jonathan kellerman therapy alex delaware to the memory of warren zevon special thanks to dr leah ellenberg chapter a few years ago a psychopath burned down my house the night it happened i was out to dinner with the woman whod designed the house and lived in it with me we were driving up beverly glen when the sirens cut through the darkness ululating like coyote death wails the noise died quickly indicating a nearby disaster but there was no reason to assume the worst unless youre the worst kind of fatalist you think something lousy happened to some poor devil that night i learned different since then the klaxon of an ambulance or a fire truck in my neighborhood sets off something inside me a crimp of shoulder a catch of breath an arrhythmic flutter of the plumcolored thing in my chest pavlov was right im trained as a clinical psychologist could do something about it but have chosen not to sometimes anxiety makes me feel alive when the sirens shrieked milo and i were having dinner at an italian place at the top of the glen it was tenthirty on a cool june night the restaurant closes at eleven but we were the last patrons and the waiter was looking tired the woman i was now seeing was teaching a night course in abnormal psychology at the u and milos partner rick silverman was busy at the cedarssinai er trying to salvage the five most seriously injured victims of a tencar pileup on the santa monica freeway milo had just closed the file on a robberyturnedtomultiplehomicide at a liquor store on pico boulevard the solve had taken more persistence than brainwork he was in a position to pick his cases and no new ones had crossed his desk id finally finished testifying at the seemingly endless childcustody hearings waged by a famous director and his famous actress wife id begun the consult with some optimism the director had once been an actor and both he and his ex knew how to perform now three years later two kids whod started out in pretty good shape were basket cases living in france milo and i chewed our way through focaccia and baby artichoke salad orrechiati stuffed with spinach veal pounded to paper neither of us felt like talking a bottle of decent white wine smoothed the silence both of us were strangely content life wasnt fair but wed done our jobs well when sirens came i kept my eyes on my plate milo stopped eating the napkin hed tucked in his shirt collar was spotted with spinach and olive oil dont worry he said not a fire whos worrying he pushed hair off his forehead picked up his fork and knife speared chewed swallowed i said how can you tell that its not a bigred trust me alex its a blackandwhite i know the frequency a second cruiser wailed by then a third he pulled his tiny blue cell phone out of his pocket and punched a button a preset number rang i raised my eyebrows just curious he said his connection went through and he told the phone this is lieutenant sturgis what call just went out in the vicinity of upper beverly glen yeah near mulholland he waited green eyes dimmed to near brown in the miserly light of the restaurant under the spotted napkin was a baby blue polo shirt that really didnt work well with his pallid complexion his acne pits were flagrant his jowls gravid as freshly filled wineskins long white sideburns frizzed his big face a pair of skunkish stripes that seemed to sprout artificially from his black hair hes a gay policeman and my best friend that so he said any detective assigned yet okay listen i happen to be right near there can make it over in ten no make that fifteen make it twenty minutes yeah yeah sure he snapped the little phone shut double homicide two bodies in a car being this close i figured i should have a look the crime scenes still being secured and the techs havent gotten there so we can still have dessert how are you with cannoli we split the check and he offered to drive me home but neither of us took that seriously in that case he said well take the seville i drove quickly the crime scene was on the west side of the intersection between the glen and mulholland up a skinny decomposed granite road marked private that climbed through sycamorecrowned hillside a police cruiser was stationed at the mouth of the road staked to a tree several feet up was a for sale sign bearing the logo of a westside realtor milo flashed the badge to the uniform in the car and we drove through at the top of the road was a house behind high nightblackened hedges two more blackandwhites kept us ten yards back we parked and continued on foot the sky was purplish the air still bitter with the smolder of two earlysummer brush fires one up near camarillo the other past tujunga both had just been vanquished one had been set by a fireman behind the hedges was stout wooden fencing double gates had been left open the bodies slumped in a red mustang convertible parked on a semicircular flagstone driveway the house behind the drive was a vacant mansion a big neospanish thing that was probably cheerful peach in the daylight at this hour it was putty gray the driveway bordered a half acre of front yard shaded by more sycamores giant ones the house looked newish and was ruined by too many weirdshaped windows but someone had been smart enough to spare the trees the top was down on the little red car i stood back and watched as milo approached careful to stay behind the tape he did nothing but stare moments later a pair of crimescene techs walked onto the property lugging cases on a dolly they talked to him briefly then slipped under the tape he walked back to the seville looks like gunshot wounds to both heads a guy and a girl young hes in the drivers seat shes next to him his flys open and his shirts halfunbuttoned her shirts clean off tossed in the backseat along with her bra below the shirt she wore black leggings theyre rolled down to her ankles and her legs are spread lovers lane thing i said empty house he said good neighborhood probably a nice view from the backyard seize the night and all that sure if they knew about the house they could be locals he looked cleancut well dressed yeah id say local is also a decent bet i wonder why the gate was left open or maybe it wasnt and one of them has some connection to the house and a gateclicker for all we know one of their families built the place crime scene will do their thing hopefully theyll find ids in the pockets the cars plates are being run right now i said any gun in sight a murdersuicide thing not likely he rubbed his face his hand lingered at his mouth tugged down his lower lip and let it snap back up what i said two headshots plus alex someone jammed what looks to be a short spear or a crossbow bolt into the girls torso here he touched a spot under his breastbone from what i could see the damn thing went clear through her and is lodged in the seat the impact jolted her body shes lying funny a spear she was skewered alex a bullet to the brain wasnt enough overkill i said a message were they actually making love or were they positioned sexually he flashed a frightening smile now were veering into your territory chapter the techs and the coroner gloved up and did their thing under heartless floodlights milo talked to the uniforms whod arrived first on the scene and i stood around he loped over to one of the big sycamores said something to no apparent listener and a nervouslooking hispanic man in baggy clothes stepped from behind the trunk the man talked with his hands and looked agitated milo did a lot of listening he took out his notepad and scrawled without breaking eye contact when he was finished the man was allowed to leave the scene the spear in the girls chest appeared to be a homemade weapon fashioned from a slat of wroughtiron fencing the coroner who manipulated it free said so out loud as she carried it beyond the yellow tape perimeter and laid it on an evidence sheet the uniforms checked the property for similar fencing found iron around a pool but a different diameter dmv came through with the cars registration the mustang was one year old and registered to jerome allan quick of south camden drive in beverly hills a wallet in the pocket of the male victims khakis yielded a drivers license that confirmed him as gavin ryan quick two months past his twentieth birthday a student id card put him as a sophomore at the u but the card was two years old in another pocket the techs retrieved a joint wrapped in a baggie and a foilwrapped condom another condom out of the foil but unrolled was discovered on the floor of the mustang neither the girls black leggings or her gold silk shirt contained pockets no purse or handbag was found in the car or anywhere else blond thin pale pretty she remained unidentified even after the spear was removed she lay contorted chest thrust at the night sky neck twisted eyes wideopen a spidery position no living creature would have entertained the coroner wouldnt commit but guessed from the arterial blood spatter that shed been alive while being impaled milo and i drove to beverly hills once again he offered to drop me off once again i laughed allison would be home by now but we werent living together so there was no reason to let her know where i was back when robin and i did live together i checked in most of the time sometimes i was derelict the least of my sins i said who was the guy you interviewed night watchman employed by the real estate company his job is to drive around at the end of the day check out the highpriced listings make sure everythings secure the brokerage gives the key out to their agents and agents from other outfits can come by and borrow copies supposedly a foolproof system but doors dont get locked windows and gates are left open thats probably what happened here the house was shown today by three brokers it was the watchmans last stop he covers everything from san gabriel to the beach hes the one who found the bodies and phoned it in but youll paraffin him anyway done no gunshot residue ill also be checking the three brokers and their clients i crossed santa monica boulevard drove east headed south on rodeo drive shops were closed but storefronts were bright a homeless man steered a shopping cart past gucci so youre taking the case i said he rode half a block before answering been a while since i had me a nice little whodunit good to stay in shape hed always claimed to hate whodunits but i said nothing the last one had closed a while back a coldhearted killer executing people with artistic talent the day after milo filed his final report he said ready for some lowiq bar shootings bad guys holding the smoking gun now he said yeah yeah im a glutton for punishment lets get this over with jerome allan quick lived on a pretty street a block and a half south of wilshire this was the middle ground of beverly hills meaning pleasant houses on fifthacre lots that ran between one and two million the quick residence was a twostory white traditional open to the street a white minivan and a gray baby benz shared the driveway lights out everything looked peaceful that would change soon milo phoned beverly hills pd to let them know hed be making a notification call then we got out and walked to the house his knock elicited only silence his doorbell ring brought footsteps and a womans voice asking who it was police lights on in the entry illuminated the peephole in the door the door opened and the woman said police whats going on she was in her midforties trim but wide in the hips wore green velour sweats glasses on a chain and nothing on her feet ashblond hair was texturized to faux carelessness at least four shades of blond that i could make out in the light over the doorway blended artfully her nails were painted silver her skin looked tired she squinted and blinked the house behind her was silent theres no good way to do what milo had to do she sagged and screamed and tore at her hair and accused him of being crazy and a goddamn liar then her eyes bugged and her hand snapped across her mouth and a retching sound forced its way through her fingers i was the first to follow her into her kitchen where she vomited into a stainlesssteel sink milo hung near the doorway looking miserable but still taking the time to examine the room as she threw up convulsively i stood behind her but didnt touch her when she was finished i got her a paper towel she said thank you that was very she started to smile then she saw me for the stranger i was and began to shake uncontrollably when we finally made it to the living room she remained on her feet and insisted we sit we perched on a blue brocade sofa the room was pretty she stared at us her eyes were bloodshot her face had gone white can i get you coffee and cake milo said dont go to any trouble mrs quick sheila she hurried back to the kitchen milo clenched and unclenched his hands my eyes ached i stared at a picasso print of an old guitarist a reproduction cherrywood grandfather clock pink silk flowers in a crystal vase family photos sheila quick a thin grayhaired man a darkhaired girl about twenty and the boy in the mustang she returned with two mismatched mugs of instant coffee a jar of powdered whitener a plate of sugar cookies her lips were bloodless im so sorry here maybe this will make you feel better milo said maam sheila my husbands in atlanta business jerrys a metals dealer he visits scrapyards and smelters and whatever she fooled with her hair have one please theyre pepperidge farms lifting a cookie from the plate she dropped it tried to pick it up crushed it to crumbs on the carpet now look what i did she threw up her hands and cried milo was gentle but he probed and he and sheila quick fell into a routine short questions from him long rambling answers from her she seemed hypnotized by the sound of her own voice i didnt want to think about what it would be like when we left gavin quick was the younger of two children a twentythreeyearold sister named kelly attended law school at boston university gavin was a very good boy no drugs no bad company his mother couldnt think of anyone whod want to hurt him its really a pretty stupid question detective its just something i have to ask maam well it doesnt apply here no one would want to hurt gavin hes been hurt enough milo waited she said he was in a terrible car crash when was this maam just under a year ago hes lucky he wasnt her voice choked she lowered her head to her hands and her back hunched and trembled it took a while for her to show her face gavin was with a bunch of friends college friends he was just finishing his second year at the u was studying economics he was interested in business not jerrys business finance real estate big things what happened what oh the crash pointless absolutely pointless but do kids listen they denied it but im sure drinking had something to do with it they the boy who was driving his insurance company they wanted to reduce their liability obviously a kid from whittier gavin knew him from school he was killed so we couldnt very well harass his parents but the time it took the insurance company to compensate us for gavins medical was you dont need to hear this she grabbed a tissue and wiped her eyes what exactly happened mrs quick what happened six of them piled into a stupid little toyota and were speeding way too fast on pacific coast highway theyd been to a concert in ventura and were heading back to la the driver the boy who died lance hernandez missed a turn and plowed right into the mountainside he and the frontseat passenger were killed instantly the two boys in the back next to gavin were only injured slightly gav was sandwiched between them he was the skinniest so he got the middle spot and there was no seat belt the highway patrol told us it was lucky for him he was squished so tight between them because that prevented him from flying as is he was thrown forward and the front of his head hit the back of the drivers seat his shoulder was wrenched and some small bones in his feet broke when they were bent back the funny thing is there was no blood no bruising just the smallest bump on his forehead he wasnt in a coma or anything but they did tell us hed suffered a severe concussion he had a memory loss that was pretty bad for a few days it really took weeks for his head to clear fully other than that when the bump went down there was nothing you could see from the outside but im his mother i knew he was different different how mrs quick quieter does it matter what does it have to do with this collecting background maam well i dont see the point of it first you come in here and tear my life to shreds then you im sorry im just taking it out on you rather than kill myself big smile first my baby gets thrown against a seat now youre telling me he was shot by some maniac where did it happen off of mulholland drive north of beverly glen all the way up there well i wouldnt know what hed be doing there she looked at us with newfound skepticism as if hoping we were wrong about everything he was parked in his car with a young woman a young sheila quicks hand wadded the tissue blond good figure pretty yes maam kayla she said oh my god gavin and kayla why didnt you tell me it was both of them now i have to tell paula and stan oh god how am i going to kayla was gavins girlfriend is was i dont know they were something sheila quick placed the tissue on the sofa cushion and sat immobile the crushed paper began expanding as if by its own volition and she stared at it mrs quick said milo gavin and kayla were off and on she said they knew each other from beverly high after the accident when gavin she shook her head i cant tell her parents im sorry will you tell them of course whats kaylas last name and where do her folks live you can use my kitchen phone im sure theyre up at least stan is hes a night person hes a musician composes commercials movie scores hes very successful they live up in the flats the last name maam bartell used to be bartelli or something italian like that kaylas a blondie but shes italian must be northern italian at least on stans side i dont know what paula is do you think i should call my husband in atlanta its really late there and im sure hes had a busy day milo asked a few more questions learned nothing got her to sip from one of the mugs of instant coffee found out the name of her family physician barry silver and woke him up the doctor lived in beverly hills and said hed be over soon milo asked to see gavins room and sheila quick took us up a maroon plushcarpeted staircase flung the door open flicked a light switch the room was generous and painted pale blue and stank of body odor and rot a queensized bed was unmade rumpled clothes were piled on the floor books and papers were strewn haphazardly dirty dishes and fastfood cartons filled in the empty spaces ive seen the police leave drug houses more composed after an evidence toss sheila quick said gavin used to be neat before the accident i tried i gave up she shrugged shame colored her face she closed the door some battles arent worth fighting do you have kids we shook our heads maybe youre the lucky ones she insisted we leave before the doctor arrived and when milo tried to argue she pressed a hand to her temple and grimaced as if he was causing her great pain let me be with my thoughts please yes maam he got the address for stan and paula bartell same street camden drive but the eight hundred block one mile north on the other side of the business district the flats sheila quick reiterated theyve got some place when you see stock footage of beverly hills in the movies its almost always the flats directors favor the sunsplotched palmlined drives like foothill and beverly but any of the broad streets wedged between santa monica and sunset will do when the connotation is primal california affluence in the flats teardowns began at million bucks and pumpedup piles of stucco can fetch more than triple that amount tourists from the east usually have the same impression of the area so clean so green such miserly lots houses that would grace multiple acreage in greenwich or scarsdale or shaker heights are shoehorned onto halfacre rectangles that doesnt stop the residents from erecting thirteenthousandsquarefoot imitations of newport mansions that elbow their neighbors the bartell house was one of those a hulking flatfaced wedding cake set behind a pitiful front yard that was mostly circular driveway white fencing topped with gold finials shielded the property a security sign promising armed response hung near the electric gate through the fence double doors with frostedglass panes were backlit teal green above them a giant porthole showcased a whitehot chandelier no vehicles in front a fourcar garage provided ample shelter for automotive pets milo inhaled and said once more with feeling and we got out cars zipped by on sunset but north camden drive was still beverly hills has a thing for trees and the ones lining camden were magnolias that wouldve loved south carolina here they were stunted by drought and smog but a few were flowering and i could smell their fragrance milo punched a button on the squawk box a man barked yes mr bartell who is this police about what could we come in please sir whats this about milo frowned your daughter sir my hold on seconds later lights flooded the front of the house now i saw that the glass doors were flanked by orange trees in pots one was failing the doors swung open and a tall man walked across the driveway he stopped fifteen feet from us shaded his eyes with his hands took three steps more into the floodlights like a performer whats this all about said a deep hoarse voice stan bartell stepped up close late fifties palm springs tan a big man with powerful shoulders a hawk nose thin lips a bulky chin waxy white hair was drawn back in a ponytail he wore blackframed eyeglasses a thin gold chain around his neck and an iridescent burgundy velvet robe that brushed the ground milo produced his badge but bartell didnt come any closer what about my daughter sir it would really be better if we came in bartell removed his glasses and studied us his eyes were closeset dark analytic youre beverly hills police la then what are you doing here im going to check you out so if this is a scam youve been warned he returned to the house closed the doors behind him we waited on the sidewalk headlights appeared at the south end of the block followed by bass thumps as a lincoln navigator drove by slowly behind the wheel was a kid who looked no older than fifteen baseball hat worn backwards hiphop music bellowing from the interior the suv continued to sunset cruising the strip five minutes passed with no word or sign from stan bartell i said how much detail will beverly hills pd give him who knows we waited another couple of minutes milo ran his hand along the white fence slats eyed the security sign i knew what he was thinking all the safety measures in the world the electric gate slid open stan bartell stepped out of his house and stood on his front steps and waved us in when we got to the door he said the only thing they know about lapd being here is something called a notification on a kid my daughter knows let me see your badge just to be safe milo showed it to him youre the one said bartell so whats with gavin quick you know him like i said my daughter knows him bartell shoved his hands in the pockets of his robe does notification mean what i think it does gavin quick was murdered said milo what does my daughter have to do with it a girl was found with gavin young blond bullshit said bartell not kayla where is kayla out ill call her on my cell phone cmon ill show you we followed him inside the entry hall was twenty feet high marblefloored a lot larger than the quicks living room the house was an orgy of beige except for amethystcolored glass flowers everywhere huge frameless abstract canvases were all painted in variations upon that same noncommittal earth tone wordlessly stan bartell led us past several other huge rooms to a studio at the rear wood floors and a beamed ceiling a couch two folding chairs a grand piano an electric organ synthesizers mixers tape decks an alto sax on a stand and a gorgeous archtop guitar that i recognized as a fiftythousanddollar daquisto in an open case on the walls were framed gold records bartell slumped onto the couch pointed an accusing finger at milo and pulled a phone out of his pocket he dialed put the phone to his ear waited no answer doesnt mean a thing he said then his bronze face crumpled and he broke into wracking sobs milo and i stood by helplessly finally bartell said what did that fucking little bastard do to her gavin i told kaylie he was weird stay away especially since the accident you know about his fucking accident right mustve had some kind of brain damage the little fu his mother her crazy bitch youve had problems with them shes nuts said bartell in what way just weird never leaves the house the problem was their son going after my angel bartells fists were huge he raised his eyes to the ceiling and rocked oh jesus this is bad this is so fucking bad his eyes sparked with panic my wife shes in aspen she doesnt ski but she goes there in the summer for shopping the air oh shit shell die shell just crumple up and fucking die bartell bent and grasped his knees and rocked some more how could this happen milo said why do you think gavin quick wouldve hurt kayla because he was the kid was weird kaylie knew him from high school she broke up with him a bunch of times but he kept coming back and she kept letting him down too easy little bastard would show up sniff around even when kaylie wasnt in bugging me like kissing up to the old man would help i work at home im trying to get some work done and the little fucker is bullshitting me about music trying to have a conversation like he knows something i do a lot of jingles have deadlines you think i want to discuss alternative punk with some stupid kid hed sit himself down never want to leave finally i told the maid to stop letting him in obsessive i said bartell hung his head was he more obsessive since the accident said milo bartell looked up so he did it unlikely mr bartell no weapon was found at the scene so my instinct is he was just a victim what are you saying what the fuck are you footsteps light footsteps made all three of us turn a pretty young girl in lowriding skintight jeans that looked oiled and a black midriff blouse exposing a flat tan abdomen stood in the doorway two bellybutton pierces one studded with turquoise over her shoulder was a black silk bag embroidered with silk flowers she wore too much makeup had a beak nose and a strong chin her hair was long straight the color of new hay the blouse revealed luminous cleavage a big gold k on a chain rested in the cleft stan bartells tan faded to blotchy beige what the he slapped his hand over his heart then reached out toward the girl with both hands baby baby the girl frowned and said what dad chapter stan bartell said where the hell have you been kayla bartell stared at her father as if hed gone mad out with who friends i called your cell kayla shrugged i switched it off the club was loud i couldnt have heard it anyway bartell started to say something then drew her near and hugged her she glanced at us as if seeking rescue daad thank god said bartell thank almighty god who are these people daddy bartell let go of his daughter and glowered at us leave milo said ms bartell no shouted bartel out now who are they daddy theyre no one milo said at some point id like to talk to kayla when pigs take the concorde when we reached the door bartell stood on his front steps and jabbed a remote control the gates began sliding and milo and i barely made it through before they clanged shut bartell slammed his door milo said your friendly neighborhood policeman making friends and spreading good cheer wherever he goes as we drove away he said interesting how bartell assumed gavin had done something to kayla you used the word obsessive bartells hostility could just be resentment at someone sniffing around his angel but obsessiveness can be a side effect of head injury what about that pigsty room kids mother claims he used to be neat that fits with brain damage catch a strong blow to the frontal lobes and there can be all sorts of changes permanent depends on the severity of the injury in most cases its temporary gavin got hurt ten months ago not a good sign i said id like to know how he was functioning in general the student id in his pocket was two years old assuming he dropped out whats he been doing since then maybe getting on the bad side of the wrong people he said getting obsessive ill have another goround with sheila bartell said she was weird you spot anything the context we saw her in anything less than breakdown would be weird yeah ill check the father out when he gets back from atlanta i love my job enough for one night drop me back at the glen and nightynight i got onto sunset and crossed the border into holmby hills milo said the big question right now is who was the girl and why impale her and not gavin that and the way she was left says a sexual thing i said eliminate the male have your way with the female think the coroner will find evidence of sexual assault if were dealing with a sexual psychopath the impalement might suffice surrogate penetration i nodded so maybe its a twisted thing he said nothing to do with the victims they were just a couple of kids happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time it could go that way i said he laughed softly and i volunteered for this one who better than you i said meaning meaning youll do a good job on it he didnt answer i slowed down for a couple of turns got on a straight stretch and glanced at him the merest excuse for a smile wormed its way across his lips what a pal he said the following morning i had an early breakfast with allison gwynn before her first patient her office is in santa monica on montana east of boutique row and we met at a pastry shop nearby it was am and the place hadnt yet filled with people of leisure allison had on a white linen suit and white sandals that set off her long black hair she never goes out without makeup and an assortment of serious jewelry today it was coral and gold pieces wed picked up on a recent trip to santa fe she was there when i arrived had finished half a cup of coffee good morning dont you look handsome i kissed her and sat down morning gorgeous wed been seeing each other for a little over six months were still in that stage where the pulse quickened and the body flushed we ordered sweet rolls and set about getting into conversational gear at first it was small things then sexual banter then work shoptalk can kill a relationship but so far id enjoyed it she went first busy week grading papers for the courses she taught a full patient load volunteering at a hospice eventually we got around to talking about the previous night allison takes an interest in what i do more than an interest shes attracted to the ugliest aspects of human behavior and sometimes i wonder if that isnt part of what cements us maybe its life experience she was sexually humiliated as a teenager widowed in her twenties carries a gun in her purse and loves to shoot at paper human targets i dont think much about it too much analysis and theres no time to live i described the crime scene she said mulholland drive when i went to beverly we used to go up there to park all the time we she grinned me and the other alleged virgins a religious experience not back then you can be sure of that she said young boys and all that too much enthusiasm not enough finesse i laughed so it was a wellknown makeout spot that you missed out on you poor midwest boy yup my dear mulholland was the makeout spot probably still is though theres probably less lovers lane stuff going on because kids are allowed to do it in their own rooms im amazed at how many of my patients go along with that you know the rationale better i should know where they are there are two families who probably feel that way right now she pushed hair behind her ear tragic the sweet rolls arrived coated with almond slivers warm she said a vacant house that creative we werent they probably spotted the for sale sign and the open gate seized the opportunity poor parents first the boys accident now this you said he changed in what way his room was a sty and his mother claimed hed once been neat she didnt say much it wasnt the time to press no of course not i said his exgirlfriends father described him as obsessive in what way showing up at the girls house unexpectedly when she wasnt home hed bug the father hang around asking questions the father also implied gavin had been overly persistent with his daughter his first reaction when he thought his daughter was dead was that gavin had done something to her that could be more like protective dad could be was there any postconcussive syndrome she said loss of consciousness blurred vision disorientation some transitory memory loss is all the mother mentioned the crash was ten months ago she said and the mothers still talking about him as changed i know i said the damage mightve been permanent but im not sure any of that matters ally makeout spots attract voyeurs and worse either gavin and the girl were interrupted midcoitus or they were positioned to look that way a sicko she studied her sweet roll but didnt touch it smiled to be technical its a little early in the day for technical i said mulholland drive she said the things we do when we think were immortal we strolled the three blocks to her office allisons hand clasped my biceps her opentoed white shoes had generous heels and that brought the top of her head to my bottom lip a bit of ocean breeze lifted her hair and soft strands brushed against my face she said milo volunteered for this one he didnt seem to need any convincing i guess it makes sense she said hes been looking pretty bored i hadnt noticed youd know better but thats how its seemed to me hell be getting plenty of stimulation on this one so will you if im needed she laughed be good for you too ive been looking bored more like restless all that caged animal energy i growled and beat my chest with my free hand and let out a lowvolume tarzan roar two women powerwalking our way scrunched up their lips and gave us wide berth as they passed you just made their day she said milo bored he griped so much about work stress personal stress the state of the world anything at hand that id never considered the concept when had allison seen him last two weeks ago latenight dinner at café moghul the indian restaurant near the west la station that he uses as a second office the proprietors believe his presence ensures them peace and security and treat him like a maharajah that night allison and i rick and the big guy had been treated to a gutstretching banquet allison and milo happened to sit next to each other and ended up talking for most of the evening its taken him a while to warm up to her to the notion that im with someone new robin and i were together for over a decade and he adores her robin had found happiness with another man i thought i was dealing with that pretty well as she and i struggled to build a new kind of friendship except for when i wasnt i was waiting for milo to stop acting like a kid caught in a custody dispute the morning after the indian dinner he called me and said you have your quirks but when you settle on one shes a keeper the day after the murder he phoned no semen on the girl no sign of sexual assault unless you count the spear the same was used to shoot both of them one bullet each right to the forehead your hostile or outofcontrol shooter tends to empty his weapon meaning this was a guy with confidence cool maybe with experience confident and careful i said also he didnt want to make a lot of noise maybe he said though given the site the nearest house is a couple of acres away he was probably okay on that account also the gun would have gone pop pop no big explosion no exit wounds the bullets bounced around the kids brains did the kind of damage youd expect from a has the girl been identified not yet her prints dont appear to be in the system though i cant say for sure because the computers been screwing up ive talked to our missing persons guys and theyre putting together some paper i did a bit of calling around to other stations but young blond girls arent a rare commodity when youre talking mp my guess is shell turn out to be another of gavins beverly hills friends though if she was youd expect someone to miss her by now and no one called or filed at bh on a missing girl sleepover i said nowadays parents are lenient and affluent parents are more likely to be out of town wouldve been nice to talk to kayla meanwhile i got the coroner to shoot some preautopsy pictures just got back from picking them up have the least scary one to show around it almost looks as if shes sleeping i want the quicks to have a look at it figure the fathers back maybe the sister too i put a call in to them but no one answered no machine grieving i said and now im going to interrupt the process care to join me in case i need help in the sensitivity department chapter in the afternoon daylight the quick residence was even prettier well kept the lawn clipped the front yard ringed by beds of impatiens daytime parking was restricted to permit holders milo had placed an lapd banner atop his dash and he handed me one for the seville in his free hand was a manila envelope i put the banner in the car now im official hoohah here we go again he bent one leg and flexed his neck opening the envelope he pulled out the death shot of the blond girl the pretty face was now a pale mask i studied the details ski slope nose dimpled chin eyebrow pierce lank yellow strands that the camera turned greenish greenish tint to the skin that was real the bullet hole was an oversized black mole puffy around the edges just off center in the unlined brow purplish bruises had settled around the eyes blood leaking from the brain bloody residue under the nose too her mouth hung slightly open her teeth were straight and dull to my eye nothing close to almost sleeping i returned the picture and we approached the quick house a woman in a black pantsuit answered younger than sheila quick she was slim and angular and brunette with firm features and an assertive posture her dark hair was short feathered in front sprayed in place her hands clamped her hips im sorry theyre resting milo showed her the badge she said that doesnt change the facts ms eileen im sheilas sister heres my badge she slid a creamcolored business card out of a jacket pocket the diamond on her finger was a threecarat pear eileen paxton senior vice president and chief financial officer digimorph industries simi valley california digimorph said milo ultratech computer enhancement we do film work on the biggest pictures milo smiled at her heres a picture ms paxton he showed her the death shot eileen paxtons gaze didnt waver but her lips worked shes the one who was found with gavin do you recognize her maam no but i wouldnt i thought gavin was found with his girlfriend that little hooknosed thing thats what sheila told me your sister assumed said milo a reasonable assumption but she was mistaken thats one of the reasons were here he kept the photo in eileen paxtons sight she said you can put that away is mr quick back from atlanta hes sleeping they both are when do you think theyll be available how would i know that this is a terrible time for the entire family yes it is maam this city said paxton this world okay then said milo well check back later we turned to leave and eileen paxton began to close the door when a male voice from inside the house said whos out there eileen paxton was halfway inside when she said something unintelligible the male voice retorted louder milo and i faced the house a man emerged his back to us talking to the doorway i dont need to be protected eileen muffled response the man closed the door swiveled and stared at us im jerry quick any news on my boys murder tall thin roundshouldered he wore a navy blue crewneck sweater over khakis and white nikes thinning gray hair was arranged in a careless combover his face was long deeply seamed lanternjawed bluish smudges stained the crinkled skin beneath wideset blue eyes his eyelids drooped as if he were having trouble staying awake we returned to the front steps milo held out his hand quick shook it briefly glanced at me said do you have anything yet afraid not if youve got time of course i do quicks lips twisted as if hed tasted something bad my executive sisterinlaw she met spielberg once and thinks her shit doesnt stink come on in my wifes totally out of it our doctor gave her valium or something but im fine he wanted to dose me up too i want to be focused milo and i sat on the same blue sofa and jerome quick took a chippendalerepro armchair i studied the family photos again wanting to imagine gavin as something other than the thing in the mustang in life hed been a tall darkhaired pleasantlooking kid with his fathers long face and wideset eyes darker eyes than his fathers graygreen in some of the earlier pictures he wore glasses his fashion sense never changed preppy clothes designer logos short hair always in either a conservative crew cut or gelled and spiked cautiously a regular kid with a tentative smile not handsome not ugly walk down any suburban street check out a mall or a multiplex theater or a college campus and youd see scores just like him his sister the law student in boston was plain and seriouslooking quick saw me looking that was gav his voice caught he cursed under his breath said lets get to work milo prepared him for the picture then showed it to him quick waved it away never seen her quicks eyes dropped to the carpet did my wife tell you about the accident yes sir that and now this quick sprang up strode to a mockchippendale coffee table studied a crystal box for a while then opened it and pulled out a cigarette and lit up with a matching lighter blue smoke rose toward the ceiling quick inhaled deeply sat down and laughed harshly i quit five years ago sheila thinks its gracious to leave these out for guests even though no one smokes anymore like the good old days in hollywood all that crap her sister tells her about hollywood crap he stared at the cigarette flicked ash on the carpet and ground it into the pile with his heel the resulting black scorch mark seemed to give him satisfaction i said did gavin talk about a new girlfriend new after kayla her said quick theres an airhead for you no he didnt say anything would he have told you what do you mean was he open about his personal life open said quick less so than before the accident he tended to get confused in the beginning i mean how could he not be confused he caught a tremendous blow right here quick touched his forehead same spot where the bullet had entered his sons skull he didnt know yet no reason for him to know yet confusion i said just temporary but he found he couldnt concentrate on his studies so he dropped out of school quick smoked and grimaced as if inhaling hurt he got hit on the prefrontal lobes he said they told us it controls personality so obviously gavin changed i said nothing huge but sure thered have to be changes but then he got better almost everything got better anyway im sure gavs accident has nothing to do with this quick puffed rapidly flicked more ash we need to find out whoever did this bastard leave any clues milo said we have no suspects and very little information we havent even been able to identify the girl well i dont know her and i doubt sheila does we know the same people is there anything you can tell us about gavin that might help gavin was a great guy said quick as if daring us to argue had his head on his shoulders hell of a golfer we both loved golf i taught him and he learned fast leaped right over me a seven handicap and he was getting better that was before the accident afterward he wasnt as coordinated but he was still good his attention would wander sometimes hed want to take the same shot over and over wanted to do it perfectly perfectionistic i said yeah but at some point youre causing a traffic jam on the green and you have to stop in terms of his interests he liked business same as me jerry quick slumped that changed too he lost interest in business got other ideas but i figured it was temporary other career ideas i said more like career fantasies all of a sudden econ was down the drain and he was going to be a writer what kind of writer he joked about working for the tabloids getting the dirt on celebrities just a joke i said quick glared he laughed and i laughed back i told you he couldnt concentrate how the hell could he write for a newspaper one time eileen was over and he asked her if she knew any celebrities he could get dirt on then he winked at me but eileen just about dirtied her pants gave some big speech about celebrities deserving their privacy the thought of offending some big shot scared the hell out of her anyway where was i quicks eyes glazed he smoked gavin becoming an investigative reporter like i said it wasnt serious how did gavin fill his time after he dropped out quick said by hanging around i was ready for him to go back to school but apparently he wasnt so i it was a hard time for him i didnt want to push i figured maybe hed reenroll in the spring any other changes i said he stopped picking up his room really let it go to seed hed never been the neatest kid but hed always been good about personal grooming now he sometimes had to be reminded to shower and brush his teeth and comb his hair i hated reminding him because he got embarrassed never argued never gave me attitude just said sorry dad like he knew something was different and felt bad about it but that was all getting better he was coming out of it getting in shape he started running again he was light on his feet used to do five six miles like it was nothing his doctor told me he was going to be fine which doctor is that all of them there was a neurologist what was his name quick smoked and removed the cigarette and tapped his cheek with his free hand some indian guy barry silver our family doctor referred us to him indian guy over at saint johns singh he wears a turban must be one of those you know barry is a friend as well as our doctor i golf with him so i trusted his referral singh did some tests and told us he really didnt see anything off in gavs brain he said gav would take time to heal but he couldnt say how much time then he sent us over to a therapist a psychologist to help gav recover from the trauma a neuropsychologist i said quick said shes a therapist thats all i know woman shrink koppel shes been on tv radio mary lou koppel you know her ive heard of her i said at first gav saw one of her partners but they didnt hit it off so he switched to her what was wrong with the first partner quick shrugged the whole process you pay for your kid to go in and talk to someone its all hushhush youre not allowed to know whats going on he dragged on his cigarette gavin told me he wasnt comfortable with the guy and that koppel was going to see him same price they both charged two hundred bucks an hour and didnt accept insurance was it helpful who knows what feedback did dr koppel give you nothing i was out of that loop the whole therapy thing i travel a lot too much been meaning to cut back he smoked the cigarette down to the butt snatched another and chainlit then snuffed out the first one between his thumb and index finger onto the carpet he mumbled something milo said sir quicks smile was abrupt and unsettling i travel all the time and its hell you know the airlines disciples of the devil frequent business flyer they could care less this time after sheila called me about gavin and i told them why i needed to go home i got treated like a king they tag you as bereaved and you get prioritized all the way upgrade to first class no one could do enough for me he barked what mightve been laughter smoked coughed smoked some more thats what it took thats what it took to get treated like a human being milo asked him about his daughter and quick said i told kelly to stay in boston shes got law school what good can it do her to come here if you release the release gavin to us and we have a funeral then she can come home when will that be hard to say sir said milo that seems to be your tune milo smiled kayla bartell havent seen her around for a while she knew gav from high school and they fooled around for a while fooled around like kids do said quick her fathers some kind of composer eileen informs me hes important youve never met him why would i gavin and kayla that was gavs business to be honest guys i dont get these questions said quick what happened cant have anything to do with gav he went up to mulholland with some girl and a pervert some sex fiend took advantage right its obvious right isnt that what youre thinking before milo could answer quicks eyes swung to the stairs eileen paxton stomped down ignored us and hurried into the kitchen a kitchen faucet opened then the hard clash of pans moments later sheila quick made her way down the stairs tentative unsteady she stopped on the bottom step studied the floor as if unwilling to commit her eyes were unfocused and she gripped the banister for support she wore a pink housecoat had aged a decade overnight she saw us said hello in a slurred voice she noticed the cigarette in her husbands hand and her lips turned down jerome quick smoked defiantly dont stand on the bottom like that come all the way down be careful youre on valium he made no effort to help her she remained in place is there anything new detective milo shook his head sorry to bother you again mrs qui no no no youre helping me us you were very gracious last night it cant have been easy for you you were gracious it wasnt easy for you or for me jerry quick said sheila go back to bed youre they were nice last night jerry its only polite that i im sure they were great but jerry i want to be polite sheila quick came down the stairs and sat down on a side chair hello she said brightly maam said milo we have learned that the girl with gavin wasnt kayla bartell sheila quick said you said she was blond jerome quick said theres a rare commodity in la i do have a picture said milo its not a pleasant picture its postmortem but if you could look at it if we could identify her it might speed things along sheila quick stared at him he showed her the death shot she looks so dead poor little thing shaking her head she snatched the photo from milo and held it closer her fingers trembled and the corners flapped are you showing pictures like this of gavin to other people sheila said quick no maam said milo we know who gavin is she examined the photo gavin never said he had a new girlfriend gavin was twenty said jerome quick he didnt need to check in about his social life sheila quick continued to stare at the picture finally she handed it back another one she said maam someone elses baby is gone chapter milo received written permission to speak to gavins doctors and we left it was nearly pm the sky was milky white and poisonous and both of us were low and hungry we drove to a deli on little santa monica had sandwiches and coffee mine was roast beef with hot mustard on pumpernickel milo opted for a wet multidecked monster layered with pastrami and coleslaw and pepperoncinis and some things i couldnt identify all stuffed into a french roll when he bit into it it collapsed that seemed to give him joy he swallowed and said model family theyre no ad for domestic life i said but the father may be right and it doesnt matter perverted stranger kills his boy that sure distances it from the family i dont see this as a family crime i said the fact that the family doesnt know the girl could mean shes the kind of girl you dont bring home to mother which may lead us to her being the primary target someone with nasty friends the killer impaled her and took her purse that couldve been trophytaking but what if he didnt want her identified quickly the primary target for sex killing or both dont know i said there was no sexual assault but to me the impaling still has a sexual quality to it gavin was shot once dispatched thats consistent with the killer wanting him out of the way so he could take care of his real business if gavin was shot first no way we can pinpoint that logic says he was i said the girl was alive when the killer impaled her its unlikely gavin wouldve sat by passively while that happened or that the killer wouldve taken the risk of fighting a young healthy male he dispatched gavin with a single shot then turned his attention to the girl her size her fear and the killers overwhelming dominance subdued her maybe he promised her he wouldnt hurt her if she didnt resist any signs she fought back he shook his head i said she watched gavin get murdered sat there terrified and hoped for the best the killer used the spear on her then he shot her too to me that says bigtime anger with both kids dead he had time to inspect his handiwork fool with the scene either gavin and the girl had already begun a sexually charged tableau or he set one up either because it was a sex crime or he wanted it to be seen that way he put his sandwich down youre offering me lots of choices what are friends for i said have you come across any other impalement murders nothing yet he picked up his sandwich and a huge chunk disappeared in his maw think the condom was gavins or did the killer bring it it was in his pocket so it was probably his so you think exploring gavins psyche is a waste of time i was thinking his therapist might be helpful and you know her i know who she is from her being on tv here we go i hid my mouth behind my coffee cup he said you make a face when you talk about her shes not someone id refer to i said why not i cant get into the details give me the basics five years ago an otherwise thoughtful judge had asked me to evaluate a sevenyearold girl caught in a vicious divorce both parents were trained marriage counselors that should have been ample warning the mother was a young passive pinchfeatured preternaturally anxious woman whod grown up with violent alcoholic parents and had shifted from couples work to processing hardened drug addicts at a countyfinanced clinic in bellflower her exhusband twenty years older was pompous and psychopathic a newly minted sex therapist and guru of sorts with an ivy league phd and a brandnew job at a yoga institute in santa barbara the two of them hadnt spoken in over a year but each insisted upon joint physical custody the arrangement was to be simple three days at one home four at the next neither parent saw the problem shuttling a sevenyearold girl ninety miles between her fathers fauxadobe house at the ashram and the mothers sad furnished apartment in glendale the alleged crux of the conflict was the calendar who got four days who got three and what about holidays after two months of raging debate the topic switched to coordinating the conventional diet favored by the mother with the vegan regimen embraced by the father the real crux was mutual hatred two hundred thousand dollars in a jointly owned investment account and the alleged sexual rapaciousness of the fathers four girlfriends when i do custody evaluations i make it a point to talk to therapists and these combatants each had one the fathers was an eightyyearold indian swami who spoke heavily accented english and took medication for high blood pressure i made a trip to santa barbara spent a pleasant two hours with the corpulent bearded fellow breathing in incense and learning nothing of substance the father hadnt kept an appointment with his avatar in six months is that okay with you i asked the swami he shifted out of lotus position and did something impossible with his body winked and smiled what will be will be theres a song like that doris day he said terrific singer the mothers therapist was mary lou koppel and she refused to talk to me first she avoided me completely by ignoring my calls after my fifth attempt to get through she phoned and explained im sure you understand dr delaware confidentiality dr wetmores given consent im afraid its not hers to give whose is it the phone crackled she said im speaking conceptually not legally teresa wetmore is in an extremely vulnerable place thad is extremely abusive as im sure you know physically emotionally she said where it counts teresa and i have made progress but its going to take time i cant risk unleashing the demons my concerns are for the child you have your priorities i have mine dr koppel what im after is any insight you can give me that might help me make recommendations to the court silence on the line static dr koppel the only insight i can give you doctor she said is to avoid thad wetmore like the plague youve had troubles with him ive never met him doctor and i intend to keep it that way i wrote her a followup letter that was returned unopened the custody case festered until the wetmores ran out of money and the lawyers quit the judge followed my recommendations both parents needed extensive childrearing education before joint custody had a chance of working in any event a weekly twohundredmile roundtrip shuttle wasnt in the best interests of the child when the judge asked if id like to be the educator i said id supply a list of names then i thought about whod annoyed me recently three months later teresa and thaddeus wetmore filed separate ethical complaints against me with the state psychology board it took a while to get out from under that but finally the charges were dismissed for no cause shortly after that dr mary lou koppel seemed to be popping up all over the airwaves an expert on couples communication milo finished his sandwich sounds like a lovely person whats her shtick for the media anything she wants it to be selfproclaimed expert talk shows are always hungry for filler i said if you say youre a specialist you are my guess is koppel hired a publicist and bought herself a nice little dog and pony show that feeds her practice so young yet so cynical one out of two aint bad he grinned sopped juice from his plate with his sandwich and finished off the soggy mess is head injuries a hot media topic if youre asking whether koppels a qualified neuropsychologist i dont know which is what gavin needed at least in the beginning someone who could find out what was really going on with his brain and make specific recommendations for rehabilitation the neurologist said he couldnt find anything all the more so i said if i had to bet id say koppel wasnt into neuropsych its a small field that requires specialized training most neuropsych people dont do straight psychotherapy and vice versa his eyes half closed claire argent was into that right dr claire argent had been one of many victims of a monster wed chased a couple of years ago a quiet woman cloaked in secrets found bisected at the waist and stashed in the trunk of her car she was i said he breathed in deeply closed his eyes and massaged the lids youre saying gavin mighta been mishandled by koppel or im wrong and he got a thorough workup i was thinking it would be smart to talk to koppel even if gavin turns out not to be the primary vic maybe he mentioned the blonde to his shrink and i can cut through a lot of procedure dont hold your breath trying to get through given her high profile i dont imagine shed want to be associated with a murdered patient ive got written consent from the parents that allows her to talk i said it doesnt compel her she can be choosy about what she tells you if she tells you anything you really dont like her she was obstructive when she didnt have to be a childs welfare was at issue and she didnt care he smiled actually i was thinking i could ask you to speak with her one doc to another that would free me up to do the other stuff as in following up with missing persons maybe expanding to searches up and down the state going over the autopsy reports ballistics records checking out the girls clothes no sweat though i took this one on ill see it through he threw money on the table and we left the deli ill talk to her i said he stopped on the sidewalk beverly hills women glided around us in a cloud of perfume youre sure why not no phone tag this time facetoface itll be interesting chapter my house designed for two is set among pines and perched above a bridle path that snakes through beverly glen high white walls polished wood floors skylights in interesting places and not too much furniture make it look larger than it is realtors hype would label it airy yet proportioned for intimacy when i arrive home alone it can be a mass of echoes and negative space this evening it felt cold i walked past the mail on the dining room table and headed for my office booting the computer i looked up mary lou koppel in the american psychological association directory and ran her through a few internet search engines shed earned her phd at the same place i had the u a year older than i but shed entered grad school shortly after id finished her dissertation on breastfeeding and anxiety in new mothers had been accepted five years later and shed followed up with an internship at one of the university hospitals and a postdoc fellowship at a mental health clinic in san bernardino her license was bona fide and the state board listed no disciplinary actions against her id been right about her lacking any training or certification in neuropsychology her name pulled up hits on the computer all excerpts from interviews shed given on various tv and radio shows a closer look revealed lots of repetition it cooked down to three dozen actual references mary lou koppel had spoken with great confidence about communication barriers between men and women gender identity eating disorders weight loss strategies corporate problem solving midlife crisis adoption learning disabilities autism puberty adolescent rebellion premenstrual syndrome menopause panic disorder phobias chronic depression posttraumatic stress sexism racism ageism sizeism one topic that had held her interest was prison reform shed given eight radio interviews last year in which she decried the shift from rehabilitation to punishment in two of the talks shed been joined by a man named albin larsen listed as a psychologist and human rights worker the photos i found showed a pleasantlooking woman with short shagged caramel hair her face was round with chipmunk cheeks and terminated in a sharp little offcenter chin her neck was graceful but starting to loosen crisp dark eyes wide determined mouth gorgeous teeth but her smile seemed posed in every picture she wore red now i knew whom to look for i left for her office the next morning at elevenfortyfive figuring my best bet was to catch her during her lunch break her office was in beverly hills but not bedford drive s couch row or any of the other fashionable streets where highpriced therapists congregated dr mary lou koppel plied her trade in a twostory building on olympic boulevard and palm drive a mixeduse stretch near the glitzy citys southern border down the block were an autopainting franchise and a private school housed in what had once been a residential duplex beyond those sat a florist and a pharmacy advertising discounts for seniors traffic on olympic was nonstop and freewaydeafening koppels building had a windowless front with brick facing painted the color of wet sand no identifying marks other than black plastic address numerals too small to read from across the street the front door was locked and a sign said to enter through the rear behind the structures was a sixspace parking lot backed by an alley three slots marked reserved were occupied by small dark mercedes sedans not unlike jerry quicks i fed a meter on palm and made my way over the ground floor was a long dim redcarpeted corridor that ran along the east side of the building and had the popcorn smell of a theater lobby one occupant an outfit called charitable planning an arrow painted on the wall directed me to the stairway and when i got there fauxbronze letters specified what awaited me on the second story pacificawest psychological services upstairs was pewtercolored industrial carpeting bluegray walls better lighting unlike the first floor no long hallway progress was halted by a perpendicular wall set ten feet in a single door was marked reception inside was a large unoccupied waiting room set up with blue tweed chairs and coffee tables stacked with magazines no reception window just a door and three signs franco r gull phd mary lou koppel phd albin a larsen phd larsen was the human rights activist with whom koppel had shared some of her prison reform interviews feeding two practices for the price of one next to each sign was a call button and a tiny faceted bulb a sign instructed patients to announce themselves with a button push a clear light meant the doctor was free red signified occupied gulls and larsens lights were red koppels wasnt i announced myself a few moments later the blank door opened and mary lou koppel stood there wearing a red shortsleeved cashmere top over white linen pants and red shoes in person her dark eyes were nearly black clear and bright and inquisitive and all over me her hair was tinted lighter than in the photos shed put on a few wrinkles her bare arms were soft freckled plumper than the rest of her yellow diamond cocktail ring on her right index finger big canarycolored stone surrounded by tiny sapphires no wedding band yes she said smooth soft lowpitched voice radio voice i gave her my name handed her the card that says i sometimes consult to the police she read the small print delaware she handed it back looked into my eyes thats an unusual name have we met a few years ago but only telephonically im afraid i dont understand the wetmore divorce case i was assigned by the court to make custody recommendations you were teresa wetmores therapist she blinked smiled if i recall correctly i wasnt very cooperative was i i shrugged unfortunate she said what i couldnt tell you at the time dr delaware what i probably still shouldnt tell you was that terry wetmore tied my hands she didnt like you one bit didnt trust you forbade me to divulge anything to you it put me in a bit of a bind i can imagine she placed a hand on my shoulder the rigors of our profession her hand lingered trailed my jacket sleeve dropped so what brings you here today what else can i not cooperate with you about gavin quick what about gavin he was murdered two nights ago mur oh my god oh no come in she led me through a short corridor past a copying machine and a watercooler to one of three doors at the rear her office was paneled in slabs of pale birdseye maple carpeted in doubleplush deep blue wool and furnished with a glass desk on a black granite base a lucite desk chair oversized baby blue leather sofas and recliners arranged with a designers eye the ceilings were cork soundproofing nothing was nailed to the highly figured wood walls her diplomas and a framed psychologists license were propped in a glass étagère off to one side along with crystal paperweights and what looked to be pueblo pottery seagreen drapes concealed what i assumed were the windows their placement meant a view of the parking lot and the alley the room managed to be generous yet cozy airy yet proportioned for intimacy mary lou koppel sat behind the glass desk i took the nearest soft chair very soft i sank low was forced to look up at her she said this is horrible i just saw gavin last week i just cant believe it i nodded what happened i gave her the bare details ended with the unidentified blond girl she said that poor boy hed been through so much the accident she placed her hands on the glass desktop her wrists were tiny her fingers short but thin the nails coated by clear polish near her right hand was a limoges box filled with business cards a pair of reading glasses and a small silver cellular phone do the police have any idea what happened no thats why im here im not clear what it is that you do for them sometimes the same goes for me i said this time theyve asked me to make contact with you because were peers peers she said they think i can help solve a murder were talking to everyone well she said i was gavins therapist but i dont see how that can be relevant surely you dont think this had anything to do with gavins treatment at this point its an open book dr koppel mary lou she said well sure i can understand that logic in the abstract she fluffed her hair before we go any further perhaps i should see some sort of written release im aware that with gavin deceased theres no legal confidentiality and i certainly dont want to be seen as obstructive again but you understand dont you absolutely i gave her the release form the quicks had signed she glanced at it cant be too careful okay what would you like to know gavins parents implied there were personality changes following the accident some falling off in his personal hygiene what sounds like obsessive behavior are you familiar with the sequelae of closedhead injuries dr delaware im not a neuropsychologist i said but it sounds as if there was postconcussive syndrome and some personality changes with closedhead anything goes may i call you alex sure she showed me gorgeous teeth switched back to serious this was a prefrontallobe assault alex youre aware of the role of the prefrontals in terms of emotional reactivity for all we know when gavins head hit the back of the seat he received the equivalent of a minor lobotomy it had been ten months i said and he hadnt recovered fully yes i found that worrisome then again the human brain especially the young human brain can be wonderfully plastic i was hopeful for full recovery she shrugged plasticity i said you do neuropsych she studied me for half a second i keep up with the journals there was no need for neuropsych because the organic end was being handled by a neurologist he and i agreed there was nothing further to be gained by subjecting gavin to yet more tests what the patient needed was emotional support and my job was to provide it i pulled out my notepad dr singh very good man did he refer gavin she nodded when gavins been in treatment for about three months seven months after the accident it took a while for things to settle i pretended to read the pad he was referred to your group not to you directly pardon ive been told that gavin began with one of your partners but switched to you she crossed her legs the black marble pedestal blocked most of the movement but i could see the tip of one red shoe now that you jog my memory thats exactly what happened singh referred gavin to the group and franco dr gull was on call franco saw gavin a couple of times then i took over problems between gavin and dr gull i wouldnt term them problems she said back then immediately after the accident gavin was extremely irritable once again par for the course you know how it can be with therapists and patients sometimes you mesh sometimes you dont and francos patient load was already heavy the black eyes found mine like with you and teresa wetmore im sure most of your patients adore you and trust you but others are you with the police fulltime or do you still see patients i do shortterm private consults no therapy not usually private practice can be tough she said the hmos with their nonsense the thin referral stream when money gets tight i suppose working for the police can be helpful providing a nice steady income im not employed by the police i do shortterm consults for them too ah she smiled anyway gavin did become my patient and i felt we were making progress her legs uncrossed and she shifted forward in her chair alex i cant think of anything i could tell you that would help a police investigation what about gavins obsessiveness i said i wouldnt call it that nothing on the level of a fullblown ocd gavin could be a bit persistent thats all getting an idea in his head and not letting go she smiled youre making it sound more pathological than it was he could be a bit enthusiastic his parents said hed switched career goals from business to journalism that seemed to surprise her and i wondered how well shed known her patient people change their minds she said young people especially sometimes tragedies get people to focus on what they really want to do is that what happened to gavin noncommittal nod did he have any plans to return to college it was hard for him to stay motivated alex one of my goals was helping restore a sense of meaning to his life but it had to be gradual gavin was still wrestling with the changes so hed slowed down cognitively yes but it was subtle and i believe exacerbated by emotional stress im curious alex why are you so interested in his personality im interested in his obsessiveness because the police are wondering if it couldve gotten him into trouble how so angering the wrong person the wrong person anyone whod react violently she touched a finger to her lip id be surprised at that gavin consorting with violent people he was a nice boy a conventional boy he certainly never mentioned anything like that to me was he pretty communicative the black eyes rose to the ceiling how shall i put this like many young men gavin wasnt much for introspection what did he talk about i was working on getting him to open up about his feelings anger at feeling different guilt about surviving the accident two of his friends were killed you know i nodded she said my sense was that gavin knew hed lost something an edge a sharpness but he had trouble expressing himself about it i suppose that couldve been aphasic or just a postadolescent males lack of verbal skills either way i knew he was wrestling with his feelings i couldnt push him too hard alex one time though he did express himself in a way that i thought was extremely eloquent this was just a few weeks ago he came to session looking downcast i waited him out and finally he punched the arm of the sofa that sofa and shouted this is fucked dr k to everyone else i look okay everyone keeps telling me im okay but i know im not okay then he stopped his chest was heaving and he was flushed and the next time he spoke it was so soft i could barely hear him what he said was its like one of those android movies im not me anymore im still the box i came in but someones fucking with the wiring then he said i really miss being me and finally he cried i thought it was a breakthrough but the following week he canceled his appointment and the one after that ive only seen him once since then and during that session it was as if nothing had happened all he wanted to talk about was cars and sports it was as if we were starting from square one but thats how it goes with young men i said did he talk about his social life social as in dating yes thered been a girlfriend some girl he knew in high school but that was over because of the accident that would be my assumption once again i needed to step around personal topics gavin was guarded about his outside life very did he mention any other girls she shook her head would you mind looking at a picture of the girl who was killed with him it is a morgue shot she shuddered i dont see the point no problem no you might as well show it to me she said i need to integrate all this misfortune i placed the death shot on the glass tabletop she didnt attempt to touch it just stared at it her mouth lost determination a vein pulsed at her temple rapid pulse you know her i said ive never seen her in my life im just imagining the way it was for the two of them chapter mary lou koppel walked me out of her waiting room and watched me descend the stairs when i paused to look back she smiled and waved her fingers back home i checked my messages three nuisance calls and allison letting me know shed had a cancellation it had been a long time since wed seen a movie did i have time tonight i phoned her exchange said how about dinner first i could be there by seven next i booted up the computer logged on to my faculty medline account and reviewed articles on closedhead prefrontal injuries with serious brain trauma bleeding and lesions showed up on xrays or cat scans but in less dramatic instances the damage was subtle and invisible the result of something called axonal shearing a microscopic shredding of nerve fibers those cases resisted neurological tests and could be best diagnosed by neuropsychological evaluation instruments like the wisconsin card sort or the reyosterreith complex figure test pulling up problems in attention and thought and information processing patients with prefrontal injuries sometimes had tempercontrol problems and they could grow impulsive and obsessive i printed a few articles changed into shorts and a tshirt and sneakers and took a long hard run not wanting to think about the short sad life of gavin quick i thought about it anyway and focused on appreciating my own life after showering and getting back into street clothes i tried milo at the station by the time id reached his car phone id put the interview with mary lou koppel in context shed cooperated but really hadnt told me much maybe she didnt know much gavin had been in therapy for three months and my guess was thered been plenty of missed appointments combine that with his resistance and koppels avoidance of his cognitive problems and treatment didnt amount to much mary lou koppels approach boiled down to whats known in the trade as supportive therapy not necessarily a bad thing sometimes all a patient needs is a yeahsaying or a shoulder to cry on but sometimes being supportive is an excuse for not doing more youre saying she was phoning it in said milo maybe she did her best she sat in that office with gavin i didnt chivalrous but you still dont like her i have nothing against her i said i mustve heard wrong you get into why she stonewalled you the first time she brought it up right away said the patient hated and distrusted me and forbade her to tell me anything taking a dig at you pal the patient did file an ethical complaint against me ouch he said the charge was dismissed course it was he said what a disgruntled weirdo something like that assholes supportive therapy i said anyway thats about it on gavins emotional state not as smart as he used to be and obsessive we knew that before its still interesting i said anything new on the girls id nope not much in terms of physical evidence either gavins prints popped up on the steering wheel but nothing on any of the door handles not his not the girls someone did a careful wipedown meaning an organized mind right which would fit with the stalker scenario plenty of tire tracks on the driveway unfortunately a whole mesh of them too much overlay so the techies couldnt pick out a good impression with realtors going in and out its what youd expect none of the neighbors saw or heard anything no reports of suspicious characters or unfamiliar cars im having the sex crimes people look at their files see if any scary peeping toms are newly out on parole any more about the sequence of death the coroner agrees with your logic about gavin getting shot first but he cant make a definitive statement has no physical evidence to back it up the blood spatter says both gavin and the girl were sitting down when they got popped and the blood all over the girls chest plus almost nothing around the head wound says she was alive when that iron stick got jammed through her i drove around looking for construction sites see if i could find any missing wrought iron but nada im getting the feel of a surprise blitz that make sense it makes perfect sense i said the bad guy follows them watches probably parks out on mulholland and continues onto the property on foot he waits sees some necking gets aroused if the condom was gavins he and the girl wouldve been about to consummate at that point the bad guy steps out of the dark and boom the element of surprise there was no semen in or on her even though she was topless her leggings were still on so that sounds right anything else on the autopsy her last meal was half a big mac a few fries and ketchup the estimate is six hours before she died gavins stomach gave up pasta with basil and garlic bread mrs quick confirms thats what shed cooked for dinner she and gavin ate together five hours before the murder then he spent some time in his room and she went to hers and watched tv no dinner date i said gavin and the girl ate separately then hooked up what time did gavin leave his house sheila didnt hear him leave got defensive about that and went on about gavin being an adult she didnt want to hover given what hed been through i said yeah he said i showed blondies picture to her again cause she didnt seemed as drugged same answer total stranger maybe it was a pickup i said i thought about that and assigned a di to comb the clubs with both their pictures the coroner prepared blood and tissue samples for dna processing but unless the girls physical data got coded in some official data bank thats likely to deadend so far she doesnt seem to be listed in any of our missing persons files that could mean a runaway from another town or the running away wouldve happened years ago the coroners reluctant to estimate her age but i had a close look at her and she seems slightly older than gavin maybe twentythree to twentyfive and she doesnt look like a runaway her clothes were good and she was put together nicely makeup earrings nail polish not great teeth shes missing a few in the rear but what shows is straight tint in the hair but shes a natural blonde coroner said he could smell perfume on her thought it was armani i didnt pick that up at the scene and by the time i got to the morgue she was smelling of other things but ill buy it dr quan has a good nose too puttogether for a prostitute i said for a street girl yes too conservatively dressed for your basic hooker a higherpriced spread maybe why no dinner date i said hooking up for one purpose you see a kid like gavin knowing how to find himself a nicelooking pro like that he was dressed like a student its not like he put on a zegna suit and trolled the bh hotels with a wad of cash but growing up in bh he might know about the hotels with enough cash in his pocket hed be in a position to negotiate we found thirty bucks in his wallet what if hed already paid the girl and she had the money her purse is missing if so robbery would have been icing on the cake for the bad guy a call girl doing an outdoor trick with a braindamaged kid he said thats the thing about some closedhead injuries the problems can be subtle unless you knew what gavin was like before he wouldnt have come across braindamaged just a cleancut kid driving a cute little red convertible we know he could be impulsive and compulsive and maybe thats what led him to approach a pro hed have his needs especially since the relationship with kayla bartell was over koppel say why they broke up she assumed it was due to the accident i dont get the feeling she really knew much about gavin a pro he said a young horny guy his girl breaks up with him maybe his confidence slipped could be something else i said his talk about digging up dirt what if he actually followed up on his tabloid dreams what better place to nab a celebrity than an expensive hotel he starts out trawling for movie stars and picks up a pro youthful impulsiveness heightened by brain damage okay he said ill check out the concierges at all the beverly hoohas not that theyre going to admit letting pros through the door ill also ask bhpd if they know her as well as show her picture to our vice guys meanwhile shes just a welldressed blonde anything traceable in her clothing the blouse was dkny calvin klein thong panties and pushup bra no label in the leggings good shoes excellent shoes jimmy choo from what i hear thats a serious investment theres a jimmy choo store right in bh on little santa monica so i went over there were talking five six hundred bucks for a spike and a strap no one recognized her as a customer but when i described the shoe the saleswoman knew it right away two seasons old coulda been bought at discount at neimans barneys whatever expensive shoes i said well puttogether youd think someone like that would be missed sure but a girl living alone it could take a while for someone to realize shes missing it looks like this is gonna be a long drawnout deal thanks for your help alex if i learn anything ill let you know i picked allison up outside her office her hair was loose and she laced her fingers through mine and kissed me hard neither of us was hungry and we opted for movie first food later an old coen brothers film blood simple was playing at the aero a few blocks up on montana allison had never seen it i had but the picture merited a second look we left the theater shortly after nine and drove over to hakata on wilshire where we sat in a booth away from the rockstar posters and the good cheer of the sushi bar and ordered sake and salmon skin salad and steak teriyaki and mixed sashimi i asked allison how shed have treated gavin quick when i get head injuries theyve usually been through a complete neuropsych eval she said if they havent i send them for one if the testing pinpoints deficits i recommend some targeted special ed with that out of the way i concentrate on marshaling the patients strengths supportive therapy sometimes they need more than that the challenge is learning to deal with a whole new world but sure supports a big part of it it can be tough alex two steps backwards for every step forward lots of mood changes and you never know what the end result will be basically youve got a person who knows hes not what he used to be and feels helpless to change gavin told his therapist he missed being himself pretty eloquent i poured sake for both of us nice lighthearted date huh she smiled and touched my wrist are we still dating before i could answer she said why all these questions about the technique honey is his mental status related to his murder his mental status became an issue because milo wondered if gavin couldve bothered the wrong person but my guess is that the girl was the target and gavin was just unlucky unlucky again she said we ate a moment later whos the therapist a woman named mary lou koppel her stated goal was to open him up emotionally doesnt sound as if it went too well she put her cup down mary lou you know her she nodded how strange what is shes had a patient murdered before chapter i pushed my food aside allison said id met mary lou a few times before conferences symposia once we sat on a panel together back when i was foolish enough to sit on panels what i remember about her most vividly are her red clothes and her smile she always smiled even when it didnt seem appropriate as if shed been prepped by a media coach on the panel she had lots to say but no data to back it up clearly she hadnt prepared was relying on charisma youre not a fan she put me off alex but i wondered if i was just jealous because everyone knew how well she was doing professionally word had it she was charging fifty percent more than the rest of us and was turning away patients the murder was over a year ago i was at the western psych association convention in vegas and mary lou was scheduled to give a talk on psychology and the media that was canceled at the last minute i hadnt planned to attend but one of my friends was registered to hear her hal gottlieb that night i was having dinner with hal and some other folks and he joked that hed lost money at the blackjack tables and that he was going to sue mary lou koppel for it because mary lous canceling her talk had given him free time and hed ambled over to the casino then he told us shed canceled because one of her patients had been murdered there was a long silence finally someone made a crack about bad publicity then someone else said for mary lou there was no such thing as bad publicity shed turn it to her advantage popular gal i said we mindhealers can be as catty as anyone if only our patients knew do you recall any details about the murder for some reason i remember it as a woman victim but i could be making that up i really cant be sure alex over a year ago two aprils ago after easter that would make it fourteen months nothing about a murder came up when i ran mary lou through the search engines i said but she started giving interviews about prison reform around that time so maybe the crime sparked her interest could be on some of the interviews she was joined by one of her partners a guy named albin larsen know him she shook her head probed her salad with a chopstick two murders in one practice i guess if the practice is large enough its not that outlandish and mary lous was large thats what i heard well i said at the very least its provocative ill pass it along to milo thanks always happy to help she pushed a wave of black hair off her face and nibbled her lower lip i leaned across the table and kissed her she took hold of my face with both her hands pressed my mouth to hers released me i poured more sake this is good she said premium brand i said i was referring to being here with you oh i knuckled my brow she laughed and touched a diamond earring despite my penchant for shiny things i really dont need much were alive and our brains are working just fine thats a good start wouldnt you say the following morning i finished a custody report and wanting to get out of the house drove to the west la courthouse and dropped off the papers at the judges chambers the police station was nearby and i walked over the civilian clerk knew me and waved me up without clearance i climbed the stairs and walked past the big robberyhomicide room where milo had once worked with all the other detectives continued up the hall hed spent a decade and a half in that room never an insider because of his sexuality and his own loner tendencies early on thered been plenty of hostility mostly from uniforms and brass but none recently and never from detectives detectives are too bright and too busy for that kind of nonsense for the last few years milos high solverate had earned him silent respect a little over a year ago his life had changed chasing down a vicious twentyyearold coldcase sex murder had led him to unearth some of the police chiefs personal secrets the chief now deposed had offered a solution milo in return for not ruining both of them would get promoted to lieutenant but would be spared the pencilpushing that went with a lieutenants position exiled to his own space away from other ds hed be a special case allowed to pick his cases expected to keep a low profile if he needed assistance he was free to enlist junior ds otherwise hed be on his own shunting and coopting its the kind of thing government does all the time milo knew he was being manipulated and he hated the idea he considered quitting for a few moments veered away from selfdestruction and convinced himself isolation could be freedom banking the extra salary wasnt bad either and while the chief was in power his job security was assured now the chief was gone and a new replacement had yet to be picked ten candidates had announced their intentions including an assistant chief from community services who tossed his name in the ring after granting an interview to a san francisco paper in which he came out of a thirtyyear closet and named his longtime companion i asked milo if that would change things in the department he laughed when bergers name hit the list eyes rolled so loud you could hear it in pacoima his chance of winning is about the same as my growing a second pancreas even so the fact that he went public public as far as the publics concerned everyone in the departments known about him for years oh i said times are different than when i started he said no one looks no one tells no one leaves nasty stuff in my locker but the basics the psychodynamics arent ever going to change are they the way i see it humans are built that way its in our dna usthem someones gotta be in someones gotta be out every few years we have to beat someone up to feel good about ourselves if most of the world was like me straights would be stigmatized probably some evolutionary thing though i cant figure it out got any wisdom for me left the wisdom pills in the car he laughed again in that joyless way hes perfected savagery reigns ill never be lacking for work the door to his office was open and he was sitting at his desk reading a file the space is windowless barely large enough for him with nothing on the wall and a picture of milo and rick on the desk fishing somewhere in colorado both of them in plaid shirts they looked like a couple of outdoorsmen for most of the trip milo had suffered from altitude sickness his computer was on and his screen saver was a shark chasing a diver each time the fishs rapacious jaws nudged the swimmers fins he got kicked in the face a floating legend read no good deed goes unpunished i knocked on the doorjamb yeah he grumbled without looking up good day to you too turns out gavin quicks not the first patient of koppels whos seen an untimely end he looked up stared as if wed never met his eyes cleared the file was gavins he slapped it shut say what i did i sat in a spare chair our noses were three feet apart none of milos cheap panatellas were in sight but his clothes were ripe with stale tobacco he said two aprils ago allison cant be certain but she thinks the victim was female thats all i can tell you well guess what the department has finally limped into the cyberage he tapped his computer monitor the shark and diver dissipated giving way to several icons haphazardly placed the screen was clouded and cracked in one corner at least theoretically this little sucker tends to freeze donated by some private high school in brentwood because the kids couldnt use it anymore he began typing the machine made washingmachine noises and loaded slowly here we are mboy every felonious slaying under the departments jurisdiction for the last five years listed by victim date division and status probably no impaling because i already searched for impaling lets see what april produces he scrolled im counting six seven females five closed two open lets start with westside cases because koppels practice is on the westside more important i can walk a few yards and get hold of the folders i scanned the screen folder looks like only ones west la wouldnt that be easy it was flora elizabeth newsome thirtyone years old brown and brown fivefive a thirdgrade teacher at canfield street school found in her palms apartment on a sunday morning stabbed and shot shed been dead for at least twelve hours dr mary lou koppel had been interviewed by detective ii alphonse mckinley and detective ii lorraine ogden on april dr koppel had nothing to offer other than the fact that shed been treating flora newsome for anxiety no solve i read the autopsy report stabbed and shot with a wouldnt it be interesting if the ballistics matched and stabbing isnt that far from impaling milo sat back in his desk chair i can always count on you to spark up my woefully dreary life think of it as therapy i said detective alphonse mckinley had transferred to the metro squad at parker center detective lorraine ogden was down the hall trying to make sense of the gibberish her computer was dishing out she was thirtyfive or so a big squareshouldered woman with short dark grayflecked hair and a determined jaw she wore an orangeandcream paisley blouse brown slacks creamcolored flats wedding band and halfcarat diamond on one hand high school ring on the other milo she said barely glancing up her screen filled with rows of numbers this thing hates me i think you just broke into a swiss bank dont think so no swastikas whats up milo introduced me lorraine ogden said ive seen you around something psychologically amiss always said milo but this is about business he told her about the mulholland murders and the similarities to flora newsome same shrink she said i guess thats a connection a was used on all of them our vic was impaled and yours was stabbed impaled how iron rod through the sternum flora was cut up pretty badly knife jammed through the chest too ogden bit down on her lower teeth and her jaw got wider i never made any headway on her wouldnt it be nice i pulled the chart but if youve got time i wouldnt mind hearing about it lorraine ogden glared at the computer clicked it off her touch was hard and the machine quivered my son tells me not to do that without going through the proper steps says it puts garbage into the system but all ive been getting is garbage she got up six feet tall in flats the three of us left the detectives room and moved into the hallway how olds your son i said ten going on thirty loves math and all that techie stuff hed know what to do with that abysmal piece of crap to milo i think conference as vacant lets play déjà vu chapter conference a was a tenbytwelve lowceilinged space set up with a folding table and chairs so brightly lit it made me want to confess to something walmart sales labels on the backs of the chairs the table was cluttered with empty pizza boxes milo shoved them to the far end and sat at the head lorraine ogden and i flanked him she took the newsome file paged through paused at the autopsy photos spent a lot of time on a fivebyseven glossy photo poor flora she said this was her graduation picture cal state la she got her teaching credential there she was thirtyone when she died said milo old picture recent picture she took time off worked as a secretary between college and teaching school had just graduated a year before she was finishing her probationary year at the school the principal liked her the kids liked her she was going to be asked to stay on her fingernail flicked the edge of the photo her mother gave this to us made a big point of telling us we could keep it she kind of bonded with me and al nice lady she had faith in us never bugged us just called once in a while to thank us let us know she was sure wed solve it her nostrils flared havent heard from her in must be half a year poor mrs newsome evelyn newsome i said may i and she slid the folder across the table in life flora newsome had been attractive in a scrubbed unremarkable way broad face clear complexion dark hair worn to her shoulders and flipped bright pale eyes for her grad shot shed put on a fuzzy white sweater and thin gold chain with a crucifix an inscription on the back of the picture said to mom and dad i finally made it blue ink beautiful penmanship mom and dad i said dad died two months after flora graduated mom wasnt doing too great either serious arthritis sixty years old but she looked seventyfive after flora got killed she moved out of her house and checked herself into one of those boardandcare places if that doesnt turn you old at warp speed she frowned so what can i tell you guys about it floras boyfriend found her around am sunday morning the two of them had a date for brunch were gonna head over to bobby js in the marina she snorted funny i should remember that we checked the restaurant confirmed the reservation the boyfriend shows up knocks no one answers he keeps trying finally uses his cell phone to call flora still nothing he bangs on her window tries to look through but the drapes are blocking so he goes and gets the manager who didnt want to let him in hes seen the boyfriend around but doesnt really know him the boyfriend makes noise about calling the cops and the manager agrees to have a quick look minute later the managers puking in the bushes and the boyfriends calling shouting for an ambulance not that there was a chance coroner said shed gotten killed around midnight she motioned for the file i slid it back and she skimmed it again shot and stabbed we counted thirtyfour wounds serious overkill and yeah heres one right under the sternum coroner said the bad guy made the most of it by churning the knife lots of blood big blade singleedged like a butcher knife flora had a set of cutlery in her kitchen one of those woodblock things with slots for each knife and the largest was missing we figured the bad guy took it for a souvenir or just to hide the evidence our guy left the rail in the girl said milo charming so what youre thinking the shrink might be a link milo shrugged two people in one practice murdered some similarities in technique lorraine ogden said what they each encountered the same nutcase in the waiting room its not a bad screenplay lorraine ogden played with her wedding band i wish i could give you something more on flora but that baby was cold the day it got delivered a victim with no kinks everyone liked her no known enemies it smelled to me right away like a psycho killing the problem was a careful psycho there were prints in the living room floras the boyfriend her parents the manager hes an eightyyearold geezer with cataracts so dont go thinking in that direction and a few of floras in the bedroom in and around the closet area mostly but nothing on or near the bed same for the kitchen and the bathroom as in wiped the bathroom in particular not a smudge on the sink no hair in the tub or on the soap we had the techies check the pipes and the traps and sure enough floras blood showed up plus luminol made the place look like a slaughterhouse all sorts of wipe marks in the blood coroner said a righthanded person there was also a row of drinking glasses in the kitchen and one in particular had that squeakyclean feel like it had been put through the dishwasher techie confirmed dishwasher crystals at the bottom bad guy does his thing washes up has a drink meticulous said ogden not that there was any finesse to how he did her he shot her after she died but she was alive for at least some of the knife work lots of arterial spurt on the sheets you saw the pictures he left her lying on her back with her legs spread our theory was that she was surprised while sleeping at least i hope so imagine waking up to that being fully aware she slapped the file shut all that blood said milo and no footprints not a single one wheres oj when we need him this bastard was careful guys so much for the old transfer theory we did find a shred of neoprene black plastic stuck on a corner of floras nightstand looked like a corner that got torn off a bigger piece al and i wondered if hed brought garbage bags along or some sort of tarp lab said it was consistent with industrial sheeting the kind they use in construction so maybe were dealing with someone in the building trades we were hoping for a print on that shred at least a partial she grinned just like on tv zip said milo zip squared i was so frustrated i even filled out one of those fbi profiling forms and sent it to quantico four months later i get an official feebie letter white male organized psychopath probably between twentyfive and forty and yeah the building trades thing made sense but they couldnt be sure dont hold em to any of it our tax dollars working for us every day i said a wroughtiron fence rail might narrow down the building trades ogden said murderous ironworker sure why not or he just picked it up at a construction site and sharpened it in terms of the shrink she glanced at mepardon the therapist the only reason we found out flora was seeing one was biweekly checks drawn on her account a hundred bucks which seemed steep for someone taking home four hundred when we asked the mother about it she was surprised flora had never told her she was being treated for anything al and i called dr what was her name koppel right dr koppel we conferenced with her by phone she said shed only seen flora a few times which synched with the checkbook six payments over three months she didnt want to get into details patient confidentiality we told her dead people lose the privilege and she said she knew that but there was nothing to tell she sounded pretty shookup said shed flown in from a conference is there something hinky about her not that i know said milo like you said the bad guy could be another one of her patients no idea why newsome was in therapy i think koppel said adjustment issues something along those lines i know she denied there was anything weird about floras personality we asked her about relationships with weirdos or bad guys and she said flora had never talked about that she gave us a diagnosis adjustment problem adjustment disorder anxious type i said that sounds right what it boiled down to was that flora had been under stress the pressure of her probationary year at the school realizing she was going to be a teacher and all the responsibility that entailed she was also having some financial difficulties because of the years shed taken off from work to go back to school financial difficulties said milo but she shells out a hundred bucks every two weeks to koppel koppel said that was a discount rate shed cut her fee in half and agreed to see flora every other week instead of weekly doing flora a favor basically yes said ogden koppel said once a week was usually the minimum in order to gain the benefits of therapy but she made an exception for flora that true doctor is there a minimum no well she said that was koppels way of looking at it one of her hands rested atop the other a big woman but delicate pianists hands she made a big deal about that how shed accommodated flora i remember thinking she was talking mostly about herself not flora bit of an ego said milo she does the radio talkshow circuit does she said ogden all i listen to is the wave nice smooth jazz after a day of blood and evil you talk to her yet dr delaware has he looked at me i summarized the conversation ogden said sounds like you got lots of nothing too maybe all shes got is nothing said milo dr d wonders if maybe koppel went a little lax on our vic therapylite in any event were gonna have another go at her the coincidence is too damn cute anything else we should know about flora not that i can think of the boyfriend was never an issue brian van dyne said ogden teacher at the same school couple of years older than flora the night of the murder he went to a lakers game with two friends then out to dinner then they hit a couple of bars confirmation on all accounts the friends dropped him off at his apartment in santa monica after am i never saw him as our guy but we polygraphed him anyway and gave him a paraffin test just to be safe no gunshot residue on his hands but it was invalid because too much time had passed he passed the poly with flying colors why didnt you see him as the guy i said he seemed devastated by floras death really crushed his friends said hed been in a great mood at the game and later everyone we talked to said he and flora got along fine all that still wouldnt have swayed me but with the poly no way not him did he know anything about floras therapy nope like floras mother he hadnt been aware shed been going biweekly appointments i said easy enough to conceal and flora was definitely concealing she accounted for the appointments by telling brian van dyne she was going to the gym which was logical shed joined the sports depot on sepulveda step aerobics and whatnot al and i interviewed the people who worked there wondering if shed hooked up with some gym rat maybe a musclebound bad boy to counterbalance wholesome brian but no she kept to herself just went there to sweat keeping her therapy secret i said that doesnt really surprise me doctor when one of our colleagues here gets a recommendation to see a shrink they either ignore it or if they go they keep it tightly buttoned the stigma its still there flora was serious about brian van dyne i can understand her not wanting him or her boss at the school to know she was having problems how long was she dating him half a year not exactly open communication i said but you could be right it does make me wonder though if the reason she went into treatment was more stigmatizing than work stress some deep dark kink in her character who knows maybe dr koppel will give it up milo said if our case is related to yours you coulda nailed it lorraine some lunatic seeing koppel spotted flora and our boy gavin in the waiting room and smelled victim male and female vics said ogden what about the girl who died with yours no id yet ogden frowned not a head patient dr koppel denied knowing the girl i said for what thats worth said ogden milo said you picked up a liarvibe nothing that strong but it sounds like she was evasive with both of us and the coincidence is giving off a definite scent let me know after you talk to her anything else milo said lorraine i was figuring to reinterview some of your principals if thats okay with you the mom the boyfriend the people flora worked with talk to whoever you want the main thing is closing flora you know al mckinley good man said milo smart man she said real bulldog she took a deep breath he and i really worked this one combed sexoffender records did some crossreferencing with felons who work construction its scary how many bad guys are doing roofing or day labor but it all came to nothing i was so frustrated i found myself hoping some other db with the same signature would show up maybe this time thered be some forensics to work with nice huh wanting someone else to die the neoprene he uses her knife but comes prepared with plastic were talking a predator and those guys dont just stop right doctor i nodded milo said maybe this one didnt chapter canfield school occupied a block of airdrome avenue three blocks south of pico and east of doheny through the chainlink fence kids played against a backdrop of mural peace love harmony little kids their faces shone with possibility the neighborhood was baja beverly hills a fiveminute ride from mary lou koppels office on olympic if flora newsome had driven to therapy from her apartment in palms the trip would have stretched longer but not much twenty minutes in bad traffic the vice principal was a black woman named lavinia robson with an edd and a pleasant demeanor she checked our credentials asked the right questions got on her intercom and summoned brian van dyne coffee she said no thanks flora was a sweetie we were all saddened is there new evidence sorry no dr robson sometimes it helps to take a fresh look thats true in education as well ah heres brian flora newsomes former boyfriend was a tall narrowshouldered man in his midthirties with thinning blond hair and a wispy mustache the color of gruel his complexion implied an aversion to sunshine he wore a green shirt khakis a brown wool necktie and rubbersoled walking shoes thicklensed eyeglasses gave his eyes a stunned glaze add to that his genuine shock at our presence and he looked like a man whod landed on a foreign planet flora he said after all this time his voice was whispery anemic lavinia robsons phone rang brian pats out for the day why dont you take these gentlemen to her office the absent patricia rohatyn was the schools special ed counselor her office was cramped linoleumfloored filled with books and games the airconditioning vent rattled the room smelled of rubber eraser two childsized chairs faced a cluttered desk brian van dyne said you guys sit and went to fetch a third he came back settled opposite us in a large chair no attempt to dominate he slumped trying to sink to our level your being here today is so strange he said i just got engaged yesterday congratulations said milo for a long time after flora i didnt feel like dating finally i agreed to let my sister set me up on a blind date his smile was wistful karen my fiancée doesnt know the details of what happened to flora just that she died no need for her to know exactly said van dyne i still have trouble with it remembering i was the one who found her what brings you here do you finally have a suspect milo crossed his legs taking pains not to kick over a stack of box games were reviewing the case sir is there anything thats occurred to you since the first detectives questioned you reviewing said van dyne deflated no nothing he rubbed the bridge of his nose why has the case been reopened it never closed sir oh said van dyne sure of course his knees bumped together the small chair was cramping my back and i stretched it had to be agony for milo but he appeared fine he said one thing that came up in our review was that ms newsome was seeing a psychotherapist detective ogden told me that was a surprise to you it was a total surprise flora never told me which was strange because id been in therapy and told her van dyne fooled with his glasses i thought we had an open relationship you were in therapy too said milo van dyne smiled nothing crazy lieutenant i was married for three years got divorced six months before i met flora my wife left me for some guy and i was having a rough time to be honest i was pretty depressed i saw a psychologist and he counseled me and referred me to a psychiatrist for some shortterm antidepressants after three months i felt a lot better and stopped the pills another two months of therapy and i was ready to be on my own thats what enabled me to be open to a relationship with flora so id be the last person to look down on therapy i guess flora felt differently you think she was embarrassed van dyne nodded milo said any idea why she sought treatment not a clue and believe me ive thought about it she was well adjusted i thought she was you have doubts now i just assume she went for help because there was some kind of problem it would have had to be something flora viewed as serious she wasnt the type to talk for the sake of talking something serious serious in her mind you two meet here at the school said milo first day of school id just transferred from the valley and flora was beginning her probationary year she got assigned to assist another teacher but i was the one who ended up showing her the ropes one thing led to the other milo pulled out his pad and scribbled keeping his eyes on the page he said any idea about who mightve wanted to hurt ms newsome some nut said van dyne no rational person would do what i saw it was stomachchurning did flora ever talk about being afraid of anyone said milo someone harassing her stalking her that kind of thing easing his big body closer to van dyne using newsomes first name never but given the fact that she kept her therapy a secret i cant be sure she didnt hide something else did she ever seem scared or unduly nervous being on probation was a little stressful who likes to be judged but she was doing great would definitely have passed teaching meant a lot to her lieutenant she told me everything shed done before that had just been a job but this was her career what other jobs did she have i said office work mostly she did some filing for a law firm worked at a parole office then she managed the office of a software company that went bust evenings she studied for her credential the parole office downtown said milo she never said only that she didnt like it there too many weird characters coming in and out i thought that might be important and mentioned it to the first detectives but they didnt seem to agree because flora hadnt worked there for a while weird characters her phrase said van dyne she didnt want to discuss it he laced his hands across his chest as if guarding his heart the thing you need to understand about flora was she wasnt the most talkative person not very outgoing or passionate on the surface he licked his lips she was very traditional more like someone from my mothers generation conservative very thats why i was so surprised to find out shed been in therapy and you have no idea said milo about what was bothering her she seemed happy said van dyne she really did about getting married about everything she was a reserved person lieutenant an oldfashioned girl van dynes fingers separated but he kept his hand on his chest have you talked to her therapist dr mary lou koppel shes one of those radio personalities for all i know thats how flora found her from hearing her on the radio would flora do something like that i said listen to a show and call up for an appointment van dyne thought about that its not what id have predicted but who knows what did koppel say about treating flora havent spoken to her yet said milo maybe youll have better luck than i did van dynes hands dropped to his lap i called her a few weeks after the murder when i found out flora had been seeing her im not even sure what i wanted some memory of flora i guess maybe some sympathy it was a horrendous time but boy did i dial a wrong number she was anything but sympathetic said confidentiality prevented her from speaking to me and hung up very curt not in the least bit therapeutic driving away from the school milo frowned and lit up a panatella sensitive guy he bug you in some way not in the criminal sense but i wouldnt want to hang out with him too delicate he frowned working at a parole office where the cons made her nervous one reinterview and weve got info that wasnt in lorraines notes lorraine and mckinley werent impressed with the parole job because a year had gone by im more easily impressed we returned to the station where he accessed flora newsomes state employment records and located the parole branch where shed clerked for five months not downtown the north hollywood office a halfhour drive from the murder scene i said a con notices her follows her home stakes out her apartment breaking in wouldnt be much of a challenge for a pro ye olde failure to rehabilitate he said wonder what dr koppel thinks about that he stood stretched sat down hard i said theres another possibility the con didnt follow flora home she already knew him thats why there was no sign of a breakin why he didnt need to bring a knife maybe what brought flora to therapy was more than adjustment problems nice oldfashioned girl getting it on with a lowlife she kept her therapy from her boyfriend couldve had other secrets fooling with a con he said forbidden pleasures guilt took her to koppel he stared at me you do weave a web he walked me through the station and out to the street glanced at his timex think ill have a go at koppel solo seeing as you two have issues issues i smiled hey im walkin the walk talkin the talk later that evening he called and said did you know shrinks dont have to hold on to files koppel has no records of flora newsomes treatment straight into the shredder a month after newsome died koppel says its routine any closed case gets trashed otherwise she runs into a storage problem also she claims it helps safeguard confidentiality because no one can happen upon the chart did she remember anything about newsome even less than she remembered for ogden i treat so many patients lieutenant but this patient was murdered same difference she gave you a hard time i said not on the surface she was superfriendly nice smile easy manner sends her regards by the way says youre a real gentleman im touched she give you anything to work with she said she couldnt be sure but she thought newsome had come in for anxiety i decided to be direct and brought up the possibility of a con boyfriend no reaction if she was hiding something shes oscar quality what did she have to say about two patients murdered in fourteen months she looked a little shaken when i phrased it that way but said shed never thought of it that way her patient load was so huge it really didnt mean anything my impression is the ladys got a busy life doesnt spend too much time focused on any single thing including her patients the whole interview was on the run i caught her leaving the building and walked her to her mercedes she was scheduled to tape a show and her cell phone kept ringing one of her partners some guy named gull had just parked his mercedes in the lot and came over to say hi she blew him off and his expression said he was used to it two murders in one practice is routine i pressed her alex she got irritated pressed me back about whether the evidence pointed to any connection between gavin and flora i couldnt give her any details so i had to tell her no she said there you go given the size of my practice its a statistical quirk but im not sure she believed it her hands were on the steering wheel and her knuckles were white they got even whiter when i asked her if she was treating any known felons she said no of course not her patients were all decent people but maybe i stirred up her youknowwhat her consciousness and shell think of something ill have another go at her in a couple days and id like you to be there issues and all at this point the more issues the better i want to rattle her cage first though im gonna talk to the parole folks see what they remember about flora ive also got an address and number for floras mother and if you could find time to see her id really appreciate it ive got to make sure i dont veer completely into newsome and neglect gavin and the blonde ill try for tomorrow thankee thankee he read off evelyn newsomes number and an address on ethel street in sherman oaks shes not in boardandcare anymore moved out six months ago and is living in a real house maybe someone came up with a miracle cure for arthritis anything in particular you want me to probe for the deep dark recesses of her daughters state of mind before she got killed and any boyfriends flora had prior to van dyne after that go anywhere you see fit sounds like a plan or reasonable facsimile that show koppel was taping guess what the topic was communication silence howd you know lucky guess you scare me chapter i phoned evelyn newsome at ten the next morning a woman with a vigilant voice answered yes when i told her who i was she softened the police were very very nice is there something new id like to stop by to chat mrs newsome well be reviewing old ground but a psychologist were taking a look at floras case from all angles oh thats fine sir i can always talk about my flora ethel street just south of magnolia was a twentyminute ride over the glen past ventura boulevard and into the heart of sherman oaks this side of the mountains was ten degrees hotter than the city and dry enough to tickle my sinuses the marine layer had burned off endowing the valley with blue skies evelyn newsomes block was lined with modest wellkept onestory houses most of them nailed up posthaste for returning world war ii vets oldgrowth orange and apricot trees rose above redwood fences huge scarred elms topheavy pines and untrimmed mulberry trees shaded some of the properties others flaunted themselves naked in relentless valley light evelyn newsomes new home was a pea green stucco bungalow with a fresh mockshake roof the lawn was flat succotashcolored stubble birdsofparadise flanked the front steps a porch swing hung still in the baking dormant air a screen door covered the entrance but the wooden door had been left open offering full view of a dark low living room evelyn newsomes daughter had been murdered two years ago and her default phone voice was wary but on some level she still trusted before i could ring the bell a big whitehaired man in his seventies appeared and unlatched the screen doctor walt mckitchen evelyns out in back waiting for you he held his shoulders high had a florid face built around a purple cabbage nose and a tiny mouth despite the heat he wore a blueandgray flannel shirt buttoned to the neck over triplepleated gray wool slacks we shook hands his fingers were sausages breaded with callus when he walked me to the back of the house he limped and i noticed that one of his shoes was bottomed by a threeinch orthopedic sole we passed through a tiny neat bedroom and entered an equally small addon den paneled in knotty pine and set up with a fuzzy green couch prefab bookshelves full of paperbacks and a widescreen tv the air conditioner in the window was silent a couple of blackandwhite photos hung on the walls group portrait of a military battalion a young couple standing in front of this very house the trees saplings the lawn just dirt to the mans right was a bubbletopped thirties plymouth the woman held a sold sign evelyn newsome sat on the fuzzy couch rotund and hunched with coldset white hair and kind blue eyes on the redwood burl table in front of her was a teapot swaddled in a cozy and two cups on saucers doctor she said half rising i hope you dont prefer coffee she patted the sofa cushion to her right and i sat down she wore a white blouse with a peter pan collar over maroon stretch pants she was topheavy with thin legs more sag to the material than stretch this is fine thanks mrs newsome she poured the cups were silkscreened harrahs casino reno nevada sugar lemon or milk plain please walt mckitchen lingered near the doorway evelyn newsome said im all right hon mckitchen looked me over saluted and left were honeymooners she said smiling mr mckitchen used to visit his wife at the boardandcare where i lived she passed away and we became friends congratulations i said thank you i never thought id get out of that place arthritis not osteo which everyone gets when they reach an age mines rheumatoid its inherited ive been achy my whole life after flora was gone i had nothing but pain now ive got companionship and my doctors come up with some new medication and im doing just fine so it teaches you things can get better she flexed her fingers and brushed at her hair the tea was lukewarm and insipid but she closed her eyes with pleasure placing the cup on the table she said im hoping for some good news about my flora were just starting to reexamine the case she patted my hand i know dear i meant in the long run now how can i help you is there anything you can think of thats occurred to you since the first detectives they werent bad she said a he and she and he was black they meant well at first i had hope then i didnt at least they were honest told me theyd gotten nowhere the reason was my flora was so good no bad influences so it had to be someone she didnt know and that makes it harder at least thats what they said you disagree not about flora being good but there was something that bothered me a while before it happened flora had worked at a parole office right from the beginning she hated it and when i asked her why she said she didnt care for the people she had to deal with i said then quit she said mom its just temporary until i get my credential and the pays good good jobs are hard to find i mentioned that to the detectives and they said theyd check it out but they doubted it was important because flora hadnt worked there for nearly a year what did flora say about the people she had to deal with nothing more than that and when i asked she changed the subject didnt want me to worry i suppose flora was always protective of me ive had my ups and downs healthwise her blues eyes sharpened do you think there couldve been a connection to that place is that why youre here her hand trembled the first detectives seemed sure it wasnt important but you know it did bother me theres no evidence of a connection but its being looked into so you already know about it brian van dyne told us brian she smiled she ran her finger over the harrahs logo any problems between him and flora brian she chuckled the two of them seemed already married both of them so conservative you know flora liked him just fine and he adored her conservative in what way i said old for their age flora was always that way she grew up fast then when she found brian i said shes got her counterpart floras father was a mans man so is mr mckitchen thats my type but flora she shrugged im not being kind to brian brians a nice boy my theory is that flora went for him because he was so different from her last boyfriend now that one was masculine enough but he had other problems but youd know about that whys that the first detectives looked into him after i told them about his temper they said he was under no suspicion whatsoever thered been no mention of a former boyfriend in the file i said i havent reviewed every page mrs newsome what kind of temper problems are we talking about roy can be a nice young man but he does fly off the handle flora used to say sometimes she had to walk on eggshells when roy got in one of his moods not that he hurt flora there was never a whisper of that he never even raised his voice it was his quiet that bothered her she told me hed drop into these long cold silences where she couldnt reach him moody i said she said i dont believe roy had anything to do with what happened to flora he has a temper oh sure but he and flora parted on friendly terms and ive known his family forever she blinked truth be told royd have no reason to resent flora he was the one who ended it ended up with another woman cheap type if you ask me now theyre getting divorced and isnt that just a great big mess youre still in touch with roy his folks were our neighbors back when we lived in culver city roy and flora grew up together like brother and sister roys folks own an aquarium one of those fish stores roy doesnt likes animals isnt that funny him i havent seen for a while its his folks i occasionally talk to his mother told me about the divorce i think what she was really saying was that roy shouldve been smart and stuck with flora whats roys full name nichols roy nichols jr i told the other detectives it should all be in the records did flora like animals she shook her head she and roy saw eye to eye on that neat both of them everything had to be tidy with all that youdve thought roy would pick a cleaner job what does he do hes a carpenter frames up houses i suppose its cleaner than plumbing construction i said you bet i spent another quarter hour in the pinepaneled room learned nothing more thanked her and left i reached milo at his desk and told him about roy nichols bad temper doesnt like animals works construction he said something else lorraine and al didnt think to include evelyn newsome said they talked to him and cleared him yeah yeah let me run him through the county data bank just in case ive got a roy dean nichols with a birth date that would make him the right age and look at this two priors a dui last year and a the year before that two months after flora was killed disturbing the peace can mean anything i said given the dui it was probably alchoholrelated im pulling up his dmv as we speak here we go an address on harter street thats culver city not far from floras place in palms are you on your way back to the alleged city i can meet you at the station and well pay this joker a visit the valley parole office isnt far from evelyn newsomes house i was going to drive by maybe go in and have a look dont waste your time flora only worked there for three days before they transferred her to a temporary branch office on sepulveda and venice one of those projects funded by a federal seed grant small storefront offices they opened half a dozen all over the city shorter distance for the cons to travel heaven forfend we tax the poor souls the hope was that the bad boys would be more compliant about checking in youre talking in past tense i said you got it no better compliance and a few million bucks down the drain the offices were shut down flora stayed on until the funds ran out so she didnt hate the job badly enough to quit didnt make much of an impression either her supervisor remembers her as quiet said she mostly filed and answered the phone he doubts shed get involved with a con why he said she kept to herself and that not many cons came in enough came in to bother her i said and sepulveda and venice is really close to her apartment id like to know how many of the cons assigned to that office had sexcrime histories good luck paroles as bureaucratic as it comes state office everythings filtered through sacramento and now that the satellites have closed the records are somewhere in outer space but if it shakes out that way ill start digging meanwhile roy nicholss place is also close by and he has a record that says impulse controls a problem and isnt it you guys who make a big deal about psychopaths not liking animals cruelty to animals i said floras mother said nichols is a neatfreak there you go yet another quirk just the type to clean up a crime scene thoroughly hes worth looking into right see you in what twenty twentyfive zoom zoom zoom chapter milos unmarked idled at the curb in front of the station he was at the wheel smoking and tapping his finger i drove up next to the drivers window he handed me a staff permit and i parked in the lot across the street when i returned the unmarkeds passenger door was open we were heading south before i closed it big hurry i pulled roy nicholss file the wasnt just some drunk breaking glass though you were right about it being boozestoked nichols beat some guy up at a sports bar in inglewood did a real number on him broke some bones the report says nichols thought the guy was leering at his date a woman named lisa jenrette they traded words and one thing led to another what got nichols out of a felony assault charge was several other patrons swore the other guy had thrown the first punch and that he had come on to nicholss date one of those habitual assholes always picking fights nichols compensated part of his medical bills and pleaded down to disturbing he served no time promised to stay away from the bar and took a rage control class he sped side streets to olympic turned left headed for sepulveda a severe jealousy problem could lead to the kind of overkill they found in floras bedroom evelyn newsome said nichols was the one who ended the relationship so maybe he changed his mind got possessive alex i read the medical report on the guy he pounded shattered face bones dislocated shoulder one witness said nichols was about to stomp the guys head into pulp when they managed to pull him off we drove in silence for a while then he said rage control class you think that stuff works maybe sometimes theres a hearty endorsement for you i think it takes more than a few mandatory lectures to alter basic temperament the lightbulb has to want to change you bet more tax dollars flushed he said like those satellite parole offices probably well he said that really pisses me off roy nicholss house was a slightly larger pure white version of evelyn newsomes bungalow that bore the signs of ambitious but wrongheaded improvement overly wide black shutters that wouldve fit a twostory colonial a pair of doric columns propping up the tiny porch a spanish tile roof the tiles variegated and expensive and piled too high a threefoot sash of bouquet canyon stone veneered to the bottom of the facade this lawn was lush unblemished the bright green of a saint paddys parade fivefoot sago palms flanked the steps five hundred dollars worth of vegetation dwarf junipers ringed the front trimmed low to the ground with bonsai precision in the driveway something hulked under a spotless black cover milo lifted a corner of the cover on a shiny black ford pickup with a freshly chromed bumper raised suspension custom wheels a sticker protected by a plastic coating said how am i driving call scru you we walked to the front door a security firm sticker was centered on a black lacquer door pushing the bell elicited chimes ohohsaycanyousee hold on a woman opened tall young pretty but washed out she had a heartshaped face wore a filmy black tank top over white terrycloth shorts no bra bare feet great legs a shaving nick on one glossy shin her hair was whiteblond with no luster bunched above her head in a careless thatch pink nail polish on her fingers chipped badly darker polish on her toes in even worse shape behind her was a room full of cardboard cartons new cartons with crisp edges sealed with brown tape and marked contents followed by three blank lines she folded her arms across big soft breasts yes milo showed her the badge youre mrs nichols not anymore you here about roy yes maam she sighed and waved us in but for a few feet inside the door the entire room was filled with the packing boxes a childsized mattress stood propped against a tiedoff garbage bag moving soon as i can get the movers over here they say by tomorrow but theyve already missed one appointment the house is already sold ive got to vacate by next week what did roy do youre assuming he did something youre here right i didnt do anything and neither did lorelei my daughter shes four years old and if she wakes up from her nap im going to kick you guys out your name maam maam she said amused im lisa nichols still ill probably go back to my maiden name which is jenrette and i always thought was a lot prettier than nichols right now ive got other things to keep me busy so whats he done could be nothing we just want to talk to him then go over to his job site hes working in inglewood on manchester near the forum theyre fixing up an office building i know hes making good money but try getting a penny out of him thank god his parents are cool they want lorelei to live decently even though shes not theirs biologically i told em id stay in la and they could see her if they make it easy for me otherwise i move back to tucson where my folks are roys tight with a buck said milo roys like a stingy old man except when it comes to his projects what kinds of projects his truck his singlemalt collection fixing up the house did you have a look at this place he never stopped fooling with it if there werent so many boxes id show you all the paneling he did in the back rooms rosewood paneling expensive stuff in all three bedrooms made it dark as a funeral parlor but he claimed it would help the resale value so what happens we put the house up for sale and we get a buyer and the first thing theyre going to do is rip out the paneling that couldnt have made roy happy i said roys not happy about anything moody she turned to me sounds like you know him never met him lucky you milo asked if shed seen roy recently not for a month hes living with his parents four blocks away youd think hed drop by to see lorelei not a single visit i bring lorelei over once a week sometimes roys there but even if he is he doesnt play with her to him it matters that she isnt his her eyes misted she shifted her weight uncrossed her arms looked down at the carpet listen ive got calls to make why wont you tell me what hes done i mean if hes dangerous shouldnt i know milo said you see him as potentially dangerous what are you said lisa nichols some kind of shrink we went to one cause of the divorce the court ordered it and he did that the shrink asked questions instead of giving answers roy hasnt done anything we just want to talk to him about a former girlfriend the one who got murdered flora you know about her just what roy told me her hand flew to her mouth youre not saying no maam were reviewing the case and are talking to everyone who knew her ive got a fouryearold said lisa youve got to be straight with me youre afraid of roy i said im afraid of his temper not that he ever did anything to me but the way he gets crawling into himself milo said what did he tell you about flora newsome that she was she folded her upper lip between her teeth its going to sound what maam he said she was cold in bed not good sexually he said she probably came on to some guy then wouldnt come through and thats what happened to her that was his theory huh roy sees everything in terms of sex if it was up to him her head flipped away from us ive got to finish up packing lori will be up soon and my hands will be tied she gave us roy nicholss parents address and phone number milo called there spoke to the mother lied about being a general contractor looking for framers and got the location of nicholss current job site as we drove south on sepulveda toward inglewood he said my guess is flora wouldnt put out enough for nichols and thats why he dumped her ergo his theory or he was what do you guys call it when you put your own crap on someone else projecting i said no forced entry at floras apartment is consistent with someone she knew the overkill fits with a lot of background rage and the sexual posing suggests the source of the rage wroughtiron fence post got to be some of those lying around construction jobs more than ever i want to know where this bastard was the night gavin and the blonde were killed speaking of which i sent two ds over to the fancy hotels then they talked to bhpd and no one knows our jimmy choo girl the hotels are probably lying but the b h cops do keep a file of highpriced call girls and shes not in it its just a matter of time someones got to miss her chapter roy nicholss supervisor was a compact middleaged man named art rodriguez with a graying beard and the excitability quotient of a stone buddha a dodger blue sticker was emblazoned across his hard hat above an american flag decal he wore an oversize disneyland tshirt under a chambray shirt filthy jeans and dusty work boots held a folded racing form in one hand we stood out in the dusty sun just inside the chainlink border of the construction site the job was tacking a side addition onto an ugly brickfaced twostory office building the original structure was gutted and windowless but a sign golden age investments remained atop the door hole the new space was in the framing stage and roy nichols was one of the framers rodriguez pointed him out crouching on the second floor wielding a nail gun the air smelled of raw wood and pesticide and sulfur art rodriguez said want me to get him or you can put on hats and go up there yourselves you can do it said milo youre not surprised we want to talk to him rodriguez gave a tobaccolaced laugh this business all my roofers are cons and a whole bunch of the other trades are too nichols isnt a con con potential con whats the difference everyone gets a second chance its what makes this country great nichols impress you as a potential i dont get into their personal lives said rodriguez step one they show up step two they do the freaking job i get that from a few of them with any regularity im a happy guy nichols dependable hes actually one of the good ones like clockwork here on the dot kind of faggy actually faggy said milo faggy rodriguez repeated as in picky prissy choosy everything has to be just so he reminds me of my wife picky how he wants his lunch box kept away from dust gets ticked when guys mess with his tools or dont show up on time any change in routine ticks him off he folds his jacket for chrissake perfectionist whats your beef with him nothing yet hope it stays that way said rodriguez he shows up does the freaking job roy nichols was sixthree an easy with a hard protruding belly floursack arms and treetrunk thighs under his hard hat was a head shaved clean the stubble that blanketed his face was fair and so were his eyebrows he wore a sweatsoaked earthcolored tshirt under blue denim overalls had a rose tattoo on his right biceps his face was square and sunbaked bottomed by a double chin scored with deep seams that made him look older than his thirty years rodriguez pointed to us and nichols surged ahead of him and swaggered in our direction round one ding muttered milo nichols reached us and said police about what his voice was thin and shockingly high i bet many a phone caller had asked to speak to his mother i bet roy nichols never got used to it milo extended a hand nichols showed us a dusty palm muttered dirty and lowered it to his side he rolled his neck what do you want to talk about flora newsome now im working wed appreciate a few minutes mr nichols about what a flush rose from nicholss bull neck and made its way up his cheeks were taking a fresh look at the case and are talking to everyone who knew her i knew her all right but i dont know who killed her ive already been through all that crap with some other cops im on the job man and they pay me by the hour theyre nazis man i stay too long in the bathroom they dock me if it was a union job they couldnt do that but it isnt so give me a break ill square it with mr rodriguez right said nichols he toed dirt rolled his neck some more just a few minutes nichols cursed under his breath at least lets get out of the fucking sun we walked to a corner of the site shaded by two portable toilets the chemicals had failed and the stench was aggressive nicholss nostrils flared reeks perfect this is all bullshit you get upset pretty easily said milo you would too if your time was money and someone wasted it nichols unsnapped the leather lid of his wristwatch and peered at the dial those first cops spent days with me man what a hassle i could tell right away they thought i was a suspect because of the way they played around with me played ones nice the others an asshole a he and a she he faked being the nice one ive seen enough tv to know the game he ran a hand over his skinhead now you what youre getting overtime trying to stretch it out milo stared at him nichols said didnt they tell you i had a perfect alibi for when flora was killed watching the game in a sports bar then i shot pool and played some darts and got drunk a buddy drove me to my house just after midnight and i threw up all over the living room couch my wife tucked me in and didnt give me shit until she woke me up two hours later after stewing on it and then she reamed me so im accounted for okay a whole bunch of people verified it and your buddies know it milo glanced at me both of us thinking the same thing his wife hadnt mentioned that you have any theories about who killed flora no none at all nichols licked his lips why should i weve heard you do have a theory i dont know what youre talking about floras sex drive or lack thereof shit said nichols youve been talking to lisa what do you expect her to say were getting divorced she hates my fucking guts didnt she tell you i was home that night shit she didnt see she hates my guts what about your theory yeah yeah i told her that but i was talking out of my butt like you talk to your wife you know milo smiled they need you to talk said nichols females he opened and shut his hand several times miming chatter you come home after a hard days work and just wanna chill and they want to talk myah myah myah so you tell them what they want to hear lisa wanted to hear about floras sex drive lisa wanted to hear that she was hot the hottest hotter than anyone else i ever met in my life nichols humphed thats what that was all about milo stepped closer to nichols you stroked lisa by putting down flora any particular reason you chose flora as the bad example nichols edged back did flora have sexual problems roy if you call not being able to do it problems said nichols she couldnt have sex she couldnt come she had no feelings down there used to lie there like a a carpet she didnt like to do it wouldnt come out and say so but she had a way of letting you know what way was that youd touch her and shed get this upset look like she like you hurt her doesnt sound like a fun relationship nichols didnt answer milo said still you went out with her for what a year less than that nicholss eyes widened i know what youre getting at whats that roy that i got mad at her because she wouldnt put out but it wasnt like that we didnt fight i never did anything but be cool with her i took her out to movies dinner whatever spent money on her man and it wasnt like i was getting anything back uneven trade said milo this is making me sound bad nicholss meaty shoulders flexed he smiled big deal how i sound i have a total fourplus alibi so you can think what you want did you break up with flora because of her sexual problems roy that was part of it wouldnt it be for anyone normal but its not like we were even really going together we were neighbors grew up together our parents hung out we had barbecues together whatever everyone kind of threw us together know what i mean parental matchmaking i said he looked at me with gratitude yeah exactly floras such a nice girl flora would make a great mom and she dug me she definitely did so why not she wasnt halfbadlooking coulda been hot if she knew how to dress and how to screw but we hung out more than we went out you know even so i spent money on her lots of lobster dinners when we broke up everything was cool she wasnt upset sure she was but it wasnt any big hysterical scene know what i mean she cried a little i told her wed be friends and that was that i said did you remain friends there was no animosity did you continue to see each other no said nichols regarding me with wariness now he cupped his clean head with one big hand scratched loose a flake of sunbaked skin id see her at my folks there was no bad feelings milo said those lobster dinners any particular place nichols stared at him i can eat lobster anywhere but flora liked this place in the marina out by the harbor bobby js thats the one flora liked to look at the boats but then one time i offered to arrange a cruise around the marina and she said she got seasick that was flora all talk flora was scheduled to go to bobby js for brunch the morning after she got murdered she and her new boyfriend so milo shrugged nichols said new boyfriend what im supposed to know that dont make like i was the old boyfriend and she threw me over and i gave a shit because that is total bullshit roy said milo floras problems aside i assume you and she did sleep together tried is more like it flora could make like her legs were glued together and it was always like you were hurting her you wanna know my opinion that is how she ran into trouble nicholss chin jutted defiantly what if she led some guy on then wouldnt come through some dude not as understanding as me for all i know that boyfriend of hers snapped he seemed like a wimp but isnt it always the quiet ones you met him one time flora brought him by my folks house thanksgiving it was evening after we finished stuffing our pieholes i was mellowing out on the couch like when i eat that way dont make me move man lisa and my mom were washing up and my dad and me were both blissed out watching the tube and boing goes the doorbell in comes flora all dressed up arm in arm with this palefaced wimpass dude with this wimpass mustache and hes looking uncomfortable like what the fuck am i doing here she claims she came by to visit my folks but i know shes there to show me shes doing okay without me thats how women are nichols tapped his upper teeth on his lowers like mr teachers gonna impress me you check him out you dont think much of van dyne i got nothing against him i was happy he had her maybe he could deal with her nichols smiled or maybe he couldnt thats your job to find out now can i go back and earn some bucks where were you monday night say between and pm monday why what happened monday milo stepped closer he and nichols were eye level their noses inches apart nicholss chin continued to jut but his eyes flickered and he flinched answer the question please roy monday i was at my parents the admission made nichols flush again this time the color reached his brow im living there till i find a new place youre sure you were there monday night yeah im sure im up every day at fourthirty in the morning so i have time to work out and shower and eat a good breakfast and be on the job at sixthirty i work my ass off all day come home lift some more eat watch tv go to sleep by eightthirty thats my swinging life and im cool with it okay what im not cool with is you coming by and hassling me for no reason ive got no obligation to talk to you so now im going back to work we watched him swagger away i said and our first nominee in the mr charm contest milo said on the edge teetering you see him as our bad guy if his alibis dont check out id definitely be interested flora was killed between midnight and two he claims a buddy drove him home just after twelve and his wife woke him at two that sounds awfully cute and i didnt see any mention of it in the file i said what if he came home a bit earlier and lisa woke him up closer to one she browbeat him got everything off her chest and hit the sack left him furious and frustrated unable to go back to sleep he got out of bed left the house and drove over to someone else whod frustrated him high stress is a trigger for some sexual killers and plenty of organized types maintain outwardly stable marriages while brutalizing other women have a tiff with the wife take it out on the ex i said he seems under lots of stress now a sexually charged fellow back to living with his parents gavin and the blonde he said a couple about to get it on pushes his button because hes all pent up sexually his alibi for gavin and the blonde is even flimsier because he and his parents dont share a room he couldve easily sneaked out without their knowing even if they claim otherwise theyre his parents nichols continued toward the framework without looking back we watched him climb up to the second floor strap on his tool belt stretch and pick up his nail gun he took another stretch aiming for casual before pressing the gun to a crossbeam snap snap snap milo said lets get outta here and we returned to the car he got back on sepulveda and drove north toward la the boulevard was crammed and slow the air hot unyielding seemed to press upon the sides of the unmarked lots of stares everyone knew it was an unmarked even if wed been in a vw milos restless eyes would have given him away he said what id like to know is why lorraine and al didnt bother putting nichols in the murder book you going to ask her thats my way bub open honest sincere that should be fun hey he said ill be sensitive he flipped on the police radio listened to felony calls for a few moments muttered i love this city and squelched the volume i said even if nichols is innocent he gave us useful information floras sexual problems maybe the reason she went for therapy that would explain her not telling van dyne now that i think about it he also described her as not very passionate on the surface the timing fits she began treatment after getting dumped by nichols and before meeting van dyne nichols claims he was gentlemanly but im sure he was brutally clear about why he was ending the relationship mr tactful he said hey bitch unglue your legs or im outta here once flora got over the hurt maybe she decided she did have a problem seeking a woman therapist for a sexual issue makes sense koppel does sex therapy too there seems to be very little she doesnt do the light turned red and he rolled to a stop a jumbo jet swooped down low on its approach to lax when the noise cleared i said assuming nicholss alibis do check out do you have the stomach for another theory at this point ill take astrology as part of treatment koppel enouraged flora to be more assertive and adventurous and she began taking risks its standard operating procedure in cases like hers what kind of risks striking up conversations with strangers maybe even getting picked up and she picked up the wrong guy which could lead us right back to the parole office what if flora connected with a con someone aggressive and hypermacho someone like roy nichols but with no boynextdoor history to rein him in the murder couldve been a sexual escapade taken too far or flora changed her mind and paid for it horribly a mr goodbar thing he said that girl was a teacher too but she was single had a secret life flora was engaged to van dyne and she was dating van dyne when she got killed you saying ms prim stepped out on her fiancé with a felon if it was a felon she met him before she began with van dyne im saying she couldve kept another man on the side secret lives or perhaps flora broke off with the con after she met van dyne but he wasnt willing to accept that there was no sign of forced entry that could mean someone flora knew or an experienced burglar or both flora told her mother and van dyne she hated the job at the parole office because of the lowlifes you think she was lying people compartmentalize their lives the light turned green and we rolled along with the traffic sludge the sky was brown at the horizon bleeding to dishwater where the sun struggled through he fooled with the radio dial again listened to more police calls lowered the volume cheating on van dyne with mr bad boy he said or maybe van dyne found out something he shouldnt have and went ballistic hell for all we know van dynes not as innocent as he comes across i thought about that floras mother implied that van dyne was less than manly that couldve come from flora and his alibi turned out to be no better than roys so maybe the sexual problems werent limited to her what if ol brian cant cut the mustard that could get a quiet boy plenty frustrated he turned up the volume seemed to be lulled by the nonstop patter of the dispatcher the traffic swell pitched us forward a few more yards and he switched abruptly to am tuning in a talk show he listened to the host berate a caller for admiring the president lowered the volume yet again ogden and al mckinley didnt include nichols in the file but they spent two days questioning him sweet old brian didnt even get that but what the hell its not even my case unless it ties in to gavin and the blonde he returned to the talk show the host was berating a caller for not taking personal responsibility for her obesity he cut her off and on came a commercial for an herbal weightloss concoction he said what do you think of these shows the exuberance of free speech i said and bad manners you a fan nah i get enough nastiness on the job but according to todays paper our girl mary lous scheduled to be on in an hour really i said you going to listen i believe in continuing education chapter milo went to talk to lorraine ogden while i sat at his desk and reviewed the gavin quick murder book nothing new i turned to the flora newsome file no progress there either milo returned five minutes letter redfaced shaking his head i relinquished his chair but he perched on the desk edge stretched his legs loosened his tie my sensitivity failed i brought up nichols and she told me shed worked the hell out of the case and i had no business secondguessing her she said i should stick to my own case the more she thought about it they werent that similar after all keep her out of it then she shoved this in my face he handed me a crumpled piece of paper that i smoothed ballistics report from the crime lab stamped priority and initialed by detective l l ogden comparisons between the used to kill gavin and the blonde and the gun that had terminated floras life a tech named nishiyama had signed off on the test similar weapons probably cheap imported semiautomatics but no match with a cheapie i said you could use one toss it get another anythings possible but a match wouldve been a helluva lot nicer now ive pissed off a colleague and gotten no closer to a solve shes a dii youre a lieutenant i thought the lines of authority were clearer in title only my lack of administrative duties cuts both ways everyone knows ive got no juice he rifled though his messages looks like no luck yet on the blonde his eyes shifted to his timex koppels on the air he switched on his desk radio and tuned in the talk station another host same level of derision a rant about racial profiling this guy hated it milo said sure lets inspect grandmas shoes at the airport while mr hamas waltzes through the host said okay folks this is tom curlie at the top of the hour and weve got a hot guest coming any minute dr mary lou koppel noted psychiatrist and anyone who listens to the show knows shes been on before and knows shes smart and anyone who doesnt listen who the hell needs you hehheh today well be talking about whats that my engineer the evercharismatic gary is informing me that dr mary lou koppel is running late better do something about the punctuality doc maybe see a psychiatrist hehhehheh meanwhile lets talk about car insurance have you ever been rearended by one of those lunatics who seem to be everywhere like invaders from outer space you know what im talking about spaceouts cellphone freaks and just plain lousy drivers has one of them bendered your fender or worse then you know the value of good insurance and lowball insurance is the best value around milo said koppels a psychologist not a psychiatrist why let facts get in the way tom curlie finished his spiel and segued to a prerecorded commercial for doityourself legal forms then a woman with a sultry voice reported on the weather and freeway traffic another commercial came on tom curlie rhapsodizing about something called a divine mochalicious that could be had at any branch of cafecafe then he said the enigmatic yet pedestrian gary is informing me that dr mary lou koppel our psychiatric guest has still not arrived at the studio and that said headshrinker cannot be reached on her cell phone tsk tsk mary lou you are now officially off the privileged roster that makes up guests on the tom curlie show because tom curlie stands for punctuality and personal responsibility and all the other virtues that have made this country great even though this country in a lapse of judgment elected a president who dont talk good okay who needs her folks lets talk about psychiatrists and why theyre so doggone nuts themselves i mean is that just my imagination or are they all just a little bit off so whats that all about gang someone becoming a headshrinker because her own heads too doggone big for her own good or is it a matter of a rotten childhood hehhehheh how do you guys feel about that cmon call and let me know at tom curlie here we go those lines are lighting up and my first call is fred from downey hey fred had your head shrunk lately hey tom first of all i wanna tell you that i listen to you every day and that youre really coo excellent judgment fred but what about those psychiatrists those head docs those voodoo incantators those shrinks think theyre rowing with one paddle blinking with one eye suffering from brain freeze dancing with shadows in the hall of mirrors is that what it boils down to fred they become shrinks because they need to get shrunk well tom as a matter of fact tom i know about those people it was just about twelve years ago that i was sitting out under the stars minding my own business and they abducted me and implanted these electrodes in my milo flicked off the radio civilization and its discontents i said malcontents is more like it maybe lorraines right and i should keep focused on gavin im gonna call the kids who were in the crash with him see what that dredges up also see if i can have a go with the girlfriend kayla bartell without her old man hovering still planning to reinterview koppel that too he settled in his chair shes obviously not in her office or that idiot couldve contacted her let me make some calls first then how about we drop by in two hours or later if that cramps your style twos fine want me to try to talk to kayla if you saw her on the street id say fine he said but what with it being bh and the father so uptight wed better stick to protocol visits limited to an official police presence such as it is i drove home listening to tom curlie mary lou koppel never showed up and curlie didnt mention her again he alternated between commercials and callins from sad angry listeners then brought on his next guest a personal injury lawyer who specialized in suing fastfood chains for racial discrimination and brewing their coffee too hot curlie said i dont know about all that bill but as far as im concerned you can jail em for just plain lousy food instead of heading home i continued on to beverly hills and drove past the quick house the same white minivan occupied the driveway but the baby benz was gone the drapes were closed and the days mail had collected on the front step a gardener pruned a hedge an anorexic woman walked by with a black chow on leash the dog looked drugged a block and a half up traffic zipped by on wilshire a family had been torn apart but the world kept spinning i turned the seville around aimed it north through the business district entered the flats cruised by the bartell mansion in daylight the house was even more outsized square and white as a fresh bar of soap the fencing looked like a prison barrier the fourcar garage doors were closed but a red jeep grand cherokee idled just inside the electric gates i parked and watched from across the street as the gates opened and kayla bartell sped through she was on her cell phone and turned right without checking for cross traffic and sped toward santa monica boulevard she talked nonstop animatedly on a cell phone with no idea i was following as she rolled through the stop sign at elevado and ran the one at carmelita without signaling she hung a risky left turn on santa monica and continued east one hand still grasping the phone the other steered and sometimes she removed it to gesticulate and swerved into other lanes for the most part motorists kept their distance from her until another young woman in a porsche boxster honked and flipped her off kayla ignored her kept gabbing weaved her way to canon drive drove south and parked in the service alley behind the umberto hair salon a valet held open the drivers door and kayla sprang out wearing a lacy black midriff top black leather pants and highheeled boots on her head was a silver lamé baseball cap her blond ponytail protruded through the adjusting band no tip for the valet just a smile someone had told her that was enough she entered the salon with a bounce in her step twohundreddollar haircut said milo ah youth we were in the seville and i was driving east on olympic toward mary lou koppels office i said you reach the boys who were in the accident both of them and they back up what the quicks told us gavin was in the back sandwiched between them when the car hit the mountain they were belted and got jostled from side to side but the impact squeezed gavin forward and he hit his head on the drivers seat he shot out like a banana out of a peel one described it both said gavin was a good guy but that hed changed bigtime stopped being social withdrew from them i asked if hed slowed down mentally and they hesitated not wanting to put him down when i persisted they admitted hed dulled just wasnt the same guy anything about obsessive behavior no but they hadnt seen him for a while they were pretty shookup about his being murdered neither had any clue whod want to hurt him and they didnt know about any blonde hed dated other than kayla who one of them called a spoiled little witch the anonymous blonde i said i called the tv stations he said asked if theyd run the death shot they said no too scary but if i got an artists rendition that toned it down they might if airtime permitted i sent a copy of the photo to one of our sketchers well see maybe the papers would run the actual photo grant the poor kid her fifteen seconds of fame too scary i said are they watching the same tube i am he laughed the media talk about public service but theyre out to sell commercial time alex it was like pitching a story to some showbiz asshole whats in it for memememe okay here we are why dont you circle around to the back see if mary lous mercedes is there it wasnt but we parked anyway and went into the building the door to the pacificawest psychological services suite was unlocked this time the waiting room wasnt empty a tall woman in her forties paced and wrung her hands she wore a gray leotard set white athletic socks pink nikes had long legs a tiny upper body short black feathered hair combed forward her eyes were blue and sunken and pouched and too bright her face was glossy and raw the color of canned salmon skin flaked around her hairline and ears recent skinpeel her expression said she was used to being mistreated but was learning to resent it she ignored us and continued pacing all three call buttons were red drs gull koppel and larsen healing souls milo said i wonder when her session ends the blackhaired woman kept walking and said if youre talking about dr k take a number my appointment was supposed to start twenty minutes ago she crossed the office twice picked at her scalp stopped to investigate the magazines on a table selecting modern health she leafed through the issue kept it folded at her side as she paced some more twentythree minutes shed better have an emergency milo said shes usually pretty punctual the woman stopped and turned her face was stretched tight yet drawn fear scalded her eyes as if shed stared at an eclipse youre not patients were not said milo keeping his voice light no no no no you look like why are you here he shrugged unbuttoned his jacket were just waiting to talk to dr koppel maa well you cant the woman shouted im next i need to see her milo glanced at me begging for help absolutely i said its your time well leave come back later no she said i mean you dont have to i dont own this place im not entitled to assert myself at that level she blinked back tears i just want to have my time my own time thats not overly narcissistic is it not at all my exhusband claims im an incurable narcissist exes i said she stared at me probing for sincerity i must have passed because she smiled said its okay for you to sit down we did the waiting room remained silent for another fifteen minutes for the first five the woman read her magazine then she introduced herself as bridget returned her eyes to the pages but her heart wasnt in it a pulse throbbed in her temple conspicuous enough for me to see from across the room racing her hands clasped and unclasped and her head bobbed from the magazine to the red buttons finally she said i dont understand i said lets call her her service will pick up and maybe they can tell us if shes got an emergency yes said bridget yes thats a good plan milo whipped out his phone bridget rattled off the number and he punched it what a team he said dr koppel please mr sturgis she knows me whats that youre sure cause im right here in her waiting room and her session lights on he clicked off bridget said what what her service says she didnt check in this morning the way she usually does and they have no idea where she is she had two early patients before her radio interview missed them too bridget cried out damn her thats fucking narcissistic snatching her purse she raced to the door swung it open slammed it behind her the silence she left behind was sour i think said milo that i prefer my job to yours five minutes later he was pounding the door to the inner offices a muffled mans voice said what might have been hold on and the door opened a crack the eyes that looked out at us were pale brown and downslanted behind octagonal bifocals analytic not amused whats going on wellmodulated voice tinged by a nordic inflection what i could see of his face was smooth and ruddy the chin melting into soft flesh a chin coated by a clipped grayblond goatee centering the beard was a prim narrow mouth police said milo were looking for dr koppel police so you pound the door calm voice almost amused despite the irritation youre dr larsen im in the midst of seeing a patient and would prefer that you leave why are you looking for mary lou id rather not discuss that sir albin larsen blinked suit yourself he began to close the door milo caught it officer her session light is on said milo but shes not in the door opened wider and larsen stepped out he was fiveten in his midfifties upholstered by an extra fifteen pounds wore his whitening hair in a longish crew cut a green handcrocheted sleeveless vest sheathed a pale blue buttondown shirt his khakis were pressed and pleated his bubbletopped brown shoes polished glossy he took a long moment to look us over not in how would you know that milo recounted his conversation with the service operator ah said larsen he smiled that doesnt mean anything dr koppel could have been called in to the office because of a patient crisis and simply neglected to check with her service a crisis here in the office our profession is rife with crisis frequently frequently enough said larsen now i suggest that the best way for us to deal with this situation is for you to leave your card and ill make sure have you seen her today doctor i wouldnt have ive been booked clear through since am so is franco dr gull we all have very full schedules and try to stagger our patients in order to avoid a logjam in the waiting room larsen tugged at his shirtsleeve exposed a pinkgold vintage rolex in fact my next appointment is in ten minutes and ive left a patient waiting in my office which is grossly unfair and unprofessional so kindly leave your card and milo said why dont we check to see if dr koppels in her office albin larsen began to fold his arms over his chest but stopped himself that would be inappropriate otherwise im afraid were going to have to wait right here dr larsen larsens prim mouth got even smaller i believe that if you pause to reflect sir youll find you are being heavyhanded no doubt said milo he sat down and picked up the copy of modern health discarded by the facepeeled woman larsen turned to me as if hoping for reason i looked at the carpet very well he said ill go check he stepped back into the inner hallway and shut the door seconds later he returned expressionless shes not there i dont understand it however im sure theres an explanation now really i must return to my patient if you insist on staying here please dont create a commotion chapter now that said milo as we left the building is what i call a shrink unflappable softspoken analyzing everything i dont qualify you my friend are an aberration too flappable too damn human lets check out dr ks residence have time sure i said lets see how the real shrinks live motor vehicle records put mary lou koppels address on mcconnell drive in cheviot hills i drove west past century city and south to pico continued half a mile past rancho park and the radar gun of a stonefaced motorcycle cop milo waved at the officer but he didnt return the gesture mcconnell was a lovely street hilly and winding and unlike the horticulturally regimented arteries of beverly hills graced by an adventurous mix of street trees koppels house was a twostory brick tudor set high on a knoll above thirty stone steps the steep driveway would have been a challenge for a car with a puny engine no sign of the mercedes but the garage door was closed milo said maybe she was more scared of two murders in her practice than she let on and decided to take a little vacation with no advance notice to her patients fear can do that to you he eyed the climb okay pass the pitons and lets start the climb howre your cpr skills he trudged up first muttering at least theres a view and i followed two steps behind he was huffing and gasping by the time we got to the top with this he panted she doesnt need a damnhomegym up close the house was beautifully kept windows sparkling copper gutters spotless carved oak door freshly varnished plantings of ferns and elephant ear and papyrus and white roses softened the usedbrick front a stone pot of mixed herbs bathed the covered entrance in fragrance a multitrunk jacaranda formed the centerpiece of the tiny perfect lawn between its branches was an eastern panorama the la basin and the san gabriel mountains beyond despite the smog blanket staggering as milo rang the bell i stared out at miles of terrain and thought what i always think way too big for one city no one answered he tried again knocked said with her car gone no big surprise but lets be thorough we walked around the left side of the house to a small square of backyard dominated by a lap pool and more thick planting high ficus hedging on three sides prevented scrutiny by the neighbors the pool was graybottomed and immaculate a covered patio covered a brick barbecue with a builtin chimney outdoor furniture potted flowers a hummingbird feeder dangled from a crossbeam and off in a corner a miniature fountain a bamboo spout tipping into a tiny barrel burbled prettily the rear wall was a bank of french doors three sets were blocked by drapes one wasnt and milo went over and peered in oh my he said i went over to have a look the back room was set up with white leather sofas glass side tables an oakandgranite wet bar and a fivefootwide plasma tv with accompanying stereo gizmos the tv was tuned to a game show ecstatic contestants jumped as if on trampolines great color and definition off to the left side mary lou koppel slumped on one of the sofas facing us her back to the screen her limbs were splayed and her head was thrown back mouth gaping eyes staring at the vaulted ceiling staring sightlessly something long and silver protruded from her chest and her color belonged to nothing living all around her white leather was blotched rusty red we remained outside as milo called in the techies the coroner and two blackandwhites for sentry work in twenty minutes the scene was bustling the coroner was an asian woman who spoke little english and slipped away without conferring the coroners investigator a heavy graymustachioed man named arnold mattingly emerged and said cho says shes all yours milo milo frowned shes gone shes busier than well ever be said mattingly lots of bodies piled up at the morgue she give you any prelim looks like stabbed in the chest with a letter opener shot through the head i know you like to draw your own db chart but if you want a copy of mine ill xerox it thanks arnie which came first the stabbing or the shooting not for me to guess and cho isnt talking much today mattingly cupped his hand but kept his voice loud her husband left her shame said milo nice lady said mattingly it really is anyway you want to know my opinion there was mucho blood around the knife wound copious as they say and just a little tiny trickle around the bullet hole more plasma than red stuff her heart was pumping hard when she got stabbed if i was a betting man said mattingly smallcaliber gun from the looks of it koppel shes that psychologist right you know her arnie my wife listens to her when shes on the radio says she talks common sense i say if its that common why do people have to pay her he shook his head the wifell have a fit when i tell her its okay to tell her right go for it said milo call the networks for all i care any other ideas mattingly said what this is guess day its a crappy day im open to suggestions humble civil servant like me mattingly scratched his head my guess would be her line of work maybe she got on the wrong side of some crazy person he seemed to notice me for the first time that make sense doc perfect sense mattingly grinned thats what i love about my job i get to make sense then when i get home im an idiot he collected his gear and left i said call the networks maybe this is the hook you need it took a while for the techies to finish printing the house searching for shoe imprints blood or other body fluids in remote rooms signs of forced entry or struggle no prints on the letter opener nothing else revelatory except for the obvious fact that the opener antique bonehandled with a sterling silver shaft had come from the desk set in mary lou koppels home office when the house cleared milo began the demeaning rummage that murder victims undergo a search of the medicine cabinet in koppels private bathroom produced the usual toiletries along with birth control pills a diaphragm and condoms careful gal otc allergy medicine a salve for yeast infections tylenol advil peptobismol and physician samples of the sleeping pill ambien all that advice for everyone else and she has trouble sleeping said milo something on her mind i shrugged her bedroom was a cozy softedged study in sage green and salmon the quilted spread on the bed was tucked tight the room perfectly composed milo rifled through a closet filled with red and black in dresser drawers he found sleepwear that ranged from sensible flannel to skimpy pieces from the hustler emporium he held up a pair of crotchless panties in faux leopard skin you dont buy this for yourself wonder who her love interest is at the bottom of the underwear drawer he found a silver vibrator nestled in a velvet bag all kinds of love he muttered i hadnt liked mary lou koppel much but exposing the archaeology of her life was depressing we left the bedroom and headed back to the office so that milo could sift through her papers it didnt take long for things to get interesting like the rest of the house the study was tidy a squared stack of papers sat atop the dainty french revival desk weighed down by a red crystal paperweight shaped like a rose just off center next to a gilded leather blotter and below the sterling desk set from which the murder weapon had been lifted milo attacked the drawers first found mary lou koppels financial records and tax forms and a stack of correspondence from people whod tuned in to her media interviews and had strong opinions pro and con those he bundled together and stashed in an evidence envelope he said she declared grand a year from treating patients another from public appearances and investments not too shabby court documents in a bottom drawer summarized a divorce twentytwo years ago the husband was some guy named edward michael koppel he said running his finger along lines of print at the time the papers were filed he was a law student at the u irreconcilable differences splitting of assets the marriage lasted less than two years no kids onward he returned to the desktop removed the roseshaped paperweight took hold of the paper stack on top was gavin quicks chart chapter thin chart it didnt take milo long to finish reading it and when he did his jaw was tight and his shoulders were bunched he thrust it at me mary lou koppel had written out a detailed intake for her treatment of gavin quick but her subsequent notes were sketchy the intake said enough gavin hadnt come to her because of posttraumatic stress due to his accident hed been assigned to therapy by an orange county judge alternative sentencing after being convicted four months ago of stalking a tustin woman named beth gallegos gallegos had been an occupational therapist at st johns hospital where shed treated gavin after his injury according to koppels notes gavin had become pathologically attached to her leading gallegos to transfer his care to another therapist gavin persisted in his attempts to date her phoning her at home sometimes two dozen times a night then extending his attempts to earlymorning wakeup calls in which he wept and proclaimed his love for her he wrote beth gallegos long amorous notes and mailed them with gifts of jewelry and perfume for every day of one manic week he had two dozen roses delivered to st johns when beth gallegos quit and took a job at a rehabilitation clinic in long beach gavin managed to find her and his overtures resumed knowing about his head injury gallegos was loath to prosecute but when he showed up at her apartment in the middle of the night banged on the door and insisted she let him in she called the police gavin was arrested for disturbing the peace but the cops told gallegos if she wanted a more serious charge she needed to get a restraining order she bargained with gavins parents if he ceased shed drop the issue gavin agreed but a week later the phone calls started up again beth gallegos obtained the order and when gavin violated it by waiting in the parking lot at the long beach clinic he was busted for felony stalking because of his accident he was allowed to plead down to a misdemeanor harassment charge contingent upon seeking psychiatric help his attorney requested and was granted the opportunity to suggest a therapist with no objection from the da the court assented and gavin was referred to franco gull phd koppel noted that shed informed the court of the transfer from gull to her covering the legal bases pt has poor insight she wrote at the end of the intake fails to see what he did wrong possib rel to head injury tx will emphasize insight and respect for personal boundaries i gave the file back to milo he was cracking his knuckles and his thick black eyebrows dipped toward angercompressed eyes nice he said no one thinks to tell me the quicks wouldnt want gavins memory fouled given that and the trauma of gavins murder i wouldnt be surprised if they forgot yeah yeah yeah but the goddamn orange county da the goddamn court goddamn dr mary lou the kid gets killed and no one thinks to tell me he got weird less than half a year ago and made someone very very unhappy the murder didnt hit the news ive sent teletypes and requests for info on the blonde to every local jurisdiction including tustin pd and gavins name is all over it no doubt its sitting in some goddamn inbasket he tried to crack more knuckles produced silence if the public only knew okay the kid was a stalker its a whole new game how would that relate to koppels murder i said or flora newsome hell if i know he shouted i kept quiet sorry he said koppel probably died because of something she knew about gavin what that is i dont have a clue but its got to be that in terms of newsome its looking like lorraine was right and i made too much of the similarities between the cases not enough of the differences he bagged the file paged through the rest of the stack muttered bills subscription forms junk and replaced it on the desk i actually volunteered for this he said i thought you need the challenge said nothing for now he said newsome stays lorraines problem im sticking to my boy gavin and all the complications hes wrought the crazy little bastard chapter mary lou koppels murder hit the news in the usual way lots of heat no light a bit of filler for the papers a few paragraphs for the perky scripts read by brighteyed tv smilers who fancied themselves journalists lacking much in the way of forensic details the newsfolk made much of the victims incursion into their territory the adjectives savvy and mediasmart were bandied about with the usual relish reserved for clichés by the next day the story was dead milo went through channels and asked lapds communications office to get the blond girls face some media exposure the hook he presented was the possibility of a bigger story than two kids getting shot up on mulholland the link between those killings and koppels the pr cops questioned his grounds for that claim said no way would tv stations run a morgue shot of a genuine dead person said they were swamped with all kinds of requests for exposure from other detectives promised theyd look into it i got to his office shortly after he did sat there as he struggled out of his jacket which seemed to be strangling him the effort left his tie askew and shirt untucked he sat on the edge of his desk read a message slip punched an extension on his desk phone sean come in i said anything new on koppel oh hi coroner estimates time of death some time last night or early morning no forced entry no reports of strange vehicles in the neighborhood what about the gunshot the neighbors to the north are in europe to the south is a woman in her nineties under the care of a nurse the nurse hears fine but they both sleep in the old ladys room and theres a humidifier and an air filter blowing which blocks out anything short of a nuclear blast he laughed its like the gods are conspiring you have any fresh insights before i could answer a tall redhaired man in his late twenties knocked on the door frame he wore a fourbutton gray suit dark blue shirt dark blue tie doc martens on his feet his hair was cut short and freckles speckled his brow and cheeks he was looselimbed and built like a point guard had the rounded babyfaced look you see on some redheads hey said milo lieutenant small salute alex this is detective sean binchy sean dr alex delaware our psych consultant binchy remained in the doorway and extended his hand the room was small enough for us to shake that way seans gonna be helping me on koppel to binchy any news on her family both parents are dead lieut i found an aunt in fairfield connecticut but she hadnt seen dr koppel in years quoteunquote after mary lou moved to california she wanted nothing to do with any of us she did say the family would probably pay for the funeral send them the bill no ones coming out sean binchy shook his head theyre pretty much detached from her kind of sad in terms of the exhusband hes here in la i mean but hes not a lawyer hes into real estate he pulled out a notepad encino i left a message but so far he hasnt gotten back i thought id do more on the neighborhood canvass near dr koppels house then try again sounds good said milo anything else you need lieut no finishing the canvass is a good idea still nothing from the neighbors sorry no said binchy seems like it was a quiet night in cheviot hills okay sean thanks sayonara see you loot nice to meet you doc when binchy was gone milo said his former occupation was get this bass player in a ska band then he got bornagain and decided being a cop was the way hed serve the lord he cut his hair and let his pierces close up and scored in the top ten percent of his academy class this is the new blue generation he seems like a nice kid i said hes smart enough maybe a little on the concrete side a to b to c well see if he learns how to be creative he grinned loot too much tv so far he hasnt brought up the bornagain stuff but i cant help feel one day hes going to try to save me bottom line is i cant juggle gavin and the blonde and koppel all by myself and hes a good worker ant so any thoughts since yesterday koppel brought gavins chart home had it at the top of her stack i said she brushed off two murders in her practice as a statistical quirk but it bothered her and she went back to review her notes the fact that newsomes chart wasnt there means she was probably telling the truth about shredding it not a lot of notes on gavin to review maybe the intake was enough in it she detailed gavins legal problems what if she tied his murder to the gallegos stalking came up with a suspect voiced her suspicions to someone and got killed for her efforts she voiced her suspicion directly to the bad guy shed be stupid enough to confront him she might have if he was her patient i said if she suspected someone in her caseload shed be reluctant to violate confidentiality and go straight to you back to the nutinthewaitingroom theory its also possible that she wasnt sure just suspicious so she discussed it with him foolhardy he said therapys a lopsided relationship despite all the talk of a partnership the patients needy and dependent and the therapist has wisdom to grant its easy to overestimate your personal power mary lou was a strong personality to begin with and she got caught up in the media game convinced herself she was an expert on everything maybe she got overconfident felt she could convince him to give himself up talk about an ego trip if she succeeded psychologist solves multiple murders i said talk about public relations he thought about that for a long time one of her patients is a very bad guy no forced entry i said someone she knew and let into the house its worth looking into i cant get hold of her patient records her partners might know something theyre shrinks too alex same confidentiality restriction im not sure of the legal issues but if the bad guy isnt officially their patient they might be okay talking about him in general terms sounds like legal precedent to me he said what the hell its worth a shot he phoned information got numbers for drs larsen and gull and left messages to call him i said hows it going with the prints from koppels house there are so damn many the print guys are figuring at least a week one thing they did tell me not a single print near the body at least a tenfoot radius had been wiped clean a psych patient whos meticulous not an overt nutcase right not even close to nuts i said he flipped open the murder book that had been opened on mary lou koppel ballistics faxed a report this morning the used to shoot her was similar but not identical to either the gavin quick or the flora newsome guns even discounting flora weve got two separate weapons for two murders this is some guy with easy access to cheapies knows his way around the street an experienced con i said the kind flora newsome couldve met on the job would a guy like that go into therapy if he had to look at gavin quick his eyes widened alternative sentencing someone who had to get shrunk and that gives me a way to get around the goddamn confidentiality go through court records see if any judges assigned any other patients to koppel he slumped huge job narrow it down to a year or two and put your worker ant on it i will he said i will definitely do that its also time to talk to mr and mrs quick again find out about their boys problem if he harassed anyone else so far all i get is their answering machine i called the da who prosecuted gavin and the defense attorney no help at all from them just another case i also recontacted gavins two friends from the accident and they had no idea he stalked beth gallegos or anyone else on the intake koppel did for the court she said gavins obsession could be related to brain damage what do you think another form of obsessive behavior i said sure it could be consistent with a prefrontal injury the other thing to consider is that the vindictive boyfriend wasnt the blondes hes beth gallegoss beau what if gavin broke the terms of his probation and resumed stalking so the guy stalks gavin in return offs him and the blonde and koppel no accounting for passion i said okay he said lets visit the object of gavins passion phone work revealed that beth gallegos had switched jobs again from the long beach clinic to a private educational therapy firm in westwood westwoods close to beverly hills i said as we drove there if gavin was still stalking her i doubt shed have chanced it lets find out beth gallegos was gorgeous that did nothing to explain gavins obsession stalking is psychopathology and plain people are victimized as often as lookers it was simply a fact petite and blackhaired and duskyskinned she wore a pale blue uniform cut for blandness that couldnt conceal her tiny waist flaring hips and bountiful breasts her eyes were amber her lashes long and curling twentyseven years old she wore no makeup and looked eighteen a clean fresh eighteen her nails were unpolished and clipped short the black hair sleek and wavy was tied back in a ponytail and fastened by a rubber band aiming for lowkey her perfectoval face and cameo features and lush body rendered the effort useless she was uncomfortable talking to us in the lobby of the educational service and we took the elevator down to the groundfloor coffee shop a young waitress approached us with a smile but even though milo smiled back something in his greeting wiped the joy from her face beth gallegos ordered tea and milo and i had cokes when the order came he pressed a bill into the waitresss palm she left quickly and never reappeared gallegos had been edgy since wed shown up and milo tried to put her at ease with chitchat about her job the outfit she worked for was called comprehensive rehab and specialized in stroke victims her job was to help patients regain fine motor skills she found the challenge satisfying milo said sounds like it would be gallegos fumbled with her teacup and avoided our eyes lets talk about gavin quick said milo have you heard what happened to him yes i read it in the paper it was horrible i cried she had a slightly nasal littlegirl voice and narrow hands with smooth fingers a diamond chip ring banded the third finger of her left hand more than a boyfriend you cried said milo i did i felt terrible despite what gavin put me through because i knew what hed been through knew it was the chi making him do it milo blinked closed head injury i said beth gallegos nodded and spooned sugar into her tea but didnt drink chis are weird that way sometimes nothing shows up on scans but people change drastically im sure gavin wouldnt have done those things if he hadnt been injured youve had other braindamaged stalkers said milo gallegoss hand flew to her mouth no god forbid i should ever go through that more than once im just saying the brain controls everything and when its compromised you get problems thats why i did everything i could to avoid making it a criminal situation for gavin her eyes got wet the way i see it maam he left you no choice thats what everyone told me whos everyone my family your family local no she said my parents live in germany my fathers a captain in the army at first i didnt tell them what was going on because i knew how my dad would react hows that for sure hed have gotten himself a leave flown right over and had a stern talk with gavin once he did find out i had a hard time convincing him not to do exactly that thats part of what led me to file charges i had to assure dad i was taking care of myself but i had to do it no matter what it was just getting too intense and gavin obviously needed help you never told your family but they found out my sister told them she lives in tucson and i confided in her and made her promise not to tell she smiled of course she didnt listen to me which i understand im not mad were close she had my best interests at heart anyone else tell you to file charges what do you mean milo looked at her ring beth gallegos said he wasnt my fiancé then actually we started dating right before i filed charges milo tried to put warmth in his smile whats the lucky young mans name anson conniff whens the big day fall gallegoss dark eyes picked up some wattage lieutenant why all these questions about me and my family i need to tie up loose ends loose ends lieutenant please dont get me involved i really cant go through it again please raising her voice the coffee shop was nearly empty but the few patrons present turned to stare milo glared at them until they turned away go through what maam gallegos whimpered and wiped her eyes legal stuff the courts i never want to see an affidavit again please keep me out of it im not out to cause you grief ms gallegos but i do need to talk to anyone gavin had conflict with gallegos shook her head there was no conflict i never yelled at gavin never complained its just that the problem got out of hand he needed to deal with it did he stop i said yes completely completely her eyes danced to one side i said you never heard from him again she picked at her napkin shredded the corners created a small pile of confetti that she collected and placed on her saucer it was basically over she said it was over her voice shook milo said beth youre obviously a good person that means youre also a very poor liar gallegos glanced at the coffee shop door as if plotting her escape milo said what happened it was just once she said a month ago not really a problem call a nothing call thats why i never told anyone whered he find you here at the office i was between patients and the secretary handed me the phone he told her he was a friend she has no idea about my history with gavin when i heard his voice i it made my heart pound and i broke into a sweat but he was okay nothing weird he said he was sorry for what hed done wanted to apologize then he told me hed met someone and was getting his life together and he hoped id forgive him i said i already had and that was that you figure he was telling the truth said milo about meeting someone he sounded sincere she said i told him congratulations i was happy for him she exhaled he sounded more mature settled did he tell you about the person hed met no he sounded happy hes happy he doesnt bug you that too she said but at the time what i thought was gavins finally getting it together she touched the handle of her teacup swirled the bag i never disliked him lieutenant all i ever felt for him was pity and fear when things got really intense but i was happy things were working out for him i said ansons probably happy too i didnt tell anson about the call too upsetting hes been through enough with me she said we just started dating when the stalking began its not a great way to start a relationship milo said anson mustve been pretty upset wouldnt anyone be gallegoss eyes got clearer youre not going to talk to him are you we are beth why like i said anyone who had conflict with gavin anson didnt have conflict please dont go there dont draw anson into this hed never hurt gavin or anyone else hes not like that easygoing said milo mature disciplined anson knows how to control himself what kind of work does he do work said gallegos his job youre actually going to talk to him we have to maam beth gallegos placed her face in her hands and kept it there for several moments when she revealed herself again shed gone pale im so so sorry gavin got killed but i really cant stand any more of this when gavin had his trial i was subpoenaed it was horrible testifying was rough being there was rough the people you see in the halls the smells the waiting i waited an entire day and never was called to testify thank god it really wasnt much of a trial gavin admitted what hed done later he and his parents walked right past me and his mother looked at me as if i was the guilty one i didnt even tell anson i was going didnt want him to lose a days work her attention shifted to the left she bit her lip no thats not the real reason i didnt want the case to pollute my relationship i want anson to see me as someone strong please let us be milo said beth i have no interest in adding stress to your life and theres no reason to believe you or ansonwill be involved any further but this is a homicide investigation and i wouldnt be doing my job if i didnt talk to him okay gallegos said barely audible i understand stuff happens whats ansons address we live together at his place ogden drive near beverly but he wont be there hes working where he teaches martial arts she said karate tae kwan do kickboxing he was a regional kickboxing champ back in florida just got hired by a dojo near where we live wilshire near crescent heights he also does youth work on sunday for a ministry in bell gardens were both christians met at a church mixer were getting married in september congratulations hes a great guy said gallegos he loves me and gives me my space chapter i drove east toward anson coniffs dojo milo said gavin had found someone to rock his world at least he saw it that way if were talking about the blonde he was seeing straight why cant i find out who the hell she is a moment later a martial arts instructor maybe you can show off your whatchamacallit those karate dances katas i said its been years im out of shape you make it to black belt brown whyd you stop not angry enough i thought martial arts helped control anger martial arts is like fire i said you can cook or burn well lets see if mr conniffs the smoldering type steadfast martial arts and selfdefense one large room highceilinged and mirrored floored with bright blue exercise mats years ago id taken karate from a czech jew whod learned to defend himself during the nazi era i had lost interest lost my skills but walking into the dojo smelling the sweat and the discipline brought back memories and i found myself mentally reviewing the poses and the movements anson conniff was fivefour maybe with a boyish face a toned body and long lank light brown hair highlighted gold at the tips surferdude slightly miniaturized he wore white karate togs a black belt spoke in a loud crisp voice to a dozen beginners all women an older whitehaired asian informed us the class would end in ten minutes and asked us to stand to one side conniff ran the women through a half dozen more poses then released them they dabbed their brows collected their gym bags and headed out the door as we approached conniff smiled can i help you gentlemen milo flashed the badge and the smile disintegrated police what about gavin quick him said conniff beth read about him in the paper and told me he laughed something funny mr conniff not his death id never laugh at that its just funny that youd be talking to me about it kind of like a movie script but i guess youre just doing your job conniff flipped hair out of his face milo said whys that because the idea of my killing anyone hurting anyone is absurd im a christian and that makes me prolife and antideath oh said milo i thought you might be laughing about gavin quick being dead because of what he did to beth the height disparity between milo and conniff was conspicuous karate and other martial arts teach you how to use an opponents size to your advantage but pure conversation put conniff at a disadvantage he tried to draw himself up thats really absurd sir gavin tormented beth but id never gloat about him or anyone else dying ive seen way too much dying ever to gloat the army said milo growing up sir my brother was born with lung disease and passed away when he was nine this was back in des moines iowa most of those nine years were taken up by bradley going in and out of the hospital i was three years older and ended up spending a lot of time at hospitals i saw someone die once the actual process a man not that old brought into the emergency room for some kind of seizure the doctors thought hed stabilized and sent him up to the ward for observation before discharge the orderlies took him on a gurney in one of those big patient elevators and my parents and i just happened to be riding in the same elevator at the same time because wed gone down to xray with bradley the man on the gurney was joking being friendly then he just stopped talking gave this sudden stare off into nowhere then his head flopped to the side and the color just drained from his face the orderlies began pounding his chest my mother slapped her hand over my eyes so i couldnt see and my father started talking nonstop keeping up a patter so i couldnt hear baseball he talked about baseball by the time we got off the elevator everyone was quiet conniff smiled i guess im just not very deathoriented as opposed to people who are youre protectionoriented said milo conniff motioned around the dojo this its a job milo said where were you last monday night not killing gavin quick conniff relaxed his posture in view of the topic youre being kind of lighthearted sir how should i be mournful that would be dishonest conniff tightened his black belt and widened the space between his feet i mourn gavin quick in the sense that i mourn the loss of any human life but im not going to tell you i cared for him he put beth through incredible misery but beth insisted on dealing with it in her own way and she was right the stalking stopped i had no reason to want to hurt him her own way said milo avoiding him said conniff going through the legal system i wanted to confront gavin on a verbal level i thought a mantoman talk might convince him beth said no and i respected her wishes mantoman conniff rubbed his palms along the sides of his tunic his hands were small and callused yes i can get protective i love beth but i didnt hurt gavin quick id have no reason to where were you monday with beth we stayed in even if you dont trust me you should trust beth shes all about forgiveness operates at a high level spiritually whatd you have for dinner said milo who remembers lets see monday so it was probably leftovers sunday we barbecued steaks and had a lot of leftovers yeah definitely leftover steak i cut it up and sautéed it with peppers and onions did a stirfry beth cooked up some rice yeah for sure we stayed in ever been in psychotherapy mr conniff why is that your business covering bases said milo well i find the question kind of intrusive sorry sir but ill answer it anyway said conniff my entire family went into therapy after bradley died we all saw a wonderful man named the reverend dr bill kehoe and i talked to him by myself a few times as well he was the pastor of our church and a fully qualified clinical psychologist he saved us from despair is there anything else youd like to know thats the only time you had therapy said milo yes lieutenant it took a while a long while to stop feeling guilty about bradleys dying and my surviving but i got there lifes darned good nowadays milo reached into his pocket and brought out the death shot of the blonde ever see this girl conniff studied the picture nope but i know the look pure dead thats the look that flavored my childhood who is she someone who died alongside gavin quick sad said conniff there are always sad things in this world the key is to push past all that and lead a spiritual life back in the car milo ran conniffs name through the data banks two parking tickets no con but hes a strange one no tightly wound i said the type to clean up carefully he says he was with beth ill ask beth he said her sayso will be enough like he said she operates at a high level a call from the car produced the same story from beth gallegos steak stirfry we returned to the station where milo found a faxed artists rendering of the dead girl and a message to call community relations look at this he said michelangelos rolling in his crypt the drawing was sketchy lacking in character useless he crumpled and tossed it phoned cr downtown listened hung up grinding his teeth this city everythings a goddamn audition they talked to the papers and the papers arent interested maybe its even true i can call ned biondi he retired from the times a few years ago but hed know who to talk to now that the pr idiots have given me an official no i cant just go off and hotdog but maybe in a few days if we still cant id her he peered at the timex muttered hows your time and your intestinal fortitude a visit to the quicks i said sure you do tarot readings too chapter that girl said sheila quick she was hired to help gavin so instead she goes and gets him into trouble her living room looked the same but drawn drapes turned it funereal and the space had gone stale the cigarette box from which jerome quick had lifted his smokes was empty sheila quick wore a black cotton robe with a zipper up the front her ash hair was turbaned by a black silk scarf her face was tight and white and old and she wore pink mules above the slippers her feet were knobby and blueveined she said unbelievable milo said what is maam what she did to him you see gavins arrest as beth gallegoss fault of course i do do you know how gav met her she was a therapist at saint johns was supposed to be helping gav get back his dexterity she knew what hed been through she shouldve been more understanding milo and i said nothing listen said sheila quick if she was so concerned about her safety whyd she take so long to complain and then what does she do goes straight for the police dials like its some bigdeal emergency when all gav did was knock on her door i know she said he pounded but no one else heard any pounding and gav told me he just knocked and i believe my son you dont think she shouldve called i think if she was so convinced there was a problem she had ample opportunity to come to us why didnt she all she had to do was call and let us know she thought gavin was a little eager wed have talked to him whyd she let this alleged problem linger if it was so bad youre professionals does that make sense to you milo said she never got in touch with you beforehand never not once see what i mean milo nodded and then all of a sudden gavs arrested and we have to hire a lawyer and go through all that rigamarole her smile was sickly of course in the end they dismissed it obviously it was nothing gavin had pled to a misdemeanor and been sentenced to therapy sheila quick said lieutenant i certainly hope you dont think what happened to my gav was related to anything he did or anyone he knew it couldnt be anyone he knew of course not we know only nice people and gavin she began to cry gavin after the accident he didnt have anyone in his life except his father and me and his sister no friends i said thats the point she said pleased as if shed solved a difficult puzzle it was no one he knew because he really didnt know anyone ive been thinking a lot about it lieutenant and im certain my baby just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time a stranger said milo look at september did any of those people know the pigs who killed them its exactly like that evils out there and sometimes it bites you and now the quick familys been bitten she sprang up raced to the kitchen came back with a plate of oreos eat she ordered milo took a cookie and finished it in two bites passed the plate to me i placed it on a side table so tell me said sheila quick what progress have you made milo brushed crumbs from his trousers to his hand searched for somewhere to put them just drop it all on the rug lieutenant i clean every day sometimes twice a day what else is there to do around here jerrys already back at work doing his businessman thing i envy that about him being able to concentrate i said being able to cut himself off its a male thing right you men cut yourselves off and go out and hunt and prowl and make deals and do whatever it is you think youre supposed to do and we women are stuck waiting for you as if youre some kind of conquering heroes mrs quick said milo youre not going to like this question but i have to ask it anyway did gavin ever run into any problems with women other than beth gallegos sheila quicks hands closed into fists no and the very fact youre suggesting it i tell you thats just so distorted shortsighted she ripped the scarfturban from her head and began kneading the fabric her hair was elaborately pinned compressed tightly to her skull white roots showed through the blond milo said im sorry but i need to you need to you need to what you need to do is find the madman who killed my son the young lady he was with maam we still havent been able to identify her sheila got up and snatched the plate of cookies from where id placed them she returned to the kitchen swung the door closed stayed in there as predicted said milo a pretty scene i know shes gone through hell but ten to one she was a harpy before minutes passed he said id better go in there and finish up with her be kind to yourself and stay here just as he rose the kitchen door swung open and sheila quick stomped through shed unpinned and brushed her hair but applied no makeup milo sat back down she stopped directly in front of us placed her hands on her hips is there anything else the girl gavin was wi dont know her never seen her cant change that no one in the family knows her including my daughter you asked kelly i called and asked her if gavin was dating anyone and she said she hadnt heard that were the two of them close of course kellys my bright one she knows her way around i said any plans for her to come back no why should she shes got a life even though i dont she stared at me gavin was a good human being a handsome human being of course girls liked him which is why that gallegos woman is so off base gavin didnt need to chase some little nurse type when did he and kayla bartell stop dating dont know she snapped why dont you ask her the she hasnt even been by to see me not once not a condolence note a pink mule tapped the carpet are we finished milo said youve heard about dr koppel she got murdered said sheila quick i read about it yesterday matteroffact no emotion any thoughts about that mrs quick its terrible she said everyones getting murdered what a city im thirsty would you like something to drink no thanks maam let me toss a few names at you please tell me if any of them are familiar anson conniff no whos he flora newsome no brian van dyne roy nichols no no no who are these people not important said milo nothing you need to worry about thanks for your time time said sheila quick ive got too much of that chapter sheila quick turned her back on us and we saw ourselves out just before we reached the car milos cell phone beeped he took the call big hand concealing the little blue gizmo sturgis oh hi as a matter of fact yes we are right here at the house yes that so wheres that when sure that would be fine thank you maam see you soon he snapped the phone shut that was eileen paxton sheilas baby sister shes in beverly hills for a meeting was planning to visit sis drove by saw us go in and decided to wait until we were finished shed like to talk about what family issues is how she put it shes a few blocks away on bedford some italian place corner of brighton time for tiramisu i said he touched his gut and grimaced even i have limits how disillusioning the italian place was named pagano and it featured three wobbly outdoor tables that blocked most of its share of the sidewalk eileen paxton sat at one of them wearing a slimcut black pantsuit and backless highheeled sandals and sipping a café latte she saw us smiled wiggled a pinkie her hair was trimmed shorter than a few days ago tinted a couple of shades lighter and her makeup was more intense she wore diamond stud earrings and a jade necklace looked as if she was celebrating something she said im so glad we could get together passersby brushed us milo edged closer to her and said here or inside oh here i like the rhythm of the city this particular city was barely a village a precious display of conspicuous wealth the rhythm was set by powerwalking pedestrians and oversized engines belching toxins milo and i sat down and ordered espresso from an overly moussed waiter with drugged eyes eileen paxton looked content as if this was a quiet restful place for al fresco dining she said how did my sister seem to you milo punted to me i said she looked a bit depressed what you need to know is thats not all because of what happened to gavin sheilas got longstanding psychological problems longstanding depression depression anxiety difficulty coping you name it shes always been moody and highstrung im the baby but i always took care of her when she married jerry i had my concerns about the marriage about sheila being able to handle marriage she said she turned her head quickly flashed teeth at drugeyes gio could i have some of those lovely little pistachio biscotti thank you youre a true dear back to us to sheilas credit she worked at her marriage and seemed to do okay even though jerrys no prize hes got problems too her squint was furious jerrys sexually predatory hits on anything with a vagina and for all i know anything with anything else he hit on me ive never told sheila it wouldve destroyed her and the marriage and i didnt want that on my conscience but youre telling us i said when did this happen a month after they were married barely back from their honeymoon i was also married and the four of us spent a weekend in arrowhead my first husbands family owned a place on the lake great place with a double dock everything was rolling along nicely until one day sheila went down for a nap she runs out of steam easily and my thenhubby had to go to town on business he was an investment banker that left just jerry and me i went down to sun on the dock in my bikini and a few minutes later jerry came by we werent alone ten minutes before he made his move and im not talking subtle hand down the bikini bottom she clawed her hand made a swooping motion he does not have a gentle touch the plate of hard cookies arrived along with our espressos eileen paxton patted the waiters hand selected a crescent broke it in half nibbled the tip what did you do i said i yanked jerrys goddamn hand out of there told him what id do to his balls if he ever tried that again hes despised me ever since and the feelings mutual not just because of that because of what he does to my sister what does he do hes cheated on her consistently throughout the marriage i didnt answer she said trust me i know the bum all those business trips doing god knows what the looks he gives me when were alone gives other women the girls he hires as secretaries what about them sluts theyre supposed to be doing secretarial work but dont look as if they know how to type he goes off doing his thing doing god knows what and sheila basically lives alone she has no friends no social network which is the way it was when we were growing up i always had a huge social circle sheila had trouble relating i said doing god knows what sheila said he was a metals dealer so ive heard paxton said airily she chewed on a biscotti you have doubts he must do something the bills get paid yes he travels around trading aluminum whatever but when my husband my new one tried to talk to him about investing jerry wasnt interested and teds a fabulous broker someone who could help jerry my sense is jerry isnt great at what he does has to hustle just to keep his head above he moves his office every few years travels all the time hires sluts as secretaries she hesitated maybe i was being a little harsh i just know what he did to me on the dock that day and the way his eyes rove i said youre thinking this could be related to gavin i want you guys to have all the facts and i know no one else will give them to you the familys screwed up and gavin was a weirdo i know sheila and jerry are going to tell you he was just a regular kid before the accident but thats not the way it was gavin had problems what kinds of problems eileen paxton rubbed the biscotti against her top teeth as if caressing the enamel her tongue snaked out and tickled the pastry then she took a hard bite and chewed slowly i wouldnt be telling you this except i dont want you misled we appreciate that maam said milo well good said paxton because i do feel uncomfortable divulging family issues she sipped latte like a cautious cat licked foam from her upper lip what kinds of problems did gavin have i said like father like son he was sexually predatory that sounds too harsh she said gavin hadnt developed into a predator yet but he was okay theres no reason not to tell you last year gavin ran into some legal problems over a woman beth gallegos said milo paxtons face slackened with disappointment so you know it came up recently maam in fact we were just talking about it to your sister youre serious sheila must have gone bonkers she blamed the victim right exactly maam thats always been her way of dealing with stress said paxton my poor sister lives on another planet well yes that was part of what i was going to tell you but that was only gavins most serious problem there have been others other women he stalked i know of at least one girl he harassed and my guess would be more because that kind of behaviors a pattern right sure said milo whos the other victim gavin had a girlfriend some rich kid from the flats i only met her once skinny little blond thing with a nose like a hawk i found her kind of snotty her fathers a prominent jingle writer gavin got sexually aggressive with her and she dumped him how do you know about this maam because gavin told me gavin talked to you about his personal issues from time to time paxton smiled and caressed her own neck the young hip aunt he liked the fact that im in the industry more in touch with pop culture than his parents wed chat from time to time the time he told me about little miss beverly hills i think her name was katya something like that we were all out to dinner right up the block at il principe the foods divine ill have to try it said milo so this was a family dinner gavin sheila and i jerry was out of town as usual how long ago um id say half a year maybe more anyway there we were enjoying the fabulous food they cook sea bass in a wood oven make their own pasta from scratch and all of a sudden sheila wasnt feeling well another typical sheila thing she cant enjoy anything not even a good meal without suffering and she ran to the little girls room and stayed there for a while gavin started talking to me hed been looking kind of tense all night finally i pried it out of him hed lost his girlfriend because she wasnt interested in sex he called her a compulsive virgin she propped the cheweddown biscotti between her index fingers rolled it placed it on her plate i asked him what had happened and he told me while he was telling it he really worked himself up it was clear he was angry and frustrated about losing the relationship no that was the thing he said he couldnt care less about having a girlfriend it was not getting sex that griped him it really made him angry this was after the accident shortly after maybe it was eight months ago but gavin was always easily frustrated as a little boy he threw all kinds of tantrums excitable i said and now he was all worked up about not getting sex he talked about sex as if it was his right said he and the girl katya had been going together on and off since high school it was about time she put out like there was a schedule you adhered to then he said everyone else was fucking themselves blind the whole world was one big fuckfest swimming in jizz and he deserved to swim too and she could just go to hell hed find someone else lots of anger i said he always had a bad temper it got worse after the accident it was like his emotional barometer was off he just did or said what was on his mind i mean im his aunt and hes talking about jizz in a booth at il principe i was mortified important people dine at that place gavin was talking loud his voice kept rising and i had to keep telling him to lower it i tried to reason with him told him women werent machines they needed to be cared for sex could be fun but it had to be mutual he listened actually seemed to be taking it in then he slid over in the booth and said eileen thanks youre awesome then he grabbed my breast in one hand the back of my head with the other and tried to shove his tongue down my throat gio a refill please milo pressed her for more on gavins sex life and the family but once shed gotten past the basic hatred there was nothing he steered the conversation to gavins tabloid fantasies that she said is another thing he was impressed with my work in the industry he kept asking me to hook him up with some celebrity parties so he could observe she laughed as if id help him dig dirt on my friends what was his angle unearthing filth and selling it to the tabs he saw it as his journalistic debut he was going to make his mark as a journalist i told him the tabs were trash and full of lies but he wouldnt hear it he claimed they were more honest than the establishment press because they were open about their goals filth she nodded after the accident gavin saw the world as one big ball of filth i said did he make any progress toward being a journalist like take a course or get an internship said paxton not to my knowledge id doubt it he really wasnt in any shape to go back to school or hold down a job too flighty he was drifting dropping out sleeping in till noon turning his room into a pigsty i cant blame him im sure his brain was messed up but sheila didnt even try to set limits and jerry of course was always gone gavin did go into therapy because the courts forced him to did he tell you who his therapist was jerry did dr koppel like it was some big deal she frowned you know her ive heard her on the radio and i have to say im not impressed all she does is preach morality to idiots who phone in why not just go to church using the present tense milo and i looked at each other she said what dr koppel was murdered paxtons face went white what when couple of days ago my god why dont i know that was it on the news there was an article in yesterdays paper i never read the paper she said except calendar murdered omigod are you saying it had something to do with gavin no maam but she could it be coincidence your sister didnt seem impressed by that my sisters crazy do you have any idea who killed her milo shook his head horrible horrible she said you think theres a chance it couldnt be related to gavin we dont know maam oh boy paxton stayed serious for a while ate her biscotti and grinned back to coquettish now youre playing hard to get lieutenant not really maam well i hope this has been helpful ive got to go one more question maam do you remember that picture i showed you of the girl who died with gavin yes of course and i told you id never seen her before and that was true gavin talked to you about wanting to find a new girl he told other people hed succeeded what other people lets leave it at other people mr inscrutable detective said paxton she brushed her knee against milos a new girl huh in gavins mind that couldve meant anything someone he decided to pursue whether or not she wanted it someone hed seen on tv the girl i showed you was real said milo and she was in gavins car up on mulholland late at night okay she said annoyed so he found someone everyone finds someone eventually look what happened to her she made sure milo picked up the tab and flounced away on backless shoes what a piece of work said milo what a family so what was her reason for talking to us dissing the quicks she despises them i said but that doesnt discount her information gavins inappropriate sexual behavior yeah hes sounding nuttier by the day if shes right about jerome quick gavin had a role model gavin may have started off with a certain view of women and the accident weakened his inhibitions further what intrigues me is the blonde gavin had problems approaching women came on way too strong yet an attractive young woman was willing to get intimate with him a young woman in fivehundreddollar shoes whom no ones reported missing a pro he said got to be severe frustration could lead a boy to buy sex a beverly hills boy might have a decent budget especially with a father who sanctioned it i know she hasnt shown up in any vice files but a relative rookie lucky enough not to get busted wouldnt if she worked on her own thered be no one to miss her if she worked for someone else they might not want to go on record a father who sanctioned it he said dad slips gavin serious dough to get seriously laid and maybe i said dad knew where to send him jerome quicks metalstrading firm was a few miles east of beverly hills on wilshire near la brea on the third floor of a shopworn fourstory building wedged between taller structures a sign in the empty lobby listed several units for lease most of the tenants were businesses with names that told you little about what they did quicks office was on the second floor midway down a poorly lit linoleumfloored hall a savory but discomforting odor beef stew just past its prime permeated the walls quick didnt keep much of an office a small mostly empty reception area fronted an office marked private the carpeting was brown stomped glossy the walls cheap woodite paneling the receptionist sat behind a cheap woodite desk she was young and thin pretty but hardlooking with randomly chopped hair tinted electric blue at the tips her makeup was thick and grayish her lipstick anoxic grayblue curving bright azure nails were an inch long she wore a tight white sweater over leatherlook black vinyl pants and chewed gum in front of her was a copy of buzz magazine the lack of other periodicals or chairs and her surprise at our presence said visitors were infrequent the sight of milos badge raised a penciled eyebrow but the pulse in her neck was slow and steady she said mr quicks out of town in a surprisingly sultry voice where said milo she wiggled her shoulders san diego he travel a lot all the time nice and quiet for you uhhuh the blue nails tapped the magazine no computer or typewriter in sight milo said youre not surprised the police want to talk to him she shrugged sure i am is it the first time the police have wanted to talk to him ive only been working here for a couple of months cops been here before said milo nope milo showed her the photo of the blonde she blinked hard turned away you know her is she dead very dont know her shes the girl who died with gavin quick oh you do know about gavin yeah of course sad said milo i didnt really know him she said very sad she turned the corners of her mouth down trying to mean it her brown eyes were flat who did it thats what were trying to find out ms angie gavin come in here once in a while how often angie not often milo unbuttoned his jacket and edged closer to her desk how long have you been working here three and a half months in three and half months how many times did you see gavin quick hmm maybe three times could be four but probably three what did gavin do when he was here went in to see jerry mr quick sometimes theyd go out for lunch i guess was it lunchtime i think it was whatd you think of gavin angie he seemed like an okay guy no problems she licked her lips no no problems at all he was always a gentleman what do you mean she said weve heard said milo that gavin could get pretty enthusiastic overly enthusiastic no reply overly enthusiastic with women angie she placed a hand on the copy of buzz as if preparing to take an oath i swear on all that is hip i never saw that he was polite polite said milo and by the way what is your last name paul angie paul yup so mr quick travels a lot all the time must get boring just sitting around its okay she flexed her shoulders again milo sidled closer to the desk the top bit into his thigh angie did gavin ever hit on you why would he do that youre an attractive woman thanks she said without inflection he was always polite wheres the boss off to somewhere in san diego he didnt say he doesnt tell you where to find him he calls in leaving you all by yourself said milo i like it she said nice and quiet before we left milo took down her north hollywood address and phone number and drivers license registration driving back to the station he ran her through the data banks three years ago angela may paul had been arrested for marijuana possession paxton said quick hired sluts for secretaries he said i dont know if ol angie would qualify for that but hes sure not tapping the executive roster that office of his pretty downscale huh keeping the overhead low i said eileen said hes no tycoon she said he was hustling think angie was telling the truth about not knowing the blonde i thought she reacted a bit to the photo though with that stone face it was hard to tell she blinked hard when you showed it to her i said but it is a death shot the blonde he said jimmy choo and armani perfume maybe ol jerry provided well for junior he checked his phone for messages grunted hung up drs larsen and gull returned my call theyd prefer to meet me away from the office suggested roxbury park tomorrow pm the picnic area on the west side they go there for lunch from time to time you up for some grass and trees and chewing the fat with a couple of colleagues should i bring a picnic basket grass and trees sounds okay but forget the niceties chapter alex im glad i caught you itd been months since id heard robins voice and it threw me no rapid heartbeat i was pleased about that i said hi howve you been well you great so civil alex im calling for a favor but if you cant do it please just say so what is it tim was just asked to fly to aspen to work with udo pisano the tenor theres a concert tomorrow and the guys voice is freezing up they want tim there yesterday are flying him on a chartered jet ive never been to aspen and would like to go along were talking one maybe two nights would you be able to babysit spike you know how he is with kenneling sure i said if spike can handle being here a few years back on a sweltering summer day a little french bulldog had made his way across the murderous traffic of sunset boulevard and up into the glen he wandered onto my property gasping stumbling dangerously dehydrated i watered and fed him searched for his owner she turned out to be an old woman dying in a holmby hills manor her sole heir a daughter was allergic to dogs hed been saddled with an unwieldy pedigree moniker i renamed him spike and learned about kibble he reacted to his new surroundings with élan promptly fell in love with robin and began viewing me as competition when robin and i broke up custody wasnt an issue she got him his leash his food bowls the short hairs he shed all over the furniture his snoring snuffling arrogant table manners i was awarded an echoing house i considered finding a dog of my own had never gotten around to it i didnt see spike much because i didnt see robin much hed taken ownership of the small house in venice that she shared with tim plachette and his regard for tim seemed no higher than for me robin said thanks so much im sure hell be fine down deep he loves you must be extremely deep when do you want to bring him over the plane leaves from santa monica as soon as were ready so i was thinking soon come on over this is not your typical dog his flat face implies as much frog dna as canine heritage his ears are oversized upright batlike and they flex and pivot and fold in response to a wide range of emotions he doesnt take up much more space than a pomeranian but manages to pack twentysix pounds into that cubic area most of it leadbone and rippling muscle clothed in a black brindle coat his neck is twentyone and threequarter inches around and his knobby head is three handbreadths wide his huge brown eyes shine with confidence and he allows himself the barest patronizing interest in the lives of others his worldview is simple life is a cabaret and its all about him when i used to take him out alone women flocked oh thats the most beautiful ugly dog ive ever seen was the operative phrase this afternoon he had as much interest in leaving robins side as in snarfing a bowl of lint i held out a chew stick he shot robin a mournful gaze she sighed and stooped itll be fine handsome the saranwrapped nugget of hamburger id concealed in my shirt pocket perked his radar and brought him over but once he gobbled it he raced back and hid behind robins legs great legs she said look at this hes guilttripping me the joys of parenthood spike nuzzled her jeans tight jeans above suede boots she wore a black silk tshirt under a tapestry vest her auburn curls were loose her face was scrubbed and fresh those big liquid brown eyes the clean sweep of jaw and thin straight nose those lips the oversized incisors i said let me take him and you go hell fuss then hell be fine youre right she said she took spikes face in both her hands listen you rascal daddy will take good care of you you know that what did she call tim stepdaddy spikes trapdoor mouth dropped open teeth flashed a purplish tongue flapped beseeching the heavens he bayed i swooped him into my arms held his taut little body tight against my chest as he sniveled and writhed and hyperventilated it was like restraining a bowling ball with legs oh dear said robin i said bon voyage rob she hesitated headed for her truck changed her mind and came back throwing her arm around my shoulder she kissed spike full on the snout she was kissing me on the cheek just as allison drove up in her black jaguar xjs the convertible top was down and her black hair blew like something out of a crème rinse commercial she wore bluetinted sunglasses and creamcolored knits with an aqua scarf glints punctuated her ears neck fingers wrists allison is unafraid of adornment she switched off the engine and robins arm dropped spike tried to leap out of my arms and reacted to his failure with a heartwrenching howl hey everyone said allison hi said robin smiling spike tried his imstranglingdotheheimlich bit well look whos here allison patted spikes head then she kissed my lips robin backed away a few steps spike froze his head shifted from woman to woman it can get like that buddy he moaned after robin drove away i trailed allison up the stairs to the terrace carrying a stillshuddering dog when we reached the landing she looked at me no at him touched his whiskered flews tentatively look at this little guy i forget how cute he is spike licked her hand you are very very cute spike began panting heavily and she petted him some more he wriggled twisted his head back and managed to make eye contact with me a knowing look rich with triumph moments later he was lying at allisons feet nibbling on his second chew stick in as many minutes damning my approach with a jaundiced eye some guys have all the luck mary lou koppels murder had shaken allison and that seemed to be why shed dropped by as i made coffee for both of us she pressed for details i told her the little i knew so it could be a patient she said at this point anythings possible her hands were tight around her mug i said youre upset not on a personal level she took a sip i have had patients mostly husbands of patients who made me uneasy but that was mostly years ago when i was taking more referrals from agencies i guess mary lous death hits close to home thinking we know what were doing and maybe we get overconfident its not just me ive gotten calls from three other psychologists who just wanted to talk about it people who knew mary lou people who know im seeing you and thought they could get some inside information dont worry i was discreet what was on their minds our line of work the unpredictablity of human beings i guess they want to convince themselves that mary lou was different and thats why it happened to her i said theyre hoping she ticked off some talkshow nut and it had nothing to do with her practice bingo but from what youre telling me it could be a patient someone who met the quick boy in the waiting room given the quick boys impulsiveness his behavior with women the suspect pool has grown beyond the waiting room but mary lous murder she said it has to be something related to her work any idea about gaining access to her patient files i said i cant figure out a way to get around confidentiality she thought about that not without some kind of clear and present danger documentation of a threat there was nothing like that in gavins chart and if she was threatened by anyone she didnt let on to me or milo weve got a meeting with her partners tomorrow gull and larsen know them i said ive said hi to both of them but nothing more any impressions gull comes across very smooth very much the beverly hills shrink larsens more the academic type gull was gavins initial therapist i said it didnt work out and gavin was transferred to koppel now that gavins dead maybe he can tell us why what a troubled kid she said the stalking putting the make on his aunt if the aunts to be believed the familys beyond dysfunctional she drank more coffee took my hand and held it at least you and i will never be out of work neither will milo spike rolled on his back and began pumping his stumpy legs he looks like an upended turtle she said what are you doing cutie practicing for the upsidedown bike race thats the signal to scratch his belly i said she grinned and complied thanks for decoding im not fluent in dog she stopped scratching and made a move for her coffee mug spike protested and she bent down again i said onetrial learning consider yourself conditioned she laughed took the mug managed to sip and rub spike burped then purred like a cat allison cracked up hes a sound effects machine hes got all sorts of talents how longs he staying couple of days i told her about robins call that was very nice of you its the least i could do i said it was supposed to be joint custody but he voted against it well that was foolish on his part im sure you were a great father she sat up and touched my face and ran a finger over my lips spike sprang to his feet and barked here we go i said to spike cool it clown ooh stern said allison you do stern pretty well my love ive never seen it before he brings it out in me i always wanted a dog she said you know my mother way too neat for hair on the carpet and dad was always away on business i did have a salamander once it crawled out of its tank and hid under my bed and dried up when i found it it looked like a piece of beef jerky poor neglected child i said yes it was a tragic childhood though to be honest i wasnt very attached to sally wet and slimy discourages bonding dont you think but something like this she rubbed spikes head this i could see it gets complicated i said how so ill show you i got up stood behind her rubbed her neck and kissed it waited for spike to go bonkers he stared defiant did nothing her top was vnecked and i slipped my hand under it she said umm as long as im here so you didnt just come to talk about mary lou i did but so what she said i pinched her nipple lightly and she leaned back in her chair and sucked in her breath and let it out in a soft laugh she reached behind and ran her hand along my flank you have time i glanced over at spike impassive i took allison by the hand walked her to the bedroom spike trotted ten steps behind us i closed the door silence back when it was robin and me hed complained incessantly i drew the drapes undressed allison got out of my own clothes we stood belly to belly blood rushing cool flesh warming i cupped allisons rear her hands were all over me still no complaints from the other side of the door as i carried her to the bed we embraced and touched and kissed and i forgot about anything but allison it wasnt till i entered her that the scratching and mewling began allison heard it right away lying there her hands on my arms her legs propped high on my back she opened her blue eyes wide we began moving together the commotion on the other side of the door got louder oh she said still rocking see what you mean i didnt stop and neither did she spike kept it up to no avail chapter when i awoke the next morning at am allison was next to me and spike lay curled on the floor at the foot of the bed shed let him in for the next two days he wouldnt even be faking civil i left her sleeping and took him outside to do his business the morning was moist and gray and oddly fragrant mustaches of haze coiled down from the mountains the trees were black sentries too early for the birds i watched him waddle around the yard sniffing and searching he nuzzled a garden snail decided escargot was an element of his gallic heritage that he preferred to forget and disappeared behind a bush as i stood there in my bathrobe shivering head clearing i wondered whod been threatened to the point of murder by gavin quick and mary lou koppel or maybe there was no threat at all and this was all about pleasure killing then i recalled gavins journalistic fantasies and my questions took off in a different direction at breakfast i said nothing about the murders to allison by eightthirty shed left for her office and i was doing some work around the house spike remained still in front of the cold tv hes always been a devotee of the blank screen maybe hes got something there i headed for my office and cleared paper spike padded in and stared until i got up went to the kitchen and fetched him a scrap of turkey that kept him happy for the rest of the morning and by am he was sleeping in the kitchen when milo called soon after and asked me to pick him up at noon for the meeting with drs gull and larsen i was glad to hear his voice i idled the seville in front of the station milo was late to come down and i was warned twice by uniforms not to loiter milos name meant nothing to the second cop who threatened to ticket i drove around the block a couple of times and found milo waiting by the curb sorry sean binchy grabbed me as i was leaving he closed his eyes and put his head back his clothes were rumpled and i wondered when hed last slept i took side streets to ohio aimed the seville east fought the snarl at sepulveda and continued to overland where i could finally outpace a skateboard roxbury park was fifteen minutes away on olympic less than a mile west of mary lou koppels office even closer to the quick house on camden drive i considered the constricted world that had become gavins after his accident until hed driven a pretty blond girl up to mulholland drive milo opened his eyes i like this chauffering stuff you ever put in for mileage the department takes a big hit saint alex what did binchy want he found a neighbor of koppels some kid living seven houses up mcconnell who spotted a van cruising the street the night of the murder kid was coming home late around am and the van passed him heading north away from koppels house and toward his he locked his doors stayed in his car watched it turn around and return going really slowly like the driver was looking for an address the kid waited until the taillights had disappeared for a while he cant say if the van parked or just drove out of sight but it didnt make another pass vigilant kid i said there was a followhome mugging over on the other side of motor a few weeks ago and his parents made a big deal about being observant two oclock fits the coroners estimate any look at the driver too dark kid thought maybe the windows were tinted how old a kid seventeen binchy says hes an honor student at harvardwestlake seems solid hes into cars too was pretty sure the van was a ford aerostar black or gray or navy blue no customization he could spot he didnt get a peek at the plate that would be too much to hope for its not much but if we turn up some suspect with an aerostar itll be a nice bit of something any progress getting access to koppels files i asked three adas and each told me the same thing without overt violent behavior or threats by a specific patient against a specific person forget it maybe theres another way to learn about gavins private life i said he fancied himself a budding journalist and journalists take notes oh man he sat up pressed the dashboard with both hands as if protecting himself from falling forward that sty he called a room all that paper piled up maybe he wrote something down and i never checked shit it was only a suggestion the night we notified sheila quick she showed us the room i felt bad for her seeing how embarrassed she was i never bothered to toss he dug his thumbs into his temples oh that was brilliant that night we notified sheila i said it presented as a lovers lane sex murder no one suspected gavin mightve played a role in his own death we still dont know that he did yeah yeah i appreciate the therapy alex but the fact is i shouldve tossed the damn room right away maybe im losing it i have to write things down or they leak outta my brain okay no more whining proactive proactive after gull and larsen i head back to the quick house mrs qs gonna love my excavating her dead boys personal effects he grimaced hopefully she didnt throw stuff out i think itll be a while before she has the energy to face the job the life she leads he said softly i looked into her hubbys background ol jerome has earned himself one ticket for speeding and one for failure to make a complete stop hes not known to our vice unit or any other i talked to including santa monica and west hollywood so if he hired call girls for himself or gavin he did it carefully i ran him through a few search engines and his name comes up once reunion of vietnam vets five years ago in scranton pennsylvania at century park east i stopped at a red light a few blocks later i passed the collegesized campus that was beverly hills high then a blocklong stretch of green clean and orderly park with that potemkin village rightness that characterizes beverly hillss public areas milo said ready to be collegial should i tell them who you are no keep it lowkey ill just listen ever the observer probably a good idea okay turn here on roxbury keep going till you get to the south side of the park and circle around they said theyll be waiting in the picnic area off the spalding side alley on the western edge near where the kids and the mommies play albin larsen and a larger darkhaired man in a black suit sat at a wooden table just inside the green iron fencing that marked the western border of the park one of six tables all shaded by a grove of old chinese elms beverly hills treats its trees like show poodles and the elms had been clipped into towering green umbrellas the psychologists had chosen a spot just north of a sand pit where toddlers frolicked under the watchful eyes of mothers and maids their backs were to the children i found a parking slot facing the green fence most of the others were taken up by suvs and vans the exception was a pair of mercedes s both deep gray positioned next to each other same cars id seen in the parking lot of koppels building same model as jerome quicks milo said his and his benzs they work together but drove here separately i said meaning meaning lets see larsen and gull were unaware of our presence and we watched them for a few moments they sat talking to each other and eating not much conversation no obvious emotion milo said lets go when we were ten yards away both men noticed us and put down their plastic forks albin larsens dress was consistent with what id seen the day mary lou koppel had failed to show up at her office another sweatervest this one brown over a tan linen shirt and a green wool tie franco gulls black suit was finely woven crepe with narrow lapels under it he wore a collarless white silk shirt buttoned to the neck gold wedding ring gold watch gull was broadshouldered and powerfullooking with a thick neck a boxers nose and a big rough face that managed to be handsome his head sported a mass of wavy ironflecked black hair his chin preceded the rest of him by a half inch tailored eyebrows arched behind graylensed sunglasses and his skin was rosy a bit younger than larsen midforties when milo and i reached the table he removed the shades and exposed big dark eyes sad eyes bottomed by smudgy pouches they added a couple of years and the suggestion of thoughtfulness he was eating takeout chinese out of the carton shrimp swimming in red sauce and fried rice and a side of dwarf spring rolls albin larsens lunch was mixed green salad heaped in a styrofoam bowl both men sipped canned iced tea larsen said good day and gave a formal little nod gull held out a hand his fingers were enormous both men were in the shade but gulls forehead was beaded with sweat spicy shrimp milo and i brushed dust and leaves from the picnic bench and sat down larsen resumed eating gull smiled with uncertainty thanks for taking the time doctors said milo must be tough around the office larsen looked up from his salad neither man answered dr koppels patients said milo having to explain to them yes said larsen the vulnerability gull said fortunately were not talking about a huge number unlike physicians each of us handles only forty fifty patients at any given time albin and i divided up the actives and contacted each one were still working on former patients but its tough finding them mary didnt hold on to her files for longer than a year his voice was smooth and soft but talking seemed to take the wind out of him he wiped his forehead the sweat kept coming is that typical said milo destroying files its something each therapist decides independently what about you and dr larsen i hold on to files for two years what about you albin larsen said it depends but generally thats about right no official group policy said milo were not an official group said larsen we share an office suite so what happens to dr koppels active patients now in terms of treatment franco gull said those who choose to continue with either albin or me are free to do so if they prefer a female therapist were happy to refer them out sounds pretty organized said milo we need to be as albin said were dealing with extreme vulnerability what could be worse for someone needy than to be cast adrift so abruptly gull shook his head and his wavy hair shimmied its a nightmare for them and for us unbelievable dr koppels murder gulls sad eyes tightened are we talking about anything else albin larsen speared a tomato but didnt eat it its a major loss said gull for her patients for us for mary was vibrant brilliant dynamic she was someone i learned from detective its hard to comprehend that shes really gone he glanced at larsen larsen toyed with a lettuce leaf and said to be snuffed out like that he wiped his eyes weve lost a dear friend franco gull said do you have any idea who did it milo placed his elbows on the picnic table i know you gentlemen are bound by confidentiality but a viable threat nullifies that are either of you aware of any patient ever making a threat against dr koppel any patient who resented her deeply a patient said gull why would you even think that im thinking anything doctor covering all bases no said gull there are no patients like that absolutely not he groped for a napkin took another swipe at his brow milo glanced at albin larsen larsen shook his head milo said dr koppel dealt with troubled people it seems a logical place to start logical in the abstract said gull but it doesnt apply to our practice mary didnt treat sociopaths who did she treat said milo people with everyday problems of adjustment said gull anxiety depression what used to be called neurosis and basically sound individuals facing choice points career guidance all kinds of guidance said gull you dont call em neurotic anymore huh we avoid labeling detective avoid stigma therapys not treatment in the way a medical procedure is a doctor doing something to a passive patient its contractual we see ourselves as partners with our patients doctor and patient working as a team exactly problems of adjustment said milo youre absolutely certain there were no dangerous people in dr koppels practice albin larsen said mary would not have enjoyed working with violent individuals and she did only what she enjoyed mary was busy she could choose her patients why wouldnt she enjoy working with violent people dr larsen mary was committed to nonviolence we all are doctor but that doesnt mean were insulated from the uglier aspects of life larsen said dr koppel was able to insulate herself milo said really yes ive heard radio tapes where dr koppel talked about prison reform ah said larsen im afraid that was my influence was i on the tapes as well dont think so doctor larsens mouth got tiny it was a topic i got mary interested in not in a clinical sense she was a socially aware individual had a human as well as an academic interest in the larger social issues but when it came to her practice she concentrated on the everyday problems of everyday people women mostly and doesnt that say something about the likelihood of her murderer being a patient whys that dr larsen criminal violence is usually malegenerated youve got an interest in criminal psychology said milo only as part of the social rubric said larsen franco gull said albins being modest hes done terrific things as a human rights advocate from that to private practice i said larsen glanced at me one does what one can in a given time milo said human rights doesnt pay the bills larsen turned to him im sorry to say youre correct detective so said milo no psychopaths on dr koppels patient roster a statement not a question and neither psychologist responded albin larsen ate a shred of lettuce franco gull examined his gold watch milo whipped out the picture of the blond girl either of you gentlemen recognize her larsen and gull examined the death shot both shook their heads gull licked his lips sweat beaded atop his nose and he wiped it away with irritation who is she was said larsen shes clearly deceased to milo is this related in some way to marys murder dont know yet doctor did mary know this girl said gull dont know that either doctor so neither of you have seen her around the office gull said never larsen shook his head tugged at a button of his sweatervest detective is there something we need to know about in terms of our own safety are you worried about your safety youve just showed us a picture of a dead girl i assume you feel her death is related to marys whats really going on here milo put the photo back in his pocket all i can advise you is to exercise normal caution should either of you come up with a threatening patient or anyone else from dr koppels life who seems suspicious youd do best to let me know he crossed his legs looked over at the frolicking children an icecream truck cruised through the alley and rang its bell some of the kids began pointing and jumping franco gull said is there anything else ive got a totally booked afternoon just a few more questions said milo about the structure of your partnership with dr koppel albin told you its not a formal partnership said gull we share office space a purely financial arrangement well said gull i wouldnt reduce it to just that mary was our dear friend what happens now that dr koppels dead in terms of the lease gull stared at him milo said i need to ask albin and i havent talked about that detective its all we can do to take care of marys patients he looked at larsen larsen said id be in favor of you and i picking up marys share of the rent franco sure said gull to us its no big deal the rents reasonable and marys share was smaller than ours whys that said milo because said gull she found the building for us arranged an excellent lease oversaw the entire renovation good negotiator said milo she was said larsen her skills were facilitated by the fact that her exhusband owns the building ed koppel franco gull said everyone calls him sonny milo said renting from the ex mary and sonny got along well said gull the divorce was years ago amicable no problems at all he gave us a sweetheart lease detective doesnt that speak volumes guess so said milo gull said you wont find anyone who knew mary well whos going to badmouth her she was a fabulous woman this is really hard for us his chin trembled he put his sunshades back on gotta be rough said milo sorry for your loss he made no move to leave larsen said is there anything else this is just a formality doctors but where was each of you the night dr koppel was killed i was home said gull with my wife and kids how many kids two out came the notepad and where do you live doctor club drive cheviot hills yes so you and dr koppel were neighbors mary helped us find the house through mr koppel no said gull as far as i know sonnys only into commercial mary knew we were looking to upgrade she was taking a walk and noticed the for sale sign and thought it might meet our needs how long ago was that a year fourteen months before that you lived in studio city said gull why is this relevant milo turned to larsen and you sir where were you that night also at home said larsen i live in an apartment on harvard street in santa monica north of wilshire he recited the address in a soft weary voice live by yourself i do larsen smiled i read and went to bed im afraid theres no one to verify that milo smiled back whatd you read sartre transcendence of the ego light stuff sometimes a challenge is good aint that the truth said milo ill tell you this case is a challenge larsen didnt answer franco gull checked his watch again i really need to head back to the office one more question said milo i know you cant tell me about any deep dark patient secrets because of ethical restraints but i do have a question that i think you are allowed to answer do any of your patients drive a dark ford aerostar minivan black dark blue maybe gray above us the elm canopy rustled and the high gleeful sounds of childhood play drifted over the icecream truck rang its bell and drove off albin larsen said a patient no ive never seen that his eyes drifted toward gull franco gull said i agree no patients im aware of drive a car like that not that id notice im in the office when they park their cars dont know what any of them drive unless it comes up in therapy his brow was slick with sweat milo scribbled in his pad and closed it thanks gentlemen thats all for now therell be more said gull depends upon what we find in the way of evidence fingerprints said gull that kind of thing that kind of thing gull stood so quickly he nearly lost his balance makes sense larsen got to his feet too gull was a head taller and a foot and a half broader at the shoulders high school football maybe college we watched the two of them walk to their mercedeses milo said now wasnt that interesting chapter sweaty fellow milo murmured as he called dmv it didnt take long to get the data three vehicles were registered to franco arthur gull on club drive a twoyearold mercedes a corvette and a ford aerostar well well well he pulled the thomas guide out of my glove compartment found a map and jabbed his index finger gulls house is only a few blocks from koppels so on the face of it one of his cars in the neighborhood isnt weird but the witness said the van drove away from his street seemed to be looking for something i said cruising back and forth at am isnt neighborly its the kind of thing stalkers do a shrink with problems in that area wouldnt that be interesting a shrink the court refers stalkers to maybe gavin found out somehow and thats why he dropped gull and switched to koppel gull driving by koppels house he said she wouldnt have stood for that gavin tells her hes lighting a tinderbox on the other hand i said what three vehicles in the gull family the mercedes for him and a vintage vette for weekend fun that leaves the aerostar for the wife suspicious wife he said oh yeah gull and koppel were having a fling when you talked about evidence gull asked about fingerprints it struck me as out of context that could be because he knows his prints are in that batch you dusted at koppels house more than partners more than neighbors she finds him a house close by all the easier for dropin fun mrs g suspects and drives by at am checking up no wonder the guys perspiring like a marathon runner i said youll find out soon enough hes got a state license so his prints are in the system he flipped the little blue phone open ill call the techs right now meanwhile lets visit the wife what about excavating gavins room that too he said but later big grin all of a sudden im busy the gull residence was a tudor not unlike mary lou koppels a bit less imposing on a flat lot with no view ballparkquality lawn the usual luxuriant beds of impatiens a liquidambar sapling just beginning to turn color staked in the crater vacated by a larger tree the aerostar van was parked in the driveway deep blue two bumper stickers my childs an honor student at wild rose school and go lakers an hispanic maid answered milos knock he asked for la señora por favor and she said un momento and closed the door when it opened again a petite very slim blondponytailed woman in her thirties stood there looking distracted milos badge changed nothing she continued to look through us whiteblond iceblue eyes small bones beautiful features even standing still she seemed graceful but dangerously slim her skin bordered on translucence and her black velvet sweats bagged shed done a fine job with her makeup but the red rims around her eyes were impossible to conceal milo said mrs gull im patty may we come in why this is about a recent crime in the neighborhood one slender hand drummed the other what she said another mugging in rancho park something more serious maam and im afraid the victims someone you know her said patty gull her voice had gone deeper and any trace of distraction had vanished her hands separated dropped clamped on her hips her lower jaw slung forward as finefeatured and aquiline as she was her face took on a mastiff scowl sure come in she said the living room was woodshuttered and paneled in oak stained so dark it was nearly black the decor looked as if it had been assembled in one day by someone with respect for convention a tight deadline and a nervous budget middling antique copies equine prints under glass the kind of stilllife paintings you can pick up at sidewalk sales further stabs at recreating manor living were accomplished by a riot of floral chintz tooshiny brass gewgaws and artificially distressed surfaces just beyond the room was a hallway filled with toys and other child clutter patty gull perched on the edge of an overstuffed sofa and we faced her from matching wing chairs she took hold of a tasseled cushion held it over her abdomen like a hotwater bottle milo said i noticed your bumper sticker someone a lakers fan me she said i used to be a lakers girl back when i was young and cute not that long ago dont stroke me said patty gull i like to think ive held up pretty well but im going to be forty in two years and i screwed up my body giving my husband two gorgeous children he pays me back by fucking other women whenever he can we said nothing she said hes a pussy hound detective for that i couldve hooked up with a basketball player even one on the bench her laughter was brittle i was a good lakers girl went home after the games didnt party held on to my morals nice catholic girl told to marry well i married a psychologist figured id be getting some stability she punched the tasseled pillow flung it to one side and hugged herself mrs gull patty ive had it hes history youre getting divorced maybe she said you take stock of your life and say this is what i have to do and it seems so obvious then you step back and all the complications rain down on you kids money its always the woman who gets screwed moneywise ive stayed out of francos business affairs he could hide everything and i wouldnt know have you talked to a lawyer not officially i have a friend whos a lawyer she was a lakers girl too but unlike me she was smart enough to go all the way with her education i always wanted to get an mba do something in the corporate world maybe in sports i love sports instead she threw up her hands why am i telling you this youre here about her dr koppel dr mary lou fuckanotherwomanshusband koppel you think franco killed her patty gull examined her fingernails should i think that mrs gull probably not the papers said she was shot and franco doesnt own a gun wouldnt have a clue how to use one also he wasnt with her that night i know because i got up in the middle of the night and drove by her house looking for his car and it wasnt there what time was this maam mustve been close to two in the morning i went to bed at ten like i always do big swinging life and all that franco came in before i could fall asleep and we had another fight and he left and i went to sleep when i woke up and he wasnt there and it was nearly two i really lost it because he hadnt come home because said patty gull he wasnt being penitent youre having serious problems and you claim youre penitent and then you have another fight what do you do you approach your wife on bended knees and beg her forgiveness thats the constructive thing to do the caring giving thing franco would tell a patient to do that what does he do stalk out turn off his car phone and stay away so you went looking for him damn straight figuring dr gull would be with dr koppel doctor this doctor that youre making it sound like a medical convention he was fucking her i found them together before she grabbed for the same pillow snatched it up bounced it on a bony knee bastard and bitch didnt even try to be subtle we live four blocks apart i mean rent a room for gods sake dont soil your own nest you found them at her house you bet when a month ago this is after franco promised hed finally deal with his problem being a pussy hound hearing her own words repeated seemed to shock her she said uh yes hes always been its always been difficult ive been more patient than mother teresa they should canonize me and then i find him with her that was too much she wasnt even attractive now were talking another level of shoving it in my face howd you find them said milo oh youre going to love this said patty gull this is great franco gave me the old bs about working late then he had his answering service call me just before nine to let me know he was still tied up it would be even later i knew right away something was up franco doesnt see emergency patients most of what he does is handhold bored beverly hills bitches so i decided to drive over to the office and confront him enough is enough right so i tell maria to watch the kids and i start driving to the office and something i still dont know what it was makes me take mcconnell cause its north its basically on the way and i pass her house and theres his car parked in front parked right in front is that gall or what pretty blatant i parked ran up those stairs all the way to her backyard and there they were in the back room shes got this bigscreen tv and on it was a porn video and apparently the bitch and the bastard were feeling playful decided to imitate whatever filth they were watching wow said milo wow indeed they didnt even bother to lock the door and i just walked in walked right past them and they were so into what they were doing that they didnt even hear me it wasnt until i switched off the tv that they opened their eyes she closed her own remembering that was delicious she said the expressions on their faces the way they looked at me shock said milo beyond shock patty gull smiled it was like someone from another planet another galaxy had landed a ufo in that room and i just stood there let them know with my stare that they were busted scum and there was nothing they could do to change that then i walked out and drove back home twenty minutes later franco showed up looking like he had cancer i bolted the door and didnt let him in and told him if he tried to trespass id call the police he left i knew he would he always leaves i didnt see him until the next day he went to work and was a good little psychologist and came home and tried to talk to me using his psychologist voice the only reason i let him in was by that time id spoken to my friend the lawyer and shed slowed me down she advised you not to file i was ready to do it i really was but she said life would get really complicated faster than i could imagine so i allowed the bastard to come home but hes not allowed to touch me and i dont talk to him unless the kids are present milo said that was a month ago between then and the night dr koppel was killed have you driven past her house all the time how often every other day said patty gull at least sometimes every day its on my way to go shopping whatever so why not i figure if i do serve franco i might as well pile up the evidence my friend says even with nofault divorce the more you can get the better have you seen his car there since no she said unfortunately maybe theyre doing it in the office or at some motel she clenched her eyes shut milo said you do think they continued their affair after you discovered them her eyes flipped open thats what franco does fucks and fucks and fucks hes sick how many other women has he no said patty gull i dont want to go there some things are private were any of them his patients said milo i dont know about that francos business was his domain that was the deal the deal the marriage deal i gave up my career and my entire life for him and had kids and he went out and provided he provide pretty well she waved a languid hand around the dark floral room he did okay nice place i conceived it myself im thinking of going back and studying decorating mrs gull in terms of the other women i said i dont want to go there okay whats the difference i dont know if he fucked his patients i do know he fucked her but he didnt kill the bitch i told you he wasnt there that night and he doesnt have the guts where was he that night some hotel i forget ask him which one how do you know he was there because he called me and left his room number and i called him back and he was there the place on beverly and pico used to be a ramada i dont know what it is now whatd you guys talk about nothing pretty she said now please leave i have things to do dont be offended by this question maam but where were you i didnt kill the bitch either guns scare me ive never even touched one thats one thing franco and i have in common were for outlawing guns just despise what guns have done to our country besides that night franco wasnt there with her so why would i bother paying the bitch a visit you had reason to resent dr koppel why not have a chat at that hour you were out driving at that hour five minutes back and forth said patty gull just to see i looked for his benz didnt see it drove back home took an ambien and slept like a baby milo said nothing detective if resentment was enough of a motive id be killing tons of women not just her she laughed this time with genuine glee id be one of those serial killers out came the picture of the dead girl know her maam patty gulls bravado crumbled her mouth opened and her jaw shook is she she is isnt she yes do you know her no no of course not is she one of francos did he right now we dont know who she is so why are you showing it to me take it away its horrible milo began to comply but her hand shot out and held the photo in place she looks like me not as pretty as i was at that age but pretty enough shes a pretty girl she placed the photo in her lap continued to stare she looks like me its horrible chapter we left patty gull sitting in the room shed decorated outside milo said scary lady am i sweating she hates her husband but is sure he didnt kill koppel provides what she thinks is an alibi but her not seeing gulls car at koppels the night of the murder says nothing its a twocar garage he couldve moved his inside especially after being caught once or he made sure to park several blocks away a third possibility is he checked into the hotel and took a cab hell he said he couldve walked its a mile and a half we headed for the car if he did call a taxi i can find out gull interests you the way he does me hes smart enough to cover his tracks the way our boys been doing and even if pattys exaggerating his record with women is interesting also he and gavin didnt get along what if it was more than poor therapeutic rapport what if gavin learned something that made him a threat to gull sleeping with a patient he said somehow gavin finds out about it hanging around the office being obsessive he talked about uncovering scandal now he found one but then why would gull kill koppel they were lovers maybe her indiscretions didnt extend to murder she figured out what had happened to gavin and threatened to turn gull in or the affair was no longer useful to gull or both youre talking about one cold guy not that cold i said he sweats easily im talking about a guy who experiences anxiety but still loves taking risks someone who sleeps with another woman four blocks from his house gets busted and possibly goes back for more mary lou threatening to turn him in she sure wasnt forthcoming when i spoke to her then again maybe gull hadnt broken it off with her yet if he did it a few days later hed have two scorned women to deal with what do you think about pattys seeing a resemblance in the dead girl it didnt strike me i said i saw it as patty having ego problems but maybe shes onto something gull murdering the old lady symbolically right from the beginning you saw this as a symbolic deal if gulls our guy it could also tie in with flora newsome she was mary lou koppels patient so gull would have had opportunity to see her combine floras feelings of sexual inadequacy gulls view of himself as a cocksman and the prestige of his position and youve got fertile ground for an easy seduction gull does her then kills her his lovers patient talk about taking risks by the time flora was killed she was dating brian van dyne maybe dr gull doesnt take well to rejection by a patient or a lover evil shrink he said all that sweating someone that calculating youd think he could keep it under control its one thing to be cool when youre calling the shots be it seduction or murder i said setting up the scene choreographing dominating because youve picked submissive partners being investigated by the police changes all that all of a sudden hes placed in the onedown position my charm intimidates him something like that so the best bet is come on strong with the bastard bulldoze over him you got it i said method acting the curtain rises he said lets boogie we drove to franco gulls office building parked in an empty slot next to gulls mercedes and headed for the rear door a janitor was vacuuming the groundfloor carpeting all six doors to the charitable planning suite were closed and the corridor smelled of inactivity and that same popcorn fragrance that same feeling of disuse and i said so to milo milo hadnt taken his eye off the janitor now he went over to the guy skinny guy midthirties with the burnished skin of the harddrinking homeless a threeday stubble lank brown hair scaredrabbit eyes he wore a uc berkeley sweatshirt over baggy gray sweatpants and filthy sneakers his fingernails were black at the edges he kept his head down and pushed the vacuum cleaner trying to pretend a big hefty detective wasnt heading his way milo moved in that surprising quick way he can muster bending and flicking off the machine when he straightened hed pushed closer and his smile was all the man could see hey no answer quiet afternoon down here on the ground floor the man licked his lips very scared rabbit yeah he finally said whats charitable planning all about beats me the man had a whiny congested voice the kind that makes everything sound evasive his shoulders rose and fell rose again and remained bunched up tight around his scrawny neck broken blood vessels explored his nose and cheeks his lips were cracked and dry and tattoos snaked their way up his wrist milo glanced at them and the man tried to slide his hand back into his sleeve uc berkeley huh the man didnt answer alma mater headshake work here long a while how longs a while ah mebbe a month two maybe i do a bunch of buildings for the owner mr koppel yeah ever see anyone actually work at charitable planning ah ah that a tough question said milo required you to think i ah i want to answer right truthful or right truthful milo took hold of the mans right wrist slid the sleeve of the sweatshirt up a scrawny forearm grimy skin was specked with discs of scar tissue most of it concentrated in the crook the tattoos were blueblack sparked with intermittent red blotches clearly homemade poorly rendered naked women with oversized breasts a dulleyed snake with dripping fangs milo said get these at uc berkeley nope whats your real alma mater san quentin or chico the man licked his lips again neither whered you do your time mostly county county here here around so youre a shortterm guy yeah whats your specialty drugs but im clean meaning burglary and shoplifting and larceny the man placed one hand on the stalk of the vacuum cleaner never any larceny any assaults or other bad stuff said milo you know im gonna find out one time said the man i did a battery thing but the other guy started it and they paroled me early weapon of choice it was his knife i took it away from him it was an accident mostly mostly said milo you cut him bad he lived how about you show me some id i do something wrong perish the thought amigo just being thorough you know why were here right the man shrugged whyre we here amigo what happened to the lady doc upstairs you dont know her name dr koppel said the man the exwife they got along good loveydovey said milo no i uh mr koppel always said just give her what she wants what she wants if theres a problem in the building he said we should fix it fast give her what she wants he doesnt do that for all his tenants the man was silent so youre trying to tell me not to suspect mr koppel for killing his ex because they were still buddies no i uh i dont know nothing about nothing the man rolled his sweatshirt sleeve down his arm any ideas about who did kill dr koppel didnt know her didnt hardly never see her except to fix things for her no protested the man i dont do that stuff i call the plumbers whatever and they fix it im just here to clean mostly i do mr koppels buildings in the valley but today youre on this side of the hill i go where they tell me they mr koppels company they got properties all over who told you to come here today mr koppels secretary one of them heather i can give you the number you can check it out maybe i will said milo now how about some id the man fished in a front pant pocket and fished out a wad of bills secured by a rubber band he slipped off the band thumbed through the money grubby singles and fives and drew out a california identification card roland nelson kristof said milo this your current address roland yeah milo scanned the card sixth street this is right past alvarado right yeah lots of halfway houses there that your situation yeah so you still paroling yeah howd you get the job with mr koppel my po got it for me whos that mr hacker downtown office yeah milo gave him back his id im going to run you through roland because a halfwayhouse guy working a building where someone got murdered is something i need to check out i find out you lied to me i pay a visit to your crib and you know im gonna discover something that busts your parole you know i am so if theres something you wanna tell me nows the time theres nothing said kristof you never had problems with women no bad behavior in that department never said kristof until then his delivery had been flat mechanical now a hint of outrage had crept in never said milo never not once i been a junkie since i was fourteen i dont hurt no one still on the junk though im getting older its getting better what is the hunger said kristof days are getting shorter hows your sex life roland aint got none kristofs declaration was free of regret almost cheerful you sound happy about that yeah i am said kristof you know what dope does to all that no drive said milo zactly kristof smiled wearily flashing intermittent brown teeth something else not to worry about milo copied down his address and allowed him to resume vacuuming as we climbed the stairs to pacificawest psychological services and the roar of the vacuum cleaner faded he said thats one habitual con i said criminal burnout get to a certain age and its too pooped to pop wanna guess how old he is fifty thirtyeight no one sat in the waiting room dr larsens session light was off dr gulls shone red its threeforty i said if he does the fortyfiveminute hour hell be out shortly i love your profession said milo imagine if surgeons could do that cutting out threequarters of the appendix and billing hey i said we use the time to chart and to reflect or if youre dr gull to put back all the stuff you swept off your desk when you decided to reflectively hump your patient all over it cynical thank you at threefortysix the door to the waiting room opened and a flushed attractive woman in her forties backed out still chattering to franco gull he was close behind her holding her by the elbow when he saw us he dropped his hand the woman sensed his tension and her cheeks pinkened i waited for gull to start sweating but he recovered his composure and ushered the woman toward the door saying next week then the woman was brunette and well padded swimming in a sea of gray cashmere she brushed at her hair favored us with a brittle smile and left gull said again now what milo said we met your wife long silence i see milo smiled gull said pattys going through a rough patch shell be fine she didnt sound fine gull smoothed back his hair why dont you come in im free for the next hour or at least fortyfive minutes of it said milo under his breath gull didnt hear hed turned and was striding toward the trio of inner offices albin larsens and mary lou koppels doors were closed gulls was open he stopped before entering my wife has got problems bet she does said milo maybe she could use some therapy chapter gulls office was twothirds the size of mary lou koppels and set up surprisingly simply no birdseye maple paneling just beige paint on the walls thin beige carpeting blurred the rooms boundaries offwhite leather couches and armchairs were loosely arranged koppel had displayed crystal eggs and indian pottery franco gulls sole nod to decoration were cheaply framed photographic prints of animals and their young i found myself sniffing for the aroma of sex smelled only a syrupy mélange of perfumes gull sprawled on a sofa and invited us to sit before our butts hit the leather he said the thing you need to know about patty is that shes dealing with some very serious issues marital infidelity said milo gulls lips produced a pained semicolon her problems go way beyond that her father was extremely abusive ah said milo ah was a running joke between us the old therapists dodge he turned his head so gull couldnt see him wink all this talk about mrs gull guess wives dont get confidentiality gulls eyes sparked a fleck of moisture appeared from under the shade of a wavy saltandpepper forelock id been right losing the power rule played havoc with his adrenals im telling you about patty because you need to put her in context meaning i shouldnt believe anything she tells me that depends on what she told you for one thing said milo she thinks you didnt kill dr koppel gull had been primed to protest he regrouped shifted position there you go even someone whos not feeling kindly toward me knows id never do anything like that i dont even own a you hate guns said milo she told us that too guns are an abomination mrs gull feels shes provided you with an alibi for the night dr koppel was killed there you go gull repeated sitting a bit straighter yeah im going strong said milo the thing is doctor what your wife considers an alibi we dont what oh come on youve got to be kidding sweat beads popped at gulls hairline why would i need an alibi dont you want to know what mrs gull told us not really theatrical sigh then fine tell me mrs gull drove by dr koppels house around am searching for your car she didnt see it she did that said gull how sad as i told you pattys got serious trust issues you blame her said milo why did you speak to patty in the first place why would you even consider something so farfetched lets get back to the alibi doctor your car not being parked on mcconnell that really doesnt mean much you couldve parked somewhere else in the neighborhood or taken a cab from the hotel you stayed at which was gull didnt answer dr gull this is my personal life detective not any longer sir why said gull why are you doing this out came milos pad which hotel sir well find out anyway oh for christs sake the crowne plaza pico and beverly drive gull nodded you stay there often why would i its close to your office for when you and the missus have a spat we dont have spats that often milos pencil tapped the pad same question doctor ive lost track of your questions do you stay there often occasionally when your wife throws you out gull flushed his hands tightened his fists were enormous my marital issues are of no concern to what im getting at said milo is do they know you at the crowne plaza i dont know those places what about them businesslike anonymous its not exactly the wayfarers inn said gull and im really not there that often how often is not that often said milo i couldnt quantify your credit card records could my this is absolutely you dont consider the hotel a home away from home being so close to the office i dont need a home i paid cash why it seemed simpler for when you bring women there gull shook his head this is ridiculous ever bring dr koppel there no no need to i guess said milo what with her living so close to the office and to your house make a stopover after work then continue on to the missus and kids gulls brow was slick and pale i dont see what your point is how far would you say it is from the office to dr koppels a mile gull rolled his shoulders closer to two think so all the way up pico to motor and then south to cheviot lets split the difference said milo mile and a half gull shook his head i really think its closer to two sounds like maybe youve clocked it doctor no said gull im just forget it this is pointless you look in pretty good shape doctor work out ive got a treadmill at home a little mile and a half walk on a cool june night wouldnt challenge you would it that never happened you never walked from the crowne plaza to dr koppels house never the night she was killed said milo where were you at the hotel did you call up for food no i had dinner before i checked in where my house before the tiff yes said gull he knuckled an eye sleeved his brow you stayed in the hotel all night said milo gull rubbed his jaw i rented a movie thatll be on record what time elevenish check i will said milo but all that proves is you pushed a button on your remote not that you stayed to watch gull stared at him this is absurd i didnt kill mary what was the title of the movie gull looked away and didnt answer doctor it was an adult film i dont remember the title i guess said milo it wouldnt help asking you to recap the plot gull managed a sickly smile milo said when did you see dr koppel last that afternoon said gull both of us were walking patients out to the waiting room and we said hi that was the last time no tryst later that evening no that was over what was mary and i who broke it off it was mutual said gull because because it was the right thing to do milo flipped his pad open scanned his notes alternatively he said if you didnt walk to her house you couldve called a cab i didnt it can be verified doctor verify to your hearts content milo slapped the pad shut gull gave a start and wiped his brow with his sleeve again doctor why did gavin quick dump you as a therapist he didnt dump me i transferred him to mary why thats confidential no its not barked milo gavin lost his privilege when someone shot him whyd he transfer away from you doctor gulls arms had gone rigid and his palms pressed against the seat cushions as if bracing himself for takeoff im not going to talk to you anymore he said not without a lawyer youre aware of how that makes you look i assert my rights and it makes me look bad if youve got nothing to hide why have concern about rights because said gull i dont want to live in a police state with all that implies he forced a smile perspiration glazed his face and his neck did you know detective that of all the professions who joined the nazi party the police were the most enthusiastic recruits really i heard it was doctors gulls smile faltered he burned some calories restoring it thats it not another word he drew a finger across his lips sure said milo rising no sweat chapter as we left gulls office he got on the phone out in the hallway milo said lawyering up i said what did it was your question about gavin transferring to koppel some deep dark secret he said something that makes him look bad i wonder how much the quicks know if they know why didnt they tell me maybe it also reflected poorly on gavin what gavin found out the guy supposed to help him with his stalking problem had outstalked him so he decided to expose him why wouldnt his parents talk about that and how does koppel figure in i dont know i said but everything seems to connect to this place ill have binchy do a loose surveillance on gull see if i can get another baby d on it too loose this aint tv unlimited gizmos and manpower ill be lucky to get two shifts a day we descended the stairs to the ground floor he said so how effective do you think my leaning on him was hes lawyering up i said and would an innocent guy do that yeah i got to him i really wanna know why gavin left him the neurologist who sent gavin to gull might know something about it specialists need to stroke their referral sources so gull would have offered some kind of explanation singh he said he whipped out his pad flipped pages leonard singh over at st johns you mind doing the doctortodoctor bit not at all also if youre still up for calling ned biondi to try to get the blondes picture in the papers go ahead he handed me a sealed envelope stamped photo do not bend heres your chance to be an anonymous source i ran a finger across my lips we reached the bottom of the stairs roland kristof and his vacuum cleaner were no longer in sight and milo gazed down the empty corridor ghost town he said charitable planning you picking up eau de scam at the very least eau de shadow corporation i said you hassled kristof what about him bugged you he gave off eau de con in waves and my nose is always sensitive to that i thought it might be more than that like what a parolee hired by koppels ex working in the building where three murder victims spent some time flora newsomes job at the parole office before koppel got killed we were surmising about an excon flora again he said and resumed walking when we got outside i said it doesnt bother you what sonny koppel hiring a junkie parolee for building maintenance the whole con connection everything bothers me when we reached the car he said in terms of flora what we were surmising about was her sleeping with a con she mighta slummed alex but i dont see her getting anywhere near a burnout like kristof so maybe kristofs not the only parolee on koppels payroll maybe koppels found himself a source of cheap labor mary lou was into prison rehab there could be some connection larsen says he gave her the idea larsen was disappointed we didnt hear him on the interview tapes everyones got an ego even shrinks especially shrinks he tried to pull the car door open i hadnt unlocked the seville his arm strained and he grunted by the time id turned the key hed wandered back toward the alley when he returned he said its time to meet mr sonny koppel something else that shoulda been done right away woman gets killed go straight for the ex its goddamned detection youre dealing with three cases that point in all directions he threw up his hands and laughed supportive therapy again reality if i wanted reality i wouldnt live in la as we drove off he sank into silence i crossed olympic and he announced hed face sheila quick alone for the toss of gavins room i dropped him at the station and returned home spike was waiting for me at the door looking forlorn that was new generally his game was nonchalance remaining in the service porch when i came home waiting me out when walk time approached feigning sleep until i lifted his limp body and set four paws on the ground hey guy he snorted shook a drizzle of saliva my way licked my hand lonely huh his head dropped but his eyes remained fixed on me one ear twitched really lonely he gazed upward and let out a low hoarse moan hey i said bending on one knee and ruffling his neck shell be home tomorrow in the old days id have added i miss her too spike snuffled and rolled over i scratched his belly how about some exercise he snapped to attention pant pant i had an old leash stored in my office closet and by the time i brought it back he was jumping and yelping and scraping at the door nice to be appreciated i said he stopped fussing his expression said dont get carried away his stubby little legs and attenuated palate could handle a half mile up the glen and back not bad for a tenyearold pooch in bulldog years he was well past retirement when we returned he was famished and parched and i filled his bowls while he ate i called the most current number i had for ned biondi ned had retired as a senior writer for the times years ago talked about moving to oregon so when i got a nolongerinservice message i wasnt surprised i tried oregon information but he wasnt listed id treated neds daughter years ago a brilliant girl with toohigh standards whod starved herself and nearly died i supposed the fact that ned hadnt bothered to leave his forwarding was encouraging the family didnt need me anymore how old would anne marie be now nearly thirty over the years ned had phoned to fill me in and i knew shed gotten married had a child was still waffling about a career the information always came from ned id never achieved much rapport with his wife whod barely spoken to me during therapy once treatment was over anne marie didnt speak to me either not even to return followup calls i mentioned it once to ned and he grew apologetic and embarassed so i dropped it a year after discharge anne marie wrote me an elegant letter of thanks on pink perfumescented stationery the tone was gracious the message clear im okay back off no way could i call her to locate ned someone at the paper would know where he was as i started to punch in the timess main number call waiting clicked in allison said hi baby hey hows your day been not bad i said yours the usual do you have a minute something wrong no no i was just yesterday when i came by alex you know i like robin weve always gotten along but when i drove up seeing you two i know what it looked like but she was just thanking me for taking spike i know her laugh was flimsy i called to tell you i know because maybe i let out a little jealous vibe i was a little bugged seeing her kissing you chastely i said on the cheek she laughed again then grew silent ally i couldnt ascertain the site she said all i saw was two people who you looked like a couple you looked comfortable with each other thats when it hit me all the history you have with her theres nothing wrong with that i just started contrasting it with it just seems as if were a ways off from that allison i know i know im being neurotic and insecure she said im allowed to do that once in a while right sure you are honey but in this case its not warranted the only reason she was there was to hand off spike period just a peck on the cheek thats it i dont want you to think ive turned into some possessive paranoid chick oh listen to me hey i said if the situation were reversed id react the same way robin has no interest in me shes happy with tim and im thrilled to be with you im your main squeeze you are okay i got my selfesteem injection she said sorry for bugging you in the middle of the day youre my girl dr gwynn i find you smooching some dude it wont be a pretty sight right you mr civilized dont test me she laughed this time with heart i cant believe i made this call the last thing i want is to be possessive her voice caught sometimes i said its nice to be possessed it is okay no more ms mawkish ive got three more patients coming and each needs to perceive me as allknowing then its over to the hospice any free time at all i wish the hospice is having a potluck dinner for all the volunteers so im eating there the only breathing time i have is right now lastminute cancellation what i should be doing is charting and returning calls not whining to you ill be over in twenty what she said im coming over i want to see you alex my next patients due in forty the drive alone will eat up i want to kiss you i said that wont take long alex i appreciate what youre trying to do but im okay you dont have to indulge my this is for me im going to be in the neighborhood anyway talking to a doctor at st johns though i hadnt made the appointment baby she said i can assure you that whatever it was that tweaked my anxiety has passed i want to see you i said dead air ally i want to see you too while driving to santa monica i got dr leonard singhs number from information found out he was on rounds would be back in an hour i told his secretary id be stopping by and hung up before she could ask why when i reached allisons office building she was waiting out on the sidewalk dressed in a skyblue cashmere cowl neck sweater and a long winecolored skirt drinking something from a cardboard cup and kicking the heel of one boot her black hair was tied back with a clip and she looked young and nervous i swung into the no parking zone in front and she got in the passenger seat the cup gave off coffee and vanilla fumes i leaned over cupped her chin in my hand kissed it she said i want lips and drew me close we connected for a long time when we broke she said i have staked my claim want a sip i dont do girlie coffee ha she has a soft sweet voice and her attempt at a growl made me smile that my darling is the primeval sound of the alpha female i eyed the cardboard cup alpha females drink that she glanced down at the beige fluid in the postfeminist age one can be simultaneously girlie and strong okay i said whats next you drag me into your cave i wish she removed the clip shook her hair loose pushed thick black strands behind one ear her skin was milk white and i touched the faint blue veins that collected at her jawline she said alpha female whom i kidding i mewl and you hurry over my professional advice is dont encourage that kind of dependent behavior alex whats your nonprofessional advice she took my hand the minutes ticked away too hurried she said does not a bad day mean youve made some progress on mary lou i told her about patty and franco gull is gull really a suspect milos looking at him pretty closely murderous shrink theres another pr coup for our profession you told me gull came across slick do you recall anything else about him she thought about it he just impressed me as really into image the way he carried himself the clothes the hair im certainly not surprised hes promiscuous he had that swagger physical confidence like someone who developed charisma early i was thinking high school jock that would fit she said if it turned out he slept with his patients i wouldnt be shocked either why not its just a feeling but you never actually heard anything to that effect never heard anything about him except that he was mary lous partner maybe that colored my judgment because of her reputation for being expensive and publicityhungry to me gull came across the same way albin larsen doesnt i said hes more of a professor apparently hes some sort of human rights advocate maybe they brought him into the group for respectability when we interviewed him and gull gull was sweating and larsen seemed to be holding his tongue as if he found gull a bit distasteful it doesnt sound as if mary lou and gull were very discreet about their affair she said so maybe larsen knew she shook her head leaving his car parked in front of her house im enough of a shrink to think accidents are pretty rare my sense is they both wanted gulls wife to find out pretty cruel i said maybe koppel saw herself as an alpha female a true alpha wouldnt need to steal someone elses man she said she glanced at the dash clock ive got five minutes shucks so what happens to the practice now that mary lous gone gull and larsen say theyll take any patients who want to continue with them and refer the rest out if even a small percentage of her patients transfer that could be quite an income boost i stared at her you see a profit motive here i agree with you theres dominance and anger at play and probably some sexual overtones but profit would a nice side benefit and if gulls your murderer it would fit what would be more intoxicating to a psychopath than eliminating someone he once possessed sexually and looting her business its basic warfare coins of color spotted her ivory cheeks robin had always been repelled by these kinds of discussions you i said are an interesting girl she said interesting but weird huh you drop by for some romance and im analyzing at warp speed before i could answer she kissed me full on the lips sat back suddenly on the other hand she said analyzing is what they sent us to school for gotta go call me soon dr leonard singh was tall and slightly stooped with nutmeg skin and clear amber eyes he wore an exquisite italian suit navy blue overlaid with a faint red windowpane check a yellow spreadcollar shirt a glistening red tie with matching pocket foulard and a jetblack turban his beard was full and gray his mustache kiplingesque he was surprised to see me in his waiting room even more surprised when i told him why i was there but no guardedness he invited me into the cramped green space that served as his hospital office three spotless white coats hung from a wooden rack a glass jar of peppermint sticks was wedged between two stacks of medical charts his medical degree was from yale his accent by way of texas dr gull he said no i dont really know him you referred gavin quick to him singh smiled and crossed his legs heres the way that happened the boy came to me through the er i was one of two neurologists on call just about to go off service but someone ive worked with asked me to do the consult jerome quick had given me a name the family doctor a golfing buddy dr silver i said thats right said singh so i saw the boy agreed to follow him did what i could given the situation closedhead injury nothing obvious on the cat scan singh nodded and reached for the candy jar care for some lateafternoon sucrose no thanks suit yourself theyre good he pulled out a peppermint stick bit off a section crunched chewed slowly cases like that youre almost hoping for something blatant on the cat youre dont actually want to see tissue damage because those situations are usually more severe its just you want to know what the insult to the brain is want to have something to tell the family gavins situation was ambiguous i said the problem with a case like gavins is you just know hes going to have problems but you cant tell the family exactly whats going to happen or if its going to be permanent when i found out hed been murdered i thought oh my theres a tragedy i called and left a message with his folks but no ones returned it theyre pretty torn up any thoughts about the murder thoughts as in who mighta done it no gavins symptoms had persisted for ten months i said not a good sign said singh on top of that all his symptoms were behavioral psychiatric stuff we cellular types prefer something concrete a nice solid ataxia something edematous that we can shrink down and feel heroic about once we veer off into your field we start to feel at loose ends he took another bite of peppermint stick i did what i could for the boy which consisted of monitoring him to make sure i wasnt missing something then i prescribed a little occupational therapy he had fine motor problems nope said singh this was more supportive in nature we knew hed experienced some cognitive loss and personality change i thought some sort of psychological support was called for but when i suggested a psych consult to the parents they didnt want to hear about it neither did gavin so i backed off and offered ot figuring maybe that would be more palatable to them it was but unfortunately you know about gavins experiences with his therapist beth gallegos nice gal he tormented her have you seen that before in chi cases you can certainly have obsessive changes but no i cant say ive seen anyone turn into a stalker singh nibbled the broken edge of the peppermint stick so the family was resistant to psychotherapy i said highly resistant singh smiled sadly i got the impression this was a family big on appearances dr silver said so too though he didnt know them well really i said i got the impression he was a family friend barry no not at all barrys an obgyn hed only recently started treating the mother for premenopausal symptoms jerome quick had lied about silver being a golfing buddy a small lie but why i said so what was your connection to dr gull i dont have one said singh after gavin got into trouble because of what he did to beth the father called me saying the boy had been arrested and that the court down in santa ana was going to lock him up unless they could show sort of mitigating circumstances what he wanted from me was a letter stating that the boys behavior was a clear result of his accident if that wasnt enough he wanted me to testify for gavin singh finished the peppermint stick i have to tell you i was of two minds on that i hate going to court i didnt know that i could say all that and be truthful beth gallegos was one of our best ots a really super gal and i felt terrible about what happened to her i had to wonder if letting gavin off the hook completely was the best thing for anyone the boy clearly had serious problems so maybe he needed to learn a lesson on the other hand this was jail we were talking about and he had experienced a cerebral insult and he was my patient i decided to call the district attorney who was prosecuting the case and she told me it being a first offense they werent gonna throw the book at him she said if i referred him to a psychiatrist or a psychologist that would work for her i asked a couple of the psych guys who attend here but they all felt it would be a conflict of interest because they knew beth before i could make more calls mr quick phoned me and said hed found a good psychologist right there in beverly hills real close to the house he said that was important because he didnt want gavin going too far afield mr quick asked to be referred to dr gull i said he asked to be referred to dr koppel but she punted and sent him to dr gull i had my secretary call up and check dr gulls credentials and everything was in order i called dr gull and he seemed like a nice fellow so i wrote the letter he smoothed his tie the amber eyes were sharp so tell me was there some problem with that cause my names on that referral letter and if there are going to be problems id sure like to know i cant think of anything that would reflect on you singh said that sounds upsettingly vague im sorry i said but its too soon to be more specific ill be sure to let you know if that changes singh touched his turban much obliged were you aware that gavin didnt stick with gull really said singh no one told you the only communication i got was from gull a week in he called thanked me said everything was going fine never heard from him again what happened gavin didnt get along with gull and was transferred to dr koppel guess she found time for him poor gavin whatever he did to beth the boy had it rough well if theres nothing else ive got a ton of paperwork he walked me out i thanked him for his time and said dallas houston born and bred my daddy was a heart transplant surgeon on denton cooleys team he smiled cowboys and indians and all that good stuff chapter i got home just after five tried the times human resources office found out it was closed i tried to recall the names of colleagues ned biondi had mentioned and came up with one don zeltin like ned once a reporter now a columnist i phoned the papers switchboard asked for him got patched through zeltin said a gruff voice i started to explain who i was and that i wanted to get in touch with ned sounds complicated said zeltin you could be some nut i could be but im not if you dont mind calling ned maybe ned didnt leave you a number because he doesnt want to hear from you would calling him and asking be a huge imposition its important psychologist huh my exwife decided she was going to be a psychologist back when she was still my wife ive got three friends in the same boat wife talks about going back to shrink school get on the horn to your divorce lawyer i laughed he said its not funny actually it is she ended up dropping out and now she lives in vegas and sells clothes at a crappy boutique okay what the hell ill call ned give me your name again i looked up franco gull in my american psychological association directory hed gone to college at the university of kansas lawrence double major psychology and business his move to berkeley for grad school had been delayed by two years playing semipro baseball at a farm club in fresno not the kind of thing generally listed in the apa book gull had been proud of his athletic stint charismatic at a young age sure about his physicality gull had no academic appointments had conducted no research since grad school that he cared to specify his areas of interest were interpersonal relations and insightoriented therapy from what i could tell hed gone straight from a postdoc at uc riverside into private practice with mary lou koppel while i had the book in front of me i checked out albin larsen his bio was considerably longer and more impressive undergraduate work at stockholm university followed by a oneyear fellowship in public policy at cambridge back to sweden for a doctorate at göteborg university and an assistant professorship in the social sciences institute at that same institution his areas of interest were cultural factors in psychological assessment the integration of social and clinical psychology the application of psychological research to conflict resolution and the appraisal and treatment of warrelated trauma and stress hed done relief work in rwanda and kenya consulted to amnesty international doctors without borders the human rights beacon symposium world focus on prisoners rights and a child welfare subcommittee of the united nations though hed lived in the us for eight years and had earned a california license shortly after arriving hed maintained an academic appointment at göteborg substantive fellow would koppel and gulls shenanigans have offended him i got on the computer logged on to the california board of psychology website and checked the list of disciplinary actions nothing on gull or larsen whatever gulls transgressions had been theyd remained private which might very well be the point had gavin learned something that made him a threat to gull was the secret something to do with the quick family why had jerome quick lied about barry silver being a golfing buddy why hadnt he told us that he himself had spearheaded the referral did quick have some kind of prior relationship with koppel or gull some specific reason he wanted gavin under the groups care if so he wasnt saying and now gavin was dead and so was his therapist i turned it over a couple of times produced nothing but a headache broke for a cup of coffee found the machine empty and was loading it when ned biondi called doc he said sorry for not keeping in touch but i just moved and the boxes arent even unpacked oregon the other direction got myself a great little apartment on coronado island dinky little place because everythings so expensive but what do i need one guy i said its pretty out there got a view of the bay the bridge norma and i got divorced to be accurate i divorced her last year sorry to hear about it dont be i shouldve done it years ago shes a mean woman terrible mother you remember how she wouldnt give you the time of day wouldnt participate in anne maries treatment i do ice queen he spit as far as im concerned she was a big part of anne maries problem i shouldve recognized it sooner you probably saw it but you couldnt come out and say that right go divorce your wife ned youd have said that id have fired you but youd have been right hows anne marie mostly good he said not always great she has her moods but most of the time good that husband of hers is okay and they just had a third kid careerwise she never got it together but she says she loves being a mom and why shouldnt i believe her shes a terrific mom the kids love her bob loves her do you know what made me realize i needed to divorce norma what i decided to quit smoking finally got serious about it so what does norma do tries to talk me out of it im talking a pitched battle she didnt want to quit because smoking was something we did together cigarettes and coffee in the morning reading the paper taking walks and puffing away like the cancer fiends we were she actually accused me of abandoning her by wanting to quit i stuck to my guns and she went ballistic so i sat back and thought dummy she doesnt care if you get sick or die she just wants what she wants its all about her thirtyfive years too late but what the hell im here and she moved to new york to write a novel and im wearing the patch and have worked myself down to seven winstons a day congratulations thanks so what can i do for you i told him about the photo of the blond girl he said ill make a call but im sorry to say i cant promise you doc the papers not about public service if it ever was its about peddling ad space and that means going for the hook from what youre telling me theres no juicy angle to this one a double killing i said two kids up on mulholland unfortunately las more of a company town than it ever was and juice means a hollywood tiein give me a klepto starlet boosting scanties on rodeo and ill guarantee you lots of print inches two kids on mulholland is tragic but it aint man bites dog how about this for a hook the police didnt want to release the photo because it was too early in the investigation but an anonymous source supplied it to the times hmm he said maybe the editors will go for that theyve got a reflexive dislike of authority anytime they can show theyre not in lockstep with lapd it makes them feel the muckrackers they wish they were okay ill try by the way is it true lapd communications didnt want to release it because they thought it lacked a hook he laughed everyones in showbiz ill call and get back to you anything more you can tell me about this girl nothing i said thats the problem ill see what i can do doc good talking to you as long as ive got you let me ask you something do you believe that study that came out said guys do better married than single depends on the guy i said and the marriage exactly he said you hit it on the head soon after i hung up milo called and i told him biondi would try to get the photo in thanks some of the prints came in from koppels house and sure enough gulls are all over the place along with a bunch of others we cant identify one we could tag was some guy who showed up in the system because of an assault record turns out he works for a heating and airconditioning company did a service call a month ago his latents were on the furnace and nowhere else so that fits the assault was punching a guy in a bar like roy nichols i said lots of anger out there if people only knew who they let into their homes do gulls prints mean much i said given his relationship with koppel thats what hed say what his lawyer would say he hired a bh mouthpiece by the way dont know him but one of the guys here does not highpowered more like mediumpowered meaning gulls not that scared hes scared enough to lawyer up he said maybe he doesnt know better or couldnt afford better hes got his baby benz and his vette but hes not really rich right even with a hefty fee you guys are limited by the hours you work interesting you should bring that up i said i told him what allison had said about profit motive kill koppel and steal her patients smart girl allison id sure like to get into gulls finances but cant see a way to do it yet howd it go with gavins room it didnt he said no one home ill try tomorrow i spoke to dr singh i recapped the interview jerry quick lied he said what was the point of that good question its time to pay mom and dad a closer look meanwhile ive been trying to arrange an appointment with mr edward koppel but i cant get past his receptionist the old tycoon shuffle i said seems to be i figure the best things to drop in tomorrow morning early say eightthirty maybe catch him before his day gets too tycoonish you up for that want me to drive what do you think he came by the next morning just before eight marched into my kitchen drank coffee and ate two bagels standing at the counter and said ready i drove over the glen into the valley then east across sepulveda into the heart of encino this was boomtown valley highrises shining like chrome in the morning sun traffic jams worthy of downtown the flavors of money and boosterism comingling easily but edward koppels office was located in a straggler from an earlier age a shopworn twostory stucco box on ventura just past balboa stuck between a usedcar lot crammed with secondhand jaguars ferraris and rollses and a storefront mideastern restaurant behind the building was a small outdoor parking lot accessible through an alley with most of the spaces marked reserved entrance was through a glass door identical setup to the building that housed mary lou koppels group and i said so milo said here i was thinking some bigtime executive suite setup maybe koppel specializes in small buildings he can rent out easily why dont you park at the far end over there he directed me to a spot where we could observe every vehicle that arrived over the next half hour four vehicles did two compacts driven by young women a bottled water delivery truck and a faded green tenyearold buick that disgorged a sloppylooking heavyset man wearing wrinkled pants and an oversized brown polo shirt he carried a brown paper bag and looked halfasleep as he stumbled up the stairs ten more minutes brought two more toyotas bearing secretarial types soon after the heavy man exited and drove off minus his sack what was that i said a literal bagman milo frowned read the face of his timex didnt answer half an hour after wed arrived we were still sitting there milo seemed fine eyes alive under halfclosed hooded lids but i was getting itchy i said looks like mr k keeps tycoons hours lets pay his office a visit the ground floor of the building was divided into three offices landmark realty sk development and koppel enterprises above were a travel agency a general contractor and a secretarial service milo tried the doorknob to koppel enterprises and landmark realty found them locked but sk development was open for business we walked into a large bright open area sectioned into cubicles by waisthigh partitions all four of the young women wed seen in the parking lot sat at computers typing briskly three wore headsets at the rear was a door marked private milo strode past the secretarial pool and tried it also locked the sole typist without a headset got up and walked over to him midtwenties pleasantly plain she had short dark hair freckles and an easy smile wore a tan cottonpoly pantsuit can i help you were looking for mr koppel sonny she said you just missed him whats he look like she glanced around moved in close cupped her hand over her mouth kind of chubby he was wearing a brown polo drives an old buick thats him are you guys the police or something milo showed her the badge wow your name maam cheryl bogard she looked back at the other women they continued typing they taking dictation on those headsets said milo oh no said bogard theyre listening to music sonny has multiple cd tracks set up so they can listen to what they want good boss the best so cheryl bogard what do you guys do here help take care of sonnys properties so how come you guys are here did one of the buildings get broken into does that happen often you know how it is she said with as many properties as sonny owns somethings always happening somewhere real estate empire said milo hes got a lot of stuff adding happily keeps all of us busy so where was the breakin this time not important said milo so that was the boss he didnt stay long he just picked up some papers she smiled not what you were expecting huh milo shook his head you know what they say officer appearances can be deceiving whens he coming back hard to say hes out on the road a lot hes got properties in four counties so that means lots of traveling we kid him say he should get himself a nice car he can sure afford it but he loves his buick showing off isnt sonnys thing lowkey hes a real nice guy could you call him for us sorry she said sonny doesnt use a cell phone in the car hes kind of oldfashioned says he doesnt like being disturbed when hes thinking and also its not safe talking and driving safetyconscious said milo hes a pretty careful guy is there any message youd like me to give him about which building had the breakin thanks but it would be better if we spoke directly okay said bogard ill tell him you were here no idea at all when hell be back if i had to guess id say late afternoon if he comes back at all you never know with sonny milo gave her a card and said in case we dont catch him today please have him call sure cheryl bogard returned to her cubicle placed the card in front of her looked up and waved milo started to leave then changed his mind went over to her said something listened to her reply as we stepped out into the hall i said what did you ask her what was in the bag he rubbed the side of his nose tootsie rolls m ms almond joy ol sonny brings candy for the girls she said they were all watching their weight ate very little of it he finishes off whats left chapter a block up from sonny koppels corporate headquarters was a coffee shop with a fortiesera starship poised for takeoff atop an aqua metal roof milo and i sat at the empty counter sucked in the aroma of eggs crackling in grease and ordered coffee from a waitress old enough to be our mother he cellphoned dmv the address on edward albert koppels drivers license was the building wed just visited hed registered four cars the buick a fiveyearold cutlass a sevenyearold chevy and an elevenyearold dodge buys american i said you saw him he said you figure mary lou would go for a guy like that they were married years ago when he was in law school i said maybe he looked different the candy man his secretary sure seemed wholesome he gulped down his coffee drummed his fingers on the counter kindly boss noble patriot allaround unpretentious guy if it seems too good to be true it probably is right ready to go where to youre going home and im back to the quicks for that toss of gavins room did you have a chance to check the psych licensing board on franco gull clean i said that so well maybe gavin didnt think so and look what happened to him it was two days before i heard from him again ned biondi hadnt called and my thoughts had drifted away from murders robin came by and picked up spike despite the two days of bonding he reverted to instant disdain for me at the sight of her ford pickup running to robin as she crouched in the driveway leaping into her arms making her laugh she thanked me for babysitting and handed me a small blue gift box not necessary i appreciate the help alex how was aspen meanlooking men with bubble blond arm candy lots of dead animal pelts the most beautiful mountains ive ever seen she played with an earring spike sat obediently at her feet anyway she said when she moved in to kiss my cheek i pretended not to notice and pivoted in a way that made me unavailable i heard the truck door close robin was at the wheel looking puzzled as she started up the engine i waved she returned the wave hesitantly spike began licking her face and she drove away i opened the blue box sterling cuff links shaped like tiny guitars when milo finally called i was getting out of the shower mr and mrs quick appear to have taken a vacation the house is locked up tight her vans there but his car isnt and a neighbor said she saw them loading suitcases taking some time off i said i need to get into that room i called the sister paxton but she hasnt gotten back to me yet onward to mr sonny koppel he may drive old cars and dress like a slob but its not due to poverty guy has title to over two hundred parcels of real estate commercial and residential rentals four counties just like his girl said definitely a tycoon i said hes also got all sorts of holding companies and limited corporations as shields its taken me this long to winnow through the basics this guys bigtime alex and from what i can tell he likes to partner with the government federal federal state county a lot of his holdings seem to be cofinanced by public funds were talking lowcost housing projects senior citizen residences landmark buildings assisted care and guess what halfway houses for parolees including the one on sixth street where roland kristof crashes the state legislature says we have to pay for the board and care of felonious individuals and koppels cleaning up publicspirited i said its a great arrangement find some building or construction project thats eligible for bond money or a grant split your costs with john q take all the income in terms of koppels background all i can find is that he did his undergrad work and law school at the u but he never practiced and i cant locate any record of his taking the bar somehow he got bankrolled and built up an empire is the office building where pacifica practices a government deal doesnt seem to be he said but not because its in beverly hoohah koppel owns two bh properties a senior residence hotel on crescent drive and a shopping center on la cienega that were financed with tax bucks the hotel qualifies for an hud gift and the strip mall got a fema grant because the stores that stood there before were earthquakedamaged he knows how to work the system i said he works it well the only time his name appears on court documents is when he sues someone or someone sues him mostly the former backrent and eviction cases once in a while he gets tagged with a slipandfall by a tenant sometimes he settles sometimes he fights when he fights he wins he distributes his business among eight different law firms all downtown all whiteshoe but get this he doesnt even live in a house let alone a mansion his primary residence and it was hard to find is an apartment on maple drive in beverly hills which sounds nice but its not one of the fancy condos just an old building kind of shabby six units one of koppels limited partnerships owns the place and koppel lives in a twobedroom at the back the manager doesnt even know her tenants really her boss because she referred to koppel as the heavy guy real quiet and said the owners were some persians who lived in brentwood on several of his rentals koppel hires a couple named fahrizad to serve as his front elusive fellow i said lets challenge that sonny koppels stretch of maple drive lay between beverly boulevard and civic center drive mixeduse neighborhood the west side filled by a graniteclad behemoth that served as mercedes benz headquarters a highprofile extravagantly landscaped office complex that catered to entertainment lawyers and film agents and construction dust from a fulminating highrise across the street were twostory apartment buildings souvenirs of the postwar building boom koppels was one of the dingiest examples an offgray traditional with a cheap composite roof three upstairs units three down a scratchy lawn struggling shrubs koppels buick was parked in back squeezed into one of the half dozen slots in the open carport we cruised and found each of koppels other cars parked within two blocks each with beverly hills street parking permits that were uptodate an olds a chevy a dodge gray gray dark green lots of dust on the first two the dodge had been washed recently i idled the seville as milo got out and examined each vehicle empty i parked and we headed for koppels building sonny koppel answered the door palming popcorn out of a chartreuse plastic bowl the fragrance brought to mind the theaterlobby smell of pacificas building before milo had his badge out koppel nodded as if hed been expecting us and beckoned us in he wore a royal blue u sweatshirt over plaid pajama bottoms and fuzzy brown slippers fiveeight at least with a melon gut and thinning reddish brown hair that frizzed above a high glossy pate he hadnt shaved in a couple of days and his stubble looked like dandruff saggy blue eyes pendulous lips short thick limbs beefy hands with stubby nails behind him an old nineteeninch rca tv blared financial news from a cable station koppel lowered the volume my girls told me you were by he said in a sleepy basso its about mary right i was wondering if youd get in touch here sit sit he stopped to study a stock quotation on the tube switched off the set cleared a massive pile of newspapers off a plaid sofa and brought them over to a metallegged dinette table four red vinyl chairs ringed the table hardback ledgers filled two of them half the table surface was taken up by more ledgers and legal pads pens pencils a hand calculator cans of diet up snack bags of assorted carbohydrates the apartment was basic white walls low ceilings a front space that served as the living roomeating area a kitchenette the bathroom and bedrooms beyond a stucco arch nothing on the walls the kitchen was cluttered but clean a few feet from the counter a pc setup was perched on a rolling cart aquarium screen saver an air conditioner rattled sonny koppel said can i offer you guys something to drink no thanks you sure positive koppels soft bulky shoulders rose and fell he sighed sank into a green tweed lazboy recliner kept the chair upright milo and i took the plaid sofa so said koppel what can i do for you first off said milo is there anything you can tell us about your exwife that could help us solve her murder i wish there was mary was a remarkable person attractive really smart koppel ran a hand over his scalp instead of settling his hair picked up static and coiled as if alive the room was dim and he was backlit with fluorescence from the kitchen and the hair became a halo sadlooking pajamabottomed guy with an aura youre thinking he said how did someone like her ever hook up with someone like me his lips curled like miniature beef roulades approximating amusement when mary and i met i didnt look like this back then i was more shortstop than sumo actually i was a pretty decent jock got a baseball scholarship to the u had major league fantasies he paused as if inviting comment when none followed he said then i ripped a hamstring and found out i had to actually study to get out of there one hand dipped into the popcorn bowl koppel gathered a full scoop and transferred the kernels to his mouth milo said you met dr koppel when you were in law school i was in law school and she was in grad school we met at the rec center she was swimming and i was reading i tried to pick her up but she blew me off he touched his abdomen as if it ached the second time i tried she agreed to go out for coffee and we hit it off great we got married a year later and divorced two years after that problems said milo everyones got them said koppel whats the cliché we grew apart part of the problem was time between her dissertation and my classes we never saw each other the main problem was i screwed up had an affair with a woman in my class to make it worse a married woman so two families got messed up mary let me down easy she just wanted a clean break stupidest thing i ever did cheating on her letting her go then again she probably would have broken it off even if i had been faithful whys that i was kind of at loose ends back then said koppel no goals only reason i went to law school was because i didnt know what else to do mary was just the opposite focused puttogether she has he wincedhad a powerful persona charisma i couldnt have kept up sounds like youre selling yourself short said milo koppel looked genuinely surprised no i dont think so ive done some background on you sir and youre one of the biggest landlords in southern california koppel waved a thick hand thats just playing monopoly youve played well ive been lucky koppel smiled i was lucky to be a loser a loser i nearly flunked out of law school then i chickened out of taking the bar started experiencing anxiety attacks about taking it that put me in the er a couple of times one of those pseudoheart attack things by then mary and i were having our problems but she helped me through it deepbreathing exercises having me imagine relaxing scenes it worked and the attacks stopped and mary expected me to take the bar i showed up early looked around the room walked out and that was it that bothered mary more than my cheating on her soon after she filed koppels hand waved again this time limply couple months after that my mother died and left me an apartment building in the valley so all of a sudden i was a landlord a year later i sold that property used the profit and a bank loan to invest in a bigger building i did that for a few years flipping and trading up real estate was booming and i made out okay he shrugged ate more popcorn milo said youre a modest man mr koppel i know what i am and what im not koppel turned his head to the side as if recoiling from insight his jowls quivered do you have any idea who murdered mary no sir do you me no of course not she was murdered in her home said milo no signs of forced entry youre saying someone she knew said koppel any candidates sir i wasnt privy to marys social life how much contact did you and she have we stayed friendly and i kept up my spousal support how much support it evolved said koppel immediately after the divorce she got nothing except the furniture in our apartment because we were both starving students when i started to earn a decent income she called and asked for support we agreed on a figure and over the years ive increased it at her request sometimes other times i decided to share some of my good luck keep the ex happy said milo koppel didnt answer sir how much were you paying her at the time of her death twentyfive thousand a month generous it seemed fair said koppel she stuck with me when i needed her helping through those panic attacks even after i cheated on her that deserves something milo said twentyfive thousand a month i went through her bank records never saw any backandforth on that level you wouldnt said koppel mary lived off her practice and reinvested what i gave her in what were partnered on some of my properties she let you hold on to what you owed her and put it back in properties mary did very well partnering with me who gets her share of the partnered properties now that shes dead koppels fingers grazed the rim of the popcorn bowl that would depend on marys will i havent found a will and no executors have come forth that wouldnt surprise me said koppel for years ive been telling her to do some estate planning between her practice and the properties she was building up a comfortable estate youd think shed have listened being so organized about everything else but she was resistant my opinion is she didnt want to think about death her parents died pretty young and sometimes she had premonitions about dying young about dying before her time tears beaded koppels lower eyelashes the rest of his stubbled face was impassive she have those premonitions recently koppel said i dont know im talking back when we were married milo said assuming theres no will what happens to her real estate holdings if there are no creditors or heirs said koppel theyd revert to me a hundred percent in the case of the ones whose mortgages i carry i own a little financing company allows me to keep things inhouse those that are bankfinanced id have the choice of paying off marys share or selling one way or the other youd get everything yes i would milo crossed his legs koppel emitted a deep rumbling laugh something funny sir the implication said koppel i suppose theres a logic to it lieutenant but do the math mary lous holdings net out to id say one and a half maybe two million dollars depending on the real estate market i grant you that isnt chicken feed eventually she couldve retired nicely but to me a sum like that isnt significant you say youve looked into my holdings two millions a drop in the bucket said milo that sounds ostentatious said koppel but its true a couple of million wouldnt make any difference during good times said milo times are good said koppel times are always good no business problems with business there are always problems the key is to see them as challenges koppel placed the popcorn bowl between his knees what makes it easier for me is i have no interest in acquiring material goods i do real estate because it seems to be what im good at since i dont need much without the burden of stuff ive always got free cash meaning theres no such thing as a bad market prices go down i buy they go up i sell life is good said milo id like to get back into shape physically and im upset about mary but when i step back and assess yes i have a lot to be thankful for tell me about the halfway houses you own sir koppel blinked you really have been doing your research i ran into an excon vacuuming dr koppels building and i got curious oh said koppel well i hire a lot of those guys for custodial work when they show up they do a good job they give you attendance problems no worse than anyone else what about pilferage problems same answer people are people over the years ive lost a few tools some furniture but that goes with the territory your secretary said properties get broken into from time to time said koppel not the halfway houses though whats to take from there you recruit your own tenants as janitors i get recommendations from the halfwayhouse managers they send me guys they think are reliable koppel lifted the popcorn bowl howd you get into the parolee business im in the real estate business a handful of my properties are halfway houses howd you get into that sir id never have done it on my own im a bleeding heart liberal but only to a point it was marys idea actually i was pretty wary but she won me over howd she come up with the idea i think dr larsen suggested it one of her partners have you talked to him yet milo nodded hes an expert on prison reform said koppel he got mary into it and she was all afire she said she wanted to do more than build up equity she wanted her investments to do some social good the halfway houses are the properties she partners with you were also together on some conventional rentals pretty idealistic when mary believed in something she got very focused but you tried to unfocus her koppel lifted a leg in order to cross it changed his mind and planted a heavy foot on the carpet i approached the issue like a businessman lets look at the assets and debits mary did her homework showed me the subsidies the state was offering and i had to admit the figures looked good even so i was concerned about tenant damage so id look at the crowd youre talking about i also told her i could get equal or better subsidies on what seemed to be safer investments senior citizen housing historic properties where if you respected the integrity of the structure you could get three separate funding sources his eyes had dried and he was talking faster in his element milo said mary convinced you mary said the tenants would be more reliable not less because they werent paying rent so they had no incentive to leave on top of that the state mandated supervision by parole officers and provided inhouse managers and security guards she had to work on me for a while but i agreed to give it a try smartest thing i ever did good deal the fundings ironclad longterm state grants that get renewed easily and the properties can be had dirt cheap because theyre always in fringe areas youre not going to stick a building full of criminals in bel air right so there are no nimbys no zoning problems and once you get past financing the part the state doesnt cover the rents are great and listen to this on a squarefootage basis the incomes close to beverly hills because youre not talking multiroom apartments its all single rooms and as opposed to a senior citizen situation where the tenancyterminating event is death so your occupancy is uncertain you go in knowing the tenants are there on a shortterm deal but theyre always going to be replenished no shortage of bad guys doesnt seem to be said koppel and turns out there are fewer repairs the bathrooms are all communal so the plumbings centralized there are no kitchens in the rooms all the tenants get is hot plates and their use is restricted to certain hours theres some paperwork but nothing i havent seen before and lets face it the state wants you to be a success define success the residents stay put and dont roam out in the community to hurt or kill someone where do i sign said milo koppel smiled i shouldve known listening to mary would never lead me wrong he shifted his bulk in the recliner now shes gone i cant believe it is there anything else i can tell you back to the halfway houses sir great deal notwithstanding have you ever had any problems with tenant violence not to my knowledge but i wouldnt know why not all thats handled inhouse said koppel im not a warden i just own the building and the state runs it why do you think one of those lowlifes killed mary theres no evidence of that said milo just covering all bases he opened his pad whats charitable planning all about my foundation said koppel i give away ten percent a year of aftertax income weve been in the building a few times and never saw any activity on the ground floor thats because there isnt much twice a month i go in and write checks to worthy causes it takes a while because the solicitations come in constantly everything really piles up an entire groundfloor suite for you to write checks thats beverly hills space mr koppel why dont you rent it out i had a deal last year for a tenant to take the whole floor an online brokerage you know what happened to the market the deal fell through i was planning to subdivide rent most of it out and leave a small office for charitable planning but mary asked me to put a hold on that until she and larsen and gull could decide if they wanted it why would they want it to expand their practice they were talking about doing group therapy needed larger rooms the only space i use is a small office the rest is empty mary was supposed to tell me in a week or so group therapy i said from a business standpoint i thought it was a smart idea treat the max number of patients in the shortest time i joked with mary that it had sure taken her a long time to figure it out koppel smiled she said sonny youre the moneyman and im the healer lets stick to what we know he tugged the side of his mouth ate some popcorn milo showed him the picture of the dead girl koppel chewed faster swallowed hard whos that someone else who got killed someone else related to mary dont know sir youre saying what happend was part of something that it wasnt just mary milo shrugged whats really going on lieutenant thats all i can tell you sir does the name flora newsome mean anything to you koppel shook his head glanced at the photo thats her what about gavin quick i know a quick said koppel but not gavin who do you know jerry quick jerome quick hes one of my tenants whos gavin his son the one who had the accident you know about the accident jerry told me about it said his son was having some emotional problems i referred him to mary how long has mr quick been your tenant four months he frowned good tenant said milo he pays his rent but not always on a timely basis i felt a little used especially after i listened to his problems and gave him a referral ive had to pay jerry a few visits he smiled thats not what it sounds like no goons with baseball bats we just talked and eventually he paid why would i assume goons with baseball bats sir koppel flushed you wouldnt so whats with gavin hes deceased murdered also yes sir my god whats the connection to mary all we know at this time was that gavin was her patient and theyre both dead my god koppel repeated theres a lot you cant tell me is there something more you could tell us sir koppel considered that i wish there was mary and i we rarely spoke except when there was a business issue even then there was little to talk about i set up our partnership so she didnt have to be handson she had her practice she didnt need to be distracted because properties can be demanding to make them work you have to give them attention like children im on the road all the time all those cars said milo i know i know it probably seems eccentric but i need to have reliable transportation jerrys son he was young right just a kid he was twenty koppels face had turned an unhealthy color bologna left too long in the fridge you cant tell me anything the truth is we dont know much ourselves quicks son the girl you showed me flora was she a patient of marys as well the girl we showed you hasnt been identified yet so i dont know if she was one of dr koppels patients the files are confidential we cant get in there all those questions you asked me said koppel about the halfway houses are you saying you suspect one of my one of those tenants had something to do with something really horrible if you do please tell me i really need to know if you do do you think thats a possibility sir how would i have a clue koppel bellowed one of his hands moved spasmodically knocked against the popcorn bowl sent it flying yellow rain when it settled koppel was covered with kernels and husks and dust he stared at us breathing heavily milo went into the kitchen and unrolled a paper towel from a wooden spool he came back and began brushing koppel off koppel snatched the paper away and flailed at himself when he finally stopped yellow grit clung to his sweatshirt and his pajamas he sat there staring at us still panting milo said what else can you tell us about jerome quick koppel didnt answer sir im sorry for losing my temper but youre freaking me out first mary now jerry quicks son that girl milo repeated his question he didnt pay his rent on time thats it his excuse was the upanddown nature of his business he trades metals makes deals on scrap once in a while he has a windfall that carries him for a while other times he loses money to me it sounded more like gambling than business had i known i never would have rented to him he didnt tell you he came to me through a leasing agent in the past theyd been reliable said koppel its not as if his rent is prohibitive i keep all my rents reasonable want the turnover low he looked down and picked stray bits of popcorn from his pajamas dropped the first few into the bowl ate the rest his son poor jerry guess ill need to cut him some slack suddenly he stood with surprising grace brushed himself off some more sat back down what kind of emotional problems did jerry quick describe he didnt get specific at first i wasnt sure i even believed him he brought it up when we were having one of our rent discussions second months rent and hes already twenty days late i dropped by to talk about it and he gave me a sob story about how hed been cheated out of a deal lost big and now on top of it his kid was having psychological problems which he didnt specify i wasnt interested figured he was just trying to make me feel sorry for him the way the referral came about is i called his bluff said if thats the case why dont you get him some help and he said yeah i need to do that and i said my exwifes a psychologist and her office is close to your house you want her number he said sure and i gave it to him like i said i thought it was a dodge so he actually followed through milo nodded hows he been with the rent since then chronically late dr koppel never told you about the referral shed never do that said koppel confidentiality she was big on that the whole time we were married she never talked about patients thats another thing i admired about her her ethics mr koppel said milo where were you the night your exwife was murdered youre kidding no sir where was i i was here alone dont rub it in said koppel that night lets see that night i think i ran into mrs cohen the art teacher in the front unit both of us were taking out the garbage are you going to ask her if you do could you please not mention that im her landlord its a secret said milo i like to keep a low profile that way i can come home and relax and not have tenants calling me up for repairs a private home would accomplish that yeah yeah im eccentric said koppel the problem with a house is too much maintenance and my whole lifes about that also i dont need the space not a lot of stuff whats so sane about accumulating stuff so you were here all night sir like i always am unless im on the road how often are you on the road one two days a week where do you stay motels i like best western but i was home that night milo got up thank you sir youre welcome said koppel tweezing popcorn from his clothes chapter the sensitive tycoon said milo when we were back on the sidewalk you buying it i think when it comes to money hed be something to reckon with youre not going to check with mrs cohen the art teacher what to verify his alibi all she saw was him taking out the garbage five minutes out of a whole evening big deal you see him as a suspect hes landlord to a bunch of cons and he was shelling out twentyfive grand a month to koppel now that shes dead not only do the payments stop he gets all her real estate thats a hell of a lot of motive also he goes on about being an efficient businessman but keeps an entire floor of a beverly hills building vacant id love to get in there find out what charitable planning is really all about group therapy i said if sonny was really as enamored of mary as he made out i can see him holding the space vacant for her what you dont see him as a potential bad guy the way you lay it out he definitely belongs on the radar screen but what motive would he have for killing gavin and the blonde he didnt answer we headed for my car i said hows the surveillance on gull going he goes to work returns home im sure his lawyer told him to keep a clean nose the lie about gavins referral could be jerry quick wanting to hide the fact that he got mary lous name from sonny because if we interviewed sonny wed know hes a deadbeat tenant having it come from a physician makes it sound a lot more respectable i guess he said but his kid was killed youd think hed want to be forthcoming another thing i said is that sonny sent gavin directly to mary lou but gull ended up with the case anyway then it reverted to mary sonny may be involved somehow but i cant shake the notion that gavins death was connected to his treatment same for flora newsome were talking two patients and their therapist all dead all skewered he said someone they all knew or who knew them but maybe nothing to do with the treatment some con sent over by sonny to clean the building spotted them and decided to play some real psychopath whos worked the system and passed himself along as a nonviolent parolee ill ask sonny for a list of maintenance guys see who pops up meanwhile lets go over to the quick house again maybe jerry and sheila returned from wherever it was they went and i can have a go at gavins mess i took gregory drive all the way to camden as we pulled up to the quick house milo said same as before her cars here his isnt dont bother getting out this probably wont take long he sprang out of the seville trotted to the front door rang the bell tapped his foot rang again shook his head and was about to leave when the door swung halfway open i caught a glimpse of sheila quicks drawn face milo talked to her turned to me mouthed come in we were at my sisters house in westlake village she said her hair was turbaned by a blue towel and she wore a quilted beige robe patterned with butterflies and clematis vines stains on the robe her face was drawn and chalky eyes stripped of illusion you and your husband said milo jerry wanted to get away for a couple days she spoke slowly slurred worked hard at forming words id guessed tranquilizers then i smelled her breath lots of wintergreen but not enough to mask the alcohol the three of us were standing in her dining room the space felt heavy smothering where light hit the furniture it exposed a coating of dust your husband wanted to get away said milo from the stress sheila quicks lips curled in distaste i said you didnt want to go eileen she said she thinks her house is the greatest that paddle tennis court of hers as far as shes concerned why wouldnt i want to go she looked to me for confirmation i nodded jerry she said whatever jerry wants jerry gets you know what i think what i think jerry wanted to stick me there so he stuck me there and went on his merry way he didnt stay at eileens i was supposed to be happy because eileen has a pool and that paddle tennis court its not even a full tennis court its half of that she took hold of my sleeve we were going to build a pool gavin liked to swim she threw up her hands i hate chlorine it makes me itch why would i be happy just cause theres a pool i wanted jerry to bring me back finally he called and i told him to bring me back woozy smile so here i am wheres jerry i said working somewhere out of town she nodded as usul usuizul its funny what is jerry hates eileen but wanted to stick me in her house so he could godknowswhat it wasnt right she ticked her fingers talked in a singsong eileen has her house i have my house you like your privacy i said i dont like her pool it itches i dont play paddle tennis she and her husband go to work im left there with all the all the quiet what am i supposed to do all day but jerry eileen asked me last week to come over and jerry told her forget it then he changed his mind whats that all about ill tell you what its about but she didnt milo said wheres mr quick currently traveling who knows who knows where he goes hes like a bird she waved her hands byebye birdie flew the coop i stay here i never leave here this is my house jerry doesnt call he doesnt want to hear from me she squeezed my arm its in consistenant one day shes a stuckup bitch who thinks her shit is perfume unquote next day hes driving me there and going back to clean up gavins room then hes off doing his thing his thingamjig he cleaned gavins room said milo he sure did you know what i think i think that was it what was he knew id get mad if he cleaned up gavins room so he snuck around me he cleaned the room while you were at eileens it was a mess said sheila quick we have no disagreement on that no question about it being a mess a big fat mess gavin used to be neater then he had an accident she let go of my sleeve swayed held on to a chair for balance did i tell you about that i said why do you think jerry decided to clean up the mess ask him smile except you cant cause hes not here hes never here im always here the cords of her neck tightened i didnt want him to clean gavs room i wouldve gotten mad i loved the mess it was gavs mess what was the rush she buried her face in her hands and began sobbing i guided her to a sofa milo went up the stairs he came down ten minutes later id gone into the kitchen found a coffeemaker halffilled with lukewarm coffee warmed it in the microwave and brought it to sheila quick guessing on nondairy creamer and one packet of artificial sweetener dirty dishes filled the sink the counters were grimy not far from the machine was a nearly empty bottle of tanqueray gin and a tube of binaca breath spray i held the cup as she drank her mouth was still trembling and she dribbled and i wiped her chin she glanced up at me youre nice goodlooking too milo strode into the living room maam i recall a computer in gavins room yes you do where is it jerry took it said he was donating it to beverly vista school what about gavins papers he boxed everything up and took it out to the garbage garbage was picked up when tomorrow he left sheila quick said hes in a hurry i said jerry was really eager to clean gavins room eager beaver eager eager beaver i nodded he said we needed to face reality said sheila quick it mustve been me crying too much getting on his nerves crying all the time i dont do anything for him i thought she meant the attraction was gone but she went on i dont want to do anything for him he comes home from work wants his dinner maybe i open a can he says lets go out i say no why should i want to go out why should i want that i said theres nothing for you outside of this house thats right you understand to no one he understands milo returned looking grim she patted my shoulder and said he understands hes a very understanding guy said milo sheila quick said jerry cleaned up so i would face reality my fucking ducking husband doesnt get it he shouldnt have done it without asking me there were things i wanted to keep she brightened is it all out there in the alley in the garbage dumpster milo said im sorry maam your dumpsters empty bastard she said for what he did he should be it was wrong who cares where he is who the hell cares has he called he left a message last night i was sleeping i sleep a lot i erased it whats he going to tell me that he misses me i know hes with some whore when he travels hes always with whores know how i know how maam condoms she said i find condoms in his luggage he has me unpack leaves them there wants me to know sick smile doesnt bother me makes me happy his going to prostitutes sure she said better them than me we got a little more coffee in her but her voice remained thick i wondered how long it had taken her to work the gin bottle down she yawned i need to take a nap sure maam said milo just a few more questions please please she unraveled the towel turban and tossed it on the floor okay since you said please who referred you to dr koppel dr silver your obstetrician her eyes closed and her head lurched forward then froze in place im tired dr barry silver said milo your gynecologist uhhuh did dr silver give you the referral personally he gave it to jerry jerry called him jerry said he was smart can i sleep please one more thing maam gavins room was cleaned out but i noticed his clothes were still in the closet jerry was probably gonna take those too and give em away those really pretty ralph lauren shirts i bought gav for christmas gav loved to go shopping with me because jerrys so cheap we went to all the stores gap banana republic saks barneys sometimes we went on rodeo drive when they had the endofseason sales i got gav a valentino sports jacket on rodeo better than anything jerry has jerry prolly woulda given gavs clothes away but he didnt have time her hands balled into fists jerry can fuck himself if he thinks ill give up gavs clothes we helped her up the stairs and into a master bedroom turned to night by blackout drapes rumpled tissues and night shades and two small airline liquor bottles on the nightstand bourbon and scotch a quarter inch of water floated in a crystal highball glass milo tucked her in and she smiled up at him and licked chapped lips nightynight one more question maam whos your husbands accountant gene marr with an h maher said milo she started to answer gave up closed her eyes by the time we were out of the room she was snoring before we exited the house milo brought me to gavins room the same pale blue walls stripped the queen bed made up with a deep blue comforter gavins bookcase held a few softcovers and magazines and two model airplanes the carpeting was dingy the closet was filled with jackets slacks shirts coats nice wardrobe i said jerry didnt take the papers out to the garbage he made sure no one would see them milo nodded and pointed to the stairs as we drove away he said bastard knows why his son was killed and hes trying to hide it he found quicks business number in his notes phoned waited snapped the phone shut not even a machine he travels and gives bluenailed angie the secretary time off angie of the petty but very definite criminal record quicks starting to smell like something more than a grieving dad his landlord hires troubled souls and so does he i said maybe compassions contagious or sonny sent him angela paul as well sonny the fixer get you a medical referral invest your money maybe quick was into him for more than back rent his own kid and he doesnt say a word maybe its more than knowing i said what if hes implicated wouldnt that be pretty whatd you find in gavins pockets who says i found anything those questions about gavins clothing you didnt need ten minutes to flip through a few books and pockets he slapped a slow threefour beat on the dashboard with one big palm bastard took the computer should i even bother calling beverly vista school to see if he donated it without waiting for an answer he made the call hung up grinning with rage first theyve heard about it you wanna know what i think gavin found out about something dirty going on in that building something to do with koppel and charitable planning and daddy the kid fancied himself an investigative reporter and figured hed got himself a nice little scandal braindamaged but he kept some sort of records and his old man destroyed them my damn fault i shoulda gone through that room first thing whatd you find in the closet i said he opened to the center of his pad and showed me something sandwiched there encased in a plastic evidence bag wrinkled sheet of paper the size of an index card miniature lined paper from a pad not unlike milos numbers written in blue ink cramped smudged a wavering column of sevendigit numberletter combinations license plate numbers that would be my guess said milo stupid kid was surveilling chapter milo said drop me back at the station gonna run these numbers then head over to the hall of records see if i can find any other link between jerry quick and sonny beyond tenancy if i leave soon i can make it downtown in time want me to take you straight there no this is gonna be tedious ill do it alone i also want to talk to quicks accountant luckily cpas dont get confidentiality any word from the times on running the picture not yet if your pal biondi doesnt come through im having a chitchat with my habitually unresponsive capitan he hates seeing my face so maybe i can promise not to surface for another year if he goes over the heads of those losers in community relations and gets someone to push the media with all the deceit on this one i dont need a victim i cant identify ill try ned again good he said thanks let me know either way i phoned coronado island ned biondi said no one called you jesus im sorry doc i thought it was worked out okay let me see whats going on ill get back to you asap an hour later the phone rang mr delaware plummy theatrical baritone every syllable foreplay speaking this is jack mctell from the los angeles times youve got a picture youd like us to run picture of a homicide victim i said an lapd detective would like it run but his superiors dont think its got enough of a hook for you well he said i certainly cant promise anything should i bring it by if you choose times headquarters was on first street in a massive gray stone building that studded the heart of downtown i got stuck in freeway mucus trolled for parking finally scored a space in an overpriced stacked lot five blocks away three security guards patrolled the timess massive echoing lobby they let several people pass but stopped me two of the uniforms made a show of staring me down as the third called up to jack mctells office barked my name into the phone hung up and told me to wait ten minutes later a young crewcut woman in a black sweater and jeans and hiking boots emerged from the elevator she looked around saw me and headed my way youre the person with the picture a times badge said jennifer duff her left eyebrow was pierced by a tiny steel barbell this is for mr mctell she held out her hand and i gave her the envelope she took it delicately between thumb and forefinger as if it was tainted turned her back and left i blew another twenty minutes waiting for the parking lot attendant to move six other cars and free the seville i used the time to leave milo a message that the times had the photo and it was up to the editors good graces by now he was downtown too reading microfiche at the hall of records just a couple of blocks away cars were queued up at the onramp so i took olympic boulevard west avoiding another jam wasnt all of it that route took me past mary lou koppels office building i made it to palm drive by threethirty hooked a left and swung around into the back alley gulls and larsens mercedeses were there along with a few other latemodel luxury cars next to the handicapped slot a coppercolored van was stationed a white stickon sign on its flanks read thrifty carpet and drapery cleaning a pico address near la brea a number the rear glass doors had been propped open with a wooden triangle i parked and got out the corridor smelled like stale laundry the polyester beneath my feet seeped and made little sucking sounds at the far end of the hall a man pushed an industrial shampooer in lazy circles two doors of the charitable planning suite were propped open the same way mechanical groan from inside i had a look another man short stocky hispanic wearing rumpled gray work clothes guided an identical machine over the thin blue indooroutdoor felt that covered charitables floor his back was to me and the din overrode my footsteps to the right was a small office a swivel chair had been lifted and placed atop a scarred steel desk off in the corner was a rollaway typing table that hosted an ibm selectric on the desktop next to the chair were five rubberbanded bundles of mail i checked out return addresses united way campaign for literacy the thanksgiving fund the firefighters ball i flipped through all the bundles everyone wanted sonny koppels money the rest of the suite was one enormous room with high horizontal windows covered by cheap nylon drapes empty save for a couple of dozen folding chairs stacked against the wall the hispanic man flicked off the machine straightened slowly as if in pain ran his hand through his hair reached into his pocket for a cigarette and lit up still with his back to me he smoked was careful to drop the ash in his cupped hands i said hi he turned surprise but no con wariness he looked at his cigarette blinked shrugged no permisa doesnt bother me i said resigned smile no hardness around his eyes no sloppy tattoos usted no es el patron youre not the boss no i said not today hokay he laughed and smoked mebbe tomorrow im thinking of renting the space blank stare i pointed to the wet carpet nice jobmuy limpia gracias i left wondering what hed cleaned up sonny koppel had been truthful about charitable planning but what did that mean perhaps parceling out partial truths was a strategic defense all that bh square footage left vacant in case mary lou needed it if milo was right about gavin hanging around spying writing down license numbers what had the boy seen empty room two dozen folding chairs what more did you need for group therapy had the sessions already begun what had gone on in there i drove a block away pulled to the curb and thought more about gavin quick braindamaged but hed managed to hold on to his secrets or maybe he hadnt perhaps hed confided in his father and thats why jerry quick had cleaned out his room now quick was traveling after stashing his wife at her sisters business as usual or was he on the run because he knew eileen paxton said quick hired sluts as secretaries the secretary id met had a dope bust and nails too long for typing house in beverly hills but a shadow life gavin had been murdered alongside a blond girl whom no one cared enough about to call in missing all along id wondered if she was a pro jerry and gavin were both sexually aggressive had the blonde been a gift from father to son another referral by sonny koppel angie paul claimed not to know her milo had noticed her blinking id explained it away as a reaction to death the blonde gavins type two miles north in the highpriced spread lived a blond girl who knew gavin before his accident a girl we still hadnt spoken to the last time id followed kayla bartell shed driven to a midday hair appointment that meant she wasnt holding down a ninetofive job rich girl with plenty of leisure time maybe shed spare me some the bartell mansion was lifeless as a mortuary behind its white iron security blanket a white bentley mulsanne with rear plates that read mew zik was parked in the circular drive but no sign of kaylas red cherokee i continued to sunset cars whizzed by both sides of the median strip and i waited for a lull to hook right and retrace to the turnaround it took a while just as i swung onto the boulevard i caught a glimpse of red in my side mirror probably nothing i got back on camden anyway the jeep was parked in front of the house i drove six houses down and parked figuring id give it half an hour eighteen minutes later kayla dressed in white but carrying a big black bag exited the house got in the red suv waited until the gates slid open and sped past me exact same path shed taken the last time santa monica west to canon drive more pampering at umberto but this time she passed the salon and continued two blocks down to a rite aid pharmacy first hair now makeup wouldnt a girl like that buy her cosmetics at a boutique watching her for five minutes gave me my answer but it wasnt what i expected she went straight for the nail polish i stood on the end of the aisle as she studied a rack of small bottles the white outfit was a midriff tshirt that advertised her tan tummy over white ostrichskin lowriders and open white sandals with orange plastic heels her long hair was tucked into a white denim cap that she wore at a jaunty tilt big white plastic earrings she bounced on her heels a couple of times seemed to settle down as she peered at the polish big decision her pretty face creased finally she chose a vermillion bottle and dropped it in her shopping basket then so fast that i almost missed it two other bottles were slipped into the big black handbag same bag id seen that first night oversized embroidered with roses not a good match for the whitewhite duds but something that size did have its utility she moved up the aisle to the eyeliners one in the basket two in the purse brazen not even a cautionary look the store was quiet poorly staffed if surveillance cameras were operating i couldnt see them i hung back pretended to browse mouthwash strolled to the next aisle sauntered back keeping my head down now she was over by the lipstick same routine she moved through the store that way for ten minutes concentrating on small articles dental floss contact lens cleaning solution aspirin candy boosting double the amount of whatever she put in her basket i bought a tenpack of gum was behind her when she checked out she walked cheerfully to her cherokee swinging her bag and wiggling her tight little butt i managed to get to the suv first slipped out from the front of the vehicle and took hold of the black bag she said what the then she recognized me cop she nearly choked on the word it seemed a poor time for full disclosure i said youve got a little problem kayla greengray eyes widened glossy lips parted as she contemplated a reply such a pretty girl despite the hook nose such empty eyes she said i was doing research for a term paper what was the subject you know she glanced off to one side cocked a hip tried to work up a smile i said where do you go to school santa monica college when what do you mean its late june schools out maybe im in summer session are you no answer whats your major she stared at the asphalt raised her head chanced eye contact design um and psychology psychology i said so you know the name for this for what i took the bag from her pulled out a bottle of contact lens solution some shrinkwrapped tylenol and passionate peach lip gloss for this kayla she pointed to the tylenol i get headaches youve got a big one now her eyes darted around the parking lot i dont want someone to see me thats the least of your problems please she said cmon we need to talk kayla cmon she repeated arched her back removed her beret and tossed her hair and let loose a blond storm she blinked twice batted her lashes and did something silly with her head golden hair shimmered cmon she said nearly whispering i can fix it how slowly spreading smile ill blow you she said like youve never been blown before i took her car keys positioned her behind the wheel of her jeep and ordered her not to move as i slid in on the passenger side keeping my door open an inch her car was her territory hopefully the open door would insulate me from a kidnapping charge if the truth ever got out she jammed the beret back on her head carelessly golden strands leaked out please she said staring out the windshield her middy blouse rode up rapid breathing pulsed her flat belly i let the silence sink in cars drove in and out of the rite aid lot tinted windows afforded us privacy i wondered if shed cry she pouted i dont know why you wont just let me do it ill make you feel real good and ill return the stuff okay sonny koppel had talked about stuff being a burden i said heres what well do youll return everything and promise never to do it again but first youll talk to me about gavin quick if youre honest and open and tell me everything you know about him well call it even she turned quickly and gawked at me her hawk nose was powdered beneath the film i saw delicate freckles the graygreen eyes had turned calculating she said thats it thats it she laughed cool i wasnt really into giving you head speaking of gavin that was gavins thing wham bam was gavins thing even for a young guy he was fast even if he came twice in a row i mean they all start out that way but you can train them not gavin the twentysecond man so i stopped stopped having sex with him it was never sex she said thats the point what was being with him felt like playing basketball he shoots he scores he zips up you go out for coffee that why you broke up we didnt break up because we werent like going together you know what was your relationship we knew each other for years from beverly we had classes together then he went to college to do whatever and i decided to study design its better at smc than at some university you know smcs strong on design for sure you can just do it and not mess with all that other stuff like psychology i said she grinned you caught me again that research story was pretty lame huh beyond lame yeah she said i shouldve prepared something better howd you catch me you werent exactly subtle i never got caught before been doing it for a while i said she started to reply shut her mouth kayla i thought you werent going to bother me about that if i told you about gavin you brought it up i did i nodded oh she said well then i effed up lets stick to gavin which i didnt stick to him you know she laughed stopped and placed a finger across her lips spanked her hand bad kayla i shouldnt be doing that doing what laughing at him his being dead and all any idea who killed him i said nope a girl was found with him blond about your size skankadoo she said you know her ive seen her he like showed her off to me as if my friend ellie said she looked like me but i was like get a refund on your lasik girl then ellie was like not like a twin kayle like just a little like if you had a rough night she shook her head no way that thing was trailertrash skankplasm but then i thought maybe gavin being braindamaged and all liked her because he thought she did look like me because he couldnt have me and she was like sloppy seconds you know when did he show her off to you after i told him no more quickiecity after the accident way after she said this was like couple of months ago i thought hed stopped bugging me cause i hadnt heard from him in a while but then he started calling me again i expected him to like break down and beg you know because he claimed he was really into me but he just called and wanted to hang out so that proves he was lying he really wasnt into me right unusual for gavin i said what do you mean giving up so easily ive heard he could be pretty persistent after the accident he got really weird that way started calling me again like twenty times a day dropping over bugging my dad faint smile i guess he did end up begging then he stopped because he was stalking beth gallegos i said so he wanted to hang out he wanted to go somewhere and park and put his cock in my mouth i felt sorry for him so i did it once but never again no more speedrecord sex i said youre making me sound mean she said pulling at loose strands and trying to stuff them back in the beret unsuccessful she yanked off the hat and began kneading it you should apologize she said for what saying im mean and a slut you said you felt sorry for gavin exactly i was being nice after the accident he got kind of i dont want to say retarded because it sounds so mean but really thats what it was so i felt sorry for him and wanted to help him makes sense i said it does she agreed so gavin slowed down intellectually like before he could be obnoxious but he was smart but now it was she probed her cheek with her tongue i want to say pathetic sounds like it was huh pathetic yeah exactly like it really was the time you went out with him it was only once i felt sorry for him whered you park up on mulholland her mouth froze in a tiny o that was where omigod was that a regular spot for you and gavin back in the old days sometimes she started crying that couldve been me tell me about the blond girl i said she wiped her eyes smiled too bleached out you could see her roots whered you meet her i never met her like actually hanging out me and ellie went to a movie and later we went to kate mantolini for the vegetable plate sometimes jerry seinfeld goes there her eyes drifted out a side window switched direction and focused on a parking sign i hope i dont go past the validation time i said you and ellie at kate mantolini yeah she said we were like into our veggies and in comes gavin with this skank im talking rossdressforless blouse and a skirt up to her youknowwhat her eyes dropped to her sandals she did have cool shoes black openbacked very naomi campbell jimmy choo i said howd you know she was wearing them the night she was murdered they were cool shoes i figured she boosted them she chuckled just kidding so gavin walked in with her and pretended not to see me so i pretended not to see him then he had to walk past us to get to his booth and he pretended to all of a sudden spot me and be all like surprised like heyitsyou kayla what did you do i said i waited until he came right up to the table i mean right up so like no way could you ignore it then what then i said hey gav and he wiggles his finger and the skank comes over and shes like who are you like shes got it all goin on which she doesnt and gavins like this is whatever her name was and skanky just stands there in her jimmys like shes the star of an e true hollywood story or something you dont remember her name nope try its not like i was listening try i said its important it is why because shes dead hmm she flipped her upper lip with her index finger let it snap down against her teeth repeated it several times making little ploppy noises squished the beret and watched the soft fabric pulsate amoebically as it regained its shape kayla i said im thinking she said i guess id like to say chris or christa something chrissy any last name no she said definitely not gavin never mentioned a last name this wasnt like some big introduction gavin was like i dont need you look what ive got he said that no but you could just tell later he came up and said how cool she was later when when skanky went to the bathroom and left him alone she was in there a long time im thinking dope she looked like a doper real skinny there was no way anyone could think she looked like me but gavin she crossed her eyes and tapped her forehead she left him alone and he came to your table yeah and ellie was like whos your new laydee gav and gavins like christa i think it was christa something like that maybe crystal and ellies like pretty cute gav but not meaning it dissing him you know and im not saying a thing im working on my steamed spinach which is the coolest part of the vegetable plate then gavin gives this sick smile and moves away from ellie and he bends down and whispers in my ear she does it all kayla endlessly and im like more like endlessly boring and endlessly preemie but i just think it i dont say it because gavin wasnt normal anymore it wouldve been like dissing a retard also because by that time hed moved back to his booth like he didnt care what i had to say i said what else can you tell me about christa maybe it was crystal she said im thinking crystals more right she never said a word to you no but gavin did actually he said more than what i just told you i waited it was mean i really dont want to remember its important kayla she sighed okay okay when he bent down and whispered in my ear was like how great she was he also said shes a dancer kayla shes got all the moves like i dont you know what it really means right what i said get real she said a dancer means a stripper they all call themselves dancers she was skankspread on a croissant you know any strippers me no way but she had that the way she stood the way she she was like look at my body its the greatest body i love my body ill take off my clothes for a mixed green salad easy morals i said which is stupid she said the way it is with guys you want em to respect you you got to hold something back what can you tell me about gavins home life like his parents yes his moms nuts and his fathers a horndog probably where gav gets it the old man make a move on you yuk she said no way you just hear things about what about whos sleeping around jerome quick was sleeping around thats what gavin said he told you he was like bragging she said like my dads a stud and so am i this was after the accident no she said before when gavin was still talking like a normal person you say his mothers nuts everyone knows that she was never at school stuff youd never even see her out in her backyard shed be all up in her bedroom drinking sleeping at least gavins dad came to school stuff gavin was closer to him she stared at me as if id posed the question in a foreign language i said did gavin ever tell you about his career plans like what job he wanted yes before the accident he wanted to be a rich businessman afterward he talked about writing writing what he didnt say on what she laughed as if did he ever talk to you about being suspicious of anyone huh she said like some spy thing like that i said no can i get going puleeze im supposed to meet ellie over at il fornaio and i dont want to go over the parking limit paying for parking sucks so does paying for cosmetics i said hey she said i thought that was over with what else can you tell me about gavin nothing he was out of my life running with skanks you think thats why he was killed running with bad people maybe i said there you go she said it pays to be good chapter i had her go into the pharmacy and get a shopping bag dumping the stolen goods in the bag i said leave it inside the door sudden bonewhite pallor flashed through her makeup dont make me go in there please she placed a hand on my sleeve no seductiveness her knuckles were white okay i said but you have to promise to be good i do can i go ellies waiting gavin had bragged to kayla about all the sex he was getting from the blonde maybe that was trying to oneup the old girlfriend but it also fit the call girl theory christa or crystal i tried milo again his cell remained switched off listening to kayla bartell learning about the sad stumble that had been gavin quicks life had sapped my energy allison and i were due to meet for dinner at seven and i resolved to push all of it out of my head i pretty much stuck to that but by evenings end i found myself talking to allison about the quick familys meltdown wrong turns and bad luck the death of intimacy an unnamed girl in a stainlesssteel drawer body stitched back together and relegated to cold storage like the therapist she was allison mostly listened and that kept me going i knew i was being morose but didnt want to stop talking as i pulled up to her house my own voice hurt my ears sorry i said what a fun guy she said why dont you sleep over you want more of this id like you to stay the night ive never known you to be a masochist she shrugged and played with my index finger i like seeing you first thing in the morning you always look really happy to see me and theres no one else i can say that about we went straight to her bedroom got undressed shared a chaste closedmouth kiss slipped easily into sleep i woke up three times in the middle of the night twice to think discouraging thoughts and once because i felt myself being jostled i forced my eyes open saw allison hovering over me breasts dangling grasping a corner of the comforter and looking none too awake herself i said something that wouldve been huh had my tongue been working you were covered up she said groggily i didnt see you moving wanted to check mfine guh night morning light seared my eyelids i left allison sleeping went into her kitchen took in the paper searched for a picture of the dead girl didnt find it allison had morning patients and would be up soon so i got to work on breakfast moments later she shuffled in sniffing the air wearing an oversized khaki tshirt and fluffy slippers face creased by bed wrinkles hair topknotted carelessly eggs she said rubbing her eyes ysleep okay perfectly me too she yawned did i snore no i lied sank like a stone she said boom no memory of waking up to make sure i was okay shed cared about me in her dreams i was back home for fifteen minutes when milo phoned from his car his breathing was harsh as if hed run uphill i tried reaching you at nine spent the night at allisons good for you he said whats your schedule like today open i might have a first name on the blond girl crystal or christa howd you find that out kayla bartell its a bit of a story tell me when i get there im already at sepulveda and wilshire the pooch still bunking with you no hes gone okay then ill eat this beef jerky myself he entered the house wearing a sad gray suit mud brown shirt gray poly tie and chewing on the thickest rope of dehydrated meat id ever seen what is that i said python jerky buffalo lowfat lowsalt special deal at trader joes his hair was flat and his eyes were red we went into the kitchen tell me the story i recounted my talk with kayla he said little klepto huh and you played bad cop nice work it was probably illegal it was a chat between two adults he twisted the knot of his tie got any coffee left didnt make any no prob im wired anyway christa or crystal whyd kayla peg her for a stripper because gavin said she was a dancer i said well he said name a girl crystal and whats more likely that shell get a phd in biomechanics or end up shaking her tail for tips he removed his jacket and tossed it over a chair since hed arrived the air was turbulent kayla also said she looked like a doper the coroner found nothing in her system what about the times they run on their own schedule i said whyd you ask about mine he took a sheet of paper from his jacket pocket and handed it to me typed list ford explorer bennett a hacker franklin avenue hollywood lincoln sedan raymond r degussa post office box in venice mercedes benz sedan albin larsen santa monica mercedes benz sedan jerome a quick beverly hills dmv data from gavins list he said gavin copied down his fathers license number weird no could it be a brain damage thing do you guys have a name for it overinclusiveness but something else jumps out at me quicks car is listed last youd think spotting his fathers car would have caught gavins attention first unless he listed the cars in order of arrival and daddy arrived last good point i said so what are you thinking some sort of meeting he nodded quick and albin larsen and the other two the big question is why was gavin surveilling daddy it smells to me like daddy was up to no good and thats why he cleaned out gavins room getting rid of any evidence his kid mighta come up with then he left town his kids just been murdered and hes off traveling again leaving the wife alone doing business it smells ripe alex the mistake ol jerry made was not clearing out gavins clothes he picked up the list refolded it put it back in his pocket its not much but to my mind it changes everything let me tell you about the other guys on the list i said the con cleaning the building kristof said his parole officer was named hacker he sat down at the kitchen table im impressed yeah hes a po working out of the downtown office and raymond degussas one of his former clients major client string of arrests for assault larceny extortion armed robbery dope degussa beat a bunch of raps pleaded out others did some county time finally got tagged for fifteen years on a strongarm robbery beef san quentin time shaved for good behavior and he seems to have behaved himself during parole checked in with hacker regularly got free and clear two years ago i called over to q and spoke with an assistant warden whos relatively new to the job and didnt know degussa what she dug up for me was that he was a dominant con no gang membership but he never got victimized they figured him for a supplier of some kind because he always had cigarettes and candy he was also a suspect in at least two inmate murders but there was no evidence career bad guy i said two suspected murders and he got time shaved for good behavior without evidence he did prison administrators have their own agenda theyre always overcrowded want to move guys out and wonder of wonders degussa appears to be rehabilitated not a single brush with the law since being off parole a friendly parole officer would help that i said successful rehabilitation albin larsen would like that maybe degussa was one of his pet projects or mary lou koppels what weapon was used in those prison murders a blade in prison its always a blade any impaling nothing about that in his file degussa went away on a strongarm robbery i said any weapon at all just intimidation did bennett hacker spend any time at any of those satellite offices flora newsome he said she worked in parole it seems awfully coincidental yeah i didnt want to ask too much if hackers dirty i dont want him to know im snooping around but ill do what i can to sniff behind the scenes he drummed the table im getting that feeling the stew is starting to simmer but everythings still at arms length like im cooking in someone elses kitchen he got up paced the room tugged at his tie the way i see it gavin convinced himself he was gonna be some kind of investigative reporter was nosing around in his dads affairs or hed noticed funny goingson at the therapy building first started doing some serious surveillance took notes a psychologist a parole officer and a con i said without jerry quick it could just be some sort of treatment arrangement precissimoso jerry being there takes it in a whole other direction jerrys a womanizing hustler who hires someone like angie paul for his front gal hes also sonny koppels tenant and sonnys mary lous business partner in the halfway houses the moneyman the one who referred jerry to mary lou in the first place have you found any business dealings between sonny and quick not a damn thing and i dug deep yesterday and early today he slouched over to the fridge returned drinking pink grapefruit juice from a carton cant find a speck of dirt on ol sonny no slumlord problems no criminal complaints no one in organized crime has ever heard of him so far hes coming across as exactly what he claims to be a guy who owns a lot of properties he was also being straight about giving away big bucks franchise tax board says charitable planning is on the upandup as a taxexempt foundation sonny files his papers on time and donates at least a million every year to whom the poor the sick the halting every worthy disease plus save the bay nourish the trees coddle the spotted owl whatever saint sonny i said if it looks too good to be true i dont know what that meeting was about but the only thing that makes sense is theyre all involved in something shady maybe sonny got a hook into jerry quick because quicks always cash shy but i still cant figure out what use quick would be to him putting that aside for the moment what kind of scam could a bunch of shrinks pull off that would make big bucks the first thing that comes to mind i said is basic fraud overbilling insurance or the state the easiest target would be the state some kind of government contract sonny would know how to work that angle he gets the government to finance his halfway houses and his senior citizen housing he claims the halfway houses were mary lou and larsens idea maybe thats true but if owning halfways helped plug sonny into a subsidized treatment plan that would appeal to his business sense therapy for cons he said a builtin supply of patients patients they could bill for whether or not they treated them because whos going to complain sonny and mary lou and larsen and gavin saw some kind of staff meeting gavin didnt copy down gulls license number i said so maybe gull missed the meeting or he wasnt involved hes got personal problems and he sweats too much if i were setting up a slick criminal enterprise id view him as a poor risk id still like to know why gavin ditched him as a therapist he paced some more for a guy like sonny to get involved in a scam it would have to be big money maybe not i said sonny claims hes not into accumulating stuff that seems to be true meaning hes turned on by the game the process of making money soaking the government or sonny did figure out a way to make some serious money he claims he was holding the ground floor open until koppel and the others decided about group therapy if they were setting up some sort of parolee treatment that brought in big bucks that would justify leaving the charitable planning suite vacant i got into the space yesterday they were cleaning the carpets and i was able to walk in empty except for a small office for sonny and a big room with some folding chairs why would sonny need chairs if all he did was come in and sign checks but theyd be useful if someone checked and you were claiming to be running groups of course if the person checking was your pal you wouldnt need to put up much of a front bennett hacker he said theres some deal with the parole board and hackers the overseer a guy in hackers position could also supply names in return for kickback and raymond degussa being a wily dominant con someone who pulled off robberies using intimidation alone could convince the patients to cooperate headshrinking for parolees he said something like that could really bring in serious money if there were enough parolees i said lets do the math private practice group therapy can run between fifty and a hundred bucks an hour medical reimburses for much less fifteen twenty but there are all sorts of other things you can bill medical for individual treatment initial intakes followups testing case conferences case conferences as in getting together after hours at the building how much does medical pay for that thirtysix bucks for thirty minutes if these people have hooked on to some supplemental program that adds to the medical billing something sonny wangled the fee could be substantially higher but lets be conservative and assume the core is group therapy at twenty dollars per patient per session i saw at least two dozen folding chairs if theyre running groups of twenty or claiming to be each group session would bring in four hundred bucks an hour running six groups a day five times a week would bring in twelve thousand dollars that alone would be six hundred grand a year add more patients toss in additional fees and it could get interesting especially if youre not really doing any work millions he said its not inconceivable each con gets daily group therapy how many groups could you justify for a single patient if youve set up an immersion model you could treat him all day what like that deal where you sat all day and some guy yelled at you for being weakwilled and wouldnt let you pee est synanon i said theres plenty of precedent particularly with substance abuse a case could be made for immersion for cons because the aim would be largescale change on several dimensions the answer to an inquiring skeptic would be that it was still cheaper than keeping them in prison and that if it really straightened them out it was a giant money saver mary lou and her rehab kick he said going on the radio she and larsen he laughed the government pays to shrink bad guys im in the wrong business so are you for that matter i said how many parolees live in sonnys halfway houses three houses id guess a couple of hundred think about the income if everyone got on the rolls hundred bucks a week per con five grand a year a million bucks for group therapy alone plus other charges the only problem is alex a couple of shrinks doing all that billing would be physically impossible so they use assistants peer counselors and they flat out lie bill for sessions that never take place peer counselors he said meaning other cons yeah thats the rage aint it exgangbangers become facilitators junkies go the drugcounseling route thats where a guy like degussa would fit in scumbags doing therapy thats legal everything depends how the contracts written i said and a guy like sonny would know how to get a juicy government contract all those billable hours he said the place would be jumping but its not maybe that discrepancy occurred to gavin braindamaged ace reporter ferrets out fraud he said he drank juice put the carton down wiped his lips with his sleeve all you need is a room and some chairs to make a million yeah its a fat scam but sonny gives away a million a year why would he mess with this the game maybe something else i said whats that making mary lou happy she didnt end up too happy he said maybe something went wrong so they were cleaning the carpet the day after we spoke to sonny who was doing it scuzzbags like roland kristof didnt appear to be i said i gave him the name of the company and he copied it down a rehab scam he said but were back to the same question where does jerry quick fit in that office of his i said not much business goes on there a front maybe his real jobs working for sonny he frowned this whole scenario it makes quick more than just a sleazy bastard it means he knows why his son was killed and instead of telling us he cleans out the room that couldve been fear i said first gavin then mary lou koppel thats why quick left town when you called the office no one answered maybe quick told angie to take some time off he splits leaves his wife behind because they dont get along anyway he doesnt give a damn about her that would also explain the daughter kelly not coming home after gavins death quick wants her out of the way the scam crumbling if it really exists a scam would explain flora newsome too while she was working in the parole office she learned something she shouldnt have maybe mary lou got greedy and wanted a bigger cut or gavins getting killed changed her perspective what she suddenly developed moral fiber money games are one thing murders another perhaps koppel panicked and wanted out or she tried to lean on sonny he got up again circled the room a couple of times theres another possible angle on flora alex she couldve been in on the scam flagging files of incoming parolees passing along names could be i said thinking about evelyn newsome living on memories trying to put her life together he stared out the kitchen window for a long time career criminal parole officer shady metals dealer and professor larsen the human rights dude weve been focusing on gull havent paid much attention to larsen he drained the juice carton let out a long windy sigh ive got an appointment with jerry quicks cpa in brentwood then id better start doing detail work on degussa and hacker find out among other things if either of them interfaced with floras satellite office he snapped the case shut and saluted all this still leaves crystal the mystery blonde gavins girl i said he confided in her or he didnt and she just happened to be in the wrong place so youve changed your mind she wasnt the primary target flexibility is the hallmark of maturity he grinned seeing as your schedules open should you choose to accept the mission what scholarly research excavate every goddamn thing you can about albin larsen and the others look for the kind of easy government money were guessing about state local fed private something with poor oversight that would be easy to pad sounds like a typical grant i said so young yet so cynical so do we have a deal a deal implies reciprocity i said virtue mlad is its own reward chapter virtue took its sweet time paying off jerome quicks name pulled up no hits neither did raymond degussas or bennett a hackers edward sonny koppel was a man of means but his public profile was low twenty references in all sixteen noting koppels charitable contributions most of those consisted of koppels name on donor lists when he was identified at all it was as an investor and philanthropist no photos accompanied any of the citations albin larsen was a good deal more cybervisible for the last decade hed balanced the practice of psychology with delivering lectures on the role of psychology in social activism in his native sweden as well as in france holland belgium canada and kenya his name popped up sixtythree times that kind of travel conflicted with doing longterm therapy then again it was easier to maintain a patient load when you werent actually seeing your patients i began slogging through the hits larsens connections to africa went beyond giving speeches hed been a un observer in rwanda during the genocide that had seen eight hundred thousand tutsis exterminated and had consulted to the subsequent war crimes tribunal some of the citations were repetitive but the thirty i examined were all more of the same larsen doing good works not the profile of a swindler or a murderer before reaching the end i shifted gears and started searching for psychotherapy programs for parolees and other excons found surprisingly few no government projects in california other than a statefunded truckdriving school for recently released felons that one had earned a bit of scrutiny when one of its graduates tanked up on meth had crashed his big rig into a restaurant in lodi but i found no sign the grant had been terminated everything else i came up with was academic a smattering of social scientists espousing theories and playing with numbers when treatments for criminals did exist they tended to be outside the therapy mainstream a group in baldwin park promoted meditation and attitudinal healing for excons and one in laguna trumpeted the power of arts and crafts martial arts tai chi specifically was the treatment of choice for an organization in san diego and there was no shortage of religious groups touting techniques of moral change i phoned the state department of health endured nearly an hour of voice mail and onhold stupor before speaking to a jaded woman who informed me that she hadnt heard of any treatment groups for parolees but that if one existed they wouldnt know about it the department of corrections would another forty minutes of telephonic torment by the corrections switchboard as i was shunted from menu to menu i started pressing like a man possessed finally reached an operator and was told that the office was closed fourfifteen my tax dollars working overtime i returned to the last dozen citations on albin larsen a few more speeches then a joint statement issued by larsen and a un commissioner named alphonse almogardi in lagos nigeria promising that the united nations would do everything in its power to bring the perpetrators of the rwandan genocide to justice links attached to that one connected me to an african public affairs website the big story took place in kigali the rwandan capital a june march by thirtyfive hundred genocide survivors branding the international criminal tribunal a farce during the eight years since the tribunals establishment only seven war crimes trials had been convened all of lowlevel military officers as the years ground on witnesses died or disappeared those who persisted had endured threats and harassment accused butchers grew wealthy as their defense attorneys kicked back shares of tribunalfinanced legal fees more damaging was the accusation that the tribunal judges were actively conspiring to delay the trials of bigticket mass murderers because of fears that hearings in open court would reveal the complicity of un personnel in the genocide from the safety of her office in dublin a tribunal registrar named maria robertson responded by scolding the survivors for their incendiary language and cautioned against instigating a cycle of violence speaking in lagos consultant professor albin larsen stressed the complexity of the situation and advised patience the nineteenth hit also emanated from the nigerian capital and it gave me pause description of a program called sentries for justice aimed at helping steer young african men away from lives of crime the group staffed by european volunteers functioned by offering synergistic alternatives to prison that engender efficacious rehabilitation and attitudinal shifting through a holistic emphasis upon the interplay between socially altruistic behavior and communal social norms set into place during the precolonial era but disrupted by colonialism services offered included parenting education jobs skills training drug and alcohol counseling crisis intervention and something called cultural demarginalization synergy was illustrated by the use of sentries buses driven by sentries alumni for transporting criminal detainees to court most of the volunteers had scandinavian names and albin larsen was listed as a senior consultant i printed the citation and moved to the last few hits more speeches by larsen then the final reference posted three weeks ago calendar of events at a santa monica bookstore named the pen is mightier a harvard professor named george issa qumdis was scheduled to deliver a speech on the middle east and albin larsen would be there to introduce him the speech was tonight in four hours professor larsen was a busy man i scanned the sentries for justice citation for buzzwords and keyed them into several search engines syngerstic alternatives efficacious rehabilitation attitudinal shifting demarginalization and the like pulled up lots of academic verbiage but nothing useful it was pm when i pushed away from the computer and i had nothing much to show i made some coffee munched on a bagel and drank thinking and looking out my kitchen window at a graying sky i realized id been seduced by the cheap trick that was cyberresearch and decided to do it the oldfashioned way olivia brickerman and i had worked together at western pediatric hospital she as a supervising social worker i as a fledgling psychologist twenty years my senior shed seen herself as my surrogate mother i hadnt minded one bit because shed been a benevolent mother down to home cooking and a cheerfully nosy interest in my love life her husband an international chess grand master had written the final moves column for the times hed since passed on and olivia had dealt with her loss by plunging herself back into work taking a series of shortlived wellpaying state consultantships then easing into a position at the genteel old school across town where i was nominally a med school professor olivia knew more about grantsmanship and the way government operated than anyone else id ever met at fiveforty she was still at her desk alex darling olivia darling so nice to hear from you hows life life is good i said how about you still kicking so hows the new one working out shes working out great makes sense she said both of you in the same profession lots of common ground which isnt to say i have anything against robin i love her shes lovely sos the new one that hair those eyes no surprise there a goodlooking guy like you get yourself a new dog not yet a dog is good she said i love my rudy rudy was a walleyed shaggy mutt with a lust for deli meat rudy rocks i said hes smarter than most people last time id spoken to her three or four months ago shed sprained an ankle hows the leg i said back to jogging yet hah cant get back to a place youve never been truthfully the legs still a little gammy i should take off weight but thank god the latest thing is im on blood thinners you all right well she said ive got thinner blood unfortunately nothing else got thin so what can i do for you darling i told her department of corrections she said havent had much to do with those yokels in a long time not since i consulted to sybil brand back then they had some state grants for therapy but that was all for inside the prison helping inmates with kids learn to be good mothers good idea but the oversight was pathetic never heard about an outside project such as youre describing it may not exist i said and youre asking about this because because it may relate to some murders some murders she said ugly stuff very ugly you and milo hows he doing by the way working hard hell always be doing that she said well im sorry nothing comes to mind but just because i havent heard about it doesnt mean it doesnt exist ive been teaching have kind of lost touch with the divine world of public monies what youre describing could be a pilot study let me fire up my mac and see okay here goes click click click cant seem to find any pilot postprison rehab therapy studies from nih or hhs or the state maybe its private no nothing on that list either so maybe it was approved as a fullterm grant not a pilot i said you might want to check under sentries for justice and if that doesnt work ive got some other buzzwords for you give them to me synergy demarginalization attitudinal shifting holistic interplay that sound youre hearing in the background is mr orwell groaning i laughed waited listened to olivia humming and muttering to herself nothing she said finally not on any databases i can find but not everything makes it into the computer in a timely fashion there are good oldfashioned printed lists i dont keep them here have to go over to the main office which is locked for the night give me some time darling and ill see what i can do thanks olivia youre more than welcome come over sometime alex bring allison is she a vegetarian or something like that on the contrary oh lucky you she said then definitely bring her over ill marinate some skirt steaks my skirt steaks are famous you bring allison and some wine i could use some adorable people in the house sixthirty milo called me from his desk jerry quicks cpa was cagey but i managed to get a few things out of him first of all i got a clear impression quick is not a bigmoney client secondly quicks income comes in spurts hes got no regular income coming in just whatever deals he can close and the cpa never sees the checks just writes down what jerry tells him his main gripe was that jerrys income was unstable so establishing estimated tax was a hassle not a bigmoney client i said hows hes been doing recently couldnt get the guy to spill specifics but he did say quick was late to pay his bill same thing sonny koppel complained about so maybe quicks living on the edge house in beverly hills a mercedes albeit one thats a few years old appearances are important toss in gavins medical bills and thered be pressure sure he said it would explain quick getting into something iffy and lucrative but what it doesnt explain is why would sonny and the others want him involved guys a middling metals dealer what could he offer guns are metal from therapy to guns a burgeoning crime syndicate its just what came to mind i said dealers like to deal quick travels around buying scrap dont police departments scrap confiscated weapons yeah he said anythings possible but theres still nothing to connect quick or anyone to therapy mischief let alone arms mischief and i still cant locate the bastard i got hold of his home phone records but therere no calls to any airlines no travelrelated stuff of any kind couldnt find any business phone so i asked sheila about it she said he uses prepaid cells which is just what youd do if your business was shady meanwhile sheila still has no idea where he is so maybe you were right and he is on the lam hows she taking that she was pretty soused but did sound a little scared as in maybe this is more than just another of jerrys business trips when she sobers up itll be worse lucidity can be a bitch i also bopped over to quicks office closed no sign of angie bluenails mails piled up in front of the door all junk solicitations maybe his important mail goes somewhere else that would not shock me he said i phoned angies apartment in north hollywood no answer on the other fronts mr raymond degussa works as a bouncer at a club in east hollywood petra doesnt know him but she checked hollywood files and degussas name came up on a patrol call hassle at the club degussa got into it with an unruly patron patron called the cops showed them a shiner claimed degussa threatened to kill him but there were no witnesses and the complainant was stoned and hostile and obnoxious so no charge death threats i said sweet guy im sure he mans the velvet rope with tact and diplomacy other than that one incident hes kept his nose clean heres something juicier bennett hacker our probably errant po did circulate through some of the satellites including the one where flora newsome temped but he was only there two weeks thats long enough i said hows your schedule tonight say in an hour i told him about albin larsens appearance at the bookstore we could drop by to observe have a chance to see larsen in another context unless you think that would alarm larsen another context he said not a bad idea in terms of alarming larsen weve got a cover story we wanted to talk to him about mary lou and gull and with his being such a busy little shrink and our not wanting to disrupt his practice we figured this would be the best way in addition to being a cover it would make him think the focus is still on his partner is binchy still watching gull yes gulls keeping a low profile little bookstore jaunt tonight sure lets do it i gave him the address he said lets meet say half a block east corner of sixth arrive a little early sevenfifteen scoping out the scene hey he said no cheap seats for us chapter i got to broadway and sixth at traffic was lazy the sky was hammered tin evenings are inevitably cool in santa monica tonight marine winds whipped the june air frigid winds rich with kelp and rot the metallicsweet promise of rain a couple of homeless guys pushed shopping carts up the boulevard one muttered and sped past me the other took the dollar i offered and said hey man you have a better year okay you too i said me i had a great year he said indignant he wore a salmoncolored cashmere sport coat stained and frayed that had once belonged to a large rich man i beat the shit out of mike tyson in vegas took his woman and made her my bitch good for you it was reeeel good he flashed a gaptoothed grin leaned into the breeze and shoved on a moment later milo rounded sixth and strode toward me hed changed at the station wore baggy jeans and an old oatmealcolored turtleneck that added unneeded bulk desert boots clopped the sidewalk hed folded something stiff and shiny into his hair and it spiked in places kind of authorial i said one of those irish poets to me he still looked like a cop now all i need is to write a damn book so who wrote the one tonight a harvard professor george issa something the middle east we began walking toward the store issa qumdis you know him i said heard the name im impressed hey he said i read the papers even when they dont run photos of dead girls speaking of which i hit the clubs trying to locate christacrystal but tonight we intellectualize here we are looks like college days huh his college had been indiana u most of what i knew about his student years had to do with being in the closet we stood outside the bookstore as he inspected the facade the pen is mightier was a halfwidth storefront glass above salteaten brick with signage reminiscent of a grateful dead poster most of the blackened window was papered with flyers and announcements tonights reading was heralded by a sheet of paper headlined prof george i qumdis reveals the truth behind zionist imperialism next to that was the sticker of a boutique coffee brand the legend java inside and a b rating from the health department b said milo means a permissible level of rodent droppings id stay away from the muffins no coffee or muffin smells inside just the must of old wet news pulp where the walls werent hidden by rough pine bookshelves they were exposed block bookcases on wheels were arranged haphazardly at the center pocked vinyl floors were the color of tooold custard a twentyfoot ceiling was spaghettied by ductwork and ladders not library rollers on rails just foldable aluminum ladders supplied for those willing to climb their way to erudition a heavyset longhaired asian kid sat behind the register nose buried in something bound in plain brown wrappers a sign behind him said no smoking but he puffed on an indian herbal stick another sign said reading in back over a pointing hand the clerk ignored us as we filed past and began squeezing through the choppy maze created by the portable cases the book spines i could make out covered a host of isms titles shouted back in the hoarse adolescence of dimestore revolution milo scanned and frowned a lot we ended up in a small dark clearing at the rear of the store set with thirty or so red plastic folding chairs that faced a lectern empty chairs on the rear wall was a sign that said bathrooms unisex no one but us for all his talk of good seats milo remained on his feet retreating until he was back in the bookcase maze positioning himself at a slant perfect vantage spot we could watch and remain out of view its good were early i whispered big crush and all that he glanced over at the seats all those folding chairs you could do group therapy for the next ten minutes no one showed up and we passed the time browsing milo seemed distracted then his face loosened and took on a meditative cast i browsed and by the time the first people began trickling in id received a quick education on how to build homemade bombs how to farm hydroponically vandalism in the service of the greater good and the ethical virtues of leon trotsky the audience dispersed itself among the chairs a dozen or so people divided into what seemed to be two groups twentyish piercedandbranded dreadlocked rage hobbyists in expensive shredded duds and sixtyish couples swathed in earth tones the women helmeted by severe gray bobs the men frizzybearded and shadowed by cloth caps the exception was a thickset wavyhaired guy in his fifties wearing a navy pea coat buttoned to the neck and crumpled houndstooth pants who positioned himself front row center his jaw was a stubbled shelf he wore blackrimmed glasses had wide shoulders and serious thighs and looked as if hed just finished organizing dockworkers he sat stiffly folded his arms across a barrel chest scowled at the lectern milo studied him and his eyes slitted what i whispered angry fellow up in front probably not unusual for this crowd sure he said lots to be angry about its comfier and cozier in fucking north korea sevenforty fortyfive fifty no sign of albin larsen or the speaker or a bookstore staffer quiet audience everyone just sitting and waiting just before eight larsen entered the room with a tall dignifiedlooking man wearing a glen plaid suedeelbowed hacking jacket brown flannel trousers and shiny peanutbuttercolored demiboots id expected someone mideastern but professor george issa qumdis had the ruddy complexion and magesterial bearing of an oxford don i put him at fiftyfive to sixty a comfortably lived middle age his longish saltandpepper hair curled over the collar of a crisp white shirt his rep tie probably meant something haughty nose hollow cheeks thin lips he half turned his back on the audience and glanced at an index card albin larsen stepped up to the lectern and began talking in a low voice no niceties no thanking the audience right into the topic israeli oppression of the palestinian people larsen spoke fluently with minimal inflection smiling wryly as he noted the profound historical irony of jews the victims of oppression becoming the worlds greatest extant oppressors how odd how sad intoned larsen that the victims of the nazis have adopted nazi tactics murmurs of assent from the audience milos face was expressionless his eyes shifted from larsen to the audience and back larsens manner stayed lowkey but his rhetoric poured out hot and vindictive each time he uttered the word zionism his eyes fluttered the audience began warming to the topic nodding harder except for the burly guy in the pea coat his hands had dropped to his knees and he was rocking very slightly in his frontcenter seat head canted away from the lectern i caught a clear view of his profile tight jaw clenched eyes milo studied him some more and his own mandible tensed larsen went on a while longer finally indicated george issa qumdis with an expansive wave took out a sheet of paper and offered morsels from the professors academic résumé when he finished issa qumdis walked to the podium just as he began to speak footsteps behind milo and me made both of us turn a man had entered our aisle midthirties black well groomed very tall wearing a wellcut gray suit over a charcoal shirt buttoned to the neck he saw us smiled apologetically retreated milo watched him edge away and hook a quick right turn the black man never reappeared and milos hands began to flex why all the tension this was a lecture at a bookstore maybe too much work with too little outcome or his instincts were sharper than mine professor george issa qumdis unbuttoned his jacket smoothed back his hair smiled at the crowd cracked a joke about being accustomed to lecturing at harvard where the audience hadnt reached puberty a few chuckles from the audience the guy in the pea coat began rocking again one of his hands reached behind his head and scratched vigorously issa qumdis said the truth the inalienable truth is that zionism is the most repugnant doctrine of all in a world rife with malignant dogma think of zionism as the pernicious anemia of modern civilization one of the piercedandbrandeds snickered into his girlfriends ear issa qumdis warmed to his topic branding jews who moved to israel nothing less than war criminals each and every one is deserving of death pause i would shoot them myself silence even for this audience that was strong stuff issa qumdis smiled and smoothed his lapel and said have i offended someone i certainly hope so complacence is the enemy of truth and as a scholar truth is my catechism yes im talking about jihad an american jihad where he stopped openmouthed the guy in the pea coat had shot to his feet and shouted fuck you nazi as he fooled with the buttons of his coat milo was already moving toward him as pea coat whipped out a gun a big black gun and fired straight at issa qumdiss chest issa qumdiss snowy white shirt turned to crimson he stood there wideeyed reached down and touched himself and came away with a red sticky thumb you pathetic fascist he burbled still on his feet breathing fast but breathing no loss of balance no death pallor red rivulets wormed down his shirtfront and filthied the edges of his jacket besmirched but alive and healthy the man in the pea coat fired again and issa qumdiss face became a crimson mask issa qumdis cried out wiped frantically at his face albin larsen sat in his chair amazed immobile oh my god someone said thats pigs blood yelled the man in the pea coat you arab pigfucker he charged toward issa qumdis tripped fell righted himself issa qumdis blinded by blood kept swiping at his eyes pea coat raised his weapon black plastic paint gun shrieking fascist a woman in the second row one of the grayhairs shot to her feet and grabbed for the weapon pea coat tried to shake her off she clawed and scratched and got hold of his sleeve and hung on milo hurried to the front zigzagging through the makeshift aisles dodging chairs as the womans companion a bald weakchinned man wearing granny glasses and a red cccp sweatshirt jumped up and began rabbitpunching the back of pea coats neck pea coat struck back at him caught him on the shoulder and the man fell back on his rear issa qumdis had cleared his eyes now was staring at the melee albin larsen stood behind him stunned as he handed issa qumdis a handkerchief and led him toward the back of the store by the time milo reached the fracas another grayhair had joined in and pea coat had been pounded to the ground the woman whod fought for the paint gun had finally gotten hold of it she aimed downward shot a torrent of blood at pea coat but he kicked her and her aim shifted and she hit her companion instead reddening his jeans shit he cried out a flush captured his face he began kicking viciously at pea coats prone body milo yanked him away pea coat struggled to his feet took a roundhouse swing at granny glasses missed and lost his balance again issa qumdis and larsen had slipped into the unisex bathroom the woman aimed the paint gun again but milo pressed down on her arm and the weapon dribbled onto the floor whore you she exclaimed a couple of piercedandbrandeds stood i rushed over just as someone shouted get the fascist and the crowd erupted into shouts and curses milo grabbed pea coats sleeve and dragged him toward the back door the young men marched forward and got within arms length of milo milo stopped the bigger one with a quick hard squeeze of bare biceps the mans eyes fluttered milo said its under control compadres go away no badgeflash his tone froze them i got the rear door open and milo shoved pea coat out into the briny night air as the door swung shut slowly i looked back most of the onlookers had remained in their seats a few feet behind the folding chairs halfconcealed by bookshelves tucked in his own vantage point stood the tall thin black man in the good gray suit and the charcoal shirt behind the store was a service alley blackened by night milo propelled pea coat westward walking fast shoving the man when he faltered pea coat began cursing and struggling and milo did something to his shoulder blade that made him squeal let go of me you commie bastard shut up said milo you im the police idiot pea coat tried to stop short milo kicked at his heel and the man jerked forward involuntarily police state he said his voice was thick and raspy words punching out between shallow breaths so youre a fascist not a commie another moron heard from milo spotted a parked car a few yards up shoved pea coat to it pushed him up against the trunk jerking one of the mans arms behind his back he got his cuffs free snapped them around the mans wrist twisted the other arm and completed the task since pea coat had aimed his paint gun till now no more than five minutes had passed the man said antisemitic keep your mouth shut and your head down milo frisked him thoroughly came up with a wallet and a key ring the man said i know exactly how much is in there so if youre milos finger landed atop pea coats shoulder blade the memory of the first touch made the man break off midsentence i could hear cars rumble by on broadway but for that the night was still milo inspected the wallet theres twenty bucks in here you know different silence then no twenty whole dollars said milo preparing for a big night on the town smart guy hes hitler said the man that pig he lies hes hitler milo ignored him and read his drivers license elliot simons whats this here

best damn revenge who said so i did simons finally calmed down and milo uncuffed him he looked down at his bloody pea coat as if noticing the stain for the first time plucked at a clean bit of lapel this things finished i cant bring it home to my wife good point said milo get the hell outta here he returned simonss wallet and keys and put him in his toyota simons drove off quickly sped up to broadway turned right without a signal that said milo was fun he checked out his own clothing clean i said i already looked he walked me to the seville just as we got there a voice from behind mellow cultured just loud enough to be audible said gentlemen police gentlemen the tall black man in the gray suit stood on the sidewalk maybe ten feet away hands laced in front smiling warmly working hard at nonthreatening what said milo hand trailing down toward his gun might i talk to you gentlemen please about one of the people in there who albin larsen said the man what about him the man talked through his smile may we talk somewhere in private why said milo the things i have to say sir they are not nice this is not a nice man chapter milo said come forward very slowly keeping your hands clear good now show me some identification the man complied drew out a shiny black billfold removed a business card and held it out milo read it showed it to me heavy stock white paper engraved beautifully protais bumaya special envoy republic of rwanda west coast consulate montgomery street suite san francisco ca acceptable sir said bumaya for the time being thank you sir might i have your name sturgis perhaps bumaya was expecting a warmer introduction because his smile finally faded theres a place a tavern up the block might we convene there yeah said milo lets convene the tavern was on the opposite side of broadway between fourth and fifth a windowless dive named the seabreeze with wishfully tudor trim and a rough saltravaged door that had once passed for english oak remnant of the santa monica that had existed between the two population waves that built the beachside city stodgy midwestern burghers streaming westward for warmth at the turn of the twentieth century and seventy years later leftleaning social activists taking advantage of the best rent control in california in between thered been the kind of corruption you get when you mix tourists hustlers balmy weather the ocean but santa monica remained a place molded by selfrighteousness milo eyed the seabreezes unfriendly facade you been here before bumaya shook his head the proximity seemed advantageous milo shoved at the door and we entered long low dim room three crude booths to the left a wooden bar refinished in glossy acrylic to the right eight serious drinkers grayhaired and grayfaced bellied up against the vinyl cushion facing a bartender who looked as if he sampled the wares at regular intervals yeast and hops and body odor filled air humid enough for growing ferns nine stares as we entered frankie valli on the jukebox let us know we were too good to be true we took the farthest booth the bartender ignored us finally one of the drinkers came over paunchy guy in a green polo shirt and gray pants a little chrome change machine hanging from his belt said he was official he looked at bumaya scowled whatll it be milo ordered scotch and i said me too protais bumaya said i would like a boodles and tonic please we got gilbeys that will be fine green shirt smirked it better be bumaya watched him waddle off and said apparently i have offended someone they probably dont like tall dark strangers said milo black people maybe that too bumaya smiled i had heard this was a progressive city lifes full of surprises said milo so what can i do for you mr bumaya bumaya started to answer stopped himself as the drinks arrived thank you sir he told green shirt anything else if youve got some salted peanuts said milo if not just a little peace and quiet friend green shirt glared at him milo downed his scotch and another of these too green shirt took milos shot glass crossed over to the bar brought back a refill and a bowl of nubby pretzels these salty enough milo ate a pretzel and grunted gonna earn my stroke honestly huh milo flashed his wolfs grin green shirt blinked backed away when hed reclaimed his stool milo gulped another pretzel said yeah its a real progressive city protais bumaya sat there trying not to show that he was studying us in the miserly light his skin was the color of a damson plum wideset almond eyes moved very little his hands were huge but his wrists were spindly even taller than milo sixfour or five but highwaisted he sat low in the booth gave a strangely boyish impression the three of us drank for a while without talking frankie valli gave way to dusty springfield only wanting to be with us bumaya seemed to enjoy his gin and t so said milo whats with albin larsen a progressive man lieutenant sturgis you know different you were at the bookstore observing him said bumaya who says it was him we were observing who then said bumaya george issa qumdis gives political speeches all the time he is a public man what could a policeman learn from watching him and that fellow in the navy jacket impulsive but not a serious criminal thats your diagnosis huh he sprays paint said bumaya dismissively you questioned and released him you are a detective no milo reread bumayas business card special envoy if i call this number and ask about you what are they going to tell me at this hour sir you will get a recorded message instructing you to call during regular business hours should you call during business hours you will encounter another recorded message replete with many choices should you make the correct choice you will eventually find yourself talking to a charming woman named lucy who is the secretary to mr lloyd mackenzie esquire an articulate charming san francisco attorney who serves as de facto west coast consul for my country the republic of rwanda mr mackenzie in turn will inform you that i am a legitimate representative of my country bumaya flashed teeth should you choose to avoid all that you may simply believe me milo drained his second scotch strong abrasive stuff i was working at getting the first shot down special envoy he repeated you a cop not currently but i have done police work then cut the bullshit and tell me what you want bumayas eyes glinted he wrapped long manicured fingers around his glass poked a finger into the drink pushed the lime wedge around i wish for albin larsen to get what he deserves which is punishment bumaya reached into an inner pocket and produced his shiny black billfold flipping it open he fingered what appeared to be a stitched seam the stitching parted exposing a slit reaching into the slit he drew out a tiny white envelope gazing across the table bumaya flicked the edge of the envelope with a shiny fingernail how familiar are you with the genocide that ravaged my country in i know that lots of people died and that the world stood by and watched said milo nearly a million people said bumaya the most frequently quoted figure is eight hundred thousand but i believe that to be an underestimate revisionists who wish to minimize the horror claim only three hundred thousand were butchered only said milo bumaya nodded my belief backed up by observation and knowledge of specifics is that when deaths from severe injuries are factored in the final number will be closer to one million or perhaps even more what does any of that have to do with albin larsen larsen was in my country during the genocide working for the united nations in kigali our capital during the worst of the atrocities consulting a human rights consultant what did that mean in the context of your country whatever larsen wished it to mean the united nations spends billions of dollars paying the salaries of people who do exactly as they please not a fan of world bodies mr bumaya the united nations did nothing to stop the genocide in my country on the contrary certain individuals on the un payroll played active and passive roles in the mass murders international bodies have always been good at condemning tragedy after the fact but staggeringly useless at preventing it bumaya raised his glass and took a long hard swallow the small white envelope remained wedged between the fingers of his free hand youre saying larsen was involved in the genocide said milo are we talking active or passive is there a difference humor me sir i do not know detective sturgis said bumaya yet he glanced at the bar want another i do but i will decline bumaya flicked the white envelope again in january of a man named laurent nzabakaza was arrested for complicity in the rwandan genocide prior to that nzabakaza had served as administrator of a prison on the outskirts of kigali most of the prisoner were hutus when the violence began nzabakaza unlocked their cells armed them with spears and machetes and clubs and whatever firearms he could find and pointed them at tutsi homes it was a family outing nzabakazas wife and teenage sons participated cheering the murderers on as they raped and hacked before all that finally came to light and nzabakaza was arrested in geneva he found himself a new job working as an investigator for the international criminal tribunal for rwanda albin larsen helped him obtain that position larsen has done the same for other individuals several of whom have subsequently been identified as genocide suspects the bad guys are working for the court thats supposed to be trying them imagine goering or goebbels being paid by the munich tribunal is larsen some sort of bigwig among the hutus larsen was is an opportunist his credentials are impeccable doctorate in psychology a professor both in sweden and the united states he has been on the un payroll and that of several humanitarian organizations for over two decades human rights expert i said bumaya opened the little white envelope and removed a small color photo that he laid in the middle of the table two smiling boys in white shirts and plaid school ties gleaming ebony skin clear eyes cropped hair white teeth one slightly older than the other i guessed nine and eleven these lads said bumaya are joshua and samuel bangwa at the time this picture was taken they were eight and ten joshua was an excellent student who loved science and samuel the older boy was an excellent athlete their parents were seventh day adventist elders who taught at a church school in the village of butare shortly after kigali fell to the hutu insurgents butare was targeted because it had been a primarily tutsi town both of the boys parents were hacked to death by laurent nzabakazas troops their mother was repeatedly raped pre and postmortem joshua and samuel hidden in a closet and watching through a crack in the door escaped and were eventually spirited out of rwanda by an adventist minister as crucial witnesses against nzabakaza they were taken to lagos nigeria and put up at a un boarding school that catered to diplomats children and the offspring of nigerian government officials two weeks after laurent nzabakaza was apprehended in switzerland the boys failed to show up for breakfast a search of their room found them in their beds their throats had been cut ear to ear a single stroke of the razor for each child no wasted energy a pro said milo bumaya extracted the lime wedge from his glass sucked on it put it back the school was a guarded secure facility detective and there were no signs of forced entry the case remains unsolved and albin larsen was a psychological consultant to the school though seldom on the premises however one week before the boys were slaughtered he arrived in lagos and took a room in the faculty wing the alleged reason for his visit was a un site certification while he was there he engaged in other local activities as well such as allow me to finish please said bumaya it has been learned that larsen was not due to inspect the school for several months and chose to step up the schedule you think he killed the two kids said milo bumayas brow creased i have learned nothing to indicate that larsen has ever acted violently however he is known to have associated with violent people and to facilitate their actions what would you as a detective say about the following confluence of facts larsens friendship with laurent nzabakaza the threat the boys represented to nzabakaza larsens unexpected presence at the school milo picked up the photo studied the smiling faces protais bumaya said im certain larsen hired someone to slaughter those children am i able to prove it not yet you were sent here to prove it among other assignments such as factfinding find any facts said milo bumaya sat back and exhaled so far i have not accomplished much that is why when i saw you observing larsen i thought aha this is my opportunity he flattened his hands on the table his knuckles were gray would there be any way for you to share information with me it doesnt work that way long silence bumaya said i see what else do you know about larsen said milo in terms of what were his other local activities professor larsen is a man of farreaching interests said bumaya but for my purposes they are not relevant i care about my purposes said milo he was involved in programs bumaya uttered the word as if it were a curse un sponsored programs private humanitarian programs larsen affixes himself to programs for personal gain misery pimp said milo bumaya smiled faintly i have never heard of that expression i like it yes that is an apt description are we talking big money bumayas smile stretched wider one would think that with all the paperwork bureaucracies require someone would ascertain that there are only so many hours in a week i said larsen pads his bills consultant here consultant there to believe his vouchers he is the busiest man in the world milo said what kind of programs are we talking about i am familiar only with those in my country and in lagos for the most part we are talking about schools and welfare societies at least a dozen when one examines the paperwork in toto one finds that larsen was working hours per week any of those programs involve prison rehabilitation said milo bumaya smiled what said milo prison work is how larsen came to know laurent nzabakaza he obtained lutheran church funding for a psychological training program to help prisoners in nzabakazas prison overcome their criminal tendencies sentries for justice substantial payments to nzabakaza helped is the expression grease the runway the skids said milo grease the skids ah said bumaya in any event the prisoners treated by sentries for justice were the exact group armed by nzabakanza and aimed at butare larsen had already begun an identical program in lagos and when the genocide ended his rwandan activities he began concentrating more on the nigerian branch one big dark hand closed around his glass i believe i will take another drink milo took the glass went to the bar brought it back filled high bumaya drank half thank you larsen attempted to latch himself onto the bosnian crisis but failed because of too much competition recently hes expressed considerable interest in the palestinian issue was one of the foreigners who traveled to jenin to express support for arafat during the israeli siege he supplied the un with stories about the jenin massacre the one that never occurred said milo yes a brief but inflammatory international fraud ensued and larsen was paid for his consulting his entrée to that region is likely because a cousin of his torvil larsen is an official with unrwa in gaza when international conflict arises larsen will always be there to make a few dollars if he is not stopped you aiming to stop him said milo i said bumaya patting his chest am a factseeker not a man of action milo looked at the photo of the smiling boys where in la are you staying at the house of a friend out came milos pad name address and phone number is that necessary why said milo would you have a problem telling me bumaya lowered his eyes finished his drink im staying with charlotte and david kabanda he spelled the surname slowly they are physicians medical residents at the veterans hospital in westwood address said milo charlotte and david know me as a university classmate i studied law they believe im a lawyer milo tapped his pad address bumaya recited an apartment number on ohio phone bumaya rattled off seven digits if you call charlotte and david and divulge what ive told you they will be confused they believe i am conducting legal research their apartment your sole place of residence said milo yes detective youre an envoy but you dont get hotel chits we are a very poor country detective struggling to reunify mr lloyd mackenzie our de facto consul serves us at a discount rate a genuine humanitarian milo said what else can you tell me about larsen i have told you much shall i repeat the question a oneway avenue said bumaya uhhuh bumaya showed two rows of even pearly teeth that is all i have to say about the matter okay said milo closing the pad sir said bumaya it is in both our interests to cooperate sir said milo if theres something you need to know ill inform you meanwhile be careful a foreign agent getting involved in an ongoing investigation wouldnt be a good thing detective i have no intention of then well have no problem said milo bumaya frowned milo said want another drink its on me no said bumaya no thank you the snapshot of the murdered boys remained on the table he picked it up placed it back in his snakeskin billfold you pretty good with firearms mr bumaya being a former cop and all that i know how to shoot however i am not traveling armed so if i look around your friends apartment no guns are going to show up not one said bumaya his mouth moved around covering a swath of emotional territory until it finally settled on a small flat smile perhaps i have not made myself clear detective sturgis my sole purpose is to gather facts and to report back to my superiors all this trouble for albin larsen he and others others here in la here other cities other countries bumayas eyes shut and fluttered open his irises once clear and inquisitive had clouded i will be doing this for a very long time we watched him leave the bar milo said think i was rough on him a bit i sympathize with the cause but hes all about his own goals and i dont need complications if i can get larsen off the street ill be doing bumaya and his superiors the biggest favor of all makes sense i said does it he frowned those two boys he looked away summoned green shirt for a third shot green shirt looked down at me you too i placed my hand atop my glass and shook my head when milos refill arrived i said bumaya has his own agenda but what he said firms things up for us larsens got a history of exactly the kind of scam we theorized about and he uses violence when it suits him the quiet ones milo muttered tonight when he introduced issa qumdis he had plenty of fire ideology and profit he said misery pimp i like that he drank i said just out of curiosity how do you know so much about issa qumdis what cops dont read never knew you to be political he shrugged rick leaves books and magazines around i pick em up one of them happened to be the jewish beacon with the article that claimed issa qumdis invented himself never knew rick to be political either he never was even gay issues didnt mobilize him he stretched his neck and winced his parents are holocaust survivors after all these years i knew little about rick about milos life when he closed the door of his little house in west hollywood he said they were always getting after him about it the holocaust he nodded they wanted him to be more aware of being jewish there was always baggage the gay thing complicated it when his folks found out they freaked out the holocaust got all mixed up in it his mother crying like someone had died his father yelling at him and telling him he was stupid because now the nazis would have two reasons to gas him he drank more scotch swirled it around like mouthwash hes an only child it hasnt been easy what made it better was the passage of time and his parents getting older eventually he and his old man could talk about it something milo had never experienced before his own father died then came september and rick changed he said he took it personally the fact that arabs were behind it the revisionist theories blaming the jews all the antisemitic swill coming out of saudi arabia and egypt all of a sudden rick got more interested in being jewish started reading up on jewish history israel started giving money to zionist causes subscribing to magazines that you happened to pick up the issa qumdis thing caught my eye because the basic point was that the guy was a scamster but that it hadnt impeded his academic career that always fascinates me how little reality has to do with the way life plays out he was something wasnt he tenure personified that cultured stance then coming out and saying people should be killed pretty damn hateful for a college professor lots of hatred in academia i said youve seen that personally its usually more subtle but youd be amazed at what goes on at faculty parties when the scholarly set thinks no ones listening wonder if issa qumdis spouts off that way at harvard dont colleges have hate speech regulations the rules are enforced selectively whose ox is being gored yeah its a sweet world enough about that time to focus on the evil dr larsen learn anything about any local scam not yet i asked olivia to look into it gave her the sentries program as a lead because i came across it surfing sentries for justice olivias as good as it gets by the way franco gull finally broke routine and went to a health club pumped iron ignored the ladies went home so maybe he knows about the scam and what the stakes are the guy tends to get emotional maybe he can be wedged and cracked open make sense youd be showing your hand yeah but if i dont make any other progress soon what choice do i have he rubbed his face okay ill wait till you hear from olivia but eventually im gonna have to make a decision his cell phone beeped he slapped it against his ear sturgis when really okay give me the number his pad and pen were still out and he scrawled hastily clicked the phone shut with a strange smile on his face well well well who was that detective binchy obedient lad that he is he is at his desk wrapping up his paperwork before he sets out for another looksee on gull a call just came in for me and he took it sonny koppel wanting to talk hes dining coffee shop on pico im invited to drop by that include me sure he said im including you chapter the coffee shop was called genes and it was one of the few bright spots on a dark quiet block south side of pico just a few yards from the traffic on la cienega a short stroll from the eastern border of milos district it was tenforty when we got there and the place was fully lit long skinny room with grubby vinyl floors a formica counter and seven matching tables bleached by high wattage a sign in front said open to midnight inside two young guys in oversized eyeglasses whispered conspiratorially over coffee pie and the bound screenplay placed equidistant between them an old woman gummed an egg salad sandwich behind her a muscular man in gray work clothes read old news in the morning paper and worked on a hamburger shrouded in a limp gray raincoat sonny koppel sat at the counter forking bacon and eggs into his mouth the counterman ignored koppel as he scrubbed a deep fryer when we approached he turned briefly then returned to his chore koppel wiped his mouth got off his stool and carried his plate his napkin and his utensils to a front table near the door but away from the other diners under his raincoat he wore mocha brown sweats with white piping loosely laced tennis shoes covered smallish wide feet hed shaved recently had nicked himself several times his coffee cup remained behind and milo brought it over to the table the counterman turned and said anything for you guys no thanks koppel was still on his feet when milo brought the coffee cup over thanks he said one sec returning to the counter he snagged ketchup and tabasco sauce finally he pulled out a chair sat wiped his lips bounced a fork tine against the rim of his plate and smiled at his plate breakfast food i like it for dinner to each his own said milo what can we do for you that photograph of that girl do you still have it with you milo reached into his jacket pocket produced the death shot and handed it to koppel koppel studied it and nodded when you first showed it to me there was something about it but i couldnt place it really had nothing i could tell you so i said id never seen her i really wasnt sure i had he licked his lips but it stuck in my mind now you think you know her said milo i cant be certain said koppel if it is her i only saw her a couple of times literally two times he glanced at the photo again the way she is here its hard to say deathll do that to you koppel swallowed air forked a strip of bacon lost it midair and watched it land just shy of his plate he picked it up between his fingers set it back next to the mound of eggs kissed the grease on his fingertips where do you think you mightve seen her mr koppel said milo she might be a girl i saw at jerry quicks office hanging around with jerrys secretary jerrys secretary angie paul you know angie personally i know her from coming over to talk to jerry about the rent koppel scratched the side of his nose youre interested in her as well she always made me wonder about what she didnt seem to do much she wasnt who id pick as a secretary then again she probably didnt have to make much of an impression whys that not much traffic at jerrys office ive never seen anyone there but the two of them and possibly this girl maybe said koppel only maybe milo said you dont drop in very often at mr quicks office but this girl was there twice koppel flushed i dont all im saying what do i know if i wasted your time im sorry milo placed an index finger on a corner of the death shot sonny koppel said this must seem strange to you first i say i dont know her then i call you milo smiled im just trying to do the right thing lieutenant we appreciate that sir what else can you tell us about this girl just that said koppel peering at the death shot for several more seconds it could be her a girl hanging around with angie in mr quicks front office that was the first time two three months ago the second time was more recent six weeks ago i saw the two of them her and angie as they left the building together it was lunchtime i assumed they were going out to lunch whered they go to eat i didnt follow them lieutenant i was there to see jerry about the rent yes koppel scratched behind his ear im getting the feeling that by trying to do whats right im complicating my life in what way sir like i said it must seem funny to you koppel pushed the photo toward milo anyway thats all i know milo passed the shot from hand to hand like a threecard monte artist hanging around with angie talking like girls do girls just wanna have fun said milo they didnt seem to be having fun said koppel what i mean is they werent laughing or giggling in fact the time i saw them leaving together i figured it for some sort of serious discussion because when they saw me they shut up fast serious discussion on the way to lunch maybe they werent going to eat im assuming because it was lunchtime did angie call the other girl by name no what else can you tell me about her physically she wasnt tall average slim she had a good figure but she was a bit she didnt look like someone whod grown up with money nouveau riche said milo no said koppel more her clothes were nice but maybe a little too obvious like she wanted to be noticed maybe she wore a bit too much makeup i cant really remember i dont want to tell you things that arent accurate a little flashy koppel shook his head that wasnt it i dont want to be cruel she looked a little trashy like her hair no hair is that blond naturally unless youre five years old right sounds like you had a good look at her i noticed her said koppel she was pretty and shapely im a guy you know how it is milo smiled faintly anything else no thats it koppel picked up his fork the eggs had hardened he speared a big clot and shoved it into his mouth the two guys with the screenplay got up from their table looking vexed and left the coffee shop in silence milo said last time we spoke you mentioned your exwife wanting to use the bottom floor of her building for group therapy she was supposed to give me a final answer before she before her death she give you any details about the nature of the therapy no said koppel why would she no particular reason said milo still gathering facts have you made any progress at all milo shrugged sonny koppel said whatever the group therapy thing was its not going to happen albin larsen called me yesterday said it was okay to rent out the bottom floor mary was the glue that held them together with her gone it wouldnt surprise me if larsen and gull tried to break their lease they dont like the building im not sure theyll be willing to take on the financial burden mary got a sweetheart rent deal from me theres no lease its month to month youre gonna raise it hey said koppel business is business you have a problem with them i had very little to do with them like i said mary held things together whenever there was some business to discuss a repair whatever mary was the one whod call koppel smiled i didnt mind it was a chance for us to talk now he threw up his hands milo said she was the business person but it was larsen who got her interested in halfway houses he struck me as an idea guy said koppel but when it came to the nuts and bolts it was all mary mary and you i had nothing to do with the daytoday operations i just know something about real estate like getting government funding said milo koppel nodded no blink no tremble not a single errant muscle did your exwife ever ask for help getting some sort of government funding for the group therapy she planned downstairs why would she what would i know about therapy youre a savvy person in my limited sphere said koppel i already told you mary never consulted me on professional matters he twirled his fork its getting to me marys death pretty stupid huh we hadnt been together for years how often did we talk once a month tops but i find myself thinking about it for someone you know to go like that he caressed his voluminous belly this is my second dinner i do that add meals when things pile up as if to illustrate he ingested two bacon strips mary was a powerful person he said between mouthfuls its a big loss milo waltzed around the prison rehab issue but koppel wasnt biting when koppel called over to the counterman for a double order of rye toast and jelly and tea with honey we left him opening marmalade packets and returned to the seville milo said so whats his game sounding you out and letting you know he knew nothing about mary lous professional dealings nudging us closer to the blonde closer to jerry quick i said deflecting attention from himself a big man who dances fast larsens call about not needing the space think theyre pulling up the tents probably the blonde hanging with angie wonder if it really happened one way to find out i said angela pauls last known address was a bigbox fiftyunit apartment complex just west of laurel canyon boulevard and north of victory in an undistinguished section of north hollywood the freeway was a mile south near riverside drive but you could still hear it rumbling insistent the air was ten degrees warmer than back in the city a sign in front of the complex said two months of free satellite tv was included with new leases and that this was a security building security meant cardkey subterranean parking and a pair of lowgated entrances all that had no effect on the litter in the gutters or the splotchy blemishes that stained the facade paintedover graffiti no parking spots milo told me to pull into a red zone near the corner hed pay for the ticket the twin gates meant two groups of mail slots a pauls button was on the north end of the building apt no answer no managers unit listed back to the southern gate apt no name just mgr it was pm milo jabbed the button i said lets hope for a night owl whats a little sleep deprivation in the service of justice a male voice said yes police hold on i said he doesnt sound surprised maybe the tenants are interesting a buzzer sounded and we pushed through the gate the fifty units were arranged in two tiers that looked down on a long rectangular courtyard that should have held a pool instead there was sketchy grass and lawn chairs and a collapsed umbrella a couple of utility doors on the ground floor were marked to parking lot three satellite dishes rimmed the flat roof tv sounds washed across the courtyard then music a smudge of human voice breaking glass the managers unit was just to the right and a man stood in the open doorway young short maybe thirty with a head shaved clean and a little frizzle of chin beard he wore gym shorts a baggy white tshirt that read wolf trap and rubber flipflops when we reached him he said i was expecting uniforms you get a lot of uniforms you know noise calls and such milo flashed his id lieutenant is this serious or something not yet mr chad ballou he extended his hand for a soulshake thought better of it and rotated into the conventional position milo said lots of noise calls ballous eyes traced the tiers not more than youd expect with all these people i tell the tenants to let me know first if theres a problem but sometimes they dont which is fine i dont really want to deal with their stuff you manage the units fulltime said milo chad ballou said relatively fulltime my parents own the place im at csun studying classical guitar they think i should study computers the deal is i do this instead of their just giving me money he smiled cheerfully so whats up were looking for angela paul ballou touched his chin growth with his right hand his nails were longish and glossed those on his left hand were clipped short paul fortythree thats the one the stripper you know that for a fact she put it on her lease application said ballou brought in pay stubs from a club to prove it my folks wouldnt have approved but i said hey why not her incomes better than a lot of the losers who try to get in ballou grinned they put me in charge i figure its up to me to decide anyway shes been no problem pays her rent whats the deal we want to question her about an ongoing investigation have you tried her unit no answer guess shes out she out a lot i wouldnt know said ballou you have a pretty good view from your place said milo when im here im mostly practicing or studying unless theres a complaint and she never complained about anything she have visitors i couldnt tell you that either i havent really seen her much fortythrees all the way on the north end upstairs she can take the corner staircase down to the parking lot door go in and out without being noticed so youve never seen her with anyone else nothing registers milo showed him the shot of the blond girl ballous eyes widened she looks dead she is wow so this is really serious is she going to be in trouble the stripper all i need is for some big mess that freaks out my parents milo waved the photo never seen her never what happened to her someone made her dead jesus youre not going to tell me if i have something to worry about if angie pauls body is lying moldering in her unit you might chad ballou blanched shit youre serious you mind taking a look ill give you the key said ballou you look legally said milo that would pose a problem you as the manager have a right to make reasonable inspections say if theres a suspected gas leak or a circuit goes out any maintenance issue ballou stared at him moldering sure sure can i just open the door and you look fine should we do it now in a sec said milo first tell me where ms paul does her stripping that i can do that i can definitely do we followed ballou into his apartment neat sparse devoid of character with a sixtyinch digital tv in the front room along with three classical guitars on stands the set was tuned to mtv heavy metal band high volume ballou turned it down saying im eclectic in the kitchen next to the fridge stood a trio of threedrawer files ballou opened the center drawer and fished out a black file folder he opened it thumbed said here we go and held out a sheet of paper angie pauls rental application shed claimed income of three thousand a month net and a note in the margin said verified under place of employment shed listed the hungry bull club wla branch exotic dancer my eyes dropped to the bottom of the form personal references rick savarin manager thb christina marsh coworker christa or crystal i said you ever check out her references ballou said she showed me pay stubs what about previous landlords said milo isnt it standard to call them i think said ballou that she said she was from out of town where is this going to matter oh man milo said where out of town i dont remember she made enough money to handle the rent easily and came up with first last and damage deposit so she stripped big deal shes been an okay tenant milo folded the application and put it in his pocket lets have a look at her place angie pauls unit was similar in dimension to ballous also neatly kept with a smaller tv cheap furniture cotton throws a couple of roseandkitten prints on the walls the smell of heavy musky perfume reached the doorway where i stood near chad ballou milo disappeared into the bedroom area ballou tapped his foot and said so far so good i smiled it didnt comfort him a minute later milo emerged saying nothing moldering when ms paul shows up dont tell her we were here but give me a call he handed ballou a card sure can i lock up yup the three of us descended the stairs and milo had ballou point out angie pauls parking slot empty she still driving a camaro think so said ballou yeah bright blue we returned to the seville half past midnight no parking ticket lady lucks smiling down on us said milo finally i said christina marsh yeah could be i started up the engine and he slapped a manic chacha beat on the dashboard three scotches and lord knew how many consecutive work hours and he was running a mental marathon good morning i said you tired not a bit me neither whens the last time you visited a strip joint not for a while ive been to a few he said big grin seen women strip too chapter the hungry bull west la branch was on cotner off olympic in an industrial zone that smelled like rubber cement next to the club was a rollsroyce junkyard husks of onceglorious chassis and auto viscera piled high behind chainlink not much farther was a coop art gallery where a gifted painter had been strangled to death in a bathroom the last case milo and i had worked together if he was thinking about that he wasnt showing it the club was housed in a windowless hangar painted matte black doublequilted chromium doors looked tacked on a neon sign promised strong drinks and beautiful women the industrial setting was perfect no daytime neighbors with nimby fever no one to complain about the hyperdisco twofour boogie beat punching through black stucco the strip joint billed itself as a gentlemans club the parking lot was full of dusty compacts and pickups and the two darkhaired guys guarding the doors were elephantine and tattooed somehow i doubted wed find jowly halefellows savoring cognac and fine cigars amid booklined mahogany splendor milo showed his badge to elephant one and received a bowandscrape yessir what can i do for you rick savarin on tonight the bouncers cantaloupe face was bisected by an old gray knife scar that ran from the middle of his brow changed direction across the bridge of his nose meandered across his lips and terminated in the crook of a chin you could lean on for support yessir hes in his office someone will direct you sir thanks youre welcome sir elephant two even bigger and sunglassed held the door immediately inside yet another giant this one lanky and longhaired and caribbean ushered us to the left down a short corridor that ended at swinging doors also quilted in black vinyl the main rooms color scheme was black with crimson trim three steps led to a sunken pit where intentlooking men ringed a circular stage two women danced naked pulling off some pretty good gymnastic moves and making love to stainlesssteel poles both were ultrablond bighaired railthin with breasts inflated well past biology each wore a red garter on her left thigh the girl with the sunray tattoo bluing her entire back had more cash stuffed in hers we reached the black vinyl doors the lanky giant pointed and pushed them open he stayed behind as we entered a short vestibule with two unmarked wooden doors and one with an aluminum sign that read manager before milo could knock the door opened and a young man wearing an extravagant black toupee smiled and held out his hand rick savarin come on in savarin had on a softdraping powder blue suit with shawllapels black silk tshirt blue gucci loafers with no socks a gold chain around a tootan neck his office was small and functional and smelled like a shirley temple on his desk was a framed photo of a plainlooking woman and a puzzled toddler savarin said my sister back in iowa sit down make yourselves comfortable can i get you guys something to drink no thanks said milo you from iowa too savarin smiled long time ago farm boy that was a real long time ago savarin slid behind his desk sat wheeled his chair to the wall braced himself with a loafer on a drawer handle on the wall were several nude calendars with the hungry bull logo and one from a liquor distributor so he said tenting his hands he looked around thirtyfive was well built with puffy blue eyes and a tense mouth when the mouth opened a band of flashy dentition blared forth snowy caps the hairpiece looked borrowed milo said angie paul angie said savarin she worked here a while back her stage name was angie blue the nails the nails the gstring she drove a blue car its a competitive environment and the girls figure they need something distinctive in angies case a nice rack wouldve helped but she convinced herself blue was a big deal savarin chuckled so whats she been up to were looking for her as a person of interest said milo when did she stop working here four months ago did she quit or was she fired she quit said savarin one of the customers one of her regulars swept her off her feet fraternizing with the customers its against the rules and we do our best to enforce it but the girls who work here arent exactly into rules who was the regular some middleaged guy used to show up two three times a week then we wouldnt see him then hed be back to see angie always said savarin lucky for her he passed a hand over his chest some guys like the natural look with all the silicone and saline i see all day frankly a girl with a sweet face and a natural rack is a turnon for me but most customers he shook his head even guys who like natural want something and angie was pretty near flat i didnt want to hire her but she had good hips and a good butt moved good during her audition also she caught me at a time when i was low on girls this regular really went for her he came only on days when she was dancing sat right in front kept his eyes on her nonstop she started doing her thing for him he tipped her heavy i guess they developed a relationship savarin scratched his head i never saw her do a lap dance for him that shouldve tipped me off how so he had no need for lap because he was getting it after hours describe this guy middleaged pretty ordinary said savarin i never learned his name because he always paid cash and sat by himself and one time when i went over to ask if there was anything he needed he blew me off whatd he say he just waved his hand like dont bother me im concentrating fine with me it was his cash he drank mostly soft stuff but a lot of it five six cokes a night with lime occasionally hed want some rum in it middleaged said milo id say fifty six feet tall kind of skinny kind of slumpy slumpy standing bent over you know like something was sitting on his shoulders milo nodded what else savarin said lets see gray hair gray combover savarin flinched i wouldnt call it a combover not a formal sprayedinplace combover this was more like he was shoving what he had to one side and forgetting about it what about his clothes casual sweaters i can tell you what he drove little baby benz black or maybe gray dark mr businessman i figured him for money some guy with an office a lawyer or something he always come in by himself always kept to himself too angie ever mention his name im thinking said savarin maybe larry she only mentioned it one time and that was when she gave her notice to be honest i wasnt sorry to see her go small rack said milo that and not the best attitude up there onstage its all about putting yourself in a special place a giving place youve got to convince the clients you care about them angie had a sullen thing going on some guys dig that the thrill of the chase you know but most of em want big smiles this big welcome thats what were all about welcoming the clientele hospitality said savarin when someone spunkier came along id probably have let angie go you can teach someone moves but if they dont want to learn hospitality you cant teach them so she came in here and gave notice and said she was going off with larry i think it was larry said savarin dont ask me to swear on it what she say about him she said shed gotten a better offer from one of her regulars making it sound like she was getting some kind of important job but i figured he was putting her up on the side whys that guy like that said savarin money to burn shes thirty years younger than him you dont come in here looking for office managers she said he had an office maybe this was months ago could the regulars name have been jerry said milo savarin brightened you know i think it was larry jerry who is he a guy he hurt her milo shook his head what about christina marsh christi friend of angies referred angie to us she quit too maybe a month after angie her i was sorry to see go not huge in the chest department but big enough and with a real nice shape to them like pears you know sweet little pink nipples she didnt have to rouge em her whole body had this milkfed thing going on limber too she could really work the pole whyd she quit savarin shook his head her i dont know she just stopped showing up i called her once twice she didnt return i moved on he held out his hands this business pays to be philosophical you have a number for her probably somewhere the owners come in periodically and clear paper but maybe somethings still there who are the owners consortium of chineseamerican businessmen lucky guys business is good said milo business is great wish i had a piece i get bonuses though wheres corporate headquarters said milo monterey park the original club is there it was designed for an asian clientele there are seven others besides this one ontario san bernardino riverside all the way down to san diego county my cash flows among the best any other owners besides the guys from monterey park nope who owns the building savarin smiled nice little eightyyearold lady from palm springs who inherited from her husband grace baumgarten she came in one time watched the girls dance said she remembered when she could move like that anyone else involved in the business besides employees any other owners no thats it what about bouncers any others besides the guys on tonight i use some cal state football players from time to time said savarin ever use a guy named ray degussa nope whos he a guy okay i wont ask said savarin but can i ask why you want to know about angie and this jerry guy and christi what i mean to say is it something that could affect business milo showed him the death shot savarins tan lost some bronze thats christi oh man what the hell happened to her thats what were trying to find out christi said savarin oh man she was basically a nice kid not too smart but nice talk about your farm girl i think she was from minnesota or someplace natural blonde oh man thats a shame big shame said milo let me see if i can find you that paperwork out in the vestibule savarin unlocked one of the unmarked doors on a closet full of boxes and bottles of cleaning fluids he rummaged through file boxes it took a while but he came up with a single sheet of pink paper labeled employee data that listed a social security number and a mailing address for christina marsh and nothing else vanowen boulevard north hollywood not far from angie pauls apartment complex christina marsh had begun working at the club eight months ago stopped showing up six months later soon after gavin had begun therapy milo said theres no phone number here savarin took a look at the sheet guess not i think she said she hadnt gotten one yet just moved or something like that from minnesota i think it was minnesota she looked minnesota real creamy sweet kid not bright i said when she filled this out said savarin it took her a real long time and she was moving her lips but she was a great worker uninhibited i said shed squat for a dollar tip show you everything but there was nothing foxy about it sexy but not foxy sexy because it wasnt foxy said savarin what im trying to say is there was nothing teasy about her it was like fucking the pole and showing everything was just a way to show off what nature gave her wholesome you know guys like that milo said did she mention where she worked before savarin shook his head when i saw how she moved i didnt ask any more questions she have any regulars no she wasnt that way she circulated unlike angie angie knew she couldnt compete physically so she concentrated on finding one guy really worked him christi was a people person pulled in max tips thats why i was surprised when she didnt show up how long ago was she when did it happen couple of weeks ago said milo oh so she was doing something in between any idea what id say dancing at another club but id have found out the club grapevine savarin nodded its a small world girl moves to the competition you hear about it whos the competition savarin rattled off a list of clubs and milo copied them down the girls working tonight he said any of them know christi or angie doubt it none of them have been here longer than a couple of months not at this branch anyway thats our big thing we cycle the talent i said helps avoid too many jerrys keeps everything fresh said savarin milo said its a small world maybe one of the girls knew angie or christi from before you can go backstage and talk to them but youd probably be wasting your time well said milo im no stranger to that backstage was a cluttered corridor crowded with costumes on racks and makeup on tables bottles of aspirin and mydol lotions and hair clips ambitious wigs on styrofoam forms three girls lounged in robes smoking a fourth slender and dark sat naked with one leg propped on a table trimming her pubis with a safety razor up close the pancake makeup caked up close the girls looked like teenagers playing dressdown none of them knew angela paul or christina marsh and when milo showed them the death shot their eyes grew frightened and wounded the girl with the razor began to cry we muttered some words of comfort and left the club the detectives room was empty we continued to milos office and he kept the door open and stretched in his chair it was nearly am he said so whatre they doing in minnesota milking the cows harvesting wild rice he shook his head milkfed i said too early to start calling locals he rubbed his eyes want coffee no thanks he pulled out the picture of christi marsh and stared at it finally a name switching on his computer he ran her name through ncic the local databases no hits not even a drivers license and her social security number pulled up no record of employment phantom girl he said if she was freelancing at a cash business i said thered be no need for recordkeeping a pro like you suspected so whered she meet angie working at a club that doesnt file paper or angie was hooking too the vice guys didnt know christi because she was new in town hadnt gotten caught minnesota he said ill start calling there in a couple of hours got lots of calls to make sure you dont want some coffee im gonna have some no sleep for the weary i got out of the habit he pushed himself to his feet slouched away returned with a styrofoam cup plopping down he drank rubbed his eyes some more whens the last time you did sleep i said cant recall what youre fading im good for a while longer he put his cup down its like there are two parallel things going on the jerry quick side and the albin larsensonny koppel side im having trouble putting them together lets start with jerry shady guy sexually inappropriate uses prepaid phones travels a lot allegedly to trade metals but doesnt make much money at it doesnt pay his rent on time chases tail and doesnt bother to hide it from his wife when hes in town he leaves his wife alone at night so he can enjoy his favorite stripper eventually he hires her away to be his alleged secretary even though her nails are too damn long for typing savarin was probably right jerry kept angie on the side put her in the office as a way to make it look legit that way shed be in proximity if he felt like a little desktop aerobics now hes gone and so is angie the two of them hiding out together i said the question is hiding from what things are falling apart the scams gone bad jerry and angie know why gavin was murdered know they could be next he considered that i still cant see any role for quick in the scam but who knows what the hell hes really about okay so maybe he even feels guilty about gavin but most of all he doesnt want the truth to come out because thatll point the finger at him as helping cause his kids death he cleans out gavins room stashes sheila at her sisters plans to go back home and finish the cleanup but gets scared and lams taking angie with him shes got to be freaked out too losing her friend christi the girl she and jerry hooked up with gavin to keep gavin happy angie didnt seem freaked when we talked to her i said she blinked when you showed her the picture but thats still pretty cool true he said cool girl a pro in terms of jerrys role in the scam maybe he worked for sonny as a fixit guy some kind of procurer what if he hired angie away from the club for more than sex on the side a hookerstripper might know some cons and cons are raw meat for the scam jerrys a pimp theyd have bennett hacker and ray degussa to supply cons for all we know i said it was jerry who put hacker and degussa in contact with the others degussa is a bouncer and a guy like jerry who frequents strip clubs would meet bouncers through degussa jerry met hacker he introduced the two of them to sonny koppel who just happened to have an interest in some halfway houses jerrys being sonnys tenant was a front and sonny spun us that yarn about jerry not paying his rent to snow us and to distance himself from jerry an enterprising fellow like sonny wouldve seen the opportunity hes got the halfway houses and because of jerry quick the contacts toss in an exwife with an interest in prison reform and her partner a guy with a twentyyear history of making money off misery and it wouldve seemed perfect meeting of the nasty little minds he said perfect till it wasnt i said gavins accident started the downward spiral he underwent personality changes turned into a stalker got busted and needed courtordered therapy sonny could fix that by sending gavin to someone who could be counted upon to say the right things to the court but that good deed came back to bite him because gavin started thinking of himself as a muckraker he snooped and found some serious muck milo closed his eyes and sat without moving for a moment i thought hed fallen asleep then he sat up and stared at me blankly as if hed been dreaming i said you still with me slow nod jerry lied to us about the referral made up the story about dr silver being his golf partner precisely because he wanted to hide his ties to the group he suggested it was a sex crime another attempt to deflect you dear old dad he said claims to be a metals dealer but hes really a pimp with gavins stalking problem jerry probably figured he was being a great dad by setting him up with christi and gavin seemed happy bragged to kayla about his sex life with his new girlfriend the only trouble was his brain injury continued to skew his thinking he took down license numbers including his fathers someone found out and that got him and poor christi marsh killed mary lou figured it out and it scared the hell out of her bilking the department of corrections is one thing murders another maybe she pressured sonny and larsen to drop the whole thing she knew sonny carried a torch for her thought she had him under control but cornered sonny wasnt harmless at all and neither was albin larsen if bumaya can be believed about larsen were talking monster monster with a phd i said clever calculating dangerous mary lou overvalued her own charisma what about sheila in the dark about all of it sheilas got serious emotional problems she and jerry have been unavailable to each other for years but hes stuck by her for appearances now one kids out of the house and the others dead toss in some panic and it would be the perfect time for him to split appearances said milo the house the benz bh school district for the kids then gavin gets his cranium shaken up and it all falls apart what about the impalement the sexual angle for simple executions shooting wouldve been enough the impalements icing on the cake i said someone who enjoys killing someone whos done it before ray degussa he said he got up walked to the door looked up and down the empty corridor said its quiet and sat back down so mary scammed but couldnt handle murder she couldve rationalized the scam told herself they were doing good just padding the bill a bit who was the victim anyway a corrupt prison bureaucracy its exactly the line of bullshit an asshole like larsen wouldve fed her he frowned problem is this whole house of cards is predicated upon a scam and we dont even know one exists ill check with olivia in a few hours you really think mary lou would be foolish enough to threaten larsen and the others would she be blind to the kind of people she was dealing with believing your own pr can be very dangerous what about gull either he was involved or he wasnt i wonder why gavin fired him me too crazy kid he said stupid crazy kid crazy family what about the other kid in the family i said the one who didnt come home after her brother died sometimes its the ones who get away who have the most interesting things to say kelly the law student at bu her first year at law school would be over by now but she stayed in boston another item for the old todo list lots of todos i need to sleep we both do i said he struggled to his feet the rims of his eyes were scarlet and his face was gray enough he said lets get the hell outta here chapter the phone woke me up id gone to bed at am as my eyes cleared i focused on the clock six hours later i grabbed the receiver fumbled got hold of it found it said olivia brickerman the key was divergent thinking morning i said you sound groggy long night poor baby want to brush your teeth and call me back i laughed no tell me the problem she said was that i was being too limited concentrating on awards and grants as if thats the only way stuff gets funded finally i shifted gears and voila this thing was legislated alex tacked on as a rider to a tough felony sentencing law assemblyman reynard bird doakland you know him used to be a black panther sure bird got the rider stuck on the bill as part of the old giveandtake so now you can send bad guys to prison for long periods but when they get out they get free therapy any bad guys any paroled felons who ask for treatment get it up to a year of individual andor group for each bad guy no restriction on hours and the funding comes straight from medical thats why i couldnt find the money stream its a drop in the ocean of general medical payments sweet deal for felons i said and for providers sure is but few providers have taken the state up on it either they dont know about it or they dont want criminals crowding their waiting rooms probably the former bird never publicized it and usually hes the first to throw a press conference i found out his third wifes a psychologist and guess what shes running two of the biggest programs in oakland and berkeley almost all the activitys up north theres another program in redwood city and some groups in santa cruz that are run by an eightyfiveyearold shrink who practiced in la and retired the one youre probably interested in is pacifica psychological services beverly hills california right howd you know its the only program in southern cal payment straight out of the medical cookie jar i said whats the reimbursement level wait theres more darling were talking medical plus the bill authorizes surcharges because of an exigency clause the funds come out of some legislative slush account but the administrations through medical meaning these are patients your average doctor wouldnt want to treat so the state provides an incentive how much of one double reimbursement she said actually a bit more than double medical pays fourteen dollars for group therapy by a phd fifteen for an md providers under this bill get thirtyfive the same goes for individual therapy from twenty an hour to fortyfive seventy bucks for the initial intake and fortyeight for case conferences thirtyfive an hour for group i said recalculating my previous estimates lots of zeroes not bad theres no fiscal oversight i can find just bill the state and collect any way to find out how much each program has billed not for me but milo could probably do it she said if he wants to pursue it further id call sacramento ask for dwight zevonsky hes a good guy who investigates fraud i copied down the number whats the official name of the program i said no name just assembly bill crpm amendment f she said subtitled psychocultural demarginalization of released offenders which was one of your buzzwords i found a couple others in the text of the rider attitudinal shifting holistic emphasis the individual programs are free to take on their own names the one in beverly hills is called sentries for justice yes just like you said so what this has been done before oh yeah i said where you dont want to know i found out the name of assemblyman reynard birds third wife and ran her through the internet dr michelle harringtonbird a tall scottishborn redhead in her forties who favored african robes and spoke out frequently about political issues the assemblyman was in his seventies a legislative vet known for passionate oration and the ability to fix potholes in his district in one of the many photos i found harringtonbird was posed with a group of fellow psychologists that included albin larsen a bunch of therapists hanging out at a convention larsen stood next to harringtonbird goateed bespectacled wearing a tweed suit over a sweatervest and looking like hollywoods incarnation of freud his body language implied no intimacy with the assemblymans current spouse all business plenty of incentive for that harringtonbird had borrowed larsens terminology for the wording of the bill no doubt larsen had impressed her with descriptions of his human rights work in africa i wondered what shed think about his role in african genocide about two little boys left in their beds with their throats cut i found larsen and harringtonbird paired three more times as signatories on political ads after printing what i thought was relevant i got on the phone milo said oh man olivia she should run the world shes overqualified i said now we know the fundings real and that larsen got in on it early reynard bird wonder how high this will go theres no evidence bird or his wife colluded on any scam larsen knew her professionally and they hobnobbed politically he may have used her too shes into human rights shes into petitions protesting us involvement in afghanistan and iraq et cetera larsen signed the same ads he grunted so when did the funding start year and a half ago reimbursements began sixteen months ago pacifica was in at the outset thirtyfive bucks for each conhour he said even more than we estimated huge incentive to keep it going and to cover up when exposure was threatened if mary lou posed any sort of threat the obvious solution was to eliminate her bullet and impalement speaking of which heres my contribution to the database through some fancy detective footwork i located a retired guard supervisor at quentin who actually knew raymond degussa hes certain degussa was responsible for not two but three inmate contract killings and maybe as many as five others inhouse hit man the gangs hire them to keep their own noses clean with all that they just couldnt get any evidence on the asshole when degussa wasnt offing people he did all things that make parole boards salivate attended church served as a pastors assistant volunteered to make christmas toys for ghetto kids worked as a volunteer library clerk and get this he went regularly for counseling this is a guy who appreciates the value of therapy bet he does and heres the fun part alex this supervisor god bless him told me all the hits featured some kind of impaling and a combination mo which is unusual for prison killings mostly its cut and run degussa cut all right your basic throat and multiple body slashing by shiv but he followed it up with a coup de grâce through the neck or chest with some sort of pointed object in a couple of cases the objects were found sharpened fountain pen meat skewer purloined from the prison kitchen raymonds definitely our bad guy he has no record of sexual crimes his sheets what i told you larceny drugs armed robbery but those are only the things he gets caught for who knows what he does in his spare time starting tonight im switching sean binchy from surveilling gull to watching degussa ill be there at the start to make sure he doesnt get into trouble watching a sweating shrinks one thing this bad boys another gulls off the screen on the contrary now that we know the scams real weve got something to use against him assuming you still see him as the weakest link if you want to lean on someone hed be my choice i want badly to lean he said a couple more things the address christi marsh gave is a mail drop big surprise she only rented the box for two months and the clerk has no recollection of her did you check the paper this morning not yet they finally ran the photo page thirtytwo at the bottom along with three sentences asking anyone with knowledge to call me no calls yet on the quick family front i tracked down sister kelly she stayed in boston to work at a law firm but she just took a sudden leave of absence supposedly sick grandmother in michigan you think she could be well west of michigan i phoned the house but no answer have a call in to eileen paxton just in case she got sisterly again how about we get together sooner rather than later to talk about franco gull i have a few ideas about the fine art of social pressure chapter franco gull had retained the services of a criminal defense lawyer named armand moss moss had passed the assignment to an associate a stunning brunette woman of around forty named myrna wimmer the meeting was held in wimmers office a glasslined room on the top floor of an office building on wilshire near barrington it was a glorious day and the glass served its purpose myrna wimmer wore a burgundy pantsuit and had flawless ivory skin her artfully highlighted wedge cut was glossy and efficient a yale law degree was displayed like the icon it was the photos on her credenza said she had a doting husband and five gorgeous kids she moved like a dancer her greeting was warm slanted gray eyes under artfully shaped brows couldve melted paint she said for the record dr gull is here of his own volition and is under no obligation to answer any questions let alone those deemed inappropriate yes maam anything you say said milo wimmer regarded him with amusement turned to gull who sat on a club chair near the longest glass wall feet planted on the carpet looking drained and thinner the chair rested on casters and gulls movements made it shudder he had on a black suit white mockturtleneck oxblood calfskin loafers little red clocks on his black socks a folded linen handkerchief was wadded in one big hand no sweating yet but preparing himself or maybe his lawyer had provided the hankie milo took the seat farthest from gull i got close good morning i said it was am and the view out myrna wimmers glass walls deserved some serious meditation i was there for anything but dressed in my best navy suit a white pincollar shirt with french cuffs and a gold jacquard tie last time id gone that route someone had mistaken me for a lawyer the sacrifices we make for the public good two days had passed since christina marshs photo had run in the paper a couple of schizophrenics had phoned milo each with oddly congruent stories about alien abductions each certain christina was really from venus comic relief with the schedule hed been keeping milo needed it two nights attempting to surveil raymond degussa had gone flat when the bouncer had failed to show up for his club gig a check at his lastknown address revealed it to be eighteen months outofdate and now milo had more to search for before wed headed for myrna wimmers office hed shown me mug shots of degussa and a dmv photo of bennett hacker degussas stats put him at six feet with multiple tattoos long seamed face thick neck strong features black hair oiled and brushed straight back in one of the pictures degussa wore a thick drooping mustache in others he was cleanshaven tiny slit eyes projected profound boredom hacker was sixtwo with thinning dishwater hair and a chin that fell far short of assertive he wore a white shirt and tie smiled faintly for the motor vehicles camera according to medical investigator dwight zevonsky the po was a rich man both of them were franco gull hadnt responded to my greeting so i repeated it he said morning i kept my suit jacket buttoned kept my posture authoritative pretty outside i said but thats irrelevant to you no answer all that dissonance must be tough franco myrna wimmer said pardon me dissonance when selfimage clashes with harsh reality i scooted closer to gull he pressed himself against the back of the armchair the chair rolled back a couple of inches what is this said wimmer i canceled an appointment to hear psychobabble i addressed gull first off you need to know that im not a police officer im your peer franco gulls left eye twitched and he glanced at wimmer she said whats going on milo said dr delawares a clinical psychologist he consults to the department gull glared at me you never thought to mention that no reason to i said there is now wimmer folded her arms across her chest well this is different any problem with that said milo she held up a finger no one talk im thinking maybe itll be more pleasant for your client said milo no rubber hose a bit of collegiality that remains to be seen to me whats your angle first of all whats your name again i told her and she made a show of writing it down okay now whats your angle clinical psych i turned to gull ive been trying to understand how you got into this dismal situation gull looked away and i went on i did a little research on you but that only put more pieces in the puzzle i edged even closer gull tried to wheel backwards but the casters caught in the carpet franco may i call you franco franco the gap between the person i learned about and whats happening to you now is rather wide gull licked his lips myrna wimmer laughed oh boy psych i turned to her is that okay with you the question surprised her youre asking my opinion what i mean i said is that if im taking the wrong approach if youve got a better approach to communicating with dr gull please let me know speaking softly so that she had to cant her head to hear she said i just get on with it ive got another appointment in fortyfive minutes i turned back to gull you graduated summa cum laude phi beta kappa from the u of kansas in lawrence you managed that while playing four years of varsity baseball not just runofthemill baseball in your senior year you came close to breaking the universitys rbi record i find that more than impressive franco talk about your wellrounded scholar kind of a grecian ideal no youd know about that you switched from classics to psychology in your sophomore year myrna wimmer circled behind her desk and sat down she looked angry and fascinated franco gull didnt move or speak i said two years in the minor leagues and no one there has anything but good things to say about you too bad about that hamstring shred gull said things happen and started to sweat i said same goes for berkeley we both know how tough it is to get into a place like that but you were tops on their list as a grad student you kept up the good work your dissertation supervisor professor albright is getting on in years but his memory is pretty sharp he told me you were a hard worker your research was substantive you really knew how to focus on problemsolving he hoped youd go into academia but thats another story gull mopped his neck i said then there are all your good works in addition to all the required clinical hours for your doctorate you volunteered your services at a home for abused kids the same year you were writing your dissertation thats impressive howd you find the time gull said you do the job you did more than the job franco lots more and your researchreactions of latencyaged girls from divorced homes to a personal space challenge good stuff you got it published in clinical and consulting psych no mean feat for a student after you graduated you didnt pursue it pity your findings were provocative gull said ancient history he crossed his legs forced a smile at wimmer is there a point to this myrna wimmer touched her platinum watch and shrugged i said your postdoc supervisor dr ryan also remembers you as bright and industrious that entire year you never came close to any ethical breach the odd thing is that she remembers you as exceptionally respectful of women gulls lips clamped shut i kept silent he said i still am i said the year you graduated academic jobs were tight and the offers you received were all in the midwest is that why you opted for private practice how can you keep em down on the farm once theyve seen beverly hills gull said ever been to kansas he shifted the hankie to his other hand i graduated with serious debt no one gave me a damn thing for free no need to apologize for going into practice i said who says academics accomplish that much for society true take albin larsen for example academic appointments on two continents travels all over the world touting ideals but we both know where most of his money comes from gull said i have no idea what youre talking about i said okay then back to this thing with you and women the promiscuity the compulsive skirtchasing when exactly did it start franco were you able to fool dr ryan or was it something that you latched onto when you realized how much power you had as a therapist gull reddened screw you he said wrapping big fingers around the hankie myrna lets end this absolutely said wimmer gentlemen were through no prob said milo genially that was beyond rude said gull getting to his feet it certainly was said wimmer we remained seated she said gentlemen ive got a busy calendar i understand maam said milo he stood removed some folded white papers from his pocket ill be as quick as possible enforcing this arrest warrant on dr gull gull had been fooling with the neck of his sweater his hand dropped as if scalded and his head snapped back what milo stepped closer to him doctor this is an arrest war wimmer said whats the charge lieutenant charges said milo multiple counts of murder conspiracy to commit murder insurance fraud a few other things your client should be gulls eyes were wild what the hell are you talking wimmer said let me handle this franco to milo give me that milo handed her the warrant hed trolled the das office for an assistant da willing to issue the paper gulls fingerprints all over mary lou koppels house had helped as had a call from state fraud investigator dwight zevonsky the finishing touch had been a bottle of twentyfiveyearold glenlivet pressed into the palm of a sixtyyearold hardnose ada eben marovitch two months from retirement whose wife had left him for a psychiatrist proud of me milo had asked as we ascended the elevator to wimmers office applied psychology and all that as wimmer read the particulars of the warrant franco gull retreated from milo keeping his back to the glass behind him were gorgeous blue sky and the coppery contours of a sunlit downtown he stood as still as a piece of sculpture lifesize sculpture california terror with panoramic view wimmer finished reading returned to the first page reviewed her mouth tightened what what said franco gull no answer myrna shh let me finish finish what its ridiculous its wimmer silenced him with an airchop completed her perusal refolded the warrant its patently ridiculous franco but apparently valid what does that mean myrna what the fuck does that mean the handkerchief was wadded tightly in his hand and his knuckles were ivory knobs sweat trickled from his hairline but he made no attempt to swab myrna milo took out his cuffs the metallic sound made gull jump myrna wimmer said oh please milo said you read the charges gull said myrna wimmer said what it means franco is that youll have to go with them disapproval in her voice as if gull had disappointed her where will you be booking him lieutenant charges like these said milo gotta be the main jail gull said jail oh god no wimmer smiled at milo could you do me a favor and book him at west la save me the drive book him said gull myrna how can you just milo said no can do counselor sorry wimmer looked ready to spit gulls eyes had filled with tears myrna i cant do this she said does your wife have access to your finances if so ill call her and well get to work on bail if not bail myrna this is insane is that an official diagnosis doctor said milo please said gull backing off some more and pressing against the glass you dont know what youre doing ive never done any of what you say ive done please sucking in breath please milo said turn and place your hands on ms wimmers desk doctor if youre carrying any weapons or illicit substances now would be the time to tell me murder gull was shouting what the hell are you talking about murder are you insane he opened his hand and the hankie fluttered to the carpet as he watched it fall his knees buckled but he managed to stay upright myrna wimmer said calm down franc calm down easy for you to say youre not the one as your advocate franco i advise you not to say anything all im saying is i never did anything whats wrong with saying i never did anything milo said hands on the desk please he began walking toward gull franco gull you have the right to remain silent gulls powerful physique tensed he doubled over began to weep oh god how can this be happening myrna wimmer shot me a hopeyourehappy glare milo jangled the cuffs gull stepped forward placed his hands on the desk wept some more milo bent one of gulls arms behind his back and cuffed it gull cried out are you hurting my client demanded wimmer maybe psychologically said milo not too tight is it doctor god god said gull what can i do to fix this milo didnt answer why are you saying i killed someone who mary thats crazy mary was my friend we were i never wouldve milo drew back gulls other arm gull shouted what is it you want i said for you to be forthcoming forthcoming about what myrna said be quiet franco what and let them put these on me and take me to jail franco im sure this will what im sure of is i never killed anyone or conspired or did any of those things gull twisted to make eye contact with me what youre doing is unethical you should be ashamed of yourself i said feel free to file a complaint though i dont imagine youll want to he said what gives you the right to judge me forthcoming i said doesnt mean gamesmanship to milo my opinion is we should wrap up milo placed his hand on gulls scruff and turned him around and placed a palm in the small of gulls back time to go to jail doctor gull shouted stop please ill be forthcoming okay yes i chased a few skirts you want to talk about that fine im ready to talk about it ive got a little problem is that what you wanted to hear i pleasured women received pleasure in return it has nothing to do with jail or murder or any other fucking bullshit that would send me to jail and yes that is an official diagnosis im qualified to diagnose i am a good psychologist fucking great psychologist all my patients get better i said like gavin quick gull said he that he wasnt really my patient no i saw him for four five sessions it ended why take these things off and ill tell you tell us now wimmer said franco my advice to you is to not tell them any gull said the stupid kid didnt want to see me because he found out i was sleeping with a patient okay happy im humiliated i am now officially publicly shitfaced humiliated but i never killed anyone take these things off myrna wimmer said i need an advil milo removed the cuffs and sat gull in the same armchair gull said can we all calm down and get rational here his face was sodden milo said if you continue to show some honesty we might be able to work something out wimmer said i want that on the record milo said sorry no then i refuse to have my client myrna stop complicating things stop being a goddamn lawyer said gull its not your life wimmer frowned at him dryswallowed the two advil tablets in her palm youve been warned franco gull turned to me honesty about what i told you i slept with a patient only one i said his eyes searched mine trying to figure out how much i knew more than one he said but not that many more and it was always consensual the stupid kid found out and threw a fit and said he could no longer trust me he wanted to fire me then he threatened to report me he of all people what do you mean i said the whole reason he was there was to deal with his own sexual issues he was a stalker so who was he to get selfrighteous you dont understand why hed think you werent the ideal therapist franco i understand i understand said gull it shouldnt have happened but it did but he was snooping its not as if i flaunted it or anything like that the point is the kid was braindamaged his mentation was distorted not thinking straight i translated for milo in addition said gull he was pathologically compulsive extremely perseverative cognitively and behaviorally i said once he got hold of something he wouldnt let go precisely said gull as if that settled it howd he find out i said i told you by snooping gull let out a harsh laugh stalking me where he hung around the building after his session was over came back after hours and waited in his car out on the street where on the street palm drive out back behind the parking lot it didnt register at the time but later when he confronted me i realized hed been sitting there what kind of car mustang color red red convertible but he always kept the top up and the windows were tinted so i never saw if anyone was inside i said thats the car he was killed in well im sorry about that thats unfortunate said gull but i had nothing to do with it he confronted you and threatened to report you you dont kill someone for that what do you kill them for nothing violence is always wrong gull searched for his hankie i spotted it on the floor behind him but didnt let on he said you dont kill anyone for any reason im a firm believer in nonviolence make love not war youre making me sound glib and lecherous it wasnt like that some women need tenderness wimmers hands clawed i said so gavin hung around the building he damn well did how often dont know said gull i caught him once when he caught you silence how did it happen are you going to use it against me ethical violations are the least of your problems what do you want everything you know about everything i ask the grand inquisitor he said how can you justify this professionally we all make adjustments i said milo jangled the handcuffs gull said sure fine lets do it that okay with you i asked wimmer busy schedule and all wimmer hesitated gull whined myrna she looked at her watch sighed sat back in her chair sure make yourselves comfortable boys chapter franco gull said i shouldve followed my instincts never wanted to treat him not your type of patient i said he didnt answer a few minutes ago hed cleared his throat several times and milo had suggested to myrna wimmer that someone get water for her client looking vexed she phoned for a pitcher and glasses but when they arrived gull refused to drink clutching at the smallest choice i said why didnt you want to treat gavin quick i dont like adolescents said gull too much crisis too much in flux add brain damage to that that too i hate neuropsych boring uncreative braindamaged adolescent i said also he was male i see males not many how would you know am i wrong im not divulging personal information about my patients said gull no matter what pressure you put on me i said ethics and all that gull was silent gavin watched the building i said how did he find out you were sleeping with a patient gull winced is this necessary very fine fine he was there in the parking lot when we came out you and the patient yes a lovely person i walked her out it was late dark she was my last patient and i was leaving too chivalrous i said what did gavin see gull hesitated milo stretched his legs myrna wimmer polished the dial of her watch with her sleeve gull said we kissed yes it was stupid to be that open but who knew anyone was watching the kid was parked at the curb for gods sake nosy i said you need to understand this wasnt some exploitative thing it was loving mutual and loving this woman had experienced some severe losses in her life and she needed comfort deep comfort said milo what i did was wrong in a formal sense a normative sense but the specifics of the situation dictated a certain degree of intimacy i said therapeutic kindness if you must know myrna wimmer picked up a legal pad and pretended to read she looked as if shed swallowed a cup of sewage gull turned to me flushed i dont expect you to understand i said so you did it in the office on a couch on the desk that is vulgar your conduct was vulgar ive told you she was lonely and had experienced severe losses myrna wimmer shook her head all right said gull im a bastard is that what you want to hear i said back to the beginning you dont like adolescent males but you agreed to treat gavin quick as a favor to mary the referral came to her but she was booked and id just discharged a patient a very successful case i might add so i happened to have an open slot which is extremely rare whyd mary ask you to see gavin and not albin larsen albin only works parttime too busy with good works i said gull shrugged did mary tell you how the referral came to her through her exhusband hes our landlord in fact and gavins father was a tenant of his had mentioned gavins legal problems the actual referral came through a neurologist id never heard of gavin was claiming brain damage had caused the stalking you dont believe that gull shrugged off the question i said it doesnt take brain damage to get a guy sexually aggressive gull exhaled this is wearying me so sorry wimmer said is there anything more i said did you have much contact with gavins parents the father only said gull and just once i thought it was unusual generally its the mother i asked the father about it he said his wife wasnt feeling well what did you learn from mr quick not much i took a quick family intake he seemed very concerned about his son i said initially mary had no time for gavin but once gavin fired you she took over i suppose she made time said gull as a favor to me so gavin wouldnt make waves silence i said what did you give her in return i agreed to take night call for two months milo said did that include calling on her at night gull glared at him the questions stands doctor mary was a highly sexual person she had strong needs and i was able to fill them we enjoyed each other i dont see that as sinful but in answer to your question no mary and i were perfectly competent at separating our professional and personal lives i said who murdered her i have no idea from these questions you obviously think it had something to do with gavin quick you dont i dont think anything a therapist and her patient murdered within days of each other youve never wondered about it i wonder said gull i just dont have answers any guesses he shook his head the girl murdered alongside gavin i said had you ever seen her before i told you the first time you showed me that picture no the picture was in yesterdays paper bring back any memories i didnt read yesterdays paper no interest in world affairs not much said gull im not a political person unlike albin larsen you keep bringing him up so i do i looked over at milo he appeared serene myrna wimmer moved forward perching on the edge of her desk chair her mouth was set and her shoulders were tight gull said gavin quick now albin youre losing me i said why did albin just inform sonny koppel that your group had no further interest in leasing the ground floor no further interest why would we need the bottom floor its already leased isnt it some sort of charitable foundation charitable planning he nodded what are they about i said dont know youve been neighbors for a while i never see anyone go in there except sonny koppel and thats not very often how often once twice a month maybe its one of his businesses he owns several tycoon apparently how do you know that from mary she got us the suite through him handled all the paperwork on our lease takecharge gal i said mary was a mover albin and i are more cerebral she got us a great deal on the lease because sonny was still fond of her she told you that she told me and laughed about it said gull making fun of sonny to be frank she didnt think much of him mary could be cutting it wasnt typical of her but she could get that way and sonny brought out marys cutting side you know exes what exactly did mary tell you about sonny that soon after shed married him hed turned into a fat slob that shed never found him attractive in the first place but had deluded herself he might be workable she liked the fact that he was a law student then he flunked his bar exam and she started viewing him as the quintessential loser her phrase a loser who became a tycoon that surprised her she said being rich was wasted on sonny he didnt know how to spend money didnt know how to enjoy life sounds like the fondness ran one way i said you think he killed her why would we think that exhusband he said unrequited love maybe he found out how mary really felt about him maybe it came to a head did mary ever give you any indication that things got hostile between her and sonny no but she wouldnt have mentioned it to me despite you being friends despite all that intimacy gull said all i can tell you is what happened do you like sonny koppel as a suspect im saying given the situation id look into it instead of looking into you said milo gull ground his teeth i havent killed anyone i said how many patients are you carrying currently the change of subject threw gull he sat up ran his fingers through his hair shook his head i told you i cant talk about patients im not asking for names just your approximate patient load gull glanced over at myrna wimmer she ignored him milo said you fuck them but wont talk about them spare me now wait one no you wait doctor milos voice had taken on that bear growl forthcoming means no more bullshit the question was how many patients are you seeing not their quirks or their bra sizes gulls face lost color okay okay let me see i work thirtyeight hours a week with regular patients have another maybe twentyfive who pop in for occasional sessions tuneups said milo i dont run a garage sixtyfive total i said thats an estimate those sixtyfive youd remember their names sure i pulled a page of computer printout from my jacket and unfolded it on my lap does the name gayford woodrow mean anything to you no what about james leroy craig same answer said gull carl philip russo i said ludovico montez daniel lee barendo schendley paul orlando jones headshake roland kristof lamar royster collins antonio ortega who are these people patients for whom youve billed medical a considerable amount over the last sixteen months gull looked stunned thats ridiculous first of all i dont accept medical patients second those are all men and my patients are almost exclusively women third id know if i treated someone and got paid for it this is absolutely psychotic i picked up the list and read some more akuno williams salvador paz mattias soldovar juan jorge montoya juan eduardo lunares baylor hawkins paul andrew mccloskey no none of them said gull this is a mistake never treated any of them not once not once dont see any medical patients at all why would i reimbursements pathetic and im booked with solidpaying patients then whyd you bother to obtain a medical billing number who says i did i walked over to him and held the printout in front of his eyes is this your signature on an application to be a provider he said it looks like i may have obtained a number but i never really used it over the last sixteen months youve received over three hundred thousand dollars in medical reiumbursement three fortythree and fiftytwo cents to be precise he grabbed for the sheet i whipped it away let me see that you received a provider number but didnt really use it silence i said heres where forthcoming enters the picture gull said fine fine i applied to get a number just to keep all my options open in case there was a lull i could fill in the time but three hundred thou youre out of your mind the state payments went to a billing address in marina del rey there you go he said i dont have an address in the marina cant remember the last time i went to the marina someone obviously screwed up your socalled investigation is screwed up a smile spread slowly across his lips i suggest you do your homework both of you i said no marina for you no harborfront dinners for you and the missus gull turned to wimmer do you believe this myrna ive just showed them theyre totally off base and they cant admit it are you thinking what i am a harassment suit wimmer didnt answer i rattled the printout none of those names mean anything to you not a one not a single one what about this name then sentries for justice gull stopped smiling one hand shot up spasmodically and grabbed his upper lip twisting like a kid playing with a rubber mask sad mask you know that name i said that he said oh boy chapter gull pointed to the water pitcher on myrna wimmers desk i think i will have some of that wimmer aimed a cold smile his way gull got up and poured himself a glass drained it standing near the desk and refilled i need he said to put everything in context i said go for it if ms wimmers schedule allows wimmer said oh sure this is the fun part of my day gull said yes i did apply for a provider number but only at marys and albins urging the two of them were socially aware one of the issues they got involved in was penal rehabilitation who got into it first i think it was albins idea but mary began carrying the ball she was the mover mary he said wasnt the most creative person in the world but once she put her mind to something she went full bore the two of them got the idea of setting up treatment for paroled criminals in order to fight recidivism i admired what they were doing but chose to stay out of it why i said as i told you i was busy enough and i was skeptical these people criminals theyve got entrenched personality disorders psychotherapy has never been very effective for that kind of thing mary and albin disagreed especially mary she was passionate about it state money was going to be freed up it was more than just theory howd she find that out one of albins political connections hes involved in a lot of progressive causes is the wife of a politician from up north shes a psychologist too and she got her husband to pass a bill that authorized psychotherapy on demand for paroled felons albin helped her with the wording he told mary she told me but you declined i said entrenched personality disorders yes also the reimbursement rates couldnt match your private fees i work for a living said gull i dont see why i should apologize for that whats your hourly fee is that relevant yes i use a sliding scale from onetwenty to two hundred per session medical pays twenty and restricts the number of sessions medicals a joke said gull mary said the bill doubled the rates some sort of political giveandtake but fortys still a joke i opted out howd mary and albin react to that albin didnt say much he rarely does mary was upset with me but that didnt last milo said your being intimate friends and all that gull sniffed i said you declined to participate but obtained a medical provider number at albins and marys behest they said the state preferred settings with multiple providers it would look better if all of us were listed mary filled out the paperwork and i signed and that was it he was sweating heavily now searched again for his linen hankie i pulled a tissue out of a box on wimmers desk and handed it to him he wiped his face hastily and the tissue turned into a little gray sphere youre saying you never actually saw any patients on the program basically he said basically i saw a few very few at the beginning just to get the ball rolling how many is a few he removed a pair of tinylensed reading glasses from his pocket and began playing with the sidepieces franco three thats it and no one with any of the names you mentioned how was it treating excons it wasnt a good experience why not two of them were chronically late and when they did show up they were high on something it was obvious they were just passing the time why would they do that how should i know any indication they were getting paid to show up gulls brows arched no one ever mentioned that whatever the reason they werent motivated no insight no desire to acquire any what about the third patient i said that one said gull frowning that one upset me he wasnt drunk or stoned and he talked talked plenty but not about himself about his girlfriend what she needed how he figured to give it to her what did she need i said gull folded and unfolded the glasses orgasms apparently she was anorgasmic and he was determined to fix the problem did he ask your help with that no said gull thats the point he didnt want anything from me he thought he knew everything very aggressive very not a pleasant man even though he tried to be charming attempted to speak intelligently he couldnt pull it off not hardly faking it the typical antisocial charm if youve had any experience with sociopaths youd know what i mean pretentious i said exactly prototypical antisocial pretentiousness his body loosened pretending we were colleagues having a clinical chat flowery use of language overly solicitous playing at being civilized and thinking he was putting one over on me but his fantasies he exhaled sadistic dominance bondage and yes id say a touch of sadism he talked incessantly about tying this woman up and making love to her aggressively for as long as it took to force orgasms out of her body he didnt use the term making love sexual tough guy i said his fantasies involved multiple penetration bondage foreign objects i tried to get him to address this womans needs suggested that perhaps she needed some tenderness some intimacy but he laughed that off his plan was to quoteunquote stick her every which way until she screamed for mercy he smiled with practiced weariness any reticence about discussing patients had vanished i for one couldnt see what any of that had to do with reducing recidivism and when he stopped showing up i told mary id had enough of the program and the people it brought in he placed the eyeglasses back in his pocket laced his hands and sat forward you need to understand id never do anything to hurt mary never i said so you saw only three sentries for justice patients for how many sessions total i believe twelve certainly not much more than that i remember thinking that apart from being unpleasant and unproductive the project was a financial loser i think the total billable charges didnt even amount to five hundred dollars thats why your three hundred thousand figure is absurd and the money didnt come to marina del rey it came to mary at the office she cashed the state check and distributed the money to me you really do need to check your facts gentlemen mary was the bursar so to speak yes milo removed several sheets of paper from his attache case and passed them to me i showed franco gull a mug shot of raymond degussa he said yes thats him ray mr dominance he nodded did he murder mary why do you ask because he impressed me as someone clearly capable of violence the way he carried himself the way he sat walked like a barely tethered animal he studied the picture look at those eyes he made me uncomfortable i told mary that she laughed it off said there was nothing to worry about the girlfriend he talked about i said did he mention her name no but i saw her at least i assume it was her you assume shortly after ray had stopped coming to see me i spotted him with a woman his arm was around her he seemed proprietary whered you see them i said i happened to step out into the waiting room to get my patient and the two of them were also sitting there at first i thought thered been some kind of scheduling problem that ray expected a session but before i could say anything mary came out and the woman went back with her the girlfriend was a patient of marys apparently i showed him a shot of flora newsome alive and smiling yes he said good lord whats this all about did you see this woman with ray degussa any other times once more said gull as i arrived at the building and they were walking out to the parking lot it surprised me the way she looked putting a face to the person hed talked about a man like that id have expected someone a bit more obvious a bimbo said milo this woman was she looked like a bank clerk she was a teacher i said was said gull youre saying god how far does this go knowing degussa was a thug did you tell mary his fantasies about her patient no i couldnt confidentiality that was one thing we were adamant about all three of us once our doors closed that was it no crossoffice chitchat about patients you didnt see degussa as a threat to flora newsome flora said gull so thats her name good god he bounded up snatched another tissue there was nothing to warn anyone about nothing that even approached a tarasoff level he never said he wanted to hurt her just that he wanted to make her come make her scream for mercy i said i took that as a metaphor milo said him being a poetic type he killed her said gull youre saying he actually killed her someone did oh god this is my worst nightmare milo said hers was worse no one spoke for a while then gull said did he assault her sexually milo said well ask the questions fine fine god this is draining me im drying up gull stood again poured two glasses of water and finished both his face was glossy fluid in fluid out a man of little substance i said who else was involved in sentries for justice just mary and albin what about ray degussa him youre saying he was you know now that you mention it he did seem to be near the office a lot after he stopped coming for therapy whered he hang out id see him walking up the block and hed nod and smile and give a thumbsup as if we were friends i assumed he worked nearby you ever talk to him just hi and goodbye a thug nearby that didnt bother you mary and albin were treating criminals but you assumed degussa worked nearby gull shrugged i really didnt pay much attention to any of it when did the sentries sessions take place i assume after hours so as not to upset the regular clientele gull nodded you and mary and albin larsen never discussed specifics frankly said gull i didnt want to know why not criminals i find them unsavory i wanted to keep my distance from any any what said milo any unpleasantness so you suspected there might be something illegal going on myrna wimmer said dont answer that it could be selfincriminating gull said but i didnt do anything criminal wimmer glared at him and he shut his mouth milo said counselor your clients got an interesting way of blocking out things he doesnt want to deal with isnt the point of therapy breaking through all that denial lieutenant from where im sitting my client has proved most cooperative do you have any other questions id deem acceptable milo nodded at me and i showed gull bennett hackers dmv photo what about this man ever seen him ive seen him with albin a couple of times where over at roxbury park having lunch with albin the same spot where you found us albin goes there frequently said it reminds him of parks in sweden albin ever introduce you to this man no i assumed he was a therapist as well whys that i dont know really perhaps his demeanor which was quiet pleasant what about sonny koppel i said what was his role in sentries for justice sonny none that i know of mary never mentioned his being involved said milo the only thing mary told me was that sonny owned some properties that shed convinced him to use as halfway houses and thats where she and albin were going to get their patients she said it made everything easy ready supply of patients i dont believe her intentions were anything but noble she felt she could do some good and make money even at low reimbursement rates gull was silent then he said whatever took place i chose not to participate i think i deserve some credit for that well put a gold star on your chart doctor i said youre saying sonny wasnt involved i doubt mary would have included sonny in anything substantive he repulsed her frankly mary was aware of how sonny felt about her and she turned it to her advantage to get a great lease on our suite to finance her own real estate investments she borrowed money from sonny not loans gifts shed ask for money and hed say yes she joked about it said i use every part of the pig except the squeal myrna wimmers nails clacked against the edge of her desk gull said i dont want to paint a negative portrait of mary being married to a man like sonny couldnt have been easy have you met him we have i said can you imagine mary with someone like that why was sonny rough on her no nothing like that just the opposite gull fidgeted what i said to be frank mary liked things a little she enjoyed being dominated in a loving way once she arrived at a point of trust and intimacy bondage no there were never ropes involved just physical pressure holding her down at her request said gull sonny wouldnt do that sonny couldnt do that she said back when theyd been married any demand she placed on him to exhibit dominance turned him instantly impotent because he needed to be dominated she saw that as part of his general problemflabby psyche flabby body was the way she termed it gull patted his own midriff in my opinion thats really why she left him he wouldnt assert himself with her so she used him she said sonny wants to be controlled im doing him a favor by pulling his strings but she never mentioned sonny being involved in sentries all she mentioned was his owning the buildings what about albin larsen i said he and mary ever develop anything physical gull looked offended im certain they didnt why albins not marys type also not dominant as far as i can tell albins asexual milo said got a monk thing going on in all the time ive known albin hes never expressed any interest in sex or sexual matters and weve worked together for years too busy doing good works i said people channel their drives in various ways said gull i dont judge i always have seen albin as someone who mightve been comfortable in a monastic setting he lives very simply admirable said milo gull said about all those names are you saying someone actually claims i treated those men and billed medical the state of california claims ridiculous it never happened the paperwork says it did doctor then someone screwed up or someones lying check my bank accounts check the money trail or whatever you call it you wont find any three hundred thousand unaccounted for there are plenty of ways to hide money doctor well i wouldnt know what they are the paperwork doctor someones lying gull shouted milo smiled now who could that be gull was silent i said any theories myrna wimmer said be careful here franco gull inhaled deeply and let his breath out very slowly youre saying mary and albin falsified bills in my name and pocketed the money milo said youre saying it doctor gull swiped at his glassy brow i guess i am and now marys dead so she is doctor gull sweated profusely and didnt bother to mop it up you cant be serious his voice had changed higher register strained i said during the same period you ostensibly billed for dollars worth of felon therapy mary billed for and albin larsen billed gull said albin i said thats the question now lets work on the answer chapter as we rode the elevator from wimmers highrise to the ground floor milo said you squeezed him dry congrats thanks i said not pleased it needed to be done as we pulled out into traffic he said when i hunt and actually bag something i get hungry im thinking red meat okay not up for it red meats fine had a big breakfast had nothing you find playing grand inquisitor that repugnant a little outside my training hey he said psychological warfare in vietnam the army woulda had you writing pamphlets wheres the red meat i said okay change the subject wilshire near the beach theres a new place that dryages but if you find the notion of feasting after breaking down another human being repugnant i understand even though said human being is a selfserving slimeball now that you put it that way gull may not have been in on the scam or the killings directly but i dont buy the completeinnocent act i think the deal the ada authorized was a gift twoyear suspension of gulls psychology license in return for full cooperation in all criminal and civil matters pertaining to more than fair i said lets eat the steak house had microbrews on tap and an adjacent dryaging room whose picture window faced the boulevard a family of tourists stopped to admire sides of beef hanging from gleaming hooks and milo took the time to join them two little kids pointed and giggled and the father said cool the mother opined i think its brutal inside seated at a back booth milo said controlled decay kicks up the taste kind of like real life i said real life is hard to control he clapped my shoulder all the more reason to gorge over two mountains of steak delmonico baked potatoes the size of running shoes and a bottle of red wine we reviewed what wed learned from gull milo said sonny is coming across as a victim not a bad guy no reason for gull to lie about that on the contrary if there was a way to spread the blame hed have done it so maybe gull doesnt know the inside dope or sonny really is just a poor shmuck hung up over his ex who happened to make a lot of money and didnt know how to spend it i said and out of the goodness of her heart mary helped him she sure liked the green stuff didnt she nice lucrative practice extra bucks from the ex and she still risks it all going for a scam maybe it was more than dollar signs i said maybe it was the thrill of pulling off something illegal like we said she probably rationalized it as penalizing a corrupt system he gobbled steak said interesting woman our mary cultivates an identity as a professional woman and a dispenser of wisdom but she had no compunction tapping sonny for an increased allowance top of that she liked being held down powers a strange drug sometimes people in authority like being controlled sexually whered you hear that ive seen it oh he sopped up gravy with a wedge of sourdough you believe gull never talked to mary about degussas fantasies concerning flora i said even if he didnt mary had to have some idea what was going on flora came to her for treatment and sexual unresponsiveness and mary knew degussa from the scam knew what kind of person he was for all we know degussa sent flora for therapy to tune her up sexually brian van dyne said flora had heard mary on the radio theres a lot brian van dyne wasnt aware of fiancée with a shadow life he said flora juggled the two of them flora met degussa while working at the parole office he put on some of that macho sociopath charm and she threw roy nichols over for someone even tougher the thrill was forbidden fruit then she met van dyne and started thinking matrimony but she didnt want to give up the game a nice respectable teacher to show off for mom rough trade on the side its possible floras murder had nothing to do with the scam i said her crime scene was a lot bloodier than any of the others and there was no forced entry to me it feels like passion and sex gone haywire when we met roy nichols you wondered about a jealousy motive why not apply that to degussa degussa found out about van dyne and blew he said the wrong guy to betray toss in floras inability to climax and youre talking rage fodder a guy like ray degussa would take sexual unresponsiveness as a personal insult sticking her every which way thats a goddamn blueprint for what he ended up doing to her and mary koppel never warned her confidentiality i said she was big on that he sawed at his steak stopped so i should take flora off the scamster list no evidence she was involved and he said her moms a nice old lady that too confidentiality mary didnt want to jeopardize the cash flow three hundred fifty plus of her own inflated billing and she and larsen split another three hundred that came in under gulls name thats over half a million each in addition to what they were earning legitimately and mary had an allowance mary had contempt for sonny because he didnt know how to live she lived all right until she didnt the key is finding all that money zevonskys getting the ball rolling on financial subpoenas knowing about larsens african connections might help heres hoping he saluted finishing off a mammoth chunk of steak chewed slowly swallowed how do you see marys murder going down she makes noise to larsen gets threatening and he dispatches degussa to finish her off thats exactly what i think i refilled my wineglass and took a long swallow nice cabernet the latest from the health mavens was that booze was good for you if you didnt overdo it that was the key knowing the boundaries he said it all fits but im still short on proof cant even get a home address on degussa the club he works for pays him cash under the table try the marina i said flora took van dyne there for brunch maybe because shed been there with degussa bobby js yeah i like that if she was gaming that would be fun for her ill drop by again flash degussas mug he hitched his trousers and we left the steakhouse he mustve left a huge tip cops tip because the waiter followed us out to the sidewalk thanked him and shook his hand milo told him enjoy and we returned to the unmarked with what we know now he said i should also be able to get some extra personnel for serious surveillance this is good alex not anywhere near a slam dunk but good nice to see you happy me im always a ray of sunshine as if illustrating he spread his lips in something that might have been a smile and switched on the police radio as he drove humming along atonally with the dispatchers droll recital of outrage and misery midway back to the station he said theres still the matter of how jerry quick fits into the scam maybe he doesnt i said gull knew him only as gavins father and maybe thats the point jerry started following gavin around because gavin had been acting strange gavin didnt know that and spotted his dad and copied down his license plate in gavins damaged mind everyone was part of the conspiracy gavin was paranoid prefrontal damage can do that a concerned father would be helping us alex not destroying evidence and hiding out quicks been gone what five days what the hell is that all about good point i said just because gull wasnt aware of quicks involvement doesnt mean quicks a virgin weve got a guy who hires a stripper as a phony secretary uses prepaid phone cards leaves condoms in his luggage to rub salt in wifeys wounds hits on his sisterinlaw doesnt pay his bills on time to me thats precisely the kind of tainted citizen whod love something like sentries for justice ill buy the concerned dad bit up to a point the point where quick supplied gavin with christi marsh which got her killed too quick knows if it all comes out hes in big trouble with his family not to mention the law so he cuts out and leaves sheila to fend for herself this is not ward cleaver i wonder how sheilas doing i said ever the shrink feel free to drop by and do some therapy god knows she needs it meanwhile im gonna earn the salary the city pays me a block later did i thank you for all your help more than once i said good he said got to be civilized chapter south camden drive at two in the afternoon was a pretty scene temperate beverly hills weather unfettered by seasons nice houses nice cars nice gardeners mowing nice lawns up the block from the quick house an elderly man made his way along the sidewalk with the help of twin walkers and a tiny filipina attendant as i drove by he smiled and waved happiness had so little to do with the state of your bones the door to the white traditional was open and sheila quicks minivan idled in the driveway exhaust pipe blowing delicate puffs of smoke that dissipated quickly in the warm smooth air womans silhouette in the front passenger seat i got out and approached the van found sheila quick sitting stiffly looking hypnotized her window up she didnt notice me and i was about to knock on her window when a young woman came out of the house hefting an oversized blue duffel when she saw me she froze tall slim dark hair drawn back in a careless ponytail pleasant face less plain than in the family photo she wore a hooded blue sweatshirt over jeans and white sneakers downslanted eyes her fathers large jaw his slightly stooped posture too it made her look weary maybe she was kelly yes my names alex delaware i work with the la police with the police what does that mean firstyear law student trained to parse or shed chosen the profession because it fit her nature i said im a psychologist who consults to lapd ive been involved in your brothers hearing psychologist she turned her head toward her mother she said i just got in to town dont know anything about that a cheery voice behind me said hi sheila quick had rolled down her window and was waving and smiling hello again kelly quick lifted her duffel came forward interposed herself between me and her mother hes with the police kell i know mom to me excuse me but were kind of in a hurry getting away for a while no answer where to kelly id rather not say aunt eileens id rather not say kelly quick edged past me to the rear of the van lifted the hatch and loaded her duffel two large suitcases were already there sheila quick said still no sign of jerry for all i know hes dead still cheerful mom no need to be dishonest kelly ive had enough dishonesty to last me mother please sheila said at least you said please to me i raised them to be polite i said where you heading kelly quick got between us again were in a hurry her mouth twisted please sheila quick said this one is smart nothing wrong with her brain she was always a great student gavin had the charm and the looks but kelly had the grades kelly quicks eyes misted i said could we talk kelly just for a moment fluttering eyelashes cock of hip a hint of the adolescence shed barely left fine but just for a moment we walked a few yards past the van sheila quick called out where are you two going just one sec mom to me what if youre heading to your aunt eileens thatll be easy enough to find out were not we can go anywhere we want of course you can im not here to stop you then what have you heard from your father no answer kelly if hes gotten in touch and given you instructions he hasnt okay im sure he instructed you not to talk im sure you think youre helping him out by obeying i dont obey anyone she said i think independently we need to get going you cant say where its not important it really isnt my brother was murdered and my mom shes having problems i need to take care of her its as simple as that what about your dad she looked at the sidewalk kelly he could be in serious trouble the people hes dealing with shouldnt be underestimated she raised her eyes but stared past me no one knows better than you about your mothers vulnerability how long do you think you can take care of her her head snapped back toward me you think you know im sure i dont please she said dont make matters worse tears blurred her eyes old eyes in a young face i stepped aside and she returned to the van got in the drivers seat locked the door as she started up the engine sheila prattled and gesticulated festive mood kelly was grim hand planted on the wheel not going anywhere until i did i pulled away from the curb when i reached the corner i looked back in my rearview mirror and the van was still there milo was out so i asked for detective sean binchy he said so you think mr quick phoned his daughter that would be my guess so she probably knows where he is think i should put a bolo on the van id check with milo about that when will he be back he didnt say said binchy something about going over to the marina for lunch i think there was more to it but thats what he said usually he ends up explaining an hour later milo showed up at my house and explained had a nice cool drink at bobby js he said rubbing his gut found a waitress who recalls flora and degussa eating there several times brunch and dinner she remembered them because she thought they were an odd couple the teacher and the thug she said degussa flirted with her shamelessly and flora just sat there and took it she also said degussa ate funny all hunched over his food like someone was going to steal it prison etiquette i said she ever see flora with van dyne nope either it wasnt on her shift or ol brian didnt make an impression extra kudos to you for the marina lead i found an address there for bennett hacker thought he lived on franklin as of seven months ago hes got two addresses apartment on franklin condo on marina way maybe his weekend getaway guess what paid for it i said i wonder how much kickback he got from sentries total billing was over a million and a quarter during the sixteenmonth period so thered be enough for everyone larsen and mary could have shot him and degussa a third and still ended up comfy maybe thats what they used gulls phony billings for thats zevonskys job to iron out im concentrating on four homicides meaning when bennett hacker leaves the parole office today he gets tailed i found a nice unobtrusive car in the department pool plan to be downtown in half an hour binchyll be in radio contact wanna come along maybe take pictures if my hands arent free i said smile and say cheese nice and unobtrusive was a dark gray volvo station wagon with blacktinted windows and an i love la bumper sticker the interior smelled of tobacco and incense on the passenger seat was a polaroid camera and five film cartridges i placed them on my lap hot wheels confiscated from a drug dealer he said peppier than it looks he installed a turbocharger drug dealers drive station wagons lifes full of surprises he said this one was a junior at the u selling ecstacy to his frat brothers daddys a surgeon mommys a judge it used to be her car as he drove toward downtown i filled him in on my encounter with kelly and sheila quick the highachieving kid he said quick called her home to help out he knows hes in trouble and he wants his family out of the way and he needs someone to take care of sheila another stash at eileen paxtons house when i mentioned that kelly clammed up at the next red light he scanned his notepad for paxtons numbers and punched in her office he got her on the phone talked very little did plenty of listening hung up and clicked his teeth together sheila and kelly were indeed supposed to show up at her place tonight but kelly just called said thered been a change of plans wouldnt specify what they were paxton tried arguing with kelly but kelly hung up and when paxton called back the car phone was switched off paxton says kelly was always stubborn says her sisters deteriorating psychologically shes never seen her this bad she was just about to call me sheila look that bad to you pretty fragile i said everything she thought she had is slipping away sean wondered if he should put a beonthelookout on the van seans been watching too much tv sheila and kelly arent suspects theyre a couple of scared women with good reason a bolo would put them in the cross hairs and hell if im gonna do that he got on the transferred to the east two exits later wonder if the quicks have passports family escape i said if jerrys got enough money saved up could be makes me feel sorry for him he said until i think about all those impaled bodies for all we know he flew somewhere already and is having wifey and daughter meet him or he just cruised across the border to mexico wifey and daughter and angie paul i said he clicked his tongue yeah there would be that little problem ill have sean check with the airports and the border patrol then do another looksee at angies place he switched to the fast lane made the call to binchy at seventy miles per sean ive got a few tasks for you really think so okay yeah sure give it to me to me could you copy this down i found a gum wrapper in the glove compartment and wrote down the name and the number he recited he gave binchy his orders and hung up when it rains it el niños what just might be a solid tip on christina marsh just came in this guy claims hes her brother saw her picture in the paper grad student at uc santa barbara lives in isla vista once we finish with hacker ill see if its for real california department of corrections parole division region iii was located on south broadway near first in the heart of downtown we got onto the left the freeway at fourth street drove south and got stuck in gridlock near second milo had me call the parole office and ask for bennett hacker can you sound like a con hey i said deepening my voice dont crowd me man he laughed i maneuvered voice mail structured to make me give up finally ended up talking to a brusque hurried woman how many felons would have the patience she barked you one of his assignments thats what they tell me i said got an appointment no but i you need an appointment hes not here oh man i said any idea when hell be back he left she said like a minute ago i gave up milo cursed three oclock and the guy takes off she said a minute ago i said if he parks outside the building maybe we can spot him leaving traffic wasnt moving then it crawled and stopped four cars in front of us downtown shadows turned the sidewalk charcoal what the hell said milo slamming the station wagon into park he got out and looked up and down broadway the right lane was closed blocked by groupings of orange cones the cones demarcated oblong excavations the air smelled of asphalt but no work crew was in sight milo flashed his badge at four startled drivers got back in watched them veer to the right perilously close to the cones he drove through the parting power he said waving his thanks intoxicating he coasted another ten feet found an illegal parking spot next to a conesurrounded hydrant right across from the parole building the sidewalks were crowded and no one paid attention seconds later a husky female parking officer approached pad in hand when she reached his window out came the badge he talked fast gave her no chance to speak she left glowering he said id cast her in a prison movie the ruthless matron with no heart of gold we waited no sign of bennett hacker a minute ago huh maybe theres a rear exit i said wouldnt that be sad five more minutes big gray government building lots of people coming and going three minutes later bennett hacker was disgorged through the front door in a crush of other civil servants he was easy to miss stepping away from the crowd to light up a cigarette but when the view cleared he was still puffing wearing an illfitting gray sport coat over navy chinos a dark blue shirt a silver and aqua striped tie still smoking he walked up the block to a hot dog stand milo cruised forward and i took hackers picture mouth full of chili dog hacker walked another block eating and smoking unhurried not a care in the world following slowly enough so as not to be noticed was a challenge traffic either sat still or spurted ahead milo broke lots of traffic laws managed to pull it off i took polaroids when i had a clear shot the prints revealed the ultimate forgettable man tall lanky unremarkably featured and colored one noticeable trait slightly pigeontoed it made him seem unsteady almost drunk at the next corner hacker finished the chili dog tossed the greasy paper wrapping at a wastebasket and missed he turned without stopping to pick it up there you go i said you can bust him for littering im keeping score milo edged up to the corner hacker entered an outdoor municipal parking lot milo said we stay here and wait till he comes out were looking for a explorer the reg says black but that coulda changed he has two addresses but just one car yup he doesnt spend on fancier wheels i said or clothing the place in the marina is his prize got to be his crib on franklins a dump onebedroom walkup in an old threestory building i drove by last night figuring to catch a glimpse of him maybe with degussa no luck his mailbox is full now i know why he prefers the sea breeze the explorer was black turned to gray by weeks of dirt bird shit speckled the top and the hood bennett hacker avoided the freeway and took side streets west through the downtown crush to figueroa then south to olympic past staples center all the way to robertson then a right on pico to motor southward to washington where the avenue deadended at the sony studio lot another right turn and we were heading for the marina a circuitous route it took nearly an hour hacker made no attempts at shortcuts or slick maneuvers he drove the way he walked slow easy not even a lane change unless it was essential he smoked constantly rolled the window down and flicked butts milo stayed three cars behind him and there was no sign hacker noticed at palms milo phoned sean binchy and told him to forget about joining the tail it wasnt looking complicated binchy was mired in bureaucracy and enjoying it airline records the border patrol querying the irs for jerome quicks tax records milo told him glad its fun for you sean at washington just east of palawan way bennett hacker stopped at a eleven and bought himself a slurpee and i took a picture of him sipping through two straws still drinking he got back in the explorer turned onto via marina and drove right past his apartment tossed the empty cup out the window where it bounced along the median he continued through the marina past bobby js and a spate of other harborside restaurants and pulled into a strip mall on the south end coin laundromat liquor store window grate company boat outfitters hog trail motorcyle shop fatlettered dayglo banners above the garage entrance said a big sale was going on big shiny bikes many of them chopped and customized were arranged in a tilting chorus line out in front here we go said milo a new toy for our civil servant i photographed hacker entering the shop and kept clicking away when he came out a few moments later talking with another man his companion bummed a cigarette big solid guy in a white tshirt and tight blue jeans work boots his hands and arms and the shirt were greasestained multiple tattoos slickedback dark hair raymond degussa looked heavier and older than his most recent mug shot hed grown back his mustache now graying and added a soul patch that emphasized a heavy lower lip well well said milo mr ray does have a day job probably another cozy cash situation like the club no papers filed no tax returns look whats on the floor to his right i said three rolls of black tarpaulin neoprene a shred had been found at flora newsomes crime scene milos jaw set i dont want to push good fortune i said but that window grate company over there has got to keep iron bars in stock talk about onestop shopping oh yeah said milo how about some more pictures click click click degussa found a rag and wiped his hands bennett hacker talked and both of them blew smoke that vanished in the beach air no expression on degussas long hard face then he nodded and grinned and snapped the rag and flicked it ten feet away into a white bucket just past the neoprene rolls two points this one could shoot he peeled off his greasy tshirt revealed slab pecs a hard protruding belly bulky hirsute shoulders arms and neck a thick waist softened by love handles some definition but mostly size prisons had free weights for bulking up no fancy toning machines crumpling the shirt he returned inside the bike shop came out wearing a shortsleeved black silk shirt that hung loose over the same jeans and boots untucked i said wonder if hes armed wouldnt shock me i reloaded the camera and photographed degussa and hacker as they got in the explorer the suv hooked an illegal u returned to washington turned south on inglewood and pulled to the curb just shy of culver boulevard in front of a bar called winners one of those claycolored cinderblock masterpieces with a bud sign in the single flyspecked window and a happy hour welldrinks discount banner above the door milo spotted a space across the street ten yards north he hung his own illegal u and parked i clickclicked the front of the bar milo said too small for us to go in without being noticed so we just wait an hour later hacker and degussa still hadnt emerged half an hour in milo had chanced a walk down the block and a looksee around the back of the bar the rear exits bolted eventually theyll have to show at the front as we sat there he checked with sean binchy a couple more times no record so far of jerome quick or angela paul flying anywhere jerry and angie gavin and christi likefatherlikeson had spawned a nightmare and i found myself feeling sympathy for quick no matter what else hed done milo groused no record at the mexican border but what the hell does that mean after youd think theyd register every damn car but they dont its still that stupid random crap leaving a big fat hole for quick to walk through i was about to commiserate when movement in front of winners caught my eye the party begins i said hacker and degussa and two women stood on the sidewalk as their pupils adjusted to the light a blonde a brunette both in their late thirties big hair heavy in the hips and bust the blonde wore a black tank top over epidermal jeans the brunettes tank was red backless highheeled sandals gave them both a mincing buttjiggling walk alcohol added some wobble faces that had once been pretty had been paved over by bad decisions hacker stopped to light up and degussa stretched his arms around both the women cupped their breasts the blonde threw her head back and laughed the brunette made a playful grab for his groin milo said classy the four of them got in the explorer and returned to hackers apartment entering the subterranean garage through an electric gate party time said milo and yet again im not invited chapter the buildings manager was a man in his sixties named stan parks he wore a shortsleeved white shirt and gray slacks had thinning hair and a disapproving mouth a thirtyyearold caltech engineering diploma hung behind his desk his office was on the ground floor next to the elevator and the rumble of the lift shook the room at random intervals he said hacker has no lease just a monthtomonth he and his roommate raymond degussa raymond something let me check parks tapped the keys of a laptop yup degussa did he move in the same time as hacker two months later hacker cleared it with me i told him no subleases the check had to come from him no split obligations how are they as tenants theyre okay your monthtomonths theyre the ones who give you troubles i prefer leases but its not one of the best units stayed vacant a long time whats wrong with it theres nothing wrong with it its just not one of our best not the harbor side and the way the trees grow at that particular height you cant see much of anything on the other side what trouble has he given you parks frowned and played with a pencil stippling three fingertips then passing the shaft between his fingers look im not just the manager im part owner so if theres something going on that affects the building i need to know who are the other owners sir my brothersinlaw the dentists the elevator vibrated the room parks sat through it stoic i depend on this place is there something i should worry about milo said at this point no what kind of problems have hacker and degussa given you at this point said parks the problems sir a few noise complaints at the beginning i spoke to hacker and it stopped what kind of noise loud music voices apparently they bring women in throw parties apparently mostly im sitting in here said parks ever see the women a couple of times the same women parks shook his head you know know what sir the type what type is that said milo not exactly high society party girls parkss eyes rolled hacker pays his rent i dont get involved in the tenants personal lives after those first few complaints theyve been fine whats the rent on their unit this is a money issue some sort of financial crime the rent please parks said hacker pays a month the unit has two full bedrooms and a den two baths and a builtin wet bar on the harbor side it would be over three thousand the women you saw would you recognize any of them parks shook his head everybody minds their own business here thats the point of the marina you get your divorced people your widowed people people want their privacy milo said everyone doing their own thing like you lieutenant you ask all these questions tell me nothing you seem pretty good at keeping your business to yourself milo smiled parks smiled back milo asked to see hackers parking slot and parks took us down to a subgarage that smelled of motor oil and wet cement half the slots were empty but the black explorer was in place milo and i looked through the windows food cartons a windbreaker maps loose papers stan parks said is this about drugs why would it be said milo youre examining the car parks went over and peered through the windows i dont see anything incriminating wheres mr degussas spot sir parks walked us a dozen slots down to a lincoln town car big square the predownsize model chrome rims shiny paint job custom job a heavy brownish red parks said pretty ugly color dont you think put all that money into restoration and end up with something like that i keep a few collector cars no way would i go this color this color was the precise hue of dry blood ugly i said what cars do you keep a caddy etype jag a minicooper im trained as an engineer do the work myself i nodded parks said by the way degussa also drives a motorcycle puts it over there indicating a section to the right smaller slots for twowheelers no bikes in sight he pays extra for that said parks wanted it for free but i told him twenty bucks a month a bargain said milo parks shrugged its not one of the better units we left the marina and milo asked for the number id written down and the name that went with it cody marsh the volvo was equipped with a handsoff phone system and milo plugged his little blue gizmo into it as he drove he punched in cody marshs number two rings and a voice said he was being rerouted to a mobile unit two additional rings and a man said hello mr marsh yes this is lieutenant sturgis oh hi fuzzy reception hold on let me switch off the radio okay im back thanks for calling im in my car coming down to la any way you can see me where are you the freeway coming up on balboa traffics not looking great but i can probably be in west la within half an hour christina marsh is your sister she is was can you find time to see me id really like to find out about her sure said milo meet me at a restaurant near the station café moghul he spelled the name and recited the address cody marsh thanked him and cut the connection we drove straight to the restaurant arrived in twentyfive cody marsh was already seated at a corner table drinking milklaced chai easy to spot solitary patron by the time we stepped through the glass beads he was on his feet looking exactly as if someone had died mr marsh thanks for seeing me lieutenant when will i be able to see my sister to identify the body youre sure you want to go through that sir i thought i had to said cody marsh christi has no one else he looked to be around thirty with long wavy brown hair parted in the middle had on a gray shirt under a cracked brown leather jacket rubbed white at the pressure points rumpled beige cargo pants white running shoes ruddy square face thick lips and tired blue eyes behind hornrimmed glasses fiveten with an incipient beer belly the only hint of kinship to the dead girl a dimpled chin actually sir said milo you dont have to do it in person you can look at a photo oh said marsh okay where do i go to see a photo ive got one right here sir but i have to warn you ill look at it milo said how about we all sit down cody marsh stared at the death shot his eyes closed and opened he folded his lips inward thats christi he raised his fist as if to pound the table but by the time the arc was completed the hand had stopped short of contact dammit the pleasant saridraped woman who ran the café turned to stare milo never talked business to her but she knew what he did he smiled at her and she resumed folding napkins im sorry for your loss sir christi said cody marsh what happened milo took the photo and put it away your sister was shot while parked in a car on mulholland drive along with a young man was the young man a friend seemed to be said milo his name was gavin quick know him cody marsh shook his head any idea why it happened thats what were looking into so christi never mentioned gavin quick no but christi and i werent in close communication the saried woman came over milo said just chai right now please ill probably see you tomorrow for lunch that would be lovely said the woman well have the sag paneer and the tandoori salmon on special when she was gone cody marsh said can the can christi be released for a funeral thats up to the coroners office said milo do you have a number for them ill call for you itll probably take a few days to get the papers in order thanks marsh pinged his teacup with a fingernail this is horrible is there anything you could tell us about your sister that would be helpful sir ping ping what would you like to know for starts when did christi move to la i cant say exactly but she called me about a year ago to tell me she was here you guys hail from minnesota baudette minnesota said marsh walleye capital of the world people who somehow find themselves there get their picture taken with willie walleye a fish a fortyfoot model of a fish i got out as soon as i could did my undergrad at oregon state taught grade school for a few years in portland so i could save up enough money to go to grad school and study history history milo repeated those who forget the past are condemned and all that i said did your being in santa barbara play a role in your sisters coming out to california it would be nice to say yes said marsh but i seriously doubt it the entire year weve seen each other exactly twice spoke on the phone maybe three or four times and wed been out of contact for a long time well before christi left minnesota those two times i said here in la i was attending symposia and called her actually i called her three times but once she was busy busy doing what said milo she didnt say whered you meet her we had dinner at my hotels which hotels thats important said marsh anything could be important sir youre the expert lets see one was a holiday inn in pasadena the other was a holiday inn in westwood christi met me in the coffee shop and came dressed totally inappropriately for an academic meeting i mean not that she was attending meetings but the the place was teeming with academics and she didnt look academic said milo not hardly inappropriate how i said i really dont want to talk ill of my sister i understand marsh pinged his cup some more both times she wore halter tops with no backs very very short skirts spike heels lots of makeup marsh sighed there was faculty all around people were staring the first time i let it go figuring she didnt know what to expect the second time i said something to her and it was a very tense meal she cut it short announced she had to go and just walked out without saying goodbye i didnt try to follow her afterward i realized id been a prissy jerk phoned her to apologize but she didnt return the call i tried again but by that time her number was inactive a month later i heard from her and she didnt mention a thing about walking out i asked for her new number but she said she was using prepaid cell phones disposable so there was no sense copying down the number id never heard of that she say why she was using prepaids she said it was simpler i took that to mean she didnt have enough of a credit history to get a real phone account or she had no permanent home out on the streets no i think she was living somewhere but not in a permanent place i tried to find out she refused to tell me i took that to mean she thought id disapprove ping ping i probably wouldve christi and i are very different i said she called you to reconnect she managed to track me down at the history department i walk in one day and find a message in my box that my sister called at first i thought it was a mistake cody marsh winced i didnt think of myself as having a sister christi and i have the same father but different mothers and we didnt grow up together christis significantly younger than i im thirtythree and shes was twentythree by the time she was old enough to relate to i was in oregon so we really didnt have a relationship are her parents alive our fathers dead and so is my mother christis mother is alive but she has serious mental problems has been institutionalized for years how many years i said since christi was four our father was a raging alcoholic as far as im concerned he killed my mother smoking in bed blinddrunk my mother was drinking too but the cigarette was his the house went up in flames he managed to stagger out lost an arm and part of his face but it didnt put a dent in his drinking i was seven went to live with my maternal grandparents soon after he met christis mom in a bar and started a whole new family serious mental problems i said carlenes schizophrenic said marsh thats why she hooked up with a onearmed scarfaced drunk im sure drinking was what they had in common im sure drinking and living with my father didnt help her mental state i was the lucky one my grandparents were educated both teachers religious my mother was trained as a social worker marrying him was her big rebellion and he raised christi after her mom was institutionalized it couldnt have been much of a raising i dont know the details i was living in baudette and he took christi over to st paul i heard that she dropped out of high school but im not sure exactly what grade later she went to duluth with him he was working on some sort of land crew then back to st paul a really bad neighborhood milo said sounds like you kept tabs no said marsh i heard things from my grandparents filtered through their biases marsh worked several strands of hair over his face spread them back shook his head they hated my father blamed him for my mothers death and everything else that was wrong in the world they loved recounting his misfortunes in great detail the slum neighborhoods he was forced to live in christi failing in school dropping out christi getting into trouble were talking editorializing not straight reporting they saw christi as an extension of him bad seed they wanted nothing to do with her she wasnt their blood so christi and i were kept apart what kind of trouble did christi get into i said the usual drugs keeping bad company shoplifting my grandparents told me she got sent to one of those wilderness camps then juvenile hall part of it was their schadenfreude reveling in someone elses misery the other part was that deep down they worried about me being halfdad genetically so they used dad and christi as negative examples they were preaching to the converted because christi represented everything i despised about my roots the trash side as my grandparents called it i was a good student well behaved destined for better things i bought into that it wasnt until my divorce he smiled i neglected to mention that somewhere along the way i got married that lasted nineteen months soon after the divorce both my grandparents died and i was feeling pretty alone and i realized i did have a half sib i barely knew and maybe i should stop being a selfrighteous jerk so i tried to get in touch with christi nagged my greataunt my grandmothers sister until she told me christi was still living in st paul doing burlesque i phoned a few strip clubs i was motivated the whole rebonding fantasy and finally located the place where christi worked she wasnt happy to hear from me very distant so i bribed her by wiring her a hundred bucks after that she started calling every couple of months sometimes to talk sometimes to ask for more money that seemed to bother her having to ask there was a shy side to her shed pretend to be tough but she could be sweet milo said she give you any other details about her lifestyle just that she was dancing we never got into details when she called it was always from a club i could hear the music going sometimes i thought she mightve sounded high i didnt want to do anything to put distance between us she liked the fact that i was a teacher sometimes she called me teach instead of my name marsh removed his glasses and wiped them with his napkin unshielded his eyes were small and weak then her calls stopped and the club said she was gone no forwarding i didnt hear from her for over a year until i got the message in my box at school no idea what she was doing for over a year marsh shook his head she said shed made enough from dancing to relax for a while but i wondered about what if shed gotten into other things i put that out of my head because i had no facts other things such as selling herself said marsh that was another thing my grandparents were always telling me about christi she was promiscuous they used lesskind language i didnt want to hear it he took hold of his cup managed to get down some chai christi had learning problems but i guess one thing she could always count on was her looks she was an extremely beautiful child skinny as a stick when she was little whiteblond hair below her waist it was never clean or combed and she wore mismatched clothes dad didnt have a clue sometimes not often hed drop in unannounced my grandfather would always storm up to his room and not come down grandmother called christi the street urchin as in heres the bum and the street urchin come aknocking better lysol the cups and glasses usually id escape to my room too one time christi couldnt have been more than four so i was fourteen she ran up the stairs flung my door open and threw herself on me marsh pulled at the skin around his jaw hugging me tickling me giggling an idiot couldve seen she was reaching out but it annoyed me i yelled at her to stop bellowed and she got off me stared with this look in her eyes and slunk out i really crushed her his eyes were dry but he wiped them i was fourteen what did i know i said what do you know about her life in la in la she didnt ask me for money i can tell you that he nudged his teacup aside i guess that bothered me because of what she might be doing to get by was she involved with bad people did she imply that marsh hesitated sir she did tell me some wild stories said marsh the last time we spoke over the phone milo said how long ago was that three four months what kind of wild stories more out there than wild said marsh she talked extremely fast so i wondered if shed gotten into drugs amphetamines cocaine something that was hyping her up or worse could she be ending up like her mother tell us about the stories i said she claimed she was working with secret agencies doing undercover work spying on gangsters hooked up with terrorists making big money wearing expensive clothes expensive shoes she went on a long time about her shoes she really wasnt making much sense but i let her go on then she just stopped talking said she had to go hung up he pulled at his hair thats the last time we talked milo said secret agencies marsh said like i said out there i said and shoes were a big deal to her spying and wearing good shoes said marsh she even mentioned a brand some chinese thing jimmy choo thats the one marsh stared at us what it was true she was wearing jimmy choo shoes the night she died oh god and the rest milo said the rest was fantasy poor christi said marsh fantasy as in mental illness milo glanced at me no i said she was misled by the person who killed her its possible marsh moaned covered his face with his hand we watched his shoulders heave at least he said she wasnt going crazy thats important to you my grandparents they raised me well in a pseudomoral sense but i came to realize that they werent moral people the way they demeaned christi her mother even dad i hated him but i came to realize that everyone deserves grace and charity grandmother and grandfather always said christi would end up like her mother made jokes about it mad as a loon weaving baskets in bedlam this was a child they were talking about my sister i didnt like hearing it but i never objected he gathered a handful of hair and twisted it hard enough to pucker the top of his brow they were wrong thats good i said did christi mention any names of people she was working with in the secret agencies she said she couldnt this is covert teach this is the real mindfucking powerful mojo teach marsh slid his cup closer someone misled her who cant say anything more at this point sir said milo marshs smile was resigned but it warmed up his face a man comfortable being disappointed running your own covert operation something like that can you at least tell me this are you feeling any optimism about finding out who did it were making progress sir i guess i have to be satisfied with that said cody marsh is there anything else not at this point sir milo took his number and marsh stood so youll call the coroner for me i really want to see my little sister we watched him leave milo said secret agent mojo think she coulda been going off the deep end i think someone convinced a girl with learning problems that she was playing spy games think prepaid phones jerry quick he hooked her up with gavin i said maybe he decided to give her another assignment spying on his fellow scamsters what if he was pulling a con within a con and got discovered and thats why hes on the run running christi as a mole shed be perfect for the assignment undereducated gullible low selfesteem living on the fringe growing up with a neglectful alchoholic father she wouldve craved an older mans attention jerry was an operator who didnt pay his rent on time but he did drive a mercedes and he lived in beverly hills to girls like angie paul and christi he would seem like a sugar daddy christi would be perfect for something else he said partying with hacker and degussa and bringing jerry back the info compared to those slatterns we just saw them with christi wouldve been a prize the saried woman came over and asked if we needed anything how about some mixed appetizers said milo she walked off beaming he said bastard buys her jimmy choos and armani perfume and various other toys i said parks claims he wouldnt recognize any of the women hacker and degussa partied with but i could show him christis death shot problem with that is hed freak out and want to evict hacker and degussa so i cant trust him to keep quiet a tray of fried things arrived want some no thanks all for me then he dipped something round into parsleytopped yogurt christi wasnt killed just because she happened to be with gavin her cover got blown hell maybe she was the target not gavin like we thought at the beginning that would explain the sexual overtones i thought about that degussa impaled men in prison and did the same to at least three women he didnt impale gavin you could be right he concentrated his rage on christi even with that scenario though gavin was more than an accidental victim as jerry quicks son hed be a target for revenge or degussa was replaying flora newsome what do you mean the jealousy scenario i said if degussa had partied with christi seeing her make love to gavin would not have made him happy degussa was dating flora he said christi was a party girl this asshole picks up floozies in bars hes not into emotional involvement maybe he is not romantically but in terms of ownership you said it yourself christi wouldve been a step up young goodlooking compliant what if degussa wanted her to himself think about the mulholland crime scene the way the bodies were found gavins fly was open and christis top was off degussa followed them watched them park watched them engage in foreplay if all he was after was a quick execution he couldve stepped in earlier and gotten it over with instead he waited watched them the timing was significant no consummation the message was you may try but you wont succeed by shooting gavin in front of christi he demonstrated to her that he was the dominant male she was shocked terrified maybe she tried to flirt her way out of it degussa shot her too then had fun with his iron rod milo put his fork down looked as if the last thing he wanted to do was eat i said the more i think about it the more it makes sense this is a hypermacho actionoriented psychopath who doesnt take well to rejection he put cash on the table called sean binchy and ordered him to find two other cops and do a careful surveillance on hacker and degussa dont lose them sean hanging up he rubbed his face if youre right about jerry quick assigning christi to gavin and to degussa he used her in ways she couldnt imagine he snatched up an appetizer gulped it down frowned bad batch i said bad world chapter roxbury park pm the picnic tables shade from the chinese elms and a declining sun turned the redwood the color of old asphalt this late in the afternoon only four children occupied the play area two little boys roaring and running wildly a toddling girl hand held by her mother making her way up the stairs of a doublehump slide and whooshing down over and over another boy pensive alone sitting and scooping sand and letting it trickle through his tiny fingers three uniformed maids discussed something with glee and animation blue jays squawked and mockingbirds aped them traffic from olympic was distant and hushed the tenyearold icecream truck once white now gray was parked facing the fence the trucks flanks were decorated with handpainted renderings of sugary delights in unlikely colors an elaborately calligraphic statement of ownership read gloglo frozen desserts prop ramon hernandez compton california on the front passenger seat was a cooler stocked with juice bars cream sandwiches and popups in case anyone asked so far no one had the trickle of kids and the lateness of the hour combined to discourage commerce and the trucks position too just out of sight of the play area parked close enough to have a clear view of the picnic tables in the drivers seat sat a detective named sam diaz a technical specialist from parker center thirtyfive compact mustachioed diaz wore a white sweatshirt over baggy white cotton painters pants a coin dispenser hung from his waist in his pocket was a commercial food license identifying him as ramon hernandez and a wallet full of small bills under the sweatshirt rested his holstered mm jerrybuilt into the trucks dashboard was forty thousand dollars of longdistance outdoor recording equipment the kind national geographic uses to memorialize birdcalls the mikes were turned down and the arias of the jays and mockingbirds were reduced to peeps so was the noise from the play area squeaks of highpitched glee the murmur of adult voices the equipment was hard to spot unless you got inside the truck and saw all the knobs and the leds and the wires that ran under the partition separating the seats from the rear storage area a talk hole had been cut into the partition covered by a sliding door now open the trucks doors were locked and its windows were tinted several shades darker than the legal limit hasty job some of the tinting plastic had puckered around the edges why anyone would go to the trouble of concealing an icecream truck was the obvious question but no one was asking milo and i sat in back on two vinyl bench seats borrowed from an impounded toyota and bolted to the floor another hasty job the stiff cushions wobbled and squeaked when we moved and keeping still was driving milo crazy hed finished two icecream sandwiches and a peanutstudded drumstick balled up the wrappers and tossed them in a corner muttering gluttony rules behind the truck was an alley and beyond that the highfenced backyards of the pretty view houses on south spalding drive through a tiny tinted heartshaped window cut into one of the trucks rear doors we could see fifty feet north or south during the hour wed been there eight cars had driven through no movement from the houses that was to be expected this was beverly hills bolted to our side of the partition was a small color tv monitor with a digital readout that ticked off the passage of time the tint was off bright beverly hills green had faded to olive tree trunks were gray the sky was butteryellow a speaker that hung from a metal hook to the right of the monitor supplied the sound effects the only sound now was franco gull shifting his position on the redwood bench he fooled with his hair gazed off into the distance studied the top of the table working at being disinterested as he tried to get down some coffee in a starbucks cup big cup grandemegapoobah or whatever they called it during our second meeting hed worked at friendly telling me he understood i had good intentions letting slip midway through the interview that hed suspected something wasnt right with sentries for justice but not knowing what to do about it appreciative of his deal this was his payment the miniature microphone that transmitted his occasional sighs was affixed to the bottom of the picnic table wiring the table was the obvious way to go sam diaz had taken one look at gull and said the way he sweats i wire him he might just go and electrocute himself other than that gulls anxiety was no problem he was supposed to be nervous now he waited we all did at five after five diaz said ive got someone approaching from the roxbury side across the bocci field a figure male anonymous could be seen in the upperright quadrant of the monitor then lower larger as it got closer as the man approached gulls park bench albin larsens form took shape today he wore a wheatcolored sport coat tan shirt tan pants at least thats what i assumed the monitor dulled it down to offwhite thats him said milo mr beige said diaz i coulda used blackandwhite yeah hes a riot when larsen got close to the bench he acknowledged gull with a small nod sat down said nothing diaz fiddled with a dial and the bird sounds amplified gull said thanks for seeing me albin the speaker turned his voice tinny larsen said you sounded upset gull i am albin larsen crossed his legs and glanced over at the children two kids remained one maid diaz fiddled with another dial and his camera zoomed in on larsens face passive impassive diaz backed up captured both men gull the police have been questioning me albin larsen really gull you dont sound surprised larsen i assume its about mary gull it started out about mary but now theyre asking questions that confuse me albin about us our group our billing silence albin go on said larsen about sentries for justice albin milo said guy thinks hes an actor i said today he is albin larsen still hadnt responded we listened to birdcalls a threeyearolds shout gull said albin larsen said really gull really larsen what kinds of questions gull whose idea was the program howd we hear about it how long has it been going on did all three of us participate then they got personal and thats whats bothering me how much i personally billed could i verify the figures did mary or you ever talk to me about intentional overbilling they were really gung ho albin fascistic sounds to me like they suspect some kind of fraud is there something you and mary never told me about silence eleven seconds larsen said who asked these questions the same cops who were by the first time along with some idiot from medical silence gull moved closer to larsen larsen didnt budge sam diaz said this ones cagey bet hes dry as a bone fourteen seconds fifteen sixteen gull is something going on albin because if there is i need to know im the one theyre harassing and i dont know what to tell them is there something i should know larsen why would there be gull they they seem so sure of themselves as if theyre really onto something i know you and mary wanted me to see more sentries patients but i told you i really wasnt into it so why would they be bothering me i had nothing to do with the program silence nine seconds gull right albin larsen maybe they think youre knowledgeable gull im not larsen then you should have nothing to worry about gull albin is there something to worry about larsen what did you tell them about your billings gull that i billed for the few patients i saw and that was it they were skeptical i could see it in their faces just about came out and called me a liar and said they found what i was telling them hard to believe even though it was true you know that albin eleven seconds gull come on albin is there some billing thing i dont know about larsen this is really upsetting you gull dont play shrink with me albin larsen placed a palm over his heart and smiled faintly gull i ask you a straightforward question and you come back with this is really upsetting you ive been through the wringer with those fascists this isnt the time for rogerian bullshit albin sixteen seconds then albin larsen stood and sam diaz said uhoh larsen walked several feet away from the table hands clasped behind his back closer to the play area a professor thinking deep thoughts franco gull glanced back in the direction of the truck helpless expression on his moist face looking right at us milo said idiot larsen returned to the table and sat back down youre obviously upset franco marys death and what it means for us is upsetting gull thats the thing albin i get the feeling from them the police that they think marys death had something to do with sentries i know thats sounds crazy but if thats what they think who knows where it will lead four seconds larsen why would they think that gull you tell me if you know something i should know you have to tell me its only fair im on the hot seat you have no idea how they treat you when they suspect you of something they phone me incessantly have me break appointments and come in for interrogations have you ever been in a police station albin larsen smiled from time to time gull yeah probably some place in africa whatever but you havent been a suspect let me tell you its not fun thirteen seconds gull they call it interviewing but its interrogation i swear albin i feel like some character out of a goddamned movie one of those kafkaesque things hitchcock everything happens to the unsuspecting fool and im he larsen it sounds dreadful gull its horrendous and disruptive its starting to affect my work how the hell am i supposed to concentrate on patients when the next message on my machine could be from them what if they start shoving paper at me subpoenas whatever it is they use what if they try to comb through my records larsen did they use the word subpoena gull who remembers the point is theyre rooting around like truffle pigs larsen rooting thats all it is gull albin i feel im not getting through to you he took hold of larsens shoulders larsen didnt move and gulls hands dropped why are they focusing on sentries tell me the truth what were you and mary up to silence six seconds larsen we were attempting to inject some compassion into the american criminal justice system gull yeah yeah i know all that i mean nuts and bolts the billing its the billing theyre latching onto they just about came out and said they suspect us of medical fraud albin were you fooling with the billing larsen why would i do that milo said cagey bastard gull i dont know but they suspect something before this thing spins out of control i need to know if theres any truth to their suspicions even if it was some kind of mistake some paperwork thing did you or mary do anything anything at all that would give them fuel because i think theyre after blood albin i really do i think marys death got them thinking in a whole bizarre direction obsessive like that patient of marys who died you know i treated him gavin quick kid was fourplus ocd in addition to all his other problems i was happy to dump him on mary but i swear albin dealing with them i started to feel i was being forced into some ocd soap opera the same questions over and over and over as if theyre trying to break me down eighteen seconds gull youre not saying anything larsen im listening fine you know how it is with obsession the patient gets into something and keeps going at it which is okay when youre the therapist and can establish boundaries but being on the receiving end these are not sophisticated people albin but they are persistent they perceive the world in hunterprey terms and have no respect for our profession im feeling like im set up to be the prey and i dont want that and i shouldnt think youd want it either larsen who would milo said such empathy sam diaz said if this guy was hooked up to the poly the needles wouldnt even be quivering gull hed make the machine explode gull waved his hands diaz backed the camera several feet farther establishing postural context larsen just sat there thirtytwo seconds of silence passed before gull said i have to say im feeling a little dismissed albin i asked you substantive questions and youve given me nothing but bland reassurance larsen placed a hand on gulls shoulder his voice was gentle theres nothing for me to tell you my friend gull nothing larsen nothing to be concerned about three seconds nothing to lose sleep over gull easy for you to say youre not the one whos being larsen would it make you feel better if i spoke to them gull to the police larsen to the police to the medical people anyone you like would it make you feel better gull glanced back toward the truck then he returned his attention to larsen larsen was watching the children again gull yes as a matter of fact it would it would make me feel substantially better albin larsen then i will do that six seconds gull what will you tell them larsen that nothing untoward has gone on gull and thats true larsen gave gulls shoulder another pat im not worried franco gull you really think you can clear things up larsen theres nothing to clear up gull nothing larsen nothing milo said cold bastard hes not gonna spill so much for this sam diazs chair squeaked he said want another drumstick no thanks maybe ill try one of those orange bars the vanilla half looks pretty creamy on the monitor franco gull ran his hands through his curls okay i sure hope so thanks albin he rose to go no no no said milo stay put you idiot the remaining maid collected her young charges and left larsen stayed gull with a hand on gulls cuff lets sit for a while franco gull why larsen enjoy the air this beautiful park enjoy life gull youre finished with patients for the day larsen i am indeed ninety seconds neither of them talked at a hundred thirtynine seconds sam diaz said approaching male from the roxbury side again another figure well in the distance was crossing the park diagonally from the east striding across the lawn passing just north of the play area and continuing into the shadow of the chinese elms diaz aimed the camera at him zoomed in goodsized man broadshouldered barrel chest blue silk shirt turned teal green by the monitor worn untucked over blue jeans dark hair combed straight back graying mustache but raymond degussa had shaved off his soul patch milo said bad guy get ready for anything sam he unsnapped his holster but didnt remove his gun unlatching one of the icecream trucks rear doors he got out closed the door quietly i turned back to the monitor gull and larsen remained silent gulls back was to degussa as degussa made his way over to the picnic table larsen saw degussa but didnt react then franco gull turned and said whats he doing here no answer from larsen gull whats going on albin hey let go of my sleeve why are you holding me back let go what the hells going on degussa made a beeline for the table was six feet away reaching under his shirt when gull broke free from larsens grasp larsen just sat there degussa pulled out a small gun toylike pointed it in gulls direction probably a cheap you could throw them away and buy another on the street for chump change five feet from gull nice clean target i thought about jack ruby picking off oswald where was milo gull ducked and shoved larsen in the path of degussas gun and screamed help as he dropped to the grass and rolled away diazs camera remained narrowly focused degussa circled around larsen to get a good shot at gull larsen ducked helping him along gull had tried to get up but he was caught legs stuck under the picnic bench torso twisted he placed his hands atop his head creating a useless shield degussa leaned over the bench aimed crack the sound of a single pair of hands clapping once a hole appeared on degussas forehead black tinted deep brown by the monitor the same shade as degussas customized lincoln his mouth dropped open he frowned annoyed he lifted his gun arm still trying to shoot let it drop tumbled facefirst onto the table the flew out of his hands and landed on the dirt albin larsen dove for it the man could mobilize when needed sam diaz said oh man i should be out there wheres milo dont see him im calling for backup then im outta here doc you stay inside he got on the police radio i watched albin larsen bend and retrieve degussas gun gull had freed his legs and he swung them at larsen missed sprang up turned to run larsen examined the gun then aimed it turning his back to the camera crack crack two bursts of applause two holes materialized on the back of larsens sport coat within an inch of each other just right of the center seam diaz was saying another one just went down this is code three plus friend larsen straightened stretched his neck as if plagued by a sudden pinch the spot on his jacket became a brown stain his right hand reached back scratching an itch he changed his mind rotated showed the camera a partial profile expressionless more dreadful applause and something puffed in the center of larsens neck at the juncture of ruddy neck flesh with tan shirt larsen reached for that too his arms shot out spastically and flopped to his sides his body lurched forward onto the grass gull was twenty feet away staring screaming birdsongs on the speaker still life on the monitor the starbucks cup hadnt even moved the trucks rear door burst open and milo threw himself in ghostly white breathing hard someones up there he panted has to be one of the houses on spalding a backyard has to be a rifle i was pinned next to the van diaz returned to the cab slid the partition open backups on its way gotta be a longrange scope you okay yeah im fine seconds later seventeen seconds according to the monitor came the sirens chapter bennett hacker folded easily faced with a mountain of evidence compiled by medical fraud investigator dwight zevonsky a twentynineyearold with the look of a hippie grad student and the manner of a grand inquisitor the parole officer traded full disclosure for a guilty plea to fraud and grand larceny that brought him a sixyear sentence in a federal prison out of california under protective isolation because hacker had once been a barstow patrolman and former cops didnt fare well behind bars even those whod befriended cons the scam had gone just as wed theorized hacker and degussa trolling for halfwayhouse residents whose names could be registered as sentries patients compensating the parolees with small cash payments or drugs or sometimes nothing at all at first the cons showed up for signin sessions and one followup in the unoccupied suite on the ground floor later even that pretext was dropped later the patient population had stretched beyond the halfway houses with degussa charged with finding new recruits sometimes we used dope sometimes ray just scared the junkies hacker said ray gives you a look that can be enough he smiled and smoked knowing hed made a good deal probably working out six years of angles milo and zevonsky sat across from him in the interview room i watched through the oneway mirror before being booked hackers contact lenses had been removed and hed been issued cheap jail eyeglasses with clear plastic frames a size too large they slid down his nose and made his chin appear even skimpier the gestalt was creepy malicious nerd in county blues hacker tried to tell the story as if he wasnt a protagonist degussa and his partner receiving twothirds of the billings filed under franco gulls name splitting slightly over two hundred thousand dollars during a sixteenmonth period ray was unhappy said hacker he figured the others were making millions he should be getting more what did he do about it said milo he was planning to talk to them about it them said zevonsky being the shrinks koppel and larsen they were in charge it was all them they cooked it up came to me howd you know them koppel used to see me at the halfway house she owned checking up on my charges she came to you said zevonsky thats right and your job was to sign my name to some therapy forms also to pinpoint good candidates meaning druggies losers guys who wouldnt give problems hacker smiled she was a businesswoman milo said she owned the halfway houses in partnership with her ex so what about him fat boy he owned the houses but he had nothing to do with it zevonsky said youre sure you want to go on record saying that im on record because its true why would i lie to you puff puff hell if i could bring someone else into this i would spread the wealth do myself some more good maybe youd lie just for the fun of it said milo this isnt fun said hacker this isnt anything near fun what about jerome quick said milo again with that the only quick i know is gavin and i already told you about him whos jerry the kids brother i already told you about him recounting it coldly gavin snooping around the building after hours seeing scruffy men filing in and out for fiveminute visits overhearing things conversations about billing gavin the braininjured wouldbe investigative reporter stumbling upon a real story and dying because of it crazy idiot said hacker crazy idiot because he snooped said milo and opened up his big yap he went and told koppel about his suspicions during therapy hed never seen her with the cons so i guess he assumed she wasnt in on it she told larsen said shed handle it larsen didnt believe her had ray handle it confidentiality milo said who did gavin see with the cons ray and larsen arent you leaving something out said dwight zevonsky hacker smoked and nodded i was occasionally there mostly my job was getting names making sure the cons were stable passing out bribes said zevonsky whatever milo said did koppel know gavin was going to be whacked no said hacker like i said she thought she could handle it larsen didnt believe her larsen didnt want to wait so he called ray ray had done it before killed for larsen no for himself who guys in prison what about another woman pause maybe that too maybe said milo i dont know for sure ray implied it said when women put him down they were gonna get stuck with the tab when he said it he was playing with a knife cleaning his nails get stuck he used those words it was a figure of speech with him when someone went down they were stuck with the tab ray could be generous when we partied hed give women whatever they wanted long as they didnt disappoint him disappoint him how by not doing what he wanted bossy fellow said milo he could be said hacker so koppel wasnt in on gavins murder i told you no when she found out figured out what happened she went nuts threatened to shut the whole thing down larsen tried to calm her down but she was pretty upset i think what bugged her the most was that one of her patients had been whacked she took that personally so ray whacked her too hacker nodded he told you he was gonna do it told you about gavin too uhuh no way if he told me i wouldve tried to stop it being an upright guy and all that said milo hey said hacker winking i used to be his po what about christina marsh she partied with us a slut ray was fucking her she was a stripper and he liked her cause she was stupid and had a tight body he bought her expensive stuff like what clothes perfume like i said ray could be generous all the money you were making he could afford to be it ran through his fingers said hacker typical con ray buy christina shoes wouldnt surprise me he liked her he liked what she did for him until until what said hacker she was also up there on mulholland bennett true said hacker this is full disclosure the deal can be turned around hacker pushed his glasses up his nose the deals already inked you keep twisting things to put yourself out of the picture well tear up the papers and send you over for a prosecution im putting myself out of the picture because i wasnt in that picture said hacker in the sentries picture yes the helpwiththepaperwork picture yes but not the uponmulholland picture you knew ray was going to whack gavin he never came out and said so he hinted said milo said someone was gonna get stuck with the tab hacker hesitated nodded he told you about it afterward who says you were roommates we werent asshole buddies milo mimed tearing up a sheet of paper hacker said what he said was i solved our problem i didnt ask later a couple of days later we were getting high in the apartment and he was feeling good and he told me the details said it went down easy the kid was surprised he didnt put up any resistance whyd he kill christina marsh cause she was there any other motivation he said she irritated him by being with the kid irritated thats the word he used ray had a way using little words for big feelings i know for a fact that christi irritated him other times too because he told me whatd she do its what she didnt do not being there when ray wanted her to be one time he scored some highclass coke wanted to party with her and she wasnt available then she did that again said she was busy ray didnt like being told no howd ray meet christi some bar said hacker he picked her up a bar where playa del rey the whale watch its a place we went a lot christi was there said milo right there said hacker ripe for the picking rays words you party with her too hacker laughed and smoked shoved his glasses up again took them off and said i need a smaller size of these milo said you party with christi marsh bennett not quite whys that ray wasnt into sharing ray ever talk about someone named flora newsome her said hacker surprised yeah i knew flora she temped at an office where i worked ray come into that office yeah said hacker as a matter of fact ray knew her too they dated for a while as a matter of fact said milo why whats she got to do with anything she got stuck with the check hackers myopic eyes bugged youre kidding you didnt know i transferred out of that office it was a satellite after maybe two weeks flora i liked her nice girl quiet i thought about dating her myself but then ray started with her and ray didnt like to share he did her oh yeah said milo too bad said hacker his voice had dropped he looked as if he meant it something bother you bennett whatd she do to piss ray off you dont know i swear i dont you said ray implied hed done women yeah but like i said he just hinted around youre saying that was her flora shit that bother you bennett sure it does i liked her nice girl after ray said he wasnt dating her anymore i told him maybe id give her a try he got irritated with me told me sloppy seconds was for losers hacker licked his lips i thought about doing it anyway i liked flora but you didnt want ray irritated at you was it in the papers nope said milo smalltime story flora said hacker unreal you guys have fun rooming in the marina his idea not mine said hacker he was supposed to split the rent so i thought why not wed go our separate ways he paid one month dont tell me said milo you didnt complain like i said ray a good roomie actually yes said hacker made his bed vacuumed you know cons they can be real neat i thought it would save me some money my plan was to own the place not just rent my main place is a shithole you saw it i like the water youre sure the federal thing is buttoned down i wont be close to anyone i mightve worked with in california i dont want to be watching my back all the time buttoned tight hacker smoked smiled all thoughts of flora newsome vanished milo said something amusing bennett i was thinking said hacker when the six years are over im gonna be assigned to someone like me chapter it would be a long time before jerry quicks entire story would be told maybe never said milo there was a dash of false hope a week after id seen kelly quick and her mother kelly made the mistake of using a conventional cell phone not a prepaid when she called rio de janeiro milo had gotten a subpoena for her account and he traced the call staybridge suites hotel são paulo brazil brazil has no extradition treaty with the us i said funny thing about that quick checked in four days ago with a woman paid cash checked out yesterday no indication where the registration book lists them as mr and mrs jack schnell englewood new jersey and they had passports to prove it the desk clerk describes it as a maydecember thing grayhaired guy younger woman dark slim she have blue fingernails kaching you get the kewpie doll clerk said they looked deeply in love clerk said mr schnell bought mrs schnell a string bikini and various other baubles i said schnell means quick in german yeah i know hahaha mistake number two a mastercard belonging to sheila quick had been used to rent a room at a days inn in pasadena milo and i drove out there spotted sheila reading a softcover by the pool covered by a bulky robe no string bikini there she looked pale and small and we avoided her and walked up to her room milos knock was answered by a young female voice yes housekeeping kelly quick opened the door saw him then me said oh no she was barefoot had her hair pinned up and wore glasses cutoffs and an oversized olive drab tshirt that read us army special forces we get the job done in her hand was ten pounds of law book milo said hi kelly and showed her his badge she said i havent done anything hows the weather in são paulo she sagged i screwed up shouldve used a pay phone hes going to her mouth clamped shut going to what ms quick tears filled her eyes going to be disappointed in me milo steered her back into the room twin beds neatly made up soda cans and takeout cartons and female clothing all over the place more law books piled up on a nightstand he sat her down on one of the beds hows the studying going its hard to concentrate going back in the fall who knows no need for this to be difficult kelly you think she said thats a laugh how long are you planning to live this way taking care of your mom kellys dark eyes flashed i dont take care of her shes you cant take care of her you can just watch her make sure she doesnt hurt herself whatever i said she needs real help kelly and you need to get on with your life she glared at me foam collected at the corners of her mouth youre so damn smart tell me how to do that lets call your aunt eileens a bitch shes also an adult and she lives in california you need to be back in boston whatever blink blink i said we can help you with all that sure you can milo said wheres your dad headed uhuh screw your help leave me alone that tshirt said milo dad give it to you no answer ive done some research kelly found a website where he attended his army reunion what the site didnt say was that he was in a special forces unit qualified as a sniper kelly closed her eyes milo said i was in vietnam myself know the unit he was in some pretty hairy situations i wouldnt know id bet you would kelly bet dad told you plenty then youd lose your bet the other thing my research turned up was that no one can seem to find any evidence your dad ever traded metals we know what he really did for a living kelly his latest freelance was for a gentleman from africa he tell you about that tell you what he did to pay the bills she turned away from us he was a businessman he supported us so where is he now she shook her head brazil said milo with a girl not much older than you hes entitled kelly blurted he did his best with her my mom you dont know what its like moms tough moms she threw up her hands shes who she is thats exactly why you shouldnt be forced to be her nurse im not her nurse you dont know what youre talking about look said milo its just a matter of time were going to dig and were going to find out where he got his money and where he keeps it that happens any financial support for your moms going to be turned off kelly faced him why are you doing this my brothers dead and my mothers sick and hes gone dont i deserve a life you do you do indeed then leave me alone she screamed everyone leave me alone she lay down on the bed curled up scrunched her face and began pounding the mattress milo gave me a helpless look i said lets go we stopped at a place on colorado boulevard for coffee and theory protais bumaya existed he said you saw him i saw him but no ones got any record of him entering or leaving the country and those names he gave us his supposed friends bogus i never bothered to check guy snookered me good he probably tagged along on some kind of diplomatic mission he aimed an index finger at me another kaching matter of fact last month a trade delegation from rwanda toured the country bumayas name wasnt on the roster but what the hell does that mean meanwhile mr mckenzie the erstwhile rwandan consul in sf is charming but not very helpful i covered my eyes then my ears and mouth the techs went over that backyard on spalding owners had been out of town for a month the gates were locked but it was easy enough to hop over perfect view of the park bench and easy hiding behind a big thatch of banana plants wet soil youd think thered be a footprint but nada not a single indentation no shell casings no cigarette butts jerrys a pro i said freelancing for foreign governments perfect civilian transition for a restless old special forces guy i got bh techs to go through his house they found gunpowder residue and some iron filings in a locker in the garage but no weapons big locker though enough for a sizable stash rifles scopes all the good stuff bumaya hired quick to avenge the murdered boys i said and maybe some other people too quick kept a close watch on larsen learned about the scam bided his time maybe he was trying to figure out a way to get hold of larsens scam money like an abduction where he could force larsen to give up pin numbers or foreign account access he connected larsen to mary lou and mary lou to koppel became sonnys tenant as a way to get closer then gavin had his accident and provided him with another opportunity he knew mary lou was involved in the scam but he had no beef with her he chatted up sonny got sonny to refer him to mary lou sending his kid for therapy would make his presence at the building easy to explain mary lou punted to gull but that was no big deal for jerry remember how gull told us that it was jerry not sheila who brought gavin in for his first appointment concerned father he said special forcestrained pro and he doesnt pay his rent on time everyones got their vulnerabilities i said money was his supporting a beverly hills lifestyle with intermittent freelance hits couldve been a strain so was feigning respectability and keeping a mistress on the side a bigbucks payoff wouldve allowed him some squeeze room thats why he kept his eye fixed on the scam then gavin messed things up by playing his own little spy game copying down license numbers and including his fathers that night maybe jerry followed gavin or he was doing his own surveillance and had no idea gavin had spotted him maybe gavin even told him about it and jerry explained it away warned gavin off but gavin was obsessive he persisted and got killed and jerry knew why and now he had another reason to get rid of larsen and a second target degussa he cleaned out gavins room to see exactly what gavin knew as well as to destroy any link to him then he went into hiding larsen and degussa and i led him right to them that bother you not one damn bit you really think gavin confronted the old man its hard to say how much they communicated outside of jerry trying to get gavin laid the first time we met jerry he told us he and gavin were close but i remember thinking that didnt feel right he seemed out of touch the fact that kelly didnt fly out immediately was also odd this familys finally come apart but it was long in the making gavins accident couldnt have been easy for any of them jerry included you have sympathy for the guy he said we start looking into his travel schedule you know were going to find a whole lot of dead people if theyre people like albin larsen i wont be weeping he smiled both of us making value judgments its a human quality youre saying i should not look into his travel records im saying kelly quicks a nice kid and what sin did she commit other than to be loyal to her parents yeah he said maybe shell even go back to school and become a lawyer whatever the hell that means in the greater scope of things and thats the last time we spoke about the quick family chapter friday am allison and i were flying to vegas in eight hours how about nothing wholesome alex how about noise and lights and losing some hardearned money at the tables i figured to finish some longneglected paperwork and leave with a clear head at milo called and said i need a favor but if youre jammed just say so what your tone of voice im bugging you what do you need it took a while to free up christi marshs body for burial cody marsh went back to minnesota found a plot now hes back and is headed over to the morgue hes got more questions about why she died wants to meet there id do it but between all the work on gavinchristimary louflora and a new one two drug dealers shot in mar vista im superjammed when did you pick that one up three hours ago he said a nonweird one dont worry nothing to bug you about bottom line i really dont have time to deal with ol cody and give him the sensitivity he deserves what should he be told i said not the whole truth thats for sure emphasize christis good points ill leave it up to your wise discretion when will he be at the morgue in two hours sure i said thanks he said as always i drove to boyle heights and found a space in the lot that fronted the coroners office as i got out of the seville an old gray chevy bumped and smoked into the lot and pulled ponderously into a nearby slot sonny koppel got out shielded his eyes from the glare stared at the sign above the door and winced he wore a shortsleeved yellow shirt over rumpled gray cotton pants and white tennis shoes his hair was slicked down and his face bore an unhealthy flush he headed for the door stopped saw me and caught his breath hi he said what brings you here meeting someone something to do with mary no i said lots of people dying he said im here to claim marys body ive been trying for weeks have no legal authority because we werent married anymore finally i cut through the red tape it can be rough main thing is i got permission he sighed mary never said what shed want in this situation i figure shed be happy with cremation he looked at me wanting counsel i said youd know would i he said i dont think so i dont think i know much you did your best for her thats nice of you to say i think its true he made puffing noises with his lips i hope youre right we reached the morgues glass doors i held one open for him thanks he said have a nice day
