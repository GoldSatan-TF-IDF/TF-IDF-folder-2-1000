the secrets of pain phil rickman february they came for me in darkness they were blackeyed grey and thin lol robinson mephistos blues white hell the house was right next to the road wherever the road was and out in front there was a woman not exactly dressed for the weather thin cardigan all lumpy with snow stumbling about in bronwens lights and the blinding white hell waving her arms and they were going to run her down cut her in half gomer danny roared no the snow was coming down like rubble now had been this past four hours and if danny couldnt see through it there was no chance that gomer could when bronwen lurched and the snow sprayed up danny was thinking oh christ itll be all blotched red then theyd stopped apart from bronwens grumpy chuntering there was silence the front door of the house was wide open yellow light splattered over the snow like warm custard on ice cream some of it reaching gomer sitting at the wheel in his old donkey jacket with his cap and his sawnoff mittens and his muffler and the snowlight in his glasses what we done danny heard his own voice all hollow what we done gomer oh god leaning on his side door breaking through the crispy layer of snow new tractor out for the first time with the snowplough this superhero routine of gomers coming out in the dark to clear for free the roads that hereford council wouldnt go near well you learned to live with that but how long before he was a danger to other folks and hisself you ask danny it was starting to look like the time had come a slapping on the door panel gomers side whos that in there danny went woooh sagging in blind relief it was her gomer meanwhile totally relaxed was letting his window down the ciggy glowing in his face we help at all dies of frostbite what do he care long as he s bloody warm the woman entirely alive glaring up at the cab hair all white and wild not you him in there look glancing behind her just as the front door of the farmhouse got punched shut from inside and the warm light vanished ent that typical he wont do nothin cept toss another bloody block on the fire serve the buggers right let em get theirselves out then back to his beer she was standing back snow over the tops of her wellies squinting then she went gomer ah gomer said sarah is it gomer parry plant hire thought you was long retired boy danny was too cold to smile gomer had an angry puff on his rollup long as the ole boy had his ciggies the cold never seemed to bother him least not as much as the idea of folks thinking he was too advanced in years to be driving heavy plant through a blizzard his voice was distinctly gruffer as he drew out the last halfinch of ciggy problem is it girl some fool in a car it is this sarah said come whizzin clean off the road on the bend back there slides across crashes through the gate and straight down the bloody hill you sure sure i was at the bedroom window gomer couldnt hardly miss him straight through headlights all over the snow then theyve gone look well there ent no way out of there ends in forestry so lets get this right girl gomer said theres a car or someing gone down over this yere hill and hes vanished likely buried already and we ent got no gear to haul him out can you get through in that thing gomer it was like the whole cab was bulging with gomers outrage this thing danny sighed gomer mabbe we should call the ent nowhere gomer tossing the last millimetre of ciggy into the snow on gods earth this girl cant get through danny defeated looked up at the falling sky snow and ice had come hard and bitter after christmas right after the floods over a month of running out of oil on account of the tankers couldnt get through and starving rats raiding your vehicle from underneath dining on your electrics a brief respite early in february and then just when you thought youd seen the end of winter the bastard was back with both fists bunched and gomer parry had got hisself a big new jcb tractor called bronwen and something to prove danny climbed down and found the car hadnt gone crunching through the gate after all some fool left him open he climbed back in slammed the door no warmer in here bronwen had a cracking heater only gomer wouldnt use it in case he nodded off at the wheel and some bastard magistrate had his hgv licence off him shouldnt be no gate there at all gomer said no fence neither common land it is bridleway only dickie see he reckons if he dkeep fencin it off one day folks is gonner forget it dont belong to him he lowered the plough tracks in the headlights but danny saw they were filling up fast gomer set about clearing the field entrance in case they came back with something on tow danny said dickie who on the pop half the time dickie protheroe hers gotter hold it all together ennit ah so thats dickie protheroes new wife is it never seed her before course you ent on account of dickies in the pub and hers back yere holdin it all together aye danny said fair play to her pulling snow out of his beard thinking whoever was down there could be badly hurt or worse couldve hit a tree or a power pole land rover them tracks gomer said long wheelbase only one set o tracks so he ent out he sniffed right then we go for it ten minutes from midnight when they went in and the windscreen was nearopaque like being inside a washing machine when somebodyd overdone it with the powder hoping to god this wouldnt end in no pink snow danny dug his hands into his pockets warming himself inside with thoughts of the pyramid stage at glastonbury on a hot night at the end of june coloured lights in rippling sequence the strobes going the ole strat hard against his thigh as he went sailing off into the solo from mephistos blues well it could be if only lol would realize how much he had to offer if the boy could just overcome that persistent low selfesteem what the hell life was good had been good you all right gomer course im all right bronwen went grinding on between leafless trees turned into great white mushrooms humpy glistening ground and a teeming sky the countryside like a strange newmade bed all the familiar creases filled in a slow downward slope now the snowlevel rising either side of them not going to be that easy getting back up oh hell patches of grey stone in the lights all right boy i seen him what the hell is it gomer looks like an ole sheepshelter gomer brought bronwen grunting to a stop and danny made out the roof of a vehicle behind the broken wall a wedge of thick snow on top how the hell did he get behind the bloody wall danny lowered his window you all right there no reply he glanced behind the incline theyd just come down would look dangerously steep on the way back he turned back to find shadows moving silently on either side just beyond the lights danny stiffened how many of the buggers were in this yere land rover and why wasnt they calling out like thank god you come kind o thing ent bein funny gomer but i dont altogether like the looks of this to be honest the shadows were spreading out circling and crouching like a pack of wolves five of them at least murky grey now in the swirling night a sudden massive bang on dannys side of the tractor one of them was there all black no face bang bang bang bang on the panel the man was in camouflage kit gloves balaclava no glint of eyes behind the slit danny got his window up to just a bit of a crack looked at gomer across the grey light in the cab in the past year two jcbs had been nicked from this area all right not hijacked just stolen out of their sheds but there was big money in a brand new tractor and a first time for everything dont wanner make a thing bout this gomer but how about we dont get out till we finds out a bit no gomer balls gomer was leaning across danny mouth up to the crack at the top of the window gomer parry plant hire you all right there oh jesus like these were the magic words the key to not getting dragged out into the snow and having the shit beaten out of you while the lovely new tractor youd called bronwen and had blessed by the vicar got shipped out to lagos danny was going look pal we when the voice came out of the snow yow know who we are aye that kind of voice full of clouds and night and a bit of birmingham and now danny could see two solid shadows either side of the camouflage man gomer coughed a bit hoarse this a hexercise pal silence then a short little laugh give the ole man a coconut what i figured gomer said only sarah back there see so yow just turn this bus around yeah and bugger off all the breath went out of danny in a steam of relief i should just do it gomer these guys they dont make a habit of flashin their id put your lights out now the camouflage man said then fuck off and forget you seen anything danny shifted uncomfortably in his seat you wanted cooperation you didnt talk quite like this to gomer parry five foot four and well past seventy but you just didnt everybody knew that and you might find it easier if you put that filthy cigarette out now listen boy just do what he says eh gomer danny hissed you can complain to the government later gomer said nothing just let the windows glide up putting the tractor into reverse and reaching out for the lights only the mad ole bugger didnt switch them off he threw them on full beam making a starburst in the snow and jesus danny was jerking back as bronwen swung round hard on a slide in the lights hed seen what hed seen what he thought hed seen before the tractor lurched and bucked and went snarling back along the track theyd made earlier danny and gomer didnt speak at all till theyd managed to make it up the hill and out the gate and onto the road again then danny sat up and looked hard into gomers thick misty specs we really see that hexercise gomer said gruffly thats all it is kind o jobs they get they gotter be hard ennit well yeah but gomer hexercise gomer said thats what we tells sarah protheroe herll know you reckon and we dont say nothin else all right danny was shivering hed go along with that anything but what theyd seen in the white hell in other circumstances it could have been almost funny but in a latefebruary blizzard in the minutes after midnight it was enough to scare the shit out of you especially the way the fifth man had been just standing there laughing bollock naked in the snow part one march empty your septic tank take it to the bank lol robinson wasted on plant hire longships the bad stuff started with jane insisting on getting the drinks a lotto thing she and merrily had both had tenquid paybacks on the same number jane wanted to buy lol and danny thomas a beer which was nice of her she seemed determined these days lol thought to do more things that were nice as if she had something to repay he watched her at the bar the tight jeans the sawnoff white hoodie and the area of soft skin exposed between the two merrily had said if you could just you know keep an eye on jane shed been thinking about the weather they all had since the christmas flood a continuing source of unease in ledwardine midevening on a friday the black swan was less than a third full but sounding crowded to lol because of all the voices raised against the punch of the wind and the fizz of rain on the leaded windows big weather more big weather hed seen it coming well before dark the sky over cole hill chaotic with rippedup cloud and flarings of wild violet beyond the church steeple the last taunt of winter or maybe the first sneer of spring the floods then the snow then more snow and now just as you thought it was over the gales and yet it was an illwind because out of the black night and the white noise of the rain and his anxiety suddenly the lines happened like theyd been blown into his head the chorus had been hanging around for weeks begging for an opening trail of memorably bleak images to illustrate the raw emptiness before love walked in the rhyme was a bit bumpy but maybe that was ok maybe even good the wind is screaming through the granary it turns the springtime into january this was the granary where hed lived for a time at prof levins studio over at knights frome the perpetual january of a lonely bed lol pulled over a beer mat found a pen in his jacket saw dannys eyes lighting up over the shoebrush beard cookin boy lol reversed the beer mat steered it across to danny then drew back as the gale pushed like a big hand whump on the leaded pane directly across the room no letup the lines had probably arisen from his failure to prevent merrily driving out into the storm or at least letting him drive her what if there was no merrily what if thered been no merrily the void at the core of the song i cant define my sense of need danny was gazing at the beermat like it was mozarts scorepad before gomer parry had rescued him hed been a struggling radnorshire farmer with fading dreams also three vintage guitars a couple of ancient amps a decibeldazed wife and a sheepdog called jimi he looked up im hearin it boy sure tbe the grin reappearing in the beard though still a little wary like a poachers flashlight in the undergrowth not long after danny had joined gomer parry plant hire lol had been looking for a lead guitarist someone good but not too expensive after two sessions in dannys barn over at kinnerton hed said you want a proper contract or will a handshake do danny grinning like a little kid his muddied hand already out should be in your barn recording this lol said under the storm noise everything shivering storm noise in a barn ent never as good as you imagines ole wind got his own backbeat see never plays to yours danny nodded towards jane at the bar growin up i suppose getting the drinks herself was important to jane doing it legally was still a novelty barry the manager was behind the bar and everybody in the swan knew jane some of them even liked her the wind came back a fighter in the ring leaving you no time for recovery and danny picked up on lols anxiety youre worried about your lady you had to love the seventies rockband jargon its not blowing over danny hard to blow an ole volvo off the road it had been midafternoon after the first severe weather warning when merrily had come across to lols house looking unsettled and facing an hours drive to the mountains the other side of brecon this was huw owen inevitably for reasons huw hadnt disclosed and merrily couldnt fathom hed wanted her to talk to his students at the grim disused nonconformist chapel up in the beacons where he taught ordained priests how to mess with the unmentionable ill give huw a call anyway lol had his mobile out make sure she makes you feel better boy danny said do it in huw owens rectory thirtyplus miles away the phone rang out maybe theyd already left for the chapel which probably didnt even have a phone huw liked to awaken in his students a sense of isolation and vulnerability lol killed the signal nothing but danny thomas was listening to something else his long grey hair pushed back behind one ear he caught lols eye lifting a cautionary forefinger lol heard a drawly voice from off what i said george i said the old tottymeters flickering into the fucking red then liquid laughter lol turned towards the bar kids youd think but they werent about five of them late twenties to early forties talking in low voices but their london accents lifted them out of the background mush clean off the fucking dial george i mean will you just look at that he on about his fannymeters gone off ask the barman for a kleenex not kidding george im in love youre ratarsed i think i think i feel a wager coming on none of them spoke for a few seconds apple logs shifted on the hearth danny looked at lol red mud was still flaked in his heavymetal hair hed been here in the village all day working with gomer on extra flood defences down by the river a wager lol could imagine florid men squires and their sons in threecornered hats with lavish waistcoats and long bendy pipes under these same beams on jacobean nights when the black swan was young how much hundred two youre not scaring me george ill go three bloody confident tonight cornel hes bladdered he wont all right listen ill persuade her into the paddock for nothing and then why dont we say threefifty if i get her upstairs however yeah but that doesnt prove however any tricks any remarks from you bastards that might put her off and you pay up anyway deal thats deal dont fall for it george mild scots accent hell probably offer to split it with her if she plays along he wont alec because well be listening to every word at some stage probably when money came into it the banter had shed its forced humour at the other end of the bar jane was handing barry a tenpound note leaning forward exposing a widening band of pink skin just below the small of her back as the daylight faded their cars would arrive on the square like viking longships floating into a natural harbour the topoftherange beemer the porsche boxter the mercedes by barry the manager like half the village was in two minds about them they had nobody could argue about this seen the swan through a bleak winter of recession and yet like they own the place that old cliche you heard it a lot around ledwardine but it was only half right lol thought you didnt need to own a playground only one man in ledwardine actually seemed interested in owning the village lol had never actually met ward savitch but you couldnt fail to be aware of his presence usually on sunday mornings used to be church bells now it was shotgun echoes the new huntergatherers paying guests of savitch whod bought the old kibble place known as the court a farmhouse with fifty acres savitch was everywhere now grabbing marginal land woods and rough country like he was reclaiming his heritage in fact he was building himself one came out of london just ahead of the big recession with all his millions in a handcart now the fifty acres had more than doubled holiday chalets had gone up shooting and paintballing weekends for those who could afford them some were corporate jollies designed to freshen up tired executives savitch clearly exploiting his old contacts not many posh cars outside tonight though a couple of these guys were staying here at the swan overspill and the others had come down from the court on foot intent on serious drinking some of them still in their designer camouflage trousers bought from one of the few retail chains in the county that were no longer on nodding terms with the official receiver days shooting supervised by kenny mostyn and the kids from hardkit and they think theyre fighting fit barry had said one night when it was quiet well fit enough to take on a fivecourse champagne dinner and a few gallons of stella barry knew about fighting and fitness retired from the sas at forty still went running in the black mountains most weekends he was on the portly side these days but only portly like a bouncer but what can i say it keeps the lights on most of these guys its just about getting pissed and bringing me pheasants theyve shot who loses apart from the pheasants lol had said glad that jane hadnt been there but not as much as he wished she wasnt here now keeping an eye on jane this was getting increasingly delicate shed been lols friend before he even knew her mother back when she was just an insecure kid in a new place and he was a parttime recluse in a cottage down blackberry lane but jane was eighteen now approaching her last term at school finding herself some space wasnt as though lol was her dad or even a dad figure not exactly a dadfigure kind of person jane had said she was just popping to the loo would get the drinks on her way back but lol had noticed she hadnt actually gone to the loo directly to the bar purposeful he pushed his chair back so he could see her talking to the lanky young guy with the deep chin and the big lips because of all the voices raised against the rattle and hiss of the weather you couldnt hear what was being said as the guy bent down to her like he was offering her a lollipop stay calm boy danny said this is the swan on a friday night she can just walk away but she hadnt she seemed to be listening solemnly then smiling right up into the bigjawed face wearing that closefitting white top halfunzipped over very tight jeans the small band of pale flesh and the navel hand it to cornel one of the older bankersorwhatever murmured to another eyes in her knickers already lol looked helplessly at danny you could see the three lagers jane had bought sitting on the bar top behind her left elbow giving her a good excuse to prove she was not here on her own jane could walk away from this any time she wanted but no she went on talking to this cornel very much a woman and smiling up at him oh god lol said what do i do about this wet cassock the grey monk was still there in the ladies lavatory his face fogged and his arms spread wide a deja vu moment and it made merrily feel unsteady the wind was whining in the rafters buzzing in the illfitting glass of the leaded window whipping into the thorn trees around the chapel all the different rhythms of the wind had this ever been a friendly place its stone looked like prison stone it stood mournful as an old war memorial in a shallow hollow on the yellowed slopes where the sas used to train nearer to god all it felt nearer to was death she glared at the grey monk by the side of the door where he lived in the plaster where youd see him in the mirror as you tidied your hair according to huw hed been a nonconformist preacher whod roamed the hills sick with lust for someones wife down in sennybridge hed been found dead where the womens toilet now stood head cracked open on the flags the point being that he was said to have left his imprint there later known because of its general shape as the grey monk huw explaining how most socalled ghostly monks were not monks at all just a vagueness in the electromagnetic soup suggestive of robe and cowl merrily saw herself in the mirror standing next to the monk she was thirtynine years old were the crows feet becoming webbed or did she just need more early nights she nodded to the monk and walked out to where huw was waiting for her at the top of the passage standing on his own under a small naked bulb spidery filaments glowing feebly through the dead flies and the dust the course students had all gone into the chapel merrily shut the doors on them the only chance shed get ok i was absolutely determined not to ask but itll be obvious lass huw said also good for you a chance to step back and see how far youve come rationalize it it cant be rationalized it isnt rational you taught me that huw put on his regretful halfsmile his dog collar was the colour of old bone huws collars always looked like theyd been bought at a carboot sale maybe a hearseboot sale merrily remembered the first time shed heard his voice expecting huw owen some distant welsh academic with a bardic lilt but getting david hockney jarvis cocker hed been born in humble circumstances just down the valley here then taken away as a baby to grow up in yorkshire all right he said its partly on account of you being the first woman ever to get sent here for deliverance training which hed hardly been happy about at the time walking her over the unwelcoming hills telling her what a turnon women priests were for the pervs and the creeps as for a woman exorcist two on this course huw said you could tell by his tone that he hadnt been impressed the hanging bulb glowed the colour of wet straw the wind was leaning on the new front door at the top of the passage and merrily had an urge to walk through it out onto the hill try and keep a cigarette alight up there or just keep on walking into the rattling night back to the car foot down out of here with the wind behind her so what do you want me to tell them just answer their questions best you can feel free to downplay everything we dont want to put the shits up them then suddenly impulsively huw sprang up on tiptoe and headed the bulb setting it swinging like a censer in its fibrous light his smile looked slightly insane although we do he said obviously the women on the course were a brisk posh girl and a squat quiet matron in her fifties who huw said had been governor of a womens prison if it wasnt for the hungry female clergy a third of the churches in england and wales would probably be nightclubs and carpet warehouses they had the confidence of being needed these women so why are you all here huw said eh over twenty clergy in the body of the chapel mostly young middleaged the higher number on the course reflecting not so much an increased interest in exorcism merrily was thinking so much as the trend for deliverance panels within each diocese health and safety backup decisions made by committee there was a kind of formality about them no jeans no sweatshirts more dog collars than crufts but somehow it felt artificial like fancy dress the only obvious maverick here was huw himself so blatantly old hippie you expected flecks of spliff down his jacket im serious why were you picked for this the one job the church still gets all coy about and dawkins on the prowl knife out somebody risked a laugh huw gazed out now they were out of fashion again he wore a ponytail grey and white bound up with a red rubber band he was sitting next to merrily behind a carafe of water at a mahogany table below where the lectern used to be you levelling a forefinger whyve you come stand up a minute lad the guy into the second row was about forty had narrow glasses and a voice that was just as soft and reasonable as youd expect peter barber luton urban parish obviously high percentage of foreign nationals the demand was there i was invited by my bishop to consider the extent to which we should address it and how much of it do you accept as valid peter when a somali woman says she thinks the devil might be arsing about with her daughter whats your instinct huw we discussed this i have a respect for everyones belief system course you do lad huw glanced at merrily his lips moving slightly they might have formed the words fucking hell the wind went on bulging the glass and swelling the joints of the chapel how many of you are here because youve had what could be called a psychic or paranormal experience silence nobody someone coughed smothered it merrily felt huw wanting to smash all the lights then the woman whod been a prison governor stood up she wore a black suit over her clerical shirt her lapel badge said shona her accent was lowland scottish ive been close to situations which were difficult to accommodate we had a disturbed girl with a pentagram tattooed on the side of her neck who we found was organizing ouijaboard sessions something not exactly unknown in womens prisons and not invariably stamped upon because at least it keeps them quiet huw said not in this case we had disturbances bordering on hysteria which spread with alarming speed girls claiming there were entities in their cells the equilibrium of the whole establishment seemed to have been tipped the prison psychologist was confident of being able to deal with it but eventually our chaplain asked me if he could bring in a colleague from the deliverance ministry when was this five or six years ago id been reluctant at first expecting him to i dont know subject the girls to some crude castingout thing but he just talked to them and it gradually became quieter no magic solution and it took a number of visits by this man but it was resolved never an exact science lass i was impressed wanting to know how it had been achieved when i took early retirement a couple of years later and sought ordination that incident kept coming back to me so here i am a volunteer huw nodded and didnt look at merrily if the first guy had seemed unlikely to go the distance it would be hard to fault this woman on either background or motivation merrily watched huw bend and lift the carafe with both hands and tip a little water into his glass so in other words he said youre a set of dull buggers outside somewhere a branch snapped huw took an unhurried drink men and women of common sense and discretion selected for their stability safe pairs of hands individuals who wont embarrass the essentially secular element inside the modern church no mystics no evangelicals no charismatics merrily stared at huw that was a bad thing he shrugged lightly well aye we dont want crackpots we dont want exorcisms prescribed like antibiotics to cure shoplifting and alcohol abuse ideally we dont want them in the fullest sense at all but lets not dress this up merrily watched his fingers flexing on the mahogany tabletop then taking his weight as he leaned forward this is no job for a digital priest at some stage if you decide to go ahead with this particular ministry youll be pulled into areas you never wanted to go youll be affected shortterm and longterm mentally and emotionally and spiritually every one of yous guaranteed to encounter summat thatll ruin your sleep i dont want any bugger leaving here thinking thats not going to happen she was aware of him glancing into the bottom lefthand corner of the chapel where the shadows were deepest and you couldnt make out the faces which is why i asked this friend of mine to come over through the rain and the gales turning to look at merrily who couldnt kill the blush and frowned this is mrs watkins deliverance consultant for the diocese of hereford successor to one of the most experienced exorcists in the country quite a responsibility so we have to ask how did a young lass get a job like that safe pair of hands i dont think so though she is now no she were handpicked by the bishop of hereford at the time because huw glaring up at him not moving her lips for gods sake because he fancied her huw said it were a glamour thing merrily had come in jeans and a cowlneck black sweater with her smallest pectoral cross nowt formal huw had said on the phone she sighed runnerup in the church times wetcassock competition never going to live that down runnerup huw sniffed that were a travesty only half of them laughed you could almost see the disdain like a faint cloud in the air around the posh girl who was probably planning a paper on how the virgin birth and the resurrection were part of the same complex metaphor with merrily you cant see the damage but its there huw wasnt smiling now she noticed that his face was thinner the lines like cracks in tree bark tell them about mr joy merrily tell the boys and girls what mr joy did to you and then he turned away so he wouldnt see her eyes saying no talk about paris cornel was that his first name or what cornel you had to try and laugh he didnt even need to open that wide loose red mouth to be screaming look at me im from off that tooperfect combination of plaid workshirt and timberlandtype boots and the rolex or whatever it was some flash oldfashioned status watch anyway and hed be thinking all the country girlies would be like take me cornel take me away in the boxter and show me the penthouse well not quite all of them ive never been up there myself jane said the court its like real mysterious to us the localish accent rolling out nicely not too pronounced if this wasnt so serious it could almost be fun mysterious cornel said did he actually say myshterioush was he really that pissed probably jane looked up at him hands on her hips so go on what like what happens what do you think happens cornel said i dont like to think cornel grinned down at her there was that sour toomuchwine smell on his breath more unpleasant somehow than beer or whisky kind of decadent and louche youre really tall jane said stupidly you know that i was breastfed for months and months he looked up from her chest so my mother tells me you got a gun cornel of your own two actually ones a purdey you need another drink so like what do you shoot things things what like bottles off walls and stuff jane could see cornel trying to not to snigger well what the wind came in again lights flickered darling cornel said we get to shoot pretty much anything that comes within range pheasants rabbits those little deer pussycats below barlevel jane felt the fingers of her right hand bunching into a tight little fist thered been talk in the village of cats going missing wow she said what happens at the court is anything you want basically cause youre paying for it or rather the bank is oh jane did the vacant look which bank you with is it putting a finger up to her lower lip is it the natwest or like that one with all the little puppet people and the tinkly music uhhuh cornel smiled shaking his head landesmans new kids on the block very progressive you do credit cards and stuff cornel sighed and what do you do girlie hairdresser jane said well trainee but one day ill be doing it big time in hereford or london mabbe hmm cornel was swaying a bit and wrinkling his nose like he was figuring something out dont know anybody in hereford but i did once handle some finance for a chain of salons in london and paris paris any good to you paris jane blinking like she didnt dare believe he was serious and milan now i think cornel said you look like you need a drink a big one had too much already jane said maybe youd rather have one somewhere else dunno really where we can talk about paris janes left hand was on the damp mat on the bar top and cornels much bigger hand was over it and squeezing gently she pulled not hard but the hand was trapped she looked up at cornel and giggled his eyes were well glazed it was unlikely that shed get any more out of him probably time to end this the odd times when it was needed in an establishment as relatively sedate as the black swan barry was known for acting with speed and economy and a glimmer of steel but barry was on the phone lol tensed the inglenook coughed out smoke and soot you seen him before danny said do we know if hes got a room yere lol shook his head telling himself it would be ok that this was jane jane whod once expressed the hope that some myopic japanese stockbroker would accidentally blow off ward savitchs head hells bells the main door had sprung open the wind pushing in james bulldavies last squire of ledwardine partner of alison kinnersley lols ex from what now seemed like another distant lifetime bloody night james thrust the door shut against the gale shaking drips from his sparse hair as lol heard janes unmistakably dangerous laughter like pills in a jar cornel was grinning and janes expression was kind of oh you almost affectionate like theyd known one another a long time or she was as pissed as he was lol looked at danny danny sighed all right then boy well both go he was halfway out of his chair when the weather took over a wall of wind hit the swan the candlebulbs shivering against the oak panelling lol saw janes free hand reaching out to grasp the end of cornels leather belt bastards bloody pulled one of his mates said george shes pulling him doesnt that give us a getout both of these guys smiling now as cornel let jane tow him along the bar towards the door to the stairs looking into her eyes with what lol interpreted as a kind of grateful disbelief as he and danny moved in then the whole bar was doused in sepia power dropout somewhere in the room a woman did a theatrical scream and lol froze all he could make out was a shadowjane trying to stand a beer glass on the bar then a roar shit as the lights came flickering back he saw cornel jerking up and away movements fractured like an early movie janes smile was wide and wild but her voice was shaky from the pussycats her face pale and strained and she was breathing hard but clearly determined not to run as cornel came at her his head like a red pepper big lips twisted you little fucking no lol flinging himself between them hands out saw it coming twisted sideways but still caught the fist on the top of the shoulder which really hurt then saw cornels colleagues closing around him with a sickly wafting of winebreath now hold up james bulldavies wading in stooping a bit these days though it might have been the weight of whatever he kept in the fraying pockets of his tweed jacket might one suggest you chaps cool off outside fucks this ladies present james said briskly that bitch cornels face thrust into jamess you saw what she did close to screeching losing it saw that did you did you lol saw an extensive dark stain on the front of cornels jeans shouldnt render you impotent for long james said mildly big man little girl be disinclined to make a fuss myself somebody laughed the inglenook was oozing smoke like some ancient railway tunnel all right enough now lads barry was here in his quiet suit his slim bow tie accidents happen in the dark if youd like to leave your trousers at reception sir we can get them cleaned for you cornel was looking at jane his eyes sunk below the bony ridge of his sweating brow ill be seeing you he said girlie lol felt jane shaking and put an arm around her and steered her back to the table by the fire she smiled slackly cocked that up lifting up her hands all wet more on me than him what did you say to him jane i was just you know so pissed off at the idea of them coming in all droit de seigneur kind of thing and he was obviously legless so i thought ill get him talking see what i can get out of him thats why you wanted to go and buy the drinks oh lol it was an impulse thing her face shone like its important to know dont you think what savitch is letting them get away with like if were going to get the bastard closed down before he turns the village into the bloodsport capital of the new cotswolds jane hes investment a lot of people love him nobody loves him and we dont want that kind of investment weve got archaeological remains weve got the strong possibility of a bronze age henge with actual stones we could have loads of tourism worthwhile tourism not these scum all right they love his money lol said sadly they just think they might need his money so they dont like to tell the bastard where to stick it jane glowered for a moment then looked up wary youre not going to tell mum about this are you lol sighed so what did he tell you jane

the way some women are the huntball floozies he said theyd shoot anything that got in the way deer pussycats he said probably exaggerating to try and sound hard i could tell he was waiting for me to go oh id love to come and watch you wielding your weapon lol theyreoh shit look at him now lol halfturned pain spinning into his shoulder where hed caught cornels fist cornel was standing next to the door to the stairs his eyes seemed to be physically retracting under the shelf of his brow as he looked around the room in the halflight plucking at the damp patch on his trousers wherever you are you little bitch he said mildly i just want you to know this isnt over lol looked around maybe only he and jane had heard cornel because thered been a sudden scraping of chairs exclamations and then a hollow nearsilence in the bar as a small circle formed around barry in the centre of the room where was this james bulldavies snapped say again oldcastle barry said have i got that right beyond credenhill but before you get to the wye dont know any details mate of mine with an apple farm was just passing it on in case we saw any police action cops are all over there apparently yes but who oh mansel barry stepped back gawd james that mean hes a relation cousin of sorts james straightened up bit his lower lip hells bells a flaking log rolled out of the fire up against the mesh of the fireguard danny thomas came back and sat down pushing fingers through his beard barry just had a call from a mate feller been found dead farmer lol said what stormrelated sounds like way too many coppers for that danny said gangland up against the brick wall under a bleary bulkhead lamp bliss was struggling into his durex suit big wide puddles in the yard four of them rippling like something tidal in the lights and the remains of the gale the fifth puddle much smaller not rippling at all the colour and consistency of bramble jelly farmers never felt comfortable around farmers not even dead farmers boss terry stagg came lumbering out of a litter of uniforms and techies shielding the body from the wind bliss looking up from the flapping plastic dci know about this terry realizing this was the very last question hed normally ask this was getting ridiculous he peered at terry staggs eyes in the lamplight terry was working on a beard to cover up his second chin his eyes looked tired and faintly puzzled shit boss it was actually the dci who said to get you out be more convenient for di bliss were her actual bitch stagg said nothing bliss turned away nerves burning like a skin rash probably digging himself an even bigger pit my impression was that the dci wont be coming out tonight at all stagg said which is unusual given the social status of the deceased dont question it bliss zipped the durex suit from groin to throat give thanks he plucked the elasticated sleeve away from his watch just gone nine taken him the best part of half an hour to get here from home blownoff branches all over the roads one lacerating the flank of his car as he squirmed past on the grass verge so this is mr mansel bull boss fiftyseven farmer as you know old family doublepage spread in the hereford times kind of old maybe special supplement terry stagg said not short of a few quid tez lorra leckie going to waste or is that you the yard was ablaze with lights on sensors like a factory and alive with bellowing creaks the smashing of blownopen doors the restive moaning of the cattle in the sheds bliss thinking all this was like the sounds of his own nerves amplified billy grace on his way terry said allegedly but we do have timeofdeath to within half an hour or so mr bulld gone to a parishcouncil meeting arranged for seven but called off due to the conditions sounds like he came directly back walking into something a council meeting explained the suit and tie what you could see of it under a glistening beard of blood hard to say if his head was still even attached was that bone was that an actual split skull bliss stepped back you never quite got used to this who found him brother heard the cattle moaning in the shed so he had a walk up with his shotgun oh aye not loaded he claims lives in the big bungalow down towards the river mr bull lived here on his own on his own in that security lights on the barn opposite flushed out mellow old brick and about fifteen dark windows on three storeys oldcastle farm the house and buildings wedged into a jagged promontory above the wye embedded like a fort georgian or queen anne or whatever had to be big enough for a family of twelve plus servants divorced for the second time apparently terry looking sideways at bliss mr bull was faceup to the lights eyes wide open in his big bald dented head like he couldnt believe the way death had come racing at him out of the wind and the night wheres the brother in the house waiting for you he see anything terry stagg shook his head all right bliss hunched his shoulders against the wind so where we up to tezza covering the lanes pubs for what thats worth now theyll be well away they mr sollers bull thinks a gang hell explain wheres karen housetohouse well farmtofarm in the fourbyfour with a couple of uniforms just in case good good karen was connected farming family where bliss came from a farmer was a bloke with a shared allotment and a chicken obviously youve searched the buildings with mr sollers bull and the house did i terry stagg coughed did i say mr sollers bull was not very happy no you amaze me terence terry said in the sense that he reckons he and his brother both reported intruders when two occasions in the past month he says we laughed we laughed the police the police laughed fuck me excellent i mean thats what he says might this explain the dcis generosity in letting the underling take charge dyou think thinking nice one welltimed francis as a vehicle came coughing and grumbling up the tarmac drive dr graces land rover defender also terry stagg said when i told him youd be in to talk to him later on mr sollers bull said he seems to know who you are the vehicles engine had been switched off but was clinging to life in the instant of its last shudder the wind died and it was like they were standing in the vacuum of quiet at the eye of the storm fame at last im made up blisss own voice came bouncing back at him from across the yard he lowered it what are you saying he knows your fatherinlaw oh billy grace was hauling his kit up the drive bliss went to meet him shit the downside of having a complicated private life in a small county every other saturday work permitting hed collect his kids from the inlaws farm trying to time it so hed be bringing them back just before kirsty got in from shopping or wherever in the hope that he could leave them with his motherinlaw a woman he could handle more or less unfortunately hed pulled this one too many times last saturday the door had been ajar at the farm holiday cottage where kirsty was living and the kids had gone running inside hed considered just buggering off but in the end hed gone in to find the stove lit all very cosy smell of quality coffee sour reminders of his own kitchen with all its comforts now plundered and here was the plunderer in person mrs bliss only this was the mrs bliss of ten years ago the future mrs bliss reborn all made up short black skirt well up the thigh see what you threw away you had another hour at least kirsty said when the kids were out of the room but then you always did get bored with them quite rapidly what with an eightyearolds lack of interest in the vagaries of the crown prosecution service vagaries shed been rehearsing evidently kairs or do you have a date tonight date not a word theyd ever used between themselves that little tweak of petty triumph on kirstys lovely pulpy lips she knew something she bloody knew something gorra be off kairsty bliss said be the easter holidays next time i come so we can make it a different day if you want i could maybe take them over to aberystwyth or somewhere you never did put yourself out much did you frank finding his arms folded classic defence stance bliss let them drop its not that frigging convenient couple of hours each way and with easter traffic i think kirsty said that you know what im talking about ive gorra go the thing is she stood up slowly isnt it against the rules i mean when it all comes out wont one of you have to move to another division isnt that how it works bliss had felt the blood draining out of his face so fast that his cheeks actually felt cold now look i dont where you think youre going with this but oh you do frank blisss mind was going like a washing machine oh shit shit shit shit where had she got this from which one of his beloved colleagues had sniffed it out how was this even possible youre mental kairsty you know that safest to go on the offensive an advantage of being separated was the way you could bring a row directly to the boil knowing you could slip away with nothing lost before the first plate hit the wall i dont think so her eyes cold as quartz i mean i could almost feel insulted if that cows as far as your ambition goes but being i know what a sad little sod youve become it doesnt surprise me a great deal frank to be honest im going blisss palms starting to sweat calling the shots now is she on your private life think whatever you want as i understand it with a male officer and a woman its always the man has to move isnt it or have i got that wrong what exactly do you want off me and shed smiled generously just want you to own up to it frank thats all oh the satisfaction in her eyes dads solicitor says that makes it a lot easier play your cards right it might not come out in public oh sure just makes it easier thats all kirsty said and costlier for me anyway kirsty had shrugged bliss feeling like his insides had been flushed out with cold water kirsty blamed the police for everything that had gone wrong between them she was wrong about that and she probably knew she was wrong but this was convenient and shed use it close friend billy dr grace who was very wellconnected glanced over his shoulder at bliss not particularly a friend at all francis but everybodys at least acquainted in this county except possibly for uncouth incoming scousers like yourself you mean a masonic thing bliss said dr grace declined to reply turning back to his work lifting a distended flap of skin like he was opening a jiffy bag full of blood and bliss turned away big family mind billy branches everywhere the bulls bullmorrises bulldavieses small county and a big house for one man two marriages francis both childless not what a farmer wants well now id say that was pointing at him as culprit but not the kind of man to have his sperm tested almost certainly wouldve been a third wife never a man to look back mansel he didnt see this coming bliss said ah now billy grace turned beaming a loose shambling man with big white teeth a wild neon smile actually he did he mustve been facing directly into it what you offering not a penknife francis machete more like thats urban billy bliss took a step back thats frigging gangland mr sollers bull thinks a gang go on then doc give me the guesswork billy grace lurched to his feet thimbles of blood on the fingers of his surgical gloves the neck one blow looks like a single slash im guessing that came first while he was still on his feet the blows to the top of the head wouldve put him straight down billy took a couple of long strides into the middle of the farmyard all the uniforms and techies moving away as his right arm went back for roleplay if you imagine hes standing here when the blade makes contact slamming into the windpipe not exactly what youd call a butchers strike but the sheer impact of it would leave the poor bastard reeling spouting blood and tissue everywhere a great dollop as you see billy gestured at the separate puddle bliss felt queasy poor old mansel tottering away couple of metres and then he began to back off unsteadily bang on the skull and mansel comes down like a block of flats bliss said and the killer just watches watches well obviously i dont know that but ill be able to give you a full list of injuries and possibly confirm the sequence tomorrow but if you want to take a closer look for now ill take your word so the killer knew hed killed there was serious intent hardly trying to fend the poor chap off and then slinks away with his big knife bliss turned to terry stagg the wind in his face like barbed wire first light we go over the whole frigging farm inch by inch i also think were gonna have to drag howe away from her dinner party or wherever gorra mad bastard here or someone pumped up with drugs billys teeth shining with carnivorous glee whoever he is francis i wouldnt like to face him in an alley terry stagg said mr sollers bull you need to know where is he i suggested he went home you go down to the fork in the drive turn right whereve i heard that name before terence sollers bull tv stagg said pictures in the papers ive been trying to tell you bliss turned billy grace was grinning oh shit bliss said hes got form that might be how you see it francis billy said but to quite a few people hereabouts hes a bloody hero exhaust even now even in a room full of priests it was hard to relive years later it would still start burning in her memory like acid if it caught her in the night shed have to get out of bed and pray recite st patricks breastplate the way she had the night denzil joy died let me set the scene for you huw owen said to the students when merrily were appointed as deliverance consultant the man she replaced was the last diocesan exorcist his name were canon dobbs and he couldnt be doing wi nambypamby terminology like deliverance he paused looking down to the darkest part of the chapel again an austere owd bugger dobbs former academic not a supporter of the ordination of women merrilys a university dropout who received her calling in the last days of a wonky marriage he got killed in a car crash was there an element of guilt after that i wouldnt like to spec huw always an element of summat int there were all on the threshold of imbalance as this job keeps reminding us she saw his left hand quiver and again he looked out towards the shadows in the lefthand corner where merrily could see a man now leaning back an arm thrown across the back of the empty chair next to his anyroad canon dobbs felt it were his duty to expose the upstart bint to the kind of evil the very existence of which would be denied by the progressive bishop whod appointed her and happen by some of you lass huw extended an arm merrily stood up erm i dont know whether anybody heres ever been a nurse or knows one but ive found its always useful to listen to nurses a rush of wind hit the chapel and there was a distant splintering all heads turning except for huws not least because theyve seen most things relating to death this erm this is about a death it was my first deliverance job and probably shouldve been canon dobbss last before he retired but he was unavailable merrily was already uncomfortable all she had to do was lift the cellar hatch of memory just a crack and out it sprang again and she could almost feel it on the underside of her wrist scritchscratch the smell coming back at once catshit and gangrene one of the nurses had said mr joy was a hospital patient in hereford and he didnt have long i was called out in the night because the nurses said he was asking for a priest and the hospital chaplain wasnt available the truth was that it was the nurses who needed the priest the nurses who didnt like to touch mr joy the nurses who had seen the way he used his wife when she came to visit the nurses who never could forget the sensation of his fingers when they bent over him to take his temperature or change one of the tubes scritchscratch on the soft skin on the underside of the wrist but i was new at this merrily said i told them it wasnt my job to judge him only to try and bring him peace something was still insisting back then that there was no such thing as an evil presence a hand went up shona the woman whod been a prison governor hair like a light brown balaclava you mean your own lifeexperience or your training look merrily said here you are at the bedside of a dying man he s dying youre a priest there to bring comfort how can you do that if you accept that hes infested with evil so you go with the rational view no such thing as an abstract incorporeal evil you need to relax he can enter you without moving that man one of the nurses had said merrilys hand instinctively moving to the pectoral cross dont shudder do not shudder now cut to the car chase lass huw said and dont omit the exhaust she told them the rest well most of it trying to convey that sense of all the light in the room being sucked sourly into a man on the very rim of extinction whose touch was like an enema looking back it leaves me asking a number of questions fierce sexual energy coming from an old dying man can that be explained medically possibly it can im not qualified to say but the nurses didnt think so and nurses no matter how compassionate can be very cynical people it was quieter now the wind in remission the psychological explanation merrily said might be that here was a man whod enjoyed exploiting women sexually degrading them a man in search of increasingly perverse pleasures to what extent you want to demonize this is up to you huw was looking at her head on one side ok im coming to it you can usually find a rational explanation but there has to be a cutoff point you need to recognize when youre trying too hard to explain something away because that can be when youre most vulnerable and if it reaches you theres not much hope for whoever youre trying to protect shona said when you say if it reaches you what do i mean by it not sure but i think if youre unable to accept the premise of an external evil you may not be able to deal with some problems i think looking back i dont think i handled it forcefully enough i let the psychology make too many decisions and afterwards i failed to draw a line under it as a result of which something seemed to be hanging around for some time looking at shona hoping shed ask another question move the thread nobody spoke i felt unclean bad dreams night sensations subjective you might say psychological ive since encountered criminals accepted as being disturbed and this was just an ordinary old man yet mr joy was a notorious case in that hospital canon dobbs had had dealings with him before and could have done so this time but he set me up she didnt want to go into the burning of garments and no way was she going to tell them about the essential advice which had come not from huw but from an old woman whod lived in a care home and whod been surrounded by some very dubious books wouldnt help anybody although it had helped her maybe seeing she was floundering huw stood up the point being he said that it mightve been years before merrily encountered owt as extreme as that if ever make or break and dobbs is expecting break id still say that were irresponsible of him heads turned at a slow creaking sound from outside some distance away but ominous another tree coming down huw said nowt we can do its like a series of doors merrily said you start off opening the psychological door and sometimes thats as far as you need to go and it ends with prayers and a blessing but quite often several doors down the line youll come to one that a psychologist wouldnt go through she drank some water i dont know to this day whether mr joy was afflicted with some violent sexual anomaly which had more or less eaten away his humanity or whether that had opened him up to something else but you dont have to thats why we have the rituals and the liturgy to an extent just do it without it youd be off the rails the posh girl did the card say bethany had her hand up what happened finally were you there when he the wind had started up again but now it was less ferocious as if slightly dismayed at what it had done the big gust which had brought down the tree had also driven clouds away from the moon it flared suddenly in the lowest window and lit the face of the man at the back briefly before he slid into the adjacent chair the man at the back of the chapel had flat grey hair and his eyes still looked like theyd been sewn on no bags no wrinkles a softtoys eyes bloody hell he died that night merrily said i was there yes nurses will often tell you stories about the dying being helped over claiming they can see the faces of people theyve known parents old friends grannies brain chemicals if you like comfort visions lots of rational explanations but it keeps happening someone to beckon you over and was there someone waiting for mr joy at the end he was conspicuously disturbed as if he could see something which didnt seem like his granny did you see anything no and i came away as ive implied with a quite acute sense of failure sat and smoked a cigarette with the ward sister both of us fairly shattered after watching an old man whod scared us all go out in a state of abject terror shona said and when subsequently you felt that something of this man hadnae gone away do you think this sense of failure mightve been a contributory factor haunted by my own inadequacy nobody followed up on this merrily glanced at huw sitting with his eyes halfclosed she had that sense of being set up manoeuvred into place as surely as she had with the late canon dobbs were you afraid the girl bethany said when you thought something was coming for him hard not to be he was afraid for your immortal soul or afraid that you werent going to be able to handle the job mmm and what did you do about that i dont know merrily said its never gone away huw was nodding youre always afraid bethany said whenever youre asked to deal with her face at last showing dismay pretty much merrily said glancing towards the guy at the back half expecting to see a spiral of smoke remembering a summer afternoon in a big church in the malvern hills the vicar there finishing off his cigarette leaving little cylinders of ash at the foot of the lectern remembering what hed said that day not a lot frightens me i can deal with most physical pain emotional pain stress hed probably done his training up here in the beacons and the exercises prior to selection it was said they had to run up to fifty miles with an eightypound pack and when they took their boots off their socks were thick with blood i can achieve separation from the weakness of the body hed said that day in his church it was fairly clear now that he hadnt been expecting to see her here maybe hoping to slide away quietly when the session had ended so they wouldnt have to meet the moon had screwed that he looked up at last and their eyes met and his were small and almost flat to his head like a teddy bears and his smile was tentative wary old evil fallen trees had restructured the landscape two of them were down on the hillside below the chapel the biggest near the bottom of the track just before it joined the main road a crackling skeletal mesh in the blurred moonlight huw owen was standing on a crag with a lambing lamp like one of holman hunts rejected sketches for the light of the world merrily thought below him a bunch of the deliverance students stood staring dumbly at the tangle of branches like this was an act of god huw smiling thinly as if he knew that it was not that it would affect the students theyd all walked up from the pub and the guest houses and b amp bs in the village huw from his rectory only someone whod arrived late enough to have to park her old volvo right outside the sodding chapel bugger what this probably means merrily said is that i wont get home tonight the wind had died back to a murmur like distant traffic huw came down from his crag couple of ladsll be up wi chainsaws i expect when soon as its light ill make you a bed up wont be silk sheets or owt mind she followed him across the rough and sodden grass popping the studs on her waxed coat not liking to think what kind of damage there might be back home in ledwardine huw stopped and looked back at her country life like town life wi extra shite dont like jane being on her own in the vicarage i know shes eighteen but in my mind shes ten shes got robinson just across the street huw came to a wooden stile waited patting merrily on the shoulder as she drew level you did bloody well tonight wouldntve worked the same coming from me he balanced his lambing light on one of the stiles posts and climbed over she called after him youre a bastard huw huw picked up the lamp and the lamp picked up a razored track leading down towards the stone rectory a grey boulder with a scree of crumbling outbuildings merrily scrambled up on the stile the wind whipping at her hair this was nothing an hour ago shedve been on hands and knees you didnt tell me syd spicer was on the course after the session was over she hadnt gone looking for the man with teddybear eyes shed waited for him to approach her but he never had she hadnt seen him leave old skills he rang me up asking if he could sit in for one day merrily looked down at him from the top of the stile when was this at the weekend he say why not in any detail would i be right in thinking merrily climbed over and sat down on the step of the stile that syd no more expected to see me here than i expected to see him huw stood gazing out beyond the rectory to where the moon had pewtered the hills i didnt tell him id asked you to come no i figured since you worked with him last year i figured hed trust what you had to say in relation to what whatever problem hes got which is the step was soaked through merrily pulled her coat under her bum this was obviously going to take a while across in the rectory a light blinked on thatll be spicer now huw said hes in your bloody rectory he were stopping tnight here anyroad two lights were on now in the rectory merrily folded her arms you see what strikes me as odd is that when i was invited down to syds parish in the malverns it was because he basically did not do this stuff had no time for any of it there are leaps i cant make hed said to her and merrily had said youre worried by the nonphysical and hed said samuel dennis spicer church of england name rank and number you could pull out all his teeth and that was the most youd get from the rev syd spicer former sergeant with sas the special air service herefords finest the uks finest come to that some said the worlds huw sat down at the other end of the step remind me about the time you worked with him briefly series of road accidents in the malverns near his rectory all in more or less the same place survivors saying theyd swerved to avoid a man on a bike who wasnt there and spicer didnt believe that kept saying he had a problem with paranormal phenomena merrily said he wanted me to look into it do the roadside blessing bit and reassure local people that it was sorted which led to i know what it led to did he believe at the end when it was over probably not so if youre asking whether im surprised to see him on a deliverance course yes i am huw said i were also wondering why he hadnt gone to you in the first place over what what did he tell you he said and i quote an old evil had come back into his life and he needed to deal with it exhaust thats why you set me up to talk about denzil joy dont get me wrong lass i think it were a useful exercise for all of em its the most explicit case of possible demonic possession ive heard of in a while and i thought youd tell it well and you did none of them buggers is going to forget about denzil but whatever it is its likely in your manor and i thought you should know about it and i thought he should be reminded about you syd isnt expecting to see me again tonight is he aye well hell think youve gone he wont know your cars trapped behind a tree huw youre a bastard aye even the weather played into huws hands i take it merrily that when that business were on in the malverns spicer wasnt frightened no he wasnt he is now you reckon a man whos served in likely the hardest regiment in the entire history of the british army huw stretched out his legs into the dark greasy grass now then lass what could possibly scare the shit out of him neglect bliss had come alone parking outside a metal gate at the top of the drive eventually having to climb over because he couldnt work the bolt in the dark a spotlight speared him as he hung astride the shivering tubular bar at the top of the drive a door had opened a man stood there green gilet high boots police bliss said feeling like a twat as he came down from the gate stumbling to his knees the countryside could always bugger you up when it felt like it he stumbled towards the bungalow built of old brick like the big house an outbuilding possibly a converted coach house mr bull a nod maybe francis bliss mr bull west mercia cid bliss pulled off his beanie held up his id the guy in the doorway didnt look at it youre the man who married chris symondss daughter i am yes bliss sighed maybe theyd met at one of the agonizing county functions kirsty had dragged him to some creaking conveyor belt of dinner jackets chris is a friend mr bull said i see him often well that could hardly be more explicit a blast of wind caught bliss as he stowed away his id loose bits of his life getting blown in his face mr bull can i say that im very sorry for my loss bliss said nothing you can take your routine commiserations inspector bliss and insert them into your rectum mr bull said bliss nodded wearily and followed him into the house grief took many forms aggression one of the commonest lowenergy bulbs laid a mauve wash on the kitchen it had costly customized fittings and strong new beams of green oak when a phone started ringing sollers bull unplugged the lead from the wall everybody who needs to know knows next few days will be difficult bliss said days sollers bull stood gazing into wide windows that looked to be tripleglazed nothing much to see but the reflection of himself and bliss and a doubleoven aga in tomato red sollers had told stagg hed spent the early evening at a staff meeting at his farm shop it checked out chris says you consistently neglected your wife inspector sollers bull told blisss reflection neglect seems to be your forces forte wheres your wife mr bull not your concern well you know actually it is bliss said quietly with an extremely violent killer on the loose then why arent you out there looking for him mr bull turned at last to bliss a wedge of stiff dark hair was razored clear of his ears a tiny diamond stud winking out of one of them the one that tv cameras always caught when with his handsome head held high sollers was striding in and out of court bliss said your brother reported intruders on his land we both did on separate occasions did you know that i no doesnt particularly surprise me inspector bliss because preventing crime look bliss held up both hands i understand your distress and your anger but alleged trespass isnt necessarily police business at all let alone cid business for a start it has to be trespass with intent and preventing crime is lowpriority stuff nowadays isnt it counts for nothing in the target culture nil points you got this every day now every little twat nicked for a minor offence accusing you of using him to make the figures tally mr bull we dont like the target culture any more than you and i try not to let it get in the way of being a good copper im not saying if id heard about your intruders wedve come rushing over with a chopper and an armed response unit because our resources are limited at the best of times but bliss drew out a chair from under the kitchen table but didnt sit down i think i need to know about it now sir dont you sollers bull crossed the room switched off the main bulbs as if to dim his anger the moon was in and out now that the storm was over through the window you could see poplars waving blackly like they were fanning away shreds of cloud mr bull sharp face scarred with shadows told bliss hed seen two of them around the end of last week thursday perhaps two men and a vehicle wasnt quite dark i could quite easily have shot one probably as well you didnt though bliss said patiently you dont know this was down to the people you saw whom im presuming you didnt recognize or did you i dont know who they are but i know what they are who did you speak to mr bull when you rang the police rang what i thought was hereford police and it turned out to be some anonymous call centre might as well have been in fucking delhi like the rest of them sometime later i actually received a call back to ask if the intruders were still in the vicinity because the police were rather busy yeh well bliss said we both know thats not satisfactory and if i was chief constable i might well talk to the home office about things being done a bit differently but im just a lowly foot soldier what exactly did your brother see is he still there still lying out there in his yard when i left but probably not now therell be a postmortem in the morning there was a bottle of single malt on the table sollers bull pushed it at bliss bliss shook his head not falling into that trap tell me about the vehicle pickup truck white or light blue mansel saw it on the track two nights together raced away when they saw him ive told all this to your sergeant which is why the whole areas taped off in case there are tyre tracks and footprints weve both been over it several times since then and delivery vehicles we can eliminate them its still worth it sollers bull eyed him over his glass wasnt worth it when we had a quad bike stolen last year was it or when gerry morgans chainharrow took a walk the week after christmas i bet you dont even know what a chainharrow is do you inspector bliss moved on might know what it was but he was buggered if he knew what it looked like mr bull you said you didnt know who they were but you knew what they were did i sollers poured himself a drink probably because id been reading in the local rag how the hereford murder rates doubled the past year or so still means a lot less in hereford than it does in new york or birmingham even and if youre pointing out that the last two killers were east european well so were the victims and both were urban arent even any migrants round here yet are there it had been too dark on the way here to see the fruit fields the frames for the polytunnels where the seasonal workers were employed the caravans and dorm blocks where they lived but they wouldnt even have started planting yet a percentage of migrants are career criminals we all know that sollers bull said easy pickings over here organized creditcard theft fiddling cash machines driving through a farm and lifting anything not nailed down did you see any signs of a breakin inspector bliss sollers bull regarding him with scorn we ent yet been able to count the livestock bliss was silent sollers sipped his whisky dont the police have two men of east european origin awaiting trial for rustling yeh but i think thats in evesham mr bull not all that far away its a fair way from smalltime rustling to taking a mans life bliss was recalling another case unsolved where sheep had been slaughtered in a field and then butchered on the spot somebodys idea of a takeaway bliss thought of butchers knives check it out he said you think your brother came back earlier than expected after his council meeting was abandoned and walked in on a robbery in progress nothing else makes sense to me seems odd he should be all alone in that big house his marriage ended no kids no children from either of his marriages housekeeper cleaner a local woman comes in most days ive given your sergeant her details bliss said we do need to know if he had enemies he was well liked and well respected by everyone who knew him a traditional farmer an oldfashioned farmer a man of the land this land bred to it sollers looked down at the tabletop as if the contours of the land were marked out on its surface we both were bridge sollers bliss said at least he knew his place names and mansel lacey sollers said both villages hamlets within a few miles of here something to live up to mr bull that sarcasm no bliss said surprised no it wasnt sollers bull lowered his head to his hands massaging the edge of his eyes with the knuckles of his thumbs lets talk again tomorrow shall we bliss said he drove up to the fork parked with his engine running headlights on dipped and got out his mobile signal was a bit wonky mansel bull he said farmer machete job billy grace reckons i know the dci said ive just talked at length to stagg addressing his superior bliss felt acutely strange up to a few months ago he was routinely editing his thoughts before opening his mouth sollers bull annie howe said that would be gobby hunt supporter nicked by the met for pouring red paint on john prescotts secondbest jag fighting for his heritage a hero malicious damage is malicious damage annie and still a cocky twat who as you can imagine doesnt like the police much especially me stagg said theyd been in the remains of blisss sitting room when the first call came through kirstys old man had been in with kirstys key while bliss was at work and had nicked the flameeffect fire bliss had been filling a paraffin stove when terry stagg had come through on annies mobile be more convenient for di bliss true enough in that bliss was nearer the door whenever annie came round shed arrive just after dusk leaving her car in a culdesac two streets away strategic kirsty was right if it came out one of them could end up behind a desk in carlisle no guesses which we need to watch stagg bliss said maam hadnt yet said a word to her about kirstys suspicions best to keep quiet until he knew for sure that the bitch wasnt flying a kite what else did sollers bull say francis reckons it was a robbery gone wrong all but accusing migrant workers from the fruit farm across the road figuring this might rattle annies pc cage a little that would be magnis berries that what its called named after what was a roman town annie said which used to stand somewhere round there how close is it to oldcastle half a mile i doubt there are many people employed there now probably not even got the polytunnels up yet you think we should go in see what vehicles theyve got check it out discreetly tomorrow maybe find out if anyones in charge during the season it could be the biggest centre of population between there and leominster yeh ok bliss sat watching the bare brown hedge like a complex circuit board in his headlights what time will you get back tomorrow she was in court at worcester three brothers accused over the nearfatal stabbing of a fatherinlaw verdict early next week i might look in on you tomorrow but no point in me getting involved if im back in court on monday you pleased madeup annie where are you now home thought it was best what about tomorrow night he said im not sure see that was what he was scared of too the idea that something which neither of them had expected to last really wouldnt last didnt catch that annie bliss said i keep losing the signal towards the flames syd s picer had the fire going nicely in the parlour this looks like sycamore he said to huw good burner easy ignition and a bit of oak to keep it going all night welldry too stored for three years the oak huw said with disinterest merrily was observing syd hyper striding around huws victorian parlour then diving at the fireplace and rearranging a log to funnel the flames the pensive figure in the darkest part of the chapel that had been the syd spicer she knew this was not same voice though flat as old lino she looked at huw in his leaking armchair his face mapped by shadows the parlour was still in winter mode with two baskets of logs and a heavy curtain drawn across the main door whitewashed walls ochred with smoke tell you what syd was back on his feet im just thinking if youve got a chainsaw huw we could get merrily out she sat down on the sofa if he wanted her out she no longer wanted to go sunk into the ruins of his armchair huw shook his head take you bloody hours on your own lad in the dark dangerous even on your terms he started easing off his walking boots make your calls merrily ring jane youll only be on edge go in tkitchen rayburns on ive no big secrets merrily looked at syd then back at huw but if you two want to talk can i make you some tea aye thatd be nice two sugars for me shed never been in huws kitchen before and it was a small surprise clean and not as basic as youd imagine new pine cupboards and a larder fridge odd domestic touches spice rack even feminine touches maybe his cleaner there was no woman in huws home as far as she knew not since the death of julia the love of his later life the rayburn was doing warm throaty noises she filled the kettle found the pack of yorkshire tea bags then called the vicarage on her mobile answering machine called janes mobile answering service called lol at his cottage in church street no answer no machine bugger since the great christmas flood ledwardine had seemed vulnerable in a way it never had before changing times a climate in destructive flux jane variable something not quite right lately she rang janes mobile back left a message just call me syd had a daughter too around janes age and problematical for once he seemed to want to talk about her ems been clean for most of a year though we remain watchful stretching in his chair couldnt seem to keep still hed shown no actual surprise when shed turned up with huw but then he wouldnt but watchful oh yes he always would be until his teddy bears eyes were closed by someone else wheres she now syd back home with fiona which is still down south for the present syd was from some part of london his wife from reading hed virtually promised her theyd go south when he came out of the army but his ordination had changed everything the way it often did and like so many sas men hed grown fond of the place that hed kept coming back to with his mission scars only problem being that by the time syd had become a curate there hereford had developed its own little drug culture and emily was a born addict no safer as it turned out in malvern in the end fiona spicer had taken her back to reading in manacles while syd bound by his faith had stayed on but its going to be all right syd sat with his hands clasped between his knees staring into the fire rocking slightly its working out youre finally leaving wychehill ive left i didnt know that not been gone long so erm oh god syd stretched his socks towards the flames i know what you want merrily and i really cant help you hands are tied you know how it is not really huw sniffed sank lower into his chair in the poor light its leaking stuffing was the colour and texture of his hair bloody old huw syd said like huw wasnt there hes a cunning bastard cant say i wasnt warned hasnt explained has he what merrily didnt look at huw im not getting any of this syd either youre taking over my job and they havent told me yet i wouldnt go near your job in a radiation suit merrily its simply that where i am now makes direct consultation with anybody outside of certain circles inadvisable at best you are still in the church to a point jesus huw said tiredly werent for me to tell her hes gone back where he came from lass what the bit irregular syd said the regiment doesnt like old warriors crawling back nobody wants a loser who cant cut it on the outside with a yen to start jumping out of helicopters again but the current guy did his back in on an exercise and they needed a standin for a while theyve made you temporary chaplain syd plucked his mug from the chair arm saves sending a civilian on the vicars and tarts for the sake of a few months he smiled thats the course they have at sandhurst for clergy new to the army he leaned back his eyes halfclosed interesting times not often commented on but the growth of the secular societys not good news as regards the regiment especially when youre dealing with an enemy that welcomes martyrdom taliban among others syd sat up drank some tea leaned back again pushing out his feet to the fire hed once told merrily that there was a harsh kind of mysticism at the heart of the sas something to do with the miracle of survival against immeasurable odds ninety per cent training and preparation nine per cent luck and one per cent something youd call on at breaking point the lantern in the storm i know what im doing syd said first rule dont throw the big feller in their faces merrily nodded it made sense always a surface cynicism about all things religious syd said which is healthy but in the end these are not ordinary soldiers they live by a very strong faith faith in themselves faith in their mates theres also what you might call a monastic quality and if a particular kind of inner spark is allowed to go out theyre open to a certain creeping disillu shit syd jerked his feet back from the hearth his socks were smouldering he stamped his feet lightly on the edge of the hearth then rubbed them together and carried on talking if you come over too evangelical youre well stuffed but you do have to come over like a priest not a mate theyll always respect an expert this mean you sometimes have to go abroad with them syd you make your own decisions on where you might be needed i mean how dangerous is it for a priest stupid question frustrating more than dangerous if threatened for instance you must never resist or exercise violence you go willingly into captivity and no shooters whats kind of amusing if you go on exercise with the boys they dont like to think youre getting off with light kit so they give you a cross to carry size of an old heckler and koch ninemil and if its touch and go lad huw said wi a crazed taliban warlord syd let his chin sink into his chest peered up coy every sas chaplain worth his kit knows thirtyseven ways to kill with a wooden cross there was a silence the elephant in the room had a big d tattooed on its hide merrily sipped her tea looking for an approach why did you want to do it it was the right time iraq afghanistan war but not the kind of war people care about you hear a lot about the dead but not much about the damaged syd put a thumb to his head up here you know the nhs got no answer to that not much of one anyway you think you can help in a small way makes me feel more useful than you know a parish its still a parish except this is one where i can see the point of it youre based at credenhill army villa fully equipped on your own for the present however emmys no longer at college on account of being four months pregnant oh nah syd sat up its good this is the good thing she gets married beginning of may to a boy wholl soon be a baby barrister how perfect is that then fiona moves back in and we get to think about a future well merrily smiled things do turn around dont they told you it was ok to smoke in church he wasnt smiling he was wearing a smiley mask he didnt seem frightened though he seemed in control right then so syd youre here because you have a deliverance issue related to your sas ministry blimey syd stretched his arms over his head is that the time there wasnt a clock in here and probably insufficient light to see his watch syd was on his feet samuel dennis spicer he yawned church of england as was goodnight all male thing the logs had reddened and collapsed into glowing splinters the air outside fallen to nearstillness merrily stood up and went to the window across the valley clouds had cleared and the hills were moonbleached but you couldnt see the tip of penyfan the way you could from the chapel of course huw said from the sunken chamber of his chair youre a woman we all have our cross to bear they dont have women in the sas youre saying thats why he wont talk to me hes back in the army his ministrys governed by the buttonedup bastards in the mod not that he said much to me either an evil what do you think that might be as i recall thats not one of his words he doesnt do melodrama but yeah i can see why you might think hes scared hes a bit manic isnt he youre hardly going to see him trembling or keep running to the bog huw sat up reached down to the hearth for the pot and poured more tea but aye that fact that hell say nowt to you more or less confirms it it is regimentrelated so very much on your patch although it has moved since syd was a soldier in syds time the regiment had still been based on the southern edge of the city where it had been established during world war two by an army colonel david stirling the camp known ever since as stirling lines still producing highly trained commando units parachuting in to operate behind enemy lines that famous motto who dares wins strangely in the city it had been more anonymous the townsfolk part of a conspiracy of silence but now it had moved a few miles out to the former raf base at credenhill now everybody knew where to find the sas out in the sticks with a high fence and armed guards merrily came away from the window topographically theyre in the county and in the diocese but not part of either the sas are a little island of their own so if spicer has a problem involving a spiritual evil he has to deal with it himself doesnt that bother you in what way he does one day on a deliverance course and thinks he knows enough to wing it on his own mmm see what you merrilys mobile was chiming in her bag the kid had always chosen her moments where are you in the pub im assuming not on your with lol and danny thomas good listen flower ive got a bit of a problem telling jane why shed be spending the night at huws rectory jesus jane said gormenghast so when you get in maybe you could ring and assure me that all the doors are locked things like that or you could even stay in lols spare room and become the subject of evil gossip ill be fine hesitation you sure winds dying down a few slates gone in the village thats all you want me to take a walk round the vic no if theres nothing obvious from inside just you want me to hang on in the morning till you get back no get the bus ill call you anyway about eight ok and get lol to see you home and check that theres nobody around yes i will ill do that now that was wrong normally it would be dont be ridiculous this is ledwardine owt up lass dont know merrily dropped the phone into her bag maybe she was overtired you think when theyre officially adult its going to be easier that theyll be more restrained but the only real difference is that now they can do things shake foundations she told huw about the ledwardine henge issue indications of a bronze age earthwork around the village concealed for centuries by apple orchards it was clear that elements inside hereford council would prefer that nothing was found on land they hoped to develop thus turning ledwardine into something approaching a town jane obsessed with ancient sites planning a career in archaeology was furious and jane was eighteen jane could vote and express opinions shes also enraged about a very rich man called ward savitch inviting other rich people to kill our wildlife and she feels i dont know she was a bit screwedup when we arrived fifteen dad dead mother adopting a deeply uncool career and yet shes been happier in ledwardine than anywhere and now she can see it coming apart the village is a divided place now not a happy place and youve to keep walking the fence huw fell silent gazing into the embers from the depths of his chair then he got to his feet ill go and make some more tea when he returned with the teapot it was after midnight and jane had rung back to say all was well doors barred cat fed no signs of stormdamage at the vicarage still detectable traces of lets not worry mum unnecessarily but short of listing every conceivable mishap and pedantically putting them to her one by one there wasnt a thing you could do about it the tea was strong as if huw was determined neither of them would get much sleep tonight you read the new guidelines mmm a circular last week underlining the need for full insurance be sure your clerical policy covered deliverance and all the possible repercussions its a farce merrily rules and procedures and targets like the nhs health and safety it cant work like that ive been thinking might be time for me to pack this in the courses youve said that before she moved to the chair vacated by syd up against the dregs of the fire lighting a cigarette and leaning back into a padded wing so that most of her face was out of huws line of sight you tended to think it was only the intensity of his work that had kept him going after julias death what would you do happen retire write me memoirs that would explode a few comfort zones huw leaned back with his hands behind his head im starting to think we could be close to fucked this time merrily i go into brecon even brecon and i can feel it apathy scorn even fear of what we might be underneath used to be the worst we were was irrelevant now were taking the shit for militant islam and a handful of kiddiefiddling catholic priests were either naive and laughable or were part of a sinister old conspiracy to control peoples minds and have sex with their children and all the time theres dawkins standing on his citadel of science pissing on us over the railings merrily let the smile show did i just hear a snatch of your fantasy final sermon huws eyes lit up for just a moment like in the old days and he laughed bugger off to bed you cheeky cow or youll be fit for nowt in the morning she nodded and stood up keep an eye on him huw said syd hes a grown man credenhills no more than what eight miles from you you think this could actually be something at the sas camp not going to get in there am i i never saw you as a defeatist huw said the room merrilyd been given she figured it wasnt supposed to be a guest room syd would have the guest room this was a womans room nothing you could quite put your finger on no frilly pink shade on the bedside lamp no extra mirrors no fleecy rugs the lamp had a parchment shade making a pale sepia circle around two books a hardback new testament and an oxford paperback edition of aquinass selected philosophical writings the bed was a double bed merrily guessed this was the room where huw had slept with julia a room that he didnt use any more wearing a sweater over bra and pants merrily switched off the lamp and walked over to the sash window the view was down the valley towards the few remaining lights of the village of sennybridge the landscape looked disarranged like rumpled bedclothes after a restless night the way the weather got inside the landscape the way it got inside people even huw new deliverance guidelines another generation of dull buggers appointed by careful bishops she couldnt lose that grainy mental video of huw in the passage at the chapel heading the old stained light bulb and she had a disturbing sense of disintegration jane leaving home for some university next autumn lols career reviving after the years of oblivion even though he only lived across the street merrily wasnt seeing as much of him this year now that danny thomass barn over the border had become his rehearsal room well that was wonderful obviously life was good for lol good for jane if she could let go of ledwardine merrily stood at the window arms wrapped around herself watching the lights in the valley going out part two then my sight began to fail and the room became dark about me as if it were night julian of norwich revelations of divine love stable doors midmorning day three of the mansel bull investigation and the police press officer was on the phone to bliss elly clatter this was exlocal journalist from the black country and a nice enough woman if you didnt mind being treated like a maladjusted kid at play school normal way of it francis my duck id be suggesting you maintain a dignified silence only it looks to me like this is starting to become a bit of an issue an issue this year everything was a frigging issue and hes saying what exactly sollers bull the first formal interviews since his brothers murder hunt hero sollers bull in the tory tabs twat in blisss book he hasnt said anything yet hes doing tv and radio in about an hour but if he says what we think he might say were going to need to be ready with some answers not me again elly ive done enough couple of pressers over the past two days this was a particularly savage and pointless crime we know the killer left the scene with a considerable amount of blood on his clothing and on his person somebody out there knows who this is this is an individual nobody should be hiding trite crap hated the telly particularly you can relax elly said itll just be a quote from a police spokesperson at this stage all we need from you frannie or your colleagues is some background so we can formally say no were not turning a blind eye to petty crime in the countryside and yes we do investigate all reports of suspicious behaviour shit elly ive gorra bliss broke off eyes were raised all over the cid room mustve been shouting normally hed be in his own office but that wasnt the best place to find out if people were dissecting your private life if you cobble something together elly said ill mess around with it read it back to you then take it upstairs for clearance hows that sound or you could just tell the media that di bliss has told mr bull to go and now francis sorry bliss lowered his head into billy graces report divided trachea several blood vessels im not gerrin a lorra sleep elly ill talk to the dci get back to you all right he seems to be an impulsive sort of man this mr bull elly said yeh bliss had a few of the backstories on his laptop the blooding of prezza daily express on the redpaint incident a telegraph feature on the saintly sollerss battle to defend a thousandyear tradition pictures of sollers in his foxhunting kit and his ear stud bliss looked up and saw that elly clatter hadnt gone away what id be a bit a careful frannie you just see him as a man with form but in hunting circles its a medal him and that otis ferry both members of the jumpedup twats club a moments silence from opposite corners of the cid room terry stagg and karen dowell were staring at him you ever think you might be working in the wrong part of the country francis elly clatter said about half an hour later bliss rang annie howe at headquarters in worcester from his office this time door shut voice lowered annie was still only halfavailable required to be on hand in case she was recalled to the crown court shed been quite helpful meanwhile which was still a whole new experience for bliss sorry she said we tried either they know nothing or theyre not playing or the translators crap bliss said shes actually a very good translator im told it had been annies idea and not a bad one to approach the two men facing rustling charges in evesham offer them a deal in return for information on who might be lifting stock in herefordshire a network couldnt be ruled out both came over as seasonal workers annie said but dont seem to have been at any of the hereford fruit farms bliss and stagg had been over to the magnis berries farm first thing still a preseason skeleton staff local manager six workers everybody living offsite the whole place locked up all night stuffed then bliss said they couldve come from anywhere birmingham newport gloucester widen the net then talk to west midlands gwent what about general crime no pointers there farm thefts are up stolen quad bikes chainsaws diesel drained from tanks widespread metaltheft some organized poaching but no recent rustling of farm animals no violence well keep trying the press conferences had shaken out sightings of two un familiar pickup trucks on private land one up towards bredwardine one seen turning round at lulham like he was a stranger who hadnt known it was a dead end this was the best so far but still not worth much meanwhile bliss said mr bull is doing interviews talking stable doors accusing us of giving rural crime low priority dont react i mean it francis bliss found himself wondering what annie was wearing where are you tonight jurys still out and were warned to expect an overnight she was always careful on police phones might make it over there before close of play failing that ill be home this evening if you need me for anything home malvern right bliss said the lunchtime tv news had pictures of grey fields barbed wire and police tape it said the hunt for the killer of a farmer in the wye valley had been stepped up what they always said when there was no new line bliss switched off hed brought karen dowell and terry stagg into the office with a pot of tea and a few sandwiches were going to get a hard time over this arent we terry said sounding almost pleased bliss extracted an egg sarnie but its not totally our fault is it tezza as were severely undermanned underfunded and overburdened with bureaucratic shite i think we need to quietly point this out to the media quietly how i was thinking you actually when you go back out there i thought you could find out which pub theyre occupying join them for a butty exchange a few confidences youve got the look of a boozer tez its the veins in your nose they like that maybe you could find out what sollers is telling them on the side and what they think of him you dont like sollers bull do you boss karen said a wholesome country girl but smart karen what were his relations with mansel do you think big old family its not the frigging royal family karen its near enough in this county you should know you married into the fringes of all that bliss scowled sorry karen said i was sensing a distance between sollers and his brother bliss said the way he kept telling me what a wellrespected man he was no conspicuous affection with respect boss he wouldnt show that in front of you but they werent mates big age gap not exactly griefstricken is what im saying and hes very likely going to inherit a big slab of prime riverside acreage plus a small mansion mansel had no wife left no kids i heard thats why theyre history terry said the wives thats what billy grace thought mansel wanted an heir to oldcastle but refused to believe it might be his fault he didnt get one bottom line looks like sollers could be in line for most of it they were partners you want to be a bit careful boss thats all karen said under the circumstances im doing me job bliss threw up his hands hes got form he was nicked for exercising his countrymans right to protest about what he considered to be an unjust law you think hes a hero do you karen i think hes clever university then business college big on diversification farm shop restaurant we frequent his restaurant do we no but my mum works there karen split a kit kat whats the dcis line something this big i keep expecting her to come stalking in rapping knuckles but she stays in worcester odd that shes been in court not over the weekend i mean she was here but not for long terry stagg said maybe keeping out of the line of fire let the di cop the flack not the only odd thing when you think about it karen said thoughtful she does that spell as actingsuper here and then gets offered thames valley which unless ive got this wrong wouldve been about six months under a superintendent coming up to retirement on a promise why didnt she go for that not the howe we know is it terry stagg smiled greasily through his unsightly stubble maybe she has other things she wouldnt want to leave behind grinned at bliss fathers daughter ok bliss said lets just thats crap karen shaking her head even i dont think shes bent that case terry brushing crumbs off his tie maybe shes finally getting herself seen to shit bliss was looking down at his desk turning over the forensics feigning lack of interest when he heard karen go its not you is it his gut went tight as a drum his head came up very slowly a struggle to frame some flip reply until he saw she was looking at terry stagg a joke how many of these frigging jokes could his heart take he watched stagg shudder why is karen trying to give me nightmares boss shes actually not badlooking karen said in her austere way karen terry stagg blinked that womans a metal coat hanger with tits itd be like you know with a plastic doll or something staring over your shoulder with glazed eyes anyway nobodys yet proved to me shes not a lezzer how many times we been through that karen said does a brilliant impression of a woman who hates men gay women cops staggie manfriendly always am i right boss sorry karen bliss tried not to look too concerned either way i was just wondering how terry knows so much about having sex with a plastic doll that was a very telling detail about the way their eyes stare over your shoulder karen giggled sod off terry stagg said going not quite red boss bliss relaxed as best he could these days he stood fingering the loose change and the car keys in his pockets unhappy about the way annie howes uncharacteristic professional restraint had been spotted had they also noticed how readily shed trusted him to handle a major inquiry of national interest karen on their own now in his office terry stagg heading back to the crime scene mmm karen look im gonna come over all pathetic now is there any kind of rumour going round about me what about being gay karen grinned then saw his face sorry boss im not sure what youre asking me if you mean kirsty a wonky marriages hardly got novelty value in this place nothing else i apologize for sounding girlie thank you well unless ive failed to pick up on something id say the pressure of a highprofile murder investigation combined with your domestic issues is making you just a bit paranoid so nothing nothing frannie id know and if i knew id tell you shouldve kept his gob shut shed be curious now and kirsty kirsty still knew something but from whom whod found out about him and annie and passed it on thingsll get better boss karen said yeh bliss said as gwyn adamson office manager on the mansel inquiry came over with an envelope couple of things francis ones an eyewitness report from a petrol station at leominster bloke apparently was dropped from a car and then escorted by two men into a fourbyfour as he was getting in someone pulled a bag over his head when was this last wednesday night two nights before mansel was killed no indication of duress witness thought it was a joke however this gwyn handed bliss the envelope is more interesting came in the lunchtime post just addressed to police hereford could be a crank job but bliss accepted a folded sheet of a computer printout the word blood all over it act of sacrifice these were two pains that shewed in the blessed head the first wrought to the drying while his body was moist and that other slow with blowing of wind from without that dryed him more the sky through the scullery window was scored with raw pink cloud easter was coming and easter week at the end of march would sometimes mean snow nobody here would be surprised after what last winter had hurled at them and pained with cold more than my heart could hold and the shewing of christs pains filled me full of pains merrily folded down the corner of the page shut the paperback it was still scary it had the feel of reportage informed forensic almost dispassionate reportage nothing quite like it before or since thered been a few blank faces when shed brought it out in church yesterday palm sunday this had been after the evening meditation attended by the more thoughtful committed parishioners all ten of them julian of norwich holding up the paperback a woman mother julian a nun an anchoress or recluse and a mystic in when she was just thirty she became very ill and nearly died and that was when she experienced the series of visions she discusses here or fever dreams hallucinations whatever leaving us with this profoundly harrowing gritty account of what crucifixion must really have been like which erm i was thinking we could use as a basis for the good friday meditation a suitably sombre prelude to the proposed vigil in the church through saturday night to easter day amanda rubens the bookseller looking a little nunlike herself in a long black dress had probably spoken for most of them and you really want us to dwell on wounds and killing exactly a week after what happened at oldcastle farm it had been all over ledwardine by the time shed arrived home from brecon ten miles was nothing in the country ten miles was somewhere you could see across the fields between the trees although shed never met or heard of mansel bull she knew a relative james bulldavies last remnant of the ledwardine squirearchy and gomer parry had once dug a pond for mansel and jim prosser in the eight till late his brotherinlaw had had a sheepdog pup off mansel less than a year ago merrilys own grandad had farmed at mansel lacy after which the dead man apparently had been named connections everywhere an act of sudden blinding violence ricocheting like a pinball around the countryside setting off vibrating lights jarring the whole table the sunday papers had pictures of a redbrick farmhouse on the edge of an orchard above the wye and a smiling thickset man leaning on a gate this morning a new for sale sign had appeared in church street to join the existing four all of them reactions to the winter and the fatal flooding which had turned the church into a nogo area on christmas day the mopping and the mourning into new year when the snow came and then the bitter winds driving the sleet heralding the murder of mansel bull at oldcastle whose high chimneys you could see from cole hill in the lifting of the morning mist some weeks during the frozen months there had been no actual meditation in church too cold in here even with all the heat on theyd just sat around in their coats and talked ledwardine shivering in chill fatalism and the village still looked raw and flaking not much energy here except around the court where ward savitch hosted upmarket action weekends and shooting parties to reawaken huntergatherer instincts in men from off obviously we should do it gus staines had said gus was a plump little woman with a semipermanent goblin smile shed come up from london in january to join amanda her longtime partner who had been making an adequate and decorous living here in the new cotswolds until the weekend visitors began to be repelled by the snow and the electricity kept failing and the shops didnt get supplied so often weve all gone soft gus said stoutly we should throw ourselves into the full horror of the crucifixion the violence and the misery because thats the reality of what people do to each other still this is not the time to turn away merrily had glanced over to where jane was sitting on the edge of the circle jane had been to the meditation most weeks since christmas not saying much which was probably just as well she didnt say anything now but she looked mildly interested and then its a magical ritual shed said last night youre playing with the big forces here community shaman dear god resurrection of christ resurrection of ledwardine correct the kid was sitting as she often did on a cushion at the edge of the hearth with the reddening log fire behind her ethel the black cat on her knees the eyes of both glittering like leds the role of the shaman being to lead the tribe out of the dark like out of the tunnel of winter onto the sunlit hillside of spring pain and death a vigil through midnight and then boom catharsis easter sod off jane youre going into denial already not exactly denial easter was the most profound of all seasonal festivals way before christianity even the last supper has pagan origins and like i think you said julian of norwich actually wished for her illness invoking mortality in the hope of rebirth experiencing those visions in like the delirium of neardeath merrily sighed its all totally valid jane said the village has lost its mojo you need to kickstart the ancient engines and some asses jane looking down slowly massaging ethel under the chin ancient engines theyd been here before the creaking and stirring of old ledwardine spiritual sap seeping eerily into centuriesdead oak timbers janes favourite picture of herself was the one taken by eirion her boyfriend in colemans meadow bare arms raised to the sun handmaiden of the goddess needs to be seriously harrowing mum like when a place gets into disaster mode expecting the worst all the time the worst just seems to go on happening unless you step in with an act of sacrifice jane how can i put this we dont actually want to scare people although we do obviously huw owen said now in merrilys head watching a bulb swing like some sinister censer merrily had spent an hour underlining passages in revelations of divine love normally on a monday afternoon shed have driven into hereford to go through the deliverance diary with sophie but the monday before easter was for planning and organizing the weekend ahead there was also a parish council meeting on wednesday uncle ted senior churchwarden had a proposal to create a permanent cafe in the church turn it into the heart of the village again he said also make some money so what would happen to the silence where would you go when you needed to be alone with something that didnt judge didnt question didnt ask you if you wanted to buy a raffle ticket merrily looked up out of the scullery window at the lesions in the sky the sky was momentarily blurred maybe she needed glasses a middleage thing it would come sooner rather than later now she had an adult daughter god the phone rang she shut her eyes for a second before picking up all right lass fine thanks hadnt spoken to him since saturday morning a sparse breakfast just the two of them syd spicer having left silently before first light as theyd both known he would just had a call what did he want merrily watched the daffodils still huddled in their buds you didnt have to be psychic hes laughing huwie he says just a slight problem here mate a mere technicality a mere technicality he said that and laughed she could hear the laughter it would be artificial she felt for a cigarette still staring out of the window under the winterbleached church wall banks of snowdrops were only now beginning to droop next to the emerging daffs and what was the technicality if a man feels lets say oppressed by the perceived proximity of someone whos passed on someone who in life was known to him but who was shall we say a flawed person how is it best to get this presence off the premises requiem eucharist you might expect him to know that he said there could be complications here comes the technicality he suspects there could be what he describes as strongly negative energy behind the manifestations plural plural aye suggests a chronic case is this one of his erm flock declines to be specific but why else the secrecy i reminded him i wasnt his spiritual director i said hereford diocese wasnt my patch i said he needed to talk to somebody else and he said he said he thought that when you were describing the case of mr joy you hadnt finished the story he wanted to know what nobody else had the nous to ask about what you did afterwards to keep mr joy out of your life i see that negative cry for help merrily if thats a cry for help its pitched too high for my hearing look she pulled the last cigarette out of the packet i was new to it then i was very scared id listened to an old wives tale from an old woman whod dabbled in areas i was supposed to abhor and and it worked something worked well so far it worked because you did it in the right spirit you could argue merrily stared at the church wall with all its lichens and life forms that the right spirit would be not to have done it at all the purer soul does it with considered prayer this was something else the cold finger was on merrilys spine up sprang the spidery figure of a creepy old woman in a care home whose name was anthea but who only answered to athena and you told him did you what i knew of it threw in a couple of defensive pentagrams point up see what reaction i got to that he said nowt seemed to be writing it down merrily remembered discussing athenas advice with huw afterwards how it bordered on what jane would call magical ritual and huw had asked her if she realized how many socalled magical rituals had come out of the medieval catholic church she wondered if syd had noted what shed told huws students about not necessarily analysing everything in depth thats why we have the rituals and the liturgy just do it still not sure how true that was how does this feel to you merrily asked feels wobbly temporary i dont like it but if the bugger wont come clean its personal isnt it its him or connected to him is he going to come back to you afterwards tell you man to man if it worked because he isnt going to come to me is he happen you should smother your pride and give him a call i havent got his new number i have it here huw said give him a day or so then call him i think it were bloody hard for him to give away much as he did i reckon hes in a bad way thanks merrily said killing fields the core squad in the cid room in front of the box all the blinds up on a heavyweight earlyevening sky a gathering dismay in the room bliss howling what are these bastards trying to do its like its been orchestrated hed come in halfway through the replay of the national news he sat down shaken how far it was planned is of no great importance at the present time annie howe said its happening and we need to respond to it annie had returned in a rare sparkling mood the worcester jury having come back unexpectedly with a nice result two out of three guilty on the stabbing the dcis fizz had survived the national tv news but the extended version on midlands today was something else poisoned our towns on the screen some fat bastard bulging out of his tweeds and now its overflowing into rural areas all the time we see strangers in old vans clearly up to no good but we know were wasting our time reporting it because itll be ignored simply ignored cut to camelcoatandheadscarf woman by a fivebarred gate obvious why they dont care coming out heres jolly timeconsuming and everybody knows they can meet their arrest and conviction targets far quicker and more cheaply in the towns trouble is shes not far wrong there is she bliss said though we wont be expressing those sentiments outside of this room will we francis annie howe said quietly not looking at him karen run the item again from the beginning would you please we need to know who they all are karen dowell played about with the remote brought up the current midlands today barbieandken presentation team man with the hunt for the brutal killer of a herefordshire farmer in its third day a rural pressure group has been accusing police of failing the countryside woman and as mandy patel reports the attacks been spearheaded by the brother of the murdered man who says west mercia police repeatedly ignored reports of intruders on their land familiar shots of the middle wye valley looking bare and windscoured patels voice describing how the mood in herefordshire had swung from horror to rage as the vision cut to an obvious protest meeting bunch of people at a raised table draped in banners apart from sollers bull bliss recognized nobody annie said to karen whos the man in the red waistcoat cant remember his name maam but im pretty sure hes the county chairmanelect of the nfu and the guy next to him is lord walford karen nodded bliss said who the fucks lord walford old tory peer boss and sollers bulls fatherinlaw also a former member of the police authority annie said wheres this happening exactly walls of light wood spotlights from exposed rafters pine tables the restaurant at sollers bulls farm shop karen said out on the leominster road my mum works there parttime got to say ive been around here all my life maam but theres quite a few people i dont think ive ever seen before yes well me neither annie howe said which possibly lends credence to their claim that its a national movement freeze it bliss said there isnt that one of those ageing boy racers from the octane show smiffy gill terry stagg said lives just over in wales just the kind of flash twat whod throw his driving gloves into the ring for this shite bliss said above the panel of nobs at the raised table a sign green on white covered half the wall countryside defiance the camera pulling back from the sign the reporter saying in voiceover the organizers insist this is not a spinoff from the countryside alliance but a new response to what they say is an urgent situation hold it there annie howe said man at the back black hair receding jawline tim tim somebody member of the police committee whos he supporting bliss said who indeed sorry let it run karen new voice a woman not local this is not political but its certainly a matter of now you saw her fortyish short red hair tailored suit pride and tradition this county like every county in britain has its roots in agriculture but in herefordshire the roots are still close to the surface not yet buried under tons of concrete the caption said rachel wisemanfrance coordinator countryside defiance bliss made a note of it as the woman said with the hunting ban and fourbyfours roadtaxed to the hilt people who live and work in the countryside already felt they were being systematically penalized now they not only fear for their livelihoods but their very lives the reporters voice came back the brother of murdered farmer mansel bull is also talking of a climate of fear in the welsh border hills and is accusing west mercia police of turning a blind eye to rural crime sollers bull was standing outside his restaurant between two flags a welsh dragon and a cross of st george my brothers death left us shattered not only the family but the whole county ive had dozens of phone calls letters emails from farmers and country dwellers and most of them are saying the same thing sollers wore a dark suit black tie spoke quietly even hesitantly letting a local accent leak through and stumbling over the odd word no hint of the aggression hed displayed to bliss no ear stud today only days before he was killed my brother reported seeing strangers on our land behaving in a suspicious manner so he phoned the police who did not come out to investigate sollers paused no mention of migrants this time bliss noticed he knew that any hint of racism and the bbc would never speak to him again and even after the murder i was appalled to be told by a senior officer that we could not have expected any more attention than we got annie howe and terry stagg both glancing at bliss dcs vaynor and toft exchanging smiles maybe even smirks bliss scowled what was i supposed to say yeh im really sorry we shouldve sent an aru rachel wisemanfrance was back the point is that some police divisions have special squads for dealing with gun and knife crime and offences in urban ethnic communities but rural crimes time after time go undetected because too many police have absolutely no knowledge of life outside the cities karen dowell looked at bliss raising a despondent eyebrow as shots appeared of uniformed police and socos in durex suits standing by a van at the entrance to mansel bulls farm the camera lingering for just an instant too bloody long on a fulllength shot of bliss pointing at something and smiling god he hadnt noticed that first time round smiling at a murder scene bliss kept his eyes on the tv knowing that every bastard in the cid room would be covertly observing his reactions what he saw next as the picture cut back to the people in the restaurant made him want to kick the screen in he turned away nails digging into his palms as rachel wisemanfrance said the last thing we want is to be accused of taking the law into our own hands but are we really going to stand by and see our precious countryside turned into killing fields at a signal from annie howe karen cut the sound on the male presenter reading out a precis of the press statement put out by elly clatter about how west mercia were fully committed to the policing of rural areas and nobody would rest until the killer of mansel bull was caught annie moved in front of the screen ok you all know what weve said to the media after what weve just seen we all know its not going to be good enough longterm i have a meeting with the chief constable tomorrow and id like to be able to tell him were moving towards a quick result on this but clearly were not killing fields bliss snarled frigging killing fields who is that woman anybody know anything about this countryside defiance bliss looked at karen dowell who shrugged ask around shall i boss theres a new pressuregroup formed every other week annie howe said probably latching onto this for their own political reasons with the telegenic mr bull as a useful figurehead however they do seem to have the support of certain influential people in the county which is obviously not going to make things any easier for us bliss looked at annie in her black crown court suit and her white silk shirt his lover now unbelievably but his friend later in his office bliss showed annie the letter posted to the police hereford gwyn adamsons inclined to think its a crank thing im not sure to the detective investigating the murder of farmer bull i cannot tell you who i am for personal reasons while my girlfriend and i were parking at the entrance to a field last friday night we both saw a man covered with blood he was coming towards us as i pulled in and when he saw us he turned and ran i had the headlights on full and we saw that there was blood all over him i am sorry that i cannot reveal my identity but i swear this is the truth i did not think to look at the exact time but it was about pm this is all i can tell you i hope it helps you catch him i am unable to give you a better description of him because of all the blood this has been processed presumably annie said its a copy where was it posted in town could be on cctv then if we can tie it down to a time margin could be a simple process of elimination already being done bliss said what strikes me is the way he calls mansel farmer bull heard that a few times the last couple of days some local people called him farmer bull in a humorous kind of way because he looked so much like an oldfashioned gentleman farmer tweeds waistcoat cloth cap that been in the papers not that im aware so this persons probably a local fairly intelligent no spelling mistakes or dodgy grammar we could be looking at a neighbour in a car with a girlfriend so if hes married whatve you done about it so far extended the search area nasty night so therell be tracks also if this bloke they saw was well splattered with mansels blood hes likely tove sprinkled some of it around we need to find whoever sent this annie said this guy thinks hes told us all he knows but half an hours questioning we could get twice as much lets put out an appeal person who sent a letter posted in hereford no details ok will do interesting they saw only one man could be significant unless they split up took off in different directions theres also a report come in of a man at leominster being taken away in a fourbyfour with a bag over his head but that was two nights earlier maybe a joke yeah well from now on we ignore nothing that happens in the sticks annie howe said yeh um might as well tell her dont think youve ever seen kirsty have you apart from in the wedding picture that used to be on your sideboard she looked different then longer hair and its dyed now dark red annie looked at him a forefinger extended along one pale cheek dark red hair black coat you noticed her then on the box oh god francis yeh who was the man with her her old man chris symonds interesting the way they were sitting at the table right underneath the countryside defiance banner so they knew theyd be on tv and youd see it annie folded the photocopy of the letter and stood up allowing her hand to brush briefly against blisss come over later if you can not going borderlife that was when the knife really went in a quarterly glossy full of ads for luxury stuff that few local people would buy even if they could afford it but then borderlife wasnt aimed at local people getting off the school bus jane had seen the spring issue on the rack at the eight till late hadnt wanted to buy it obviously but the knowyourenemy instinct had kicked in with the picture of ward savitch on the front sitting on a vintage fergy tractor with the court in the background all misty and the blurb just call me a reformed townie ok jane had never actually met savitch didnt really want to either in case he turned out to have you know some level of basic charm or a prosthetic leg but she was building up a file of news cuttings background for the expose in a proper pub lication borderlife had four pages including about six pictures of the countryside looking lush the enemy looking smug the savitch effect lorna mantle meets the man at the heart of the new cotswolds jane had the magazine open on the floor by her bed and was lying across the width of the duvet tensing up already how many lives must have been changed for ever by a quick flip through the property pages in a dentists waiting room yes i the secrets of pain owe all this to a broken tooth ward savitch laughs showing me around an estate that now extends to over acres and growing the advertisement for the court at ledwardine wasnt the biggest on the page but there was something about it that told the jaded city broker this is the one i think it was the fact that id simply never heard of the place he says id inspected properties all over gloucestershire oxfordshire and berkshire with an increasing sense of seenitallbefore but herefordshire was a revelation they all said that jane wrinkling her nose in distaste what they meant was that herefordshire was still up for grabs whereas the cotswolds had been firmly grabbed no bargains left the term new cotswolds as applied to the prerecession rush to buy property in herefordshire is not always used approvingly but ward savitch sees it as a challenge this county has a wealth of customs and traditions in danger of being lost for ever i want to see growth of a kind which supports the old traditions and helps develop a society that will preserve them in a sympathetic and lasting way made you want to vomit after an extensive restoration of the former farmhouse and its grounds and outbuildings mr savitch began breeding pheasants and organizing shooting weekends then as he acquired more land new luxury chalets were concealed in the dark woods giving upmarket holidaymakers a taste of the wilds the actionholiday market was also catered for with paintballing events canoeing on the river quad bikes and rough shooting many of the guests enjoyed themselves so much that they didnt want to leave and went on to buy their own homes in the area finding that it was possible to live on the welsh border without giving up their highpowered business ventures i realized there was a new energy here says mr savitch and became more excited than id ever been in my life i saw that with the decline of agriculture the countryside was literally being left to rot by the damned townies well you can call me a reformed townie ive seen the light in the internet era we can do anything here that can be done in a city and better to prove this to city powerbrokers mr savitch has been organising hugely popular freshenup weekends aimed at londonbased professionals damaged by the recession and and desperate to make a new start cornel and his mates they were damaged all right but not in ways theyd accept ward savitch certainly exudes an infectious vitality as he drives me in a bumpy old land rover across fields and along forestry tracks where every chalet and chalet is a poor term for these luxurious holiday homes comes with over half an acre of wooded land and full wifi broadband they all have solar panels and ward has plans for a small wind farm on the edge of his estate oh im as green as the next man he says but im not into gimmicks and all that old hippie good life nonsense the countryside isnt a place for running away to its a place to progress to surveys show that the largest proportion of incomers to herefordshire in the past year have been from london many are people with money eager to invest it somewhere they can see it having an effect says mr savitch ive lost nearly two stone since moving here and sleep better than ive ever done coming to the border i expect that to add at least fifteen years to my useful life useful life solar panels and windmills for phoney green cred who was this lorna mantle had savitch opened a bottle of vintage champagne afterwards and shagged her in the barn jane wasnt laughing because it got worse the secrets of pain the savitch effect is already visible in the economic health of the county in the demand for countrysports equipment and outwardbound accessories mr savitch has done great things for my business says kenny mostyn proprietor of camping and country sports suppliers hardkit who provides instructors at the court i wont deny we were in trouble before he came the bank was pulling the plug but we now have four flourishing retail outlets either side of the welsh border ward has been good news for us says lyndon pierce who represents ledwardine on the herefordshire council hes preserved the village economy in difficult times and even attracted new business ventures and this is just the start a broad economic base means we should be able to go ahead with a major expansion programme that might otherwise have been in danger at the bottom of the piece it said see for yourself what ward savitch has achieved when the court at ledwardine is open to visitors over the easter holiday period culminating in a family fun day on bank holiday monday he had it all worked out winning the battle for hearts and minds it was sick jane slid the magazine under the bed rolled onto her back and a rogue sob came up like a hiccup she lay looking up at where when theyd first moved here and shed claimed the attic as her apartment shed painted the white plastered spaces between the timbers in primary colours the mondrian walls the big statement this is me this is my space just a kid then not yet getting it that ledwardine was all about bones of oak and creamy white skin and didnt need chemical colours or anybody like ward savitch ever now there were sheets of white card taped between the timbers shed spent every evening for most of a week putting this together using blowups of a largescale os map here was the village with the orchard marked out as it had been centuries ago a great circle around a much smaller community the orchard still enclosing much of a bronze age henge roots of old apple trees wrapped around buried stones it had to be she sat up took the mobile from the bedside table and rang neil cooper of the county archaeology department at home he answered on about the twelfth ring ok look jane said im really sorry to be ringing you at night again and i know your wife thinks weve got a thing going but i need no she doesnt jane neil cooper said shes seen you she knows im far too much of a slippersandcocoa kind of guy for someone like you in fact russell brand would probably be too yeah yeah very amusing jane squirmed to the edge of the bed where shed lost her virginity to eirion lewis he was at university now in cardiff came over most weekends bless him didnt want to lose her russell brand were moving as fast we can jane coops said but like i keep telling you its not the only dig in the queue nearly all archaeology these days was rescue archaeology they only ever got to look at places about to be buried for ever under a housing estate what worried her was that if the council sanctioned plans for a superstore and upmarket housing and savitch had to be in on that somewhere the henge would stay buried like for good so what youre saying is its now looking doubtful this summer so like if i wind up at uni in september i miss everything jane sorry i expect youve got things to do ill go i will keep you informed i realize how much this means to you jane lay down with her head hanging over the side of the bed couldnt seem to sleep these nights it was ok till you turned eighteen ok to sound off about things you hated knowing there was nothing you could really do about any of it all those years of thinking how great itd be when you were officially adult and nobody could restrict you any more when in fact not being able to do anything was actually a kind of freedom if you stood up now and accused your local councillor of being bent which he was hed have you in court the village and the henge shed tried to discuss it with some of the guys at school and they didnt get it didnt remotely get it none of them could wait to get the hell out of the places theyd grown up in dreaming of london and paris and new york and la maybe it was a pagan thing that sense of place that sense of attachment although even mum was picking up on it now jane had googled julian of norwich last night and discovered a woman who in an age when god was generally feared had found the old guy polite compassionate and had even talked of mother god which the theologians said was no more than a recognition of gods nurturing of mankind but hey come on how far was this really from mother goddess all the blood was running to janes head almost on the floor by now in a nest of hair this whole university thing was like some insidious conspiracy by the lousy government just a way of keeping you off benefits for another three years while hitting you with mega tuition fees by the time she was out of it thered probably be thousands of qualified archaeologists who were all going to be indiana jones and janes head hit the floor she didnt have to go shocked and excited she wriggled back onto the bed then rolled off it stood up went to the window the village lights were coming on twin lanterns either side of the main door of the black swan fake gas lamps on the square the lights you could see the lights you couldnt janes eyes widened wasnt going that simple a decision already made on some level it had been decided holy shit she was breathing very fast now ok maybe not a question of deliberately fluffing the a levels probably make a point of doing well getting the grades just to show she could do it and then just not going no shame in that it was actually kind of radical she could just go out and get a job any kind of job that would allow her to stay in ledwardine and fight for what mattered jane felt suddenly still inside and terrifyingly clearheaded she needed to be absolutely direct about this no shit shed give it a few minutes then go down and tell mum before she could change her mind hadnt mum after all dropped out of uni after getting pregnant hadnt she even been known to say long after dads death in the car crash alongside the woman hed been shagging that maybe it was all meant jane stood gazing down at her village which needed her in this sick withering world it needed all the energy it could get she saw a small shadow emerge from the vicarage gate mum in jeans and sweater tripping across the market square of course off to meet lol in the swan like it was still the early days of their relationship courtesies to observe what was the matter with them hovering around one another still everybody hovering nobody doing anything ok give them an hour or so and then go across to the swan telling mum in front of lol that would diffuse the effect still in her cloud of knowing jane went downstairs to the kitchen talked it over with ethel the cat ethel was like yeah but what about your career its just a word ethel jane stood for an uncertain moment in the cold kitchen then went over to the fruit bowl on the dresser and took out an apple cut it in half crossways to reveal the pale green pentagram at its heart carried it out into the garden and held it in the cup of her hands open to the rising moon only a misty greyblue smudge but it would do she stood in the silence expanding the apple pentagram in her mind until she was standing in the middle of it watching it widen and become a whitegolden aura eventually enclosing the whole of ledwardine and then jane prayed to the goddess to become a channel for the cosmic energy which would make things happen dead game lol said would barry have to kill me with his bare hands if i put that on the fire merrily followed his gaze to the basket in the inglenook black and ashy the big log the only log he was right she couldnt remember ever before seeing only one log in the inglenook at the black swan famous for its applewood fires smokesweetened air over the cobbled square she shivered in the beamed and panelled lounge bar only half the wall lights were on enough for the eight or so customers whose sparse voices made soft echoes you might not like what savitch is doing lol said but you really notice when one of his wealthy hunting parties leaves the village barrys that dependent on them lol shrugged he was wearing his fraying grey gomer parry plant hire sweatshirt he had a spiralbound notebook his lyrics pad and beside it on the table a pint she guessed was shandy not yet halfdrunk smoking ban barry said from behind the bar cheap supermarket booze and now fortress hereford yeah we are getting dependent on them seven fewer fivecourse dinners bar takings down by a third put the bleedin log on laurence i can always saw up an oak settle lol left the log alone merrily stared at bulky amiable barry in the black suit and the bow tie fortress hereford all farm doors locked at nightfall shotguns loaded tell me im wrong tell me theres another reason were nearly empty what because of having your quad bike nicked is one thing but getting killed like mansel bull is not a case for farm watch as we know it its not texas either merrily said not yet civilization vicar has a thin skin this is still a frontier face west nothing but lonely welsh hills dont take much to send us to ground see this barry slapped down a glossy flyer showing the winding wye seen from above a man in a hunting coat stood with his back to the camera a riding crop in one hand under the photo it said w orth fighting for under that c ountryside d efiance lols eyes flickered who are they the woman we saw on the box wisemanfrance shes dined here a time or two with clients professional pr management consultant not sure which but you get the idea you know the type move in and tell the hicks their interests are being ignored at national level because theyre not making their voices heard with sufficient eloquence mmm merrily nodded then they offer their services free to give themselves a certain status in the community make them feel they belong shes created it has she she aint created the mood but shes given it a name barry said dont have to be thousands of people behind it just a few dozen of the right people the thousands will follow and the money savitch put it this way it was one of his minions brought the flyers in im told it also comes in different languages when the shooting parties come in from europe america japan they learn that the spiritual home of hunting since the eleventh century is under threat you ask me defiance is pulling donations from us hunting and gun lobbies this is savitch probably excites him life on the edge can be quite sexy when youre living behind big walls with big guys around and a gamekeeper in the lodge with a rack of shotguns spoken by a man who knows all about life on the edge merrily said this and that you know syd spicer it just came out barrys expression didnt change lol glanced at merrily curious you could hear the tunk of a pool game over in the other bar barry came round the bar raked over the fire in the doggrate picked up the apple log and dumped it on top the last good log he said scuse me a minute lols spiralbound lyrics pad was halffilled merrily remembered him buying it in hereford maybe two weeks ago after a rare lunch at all saints youre erm cookin as danny would say we need to get the album out before summer lol had a cautious sip of shandy its not just about me any more probably meaning not danny so much as prof levin hard times for a producer with a studio and overheads now that a band could make a perfectly professional album with digital kit in someones spare bedroom she knew lol was worried about prof going back on the booze if only out of boredom and um upturning his pencil letting it slide through his fingers to the pad ive had another approach sorry an agency nufolk stuff reputable they could break me into tours have me headlining middling events next autumn and lol leaned back there we are serious money oh with downloads and burnoffs the profits were in gigs again i said maybe id get back to them lol said of course i wont obviously lol dont let its not just that i mean its not just you merrily felt like the stone flags were falling away beneath her chair that what he was saying was not what he was thinking lol said i dont actually want to be rich you know that i do well be nice in a way to be so loaded you could buy out ward savitch but realistically lol put his hands on his knees stared down at them ive been handed a second chance right so i want things to be different from what they mightve been if id made it first time partly because theres going to be less time and also like when prof says we need more body on this album and why doesnt he see if tom storeys available im going no theres actually this guy called danny thomas whos an exsubsistence farmer and isnt quite as good as tom storey but is good enough you didnt tell me that either you didnt tell me prof wanted to get you tom storey unlikely to be an idle promise because prof had been around a long time and knew these ageing rock gods from way back and some of them owed him favours merrily felt starved what else hadnt he told her lol said just weve not had that much time to talk lately have we because youve been at dannys barn night after bloodyyou just didnt want to tell me did you you have enough to so we have separate problems now we keep our problems to ourselves we keep them apart now you dont need me to bounce this stuff off because youve got danny i dont want a row jesus lol you never want a bloody row merrily jerked her chair back what was the matter with her she liked danny thomas she was glad that lol was working with a local guy but was he turning down tours only because he thought it would be incompatible with the life of a woman tied to a parish i like it here lol said i like being a guy living in a village where one day youre playing music the next youre doing something else he pulled over the lyrics pad pencilled a circle around something then pushed it in front of merrily she read when lifes become a bitch dig out another ditch find some recovery back in the jcb referencing the times hed spent helping gomer parry she wasnt really taking this in she was thinking this is a test it had to happen one day the christian thing would be to persuade him to do the tour she saw a man walk into the bar carrying a black bin liner look lol said ive agreed with barry to do a few more gigs here at the swan and would that be a living merrily clutched her head all right im sorry and maybe something outside in the summer with more music other people a music festival in ledwardine too big a word were thinking no more than one day and a night just an idea well dannys idea he has glastonbury dreams i was going to see what you thought before we took it any further because festivals of any kind havent always gone well here have they anyway it would be useful to have the album finished and mastered and out there before it happens if it happens does the album have a title yet a message from the morning oh god i knew that whats the matter with me lol look merrily reached across the table for his hand maybe we should grab half a day drive over to wales talk about all this and other things lol said whats up with barry merrily turned her chair around barry was back and the man was holding up the bin liner barry was wiping his hands on a towel hes not happy lol lol said why were you asking him about syd spicer its a long story the guy put the bin sack on the bar for you barry he was gangly longfaced jutting jaw and not sober barry looked up doing his professional beam is this roadkill sir or did one of you finally learn how to shoot dinner the guy slapped the bag on the bar my dinner for tomorrow barry he wore a camouflage jacket newish he had a loose rubbery mouth i wanna eat it he said merrily saw lol look up frown i thought hed gone back to wherever he came from i thought theyd all gone guest of the court they love to find bits of lead shot in their dinner lol said real men do us a favour sir barry said take it round the back not everybody likes dead game in the bar especially when its over a month out of season it never fucking is landlord then its probably unfit for human consumption barry said calmly round the back eh i need to eat it well talk about it round the back i can only thank god janes not here merrily said she saw lol wince the rule halfway across the square under the amber wash of the fake gas lamps jane lost the certainty not cold feet exactly just the need for a second opinion why ruin mums night she hadnt seen lol for days she slipped into the shadowy sanctuary of the little oak pillared market hall pulled out her mobile and called eirions phone eirions answering service kicked in its me jane said shed give him two minutes to call back and then walk across to the swan see what kind of mood mum was in let the fates decide she was alone under the stonetiled roof of the market hall which sometimes looked even more ancient than it was like a prehistoric burial chamber in her plan of the ledwardine henge the market hall was just offcentre maybe marking a confluence of energies a fair bit of energy had been expended here all those shadowy couples exploring each others bodies up against the pillars which made her think about eirion at university with all its temptations although hed sworn to her sod it jane tucked away her phone and walked across to the swan reaching the bottom of the three stone steps just as the door opened she backed away as someone stumbled out the porch lamp lighting his face and his slobbery mouth oh god no still here werent they all supposed to have gone home to their penthouses how long did these bloody courses go on still here still pissed ill be seeing you girlie bad bad news jane slid into the alley which led to the swans backyard he might not even remember her probably tried it on with a few more women since then but it wasnt worth the risk she stood leaning against the wall waiting for him to go obviously not the time to talk to mum too many negative signs the phone shuddered in her pocket she eased it out of her jeans moving further into the alley holding it very tight to her ear i was finishing a curry eirion said some things must never be interrupted and before you ask yes it was a vegetable curry not easy to obtain in this part of cardiff well that footsteps someone grunting irene ill have to call you back jane sorry she killed the signal edged a little further against the wall there was a sigh and a liquid splatter steam and stench g ross jane turned away and waited until it was over expecting him to go once hed finished but damn damn damn he was coming into the alley jane moved all the way into the inn yard there was an old brick toilet block at the end long out of use jane slid around the side of it stumbling into a pile of rubble only just making it in time the kitchen door was opening a splash of light jane saw dean wall standing in the doorway wearing an apron a local thug basically unless hed changed since shed been at school with him somehow hed persuaded barry to take him on as an assistant chef which probably meant he was responsible for sweeping the yard essentially only a few years a degree from the lse and probably a swiss bank account separated dean from cornel who was standing on the step one arm inside a plastic sack tomorrows dinner mate something was pushed at dean who went kind of duh but it was crisply overlaid by barrys voice im sorry mate dont apologize barry just take it you misunderstand i told you once im not accepting this this is the country there are rules wha rules take it away no mate cornel said in the country there arent any fucking rules that cant be broken son you dont know anything about the country you reckon season ends on february the first and its now very nearly the end of march that make sense to you what pheasants the rule did i mention pheasants did i jane saw white moonlight rippling in the black plastic of a bin liner bulging cornel was holding it up with both hands something hanging out of it it deserves to be fucking eaten cornel said by me that make sense to you barry didnt move cornel pulled the bin liner open at the top and held it out to him barry stayed in the doorway very relaxedlooking not touching the bag howd you kill that you all get together and beat it to death jane couldnt see what it was and didnt want to she felt herself going tight with hate cornel said youre really not gonna goodnight son barry at his most noshit wham i sposed to do with it almost screaming now i should put it back in your car boot mate and dispose of it very discreetly youre no fun barry youre no fucking fun actually barry said this is me at my most fun you want to see me at my most no fun youll leave that thing behind on these premises you get where im coming from there was a scary kind of deadness in barrys voice jane had heard stories about what barry had been known to do the odd times it had got rough in the public bar the yard went momentarily black as the door was shut and oh shit the mobile started vibrating in janes hip pocket she was gripping the phone through the denim as cornel totally lost it started snarling at the closed door this is not over its not fucking over just like the other night i just want you to know it doesnt end here only losers walked away limited repertoire tosser jane stayed tight between the perimeter wall and the toilet block trying to breathe slowly in the stalebeery air not wanting to think how cornel might react if he found her here witness to his humiliation again the moon showed her cornels foot coming back maybe to kick the closed door and then it got confusing didnt handle that very well did we cornel another voice someone had come into the yard from the alley pick it up eh an ashy kind of voice not barry a bit brummy i thought youd gone cornel said thought yow dont think cornel thats the problem now pick it up take it somewhere and bury it then go and cry yourself to sleep cornels voice came back petulant why are you doing this to me go home any time ywant mate no skin off my nose youre just a a movement not much of one a chuckle then a short cry more shock than pain uhhh ah dear dear youre really not ready didnt see that that coming either not as hard as we thought eh long way to go cornel still a long way to go mate jane breathed in hard through her mouth and the breath dragged in something gritty ive told you cornel said ill pay the extra its not about money its about manhood an indrawn breath full of rage a scuffling like cornel was finding his feet jane tasted something disgusting realized she was inhaling a cobweb full of dead flies cornel was going you sanctimonious fucking awwww from the yard a bright squeak of intense agony piercing violence lighting up the night like an electric storm and jane choking clawing at her mouth was really scared now sweat creaming her forehead trying to meld with the toilet wall breathing through her nose holding her jaw rigid not even daring to spit come and see me again look when your balls drop the guy said this kind of tittering laugh a sound youd swear was the guy clapping cornel on the back in a dont take it to heart kind of way departing footsteps light and casual in the alley but in the yard there was only retching and then cornel going shit shit shit shit like he was walking round in circles while jane clung to the jagged stones in the toilet wall her head ballooning with a suffocating nausea shit shit shit from the alleyway now receding cornel had gone jane sprang away from the wall coughing out the cobweb and the flies coughing and coughing wiping her mouth on her sleeve as she went staggering out into the warm smell of new vomit in the yard she was at the top of the alley where it came out onto the square when she saw cornel again he was on his own dragging the black bin sack across the cobbles like some vagrant he was moving jerkily his body arched jane saw him stop she saw him pick up the plastic sack with both hands his gangly body bending in pain like an insect which had been trodden on cornel dumped the sack into one of the concrete litter bins on the square ramming it in hard before walking crookedly away jane didnt move until he was long gone and the village centre was unusually deserted in the amber of the fake gas lamps beyond the glow gables jutted like cornels chin into a cold windless night sky and the church steeple was moonfrosted as jane moved unsteadily across to the concrete bin get the drummer killed you dont have to take that crap barry said there comes a point where you just you realize you just dont hed come back from the kitchens looking darkfaced angry and that was rare a few more customers had come in since and marion the head barmaid had taken over barry had poured himself a guinness and come to sit with merrily and lol behaving like a servant is one thing being treated like one is something else hed killed a pheasant lol said dont matter none of it matters too much now anyway when the worst happens im not going to be around he got up suddenly unhooked a big black poker turned over the last big apple log and the flames were instantly all over it barry came and sat down rubbing soot from his hands the worst merrily said i apologize barry drank some guinness wiped his lips almost delicately on a white pocket handkerchief theres no reason at all for me not to tell you savitch is buying the swan pool balls plinked off one another in the public lol put down his pencil when you think about it it was only a matter of time barry said i didnt lols voice was parched the swans for sale way things are now laurence any pubs for sale every day somewhere in britain another one shuts down merrily stared into the fire after christmas it had become known that the black swans elderly owner had handed it over to her son who ran a building firm the building trade would revive but the future for pubs savitch put in an initial offer last week barrys voice was flat ridiculously low and it got turned down of course but that was just round one hell be back whys he doing this lol said why not just you know live here hes a businessman the place you live you want it to look like an enterprise not a losers refuge this cant happen lol said it could happen tomorrow mate if he doubles his bid which im sure he can afford to but i think hell wait what can we do merrily said pray what are his plans exactly village is set to grow maybe hes on a promise all too friendly with councillor pierce these days barry leaned his chair back against an oak pillar where a wall had once divided the bar into two rooms end of the day were just the little people these things dont happen on our level do they i mean the word is hell ask me to stay on but thats not for me im so sorry barry nah ill be all right not sure about ledwardine though barry settled into his chair evidently more relaxed now it was out so whats the problem with syd spicer then merrily didnt think you wanted to talk about him i didnt now suddenly it seems like light relief one of your lot now last i heard actually one of your lot again been made chaplain at credenhill has he now you didnt know they dont put out a newsletter chaplain eh padre well well barry could i ask you something in general about the regiment barry shrugged his jacket tightening a sleeve rising to expose a purplish scar snaking up his wrist from the palm of his left hand im sorry if it nah nah just its usually teenage boys how many men you killed how many times you been tortured it can get wearing just that syd once told me he said there was a kind of mysticism in the regiment his word oh i see this is about the things you do on the side much of the time barrys broad face was smooth and bland but his eyes were the eyes of a far thinner warier man maybe a colder man he sucked some froth from his guinness not quite sure what you mean by mysticism theres a lot of myths merrily waited the old apple log was well alight and it felt warmer in here now almost like old times but this was the last good log what can i tell you barry said thereve been geezers i knew up against a wall whove prayed their hearts out and the wall never moved know what i mean and theres a bloke i know survived against all the odds and hes seen it as a miracle and gone hallelujah praise the lord bornagain what about superstition rabbits feet not treading on the cracks in the minefield barry shook his head minimally small obsessions can get you hurt fear of the unknown you dont give in to it if youre in a tight situation personal fears take a back seat because youre concentrating on how to deal with it what if its something a man knows he cant get at im wondering at what stage he would think he was going mad blimey barry said whats this about only generally speaking we dont do mad all right what id say is you might start by eliminating the possibility of there being say something in the water practical stuff and when youve eliminated the rational the hallucin atory we talking about syd here only hes a bleedin vicar not all vicars feel able to take the funny stuff on board dont all take god on board any more at what stage do you think he might seek help on a mission you rely on your mates your gang the circumstances would have to be very special for you to venture outside you read franks book frank collins should have shouldnt i frank collins former curate at st peters hereford exsas occasionally spoken of among hereford clergy warily wish id known him merrily said but he was dead before i came here by his own hand gassed himself in his car shed heard it said that hed become depressed after writing the book about his time in the sas and his conversion to christianity it hadnt been well received by the regiment not the clergy some weird stuff in that book barry said how god spoke to him through the radio theres one tale in there of a guy who knows his best mates bought the farm in the falklands on account of hes appeared to him in his house thousands of miles away all dripping wet made me shiver a bit that i served with them both frank too blondie we called him ill read it did start it once but life intervened did erm did frank collins find the same level of support in the church as he had in the sas evidently not barry said i see in the regiment you rely on your mates not only because theyre your mates but because each of yous got special skills abilities the others respect he looked at lol like in a band only a band where if you forget your chords you might get the drummer killed good analogy lol said im guessing we dont like to rely on guesswork barry said some nights lol would just go back to the vicarage with merrily for coffee or hot chocolate this wasnt going to be one of them they both knew that as they walked out onto cobbles already slick with black ice almost touching not quite they never publicly held hands in ledwardine not even after dark a few icy stars were out over cole hill a wreath of them above the church steeple merrily shivered with cold and unease watching lol beside her head down the lyrics pad under an arm a hole in an elbow of his gomer parry sweatshirt the ledwardine village musician one day playing music the next following a jcb down to the riverbank with a hand shovel she could almost hear his thoughts echoing across the cobbles what kind of fantasy is this lol had never really been much of a pub guy didnt drink much didnt play darts or pool didnt have mates it was only after his christmas concert at the swan that hed achieved a degree of openness in ledwardine after hed been lured out to play his music in front of his neighbours and now ive agreed with barry to do a few more gigs here at the swan and maybe something outside in the summer if savitch cant get it cheap enough he might not bother merrily said at the entrance to church street i mean whats he going to do with it anyway to make it show a decent profit on his scale wishing as soon as it was out like with a lot of things shed said tonight that shed kept quiet you know exactly what hell do lol said hell make it into some kind of apresshoot retreat for his corporate clients and for all the wives and girlfriends who dont want to stay in a chalet however luxurious on a muddy farm hell build up the restaurant and double the prices itll just regularize things they stood and contemplated the clutch of lights down church street where the holiday homes sixteen at the last count would be in darkness until easter weekend one of the for sale notices had acquired a crossstrip saying sold had savitch bought that too merrily saw lol bent over his guitar in a corner his music drowned out by the laughter of loudvoiced faux rural thugs they look out from their penthouses across all the lights lol said and they cant see it but they know its there all those thousands of square miles of it all dark and empty it just it starts to irritate them theyre thinking whats it doing were the masters of the universe why isnt it giving us anything merrily was nodding gloomily had it ever been otherwise since norman kings designated thousands of acres as hunting ground great slabs of it going to the barons who settled and grew in their brutal way to love it and eventually became the old squirearchy the bulls and the bulldavieses until they in turn started to lose it under the weight of inheritance taxes leaving it prey to the new money savitch cycles of exploitation the last fake gas lamp on the square was behind them now a merciful mesh of shadows claiming them for its own lol brought out the keys to the terraced cottage where lucy devenish used to live the folklorist the guardian of the soul of the village janes first mentor i suppose what gets me lol said is that most people dont seem to mind the first time somebody off the tv comes to stay at the swan bit of glamour theyre all in favour of it its brought the village alive but not in the right way a bit of glamour merrily said maybe we all need that her eyes felt damp lol held open the front door for her inside the wood stove was burning a surprising terracotta red merrilys black woollen top was off before they reached the sofa an island in the night actually i do think he did it bliss said whats wrong with that its me job to suspect people staring up at the plaster moulding around the bedroom ceiling the curtains were undrawn you could see blurry lights in the big houses on the hillside across the road cosy an upstairs flat in a classy victorian villa set back from the main road out of great malvern bliss liked it here at the moment more than anywhere especially his crappy semi on the flat side of hereford ok if he was called out in the night itd take him maybe forty minutes to get back and hed need to leave at seven am anyway but it was worth it wasnt it francis you annie howe peering at him her eyes all soft and woolly and useless without her contacts it was worth it just for that you cant simply accuse a man of murder because he doesnt like you sometimes i dont like you you can be an intensely annoying person part of me appeal annie bliss watched a light go out across the road and then the hillside was as blank as those years of mutual blind distrust fasttrack annie manhating bitch daughter of councillor charlie howe excopper bent all the poison darts bliss had aimed at her back why should she like him he felt unexpectedly flimsy what was she supposed to see in a twat who couldnt hold anything together not his job not his family like kirsty said you never did put yourself out much did you frank true in a way he and annie had fallen into bed within days of kirsty leaving both coasting on the euphoria of a crucial result a key arrest a cop thing how much staying power was there in that whats the matter annie said chris says you consistently neglected your wife inspector francis she moved away from him shed put her nightdress back on all creased she was his superior bettereducated betterconnected betterlooking coat hanger with tits was stagg blind we said when this began that thered be no analysis annie said softly one day at a time we also said that but there were no days only nights cover of darkness cover of christmas it should have been his emptiest christmas ever instead hed spent the days in work the nights with annie in january they were spending two nights a week together one at her place one at his annie parking around the corner walking all muffled up to the back door were all right shed said as long as nobody finds out as long as were never seen together as long as we dont go out together as long as we dont ever do that thing where you drive a hundred miles into wales or somewhere and have lunch and walk by the river because theres always some bloody copper who used to be in this division on holiday bliss cleared his throat badly wanting to tell annie about kirsty get her input see if she had any idea at all who mightve rumbled them but annies job was as important to her as his was to him if he told her shed restrict their meetings and he couldnt stand that because this was the only thing preventing him exploding into gases and shrapnel right then francis in the glacial light from the street lamps he saw that shed arranged two pillows against the bedhead sitting back into them a nipples areola vanishing back into the white cotton reaching to the bedside table and finding her glasses and putting them on to watch him across the postmidnight greyness return of the ice maiden tell me about sollers bull she said gut feelings were no longer encouraged no place for them in teamwork even bliss was suspicious of gut feelings other peoples anyway see even when i was talking to him i could feel it i could see him in a pair of them green nylon overalls that farmers wear for mucky jobs pulling them off i suppose as he ran through the fields into the headlights of our correspondent and his girlfriend i wanted to go back with a warrant to search his house i wanted to talk to his hidden wife maybe she knows maybe she doesnt or maybe she just suspects stay away from her francis until you have something stronger anyway the bottom line is he has an alibi several the staff at his caff its still borderline time of deaths not that certain and its not that far away you didnt see the rage in him something about it that was wrong for the situation skewed anger was always useful for concealing a hole where grief ought to be but it was also a good outlet for the hyper excitement that lived in you for hours after youd done something enormous i was thinking at first that if there was no real pain there it was because half of himd be well chuffed at getting the farm perhaps thats all it was annie said we dont even know he didnt get on with his brother ok different kinds of men the traditionalist and the young progressive university education big ideas enough to cause a rift when he starts shaking off the steadying hand even if they did hate one another whos going to tell you not the family and not the wider community somebody will bliss said always somebody with a grudge a chip we get his dna for purposes of elimination yeh you feel threatened francis me hes put you very much in the firing line a symbol of whats gone wrong with the police in this area urban cop strange as it may seem annie it wasnt that urban where i grew up not then anyway there are fields up there bliss lay back countryside frigging defiance where did that come from i googled them much of its huntingbased aimed mainly id guess at attracting younger people to the cause the trad itional foxhunting image of a retired colonel and camilla parkerbowles as was is not terribly evident on their web site whos behind it dont know theyre also using facebook and twitter sollers bull in hunting pink is a gift goodlooking and a little bit dark and edgy he was always like that oh i didnt know him well but i did know him from his days in the yfc you were in the young farmers i was a young farmers girlfriend for a while he was a friend of sollers this was when i was about sixteen we were at the same parties occasionally he was popular with girls who had more going for them in the looks department than i ever did dont sell yourself short im a realist anyway i didnt know him well enough to get behind the image hes a liar bliss said he was acting on tv just like all those husbands who break down in front of the cameras please find the monster who killed my lovely wife and all the time youre looking at him the lights were all out in the houses on the hillside traffic was sparse bliss had that feeling he used to get as a kid of being on an island in the night it was not unpleasant he did it annie id be very careful at this stage who you share your suspicions with its a small county and bull has friends all over it including my soontobeexfatherinlaw did you know that your inlaws knew sollers bull be surprising if they didnt the farms only ten minutes away and chris symonds has social ambitions always asking me if i was up for promotion annie slid down in the bed a long thigh against his youre obviously up for something annie said overslept it was sixthirty and fully light when the mobile trilled by his side of the bed bliss awoke spooned into annies back experiencing the usual halfshock at whose back this was his hand had barely found his phone before annies phone made its nokia noise on the other side karen yeh bliss said watching annie fumbling for her glasses peering at her screen in blisss phone karen dowell didnt dress it up shit bliss was clawing the sleep out of his eyes where city centre more or less east street a woman you did say a woman no boss i said two part three when i was still young i thought it a great pity to die not that there was anything on earth i wanted to live for julian of norwich revelations of divine love icon just gone eight and the city was stirring irritably under a blotchy brown sky east street sealed off end to end a barrier was moved to one side the tape dropped letting bliss through to where terry stagg was waiting with a blurry excitement on his brickdust face briefly tez two females midtwenties were thinking east european bliss stood in the middle of the street looking down to a private parking area for office workers lawyers hairdressers you could see the screens projecting from behind a blank yellow end wall east street ran narrowly between the city centre and the cathedral close a few discreet shops refurbished terraced housing offices the rear of the shirehall and a lone bijou black and white property used by chiropractors and why are we thinking that apart from general appearance stagg said ones wearing this kind of a locket thing silver with a little religiouslooking picture inside and some foreign words foreign words i was off sick when they ran the course on migrant crime bliss wrinkled his nose thousands of east europeans around the county now mainly honest decent migrant workers a percentage of migrant layabouts and a handful of migrant heavyduty wrongdoers thered been a short course for cops on the kind of societies they came from their favourite crimes the more violent ones usually practised against other migrants who were usually reluctant to give evidence how longs he been here a silver beemer was parked up by the little black and white place the havana cigar box on the dash identifying billy graces urban transport quite a while terry stagg said he likes the ones where he gets noticed the private parking area was almost a little square uneven levels low brick walls and the arseends of buildings in need of repair a weeping birch tree grew incongruously at its centre and its horizons were tarted up by the tower and steeple of st peters and the shirehalls little cupola with its flagpole and union jack this where it happened or were they dumped unlikely terry stagg said blood and gunge over a fairly wide area who found them elderly bloke from over there terry nodding at a modernized brick terrace woke up to screams and yells not long after midnight you mean we actually came out here last night no he didnt report it thought it was kids pissed seems hes complained twice in recent weeks and um no action was taken and you dont go out to remonstrate any more do you i presume the dcis en route bliss said a practised insouciance getting good at this annied given him ten minutes start so they wouldnt be seen arriving together and presumably were knocking on doors those windows overlooking the car park pubs clubs night workers minicab firms and cctv stagg said the whole city centre good bliss said right then lets go and put me off me breakfast turned towards the tape and the canvas and terry handed him the durex suit and they walked down past the offices of the hereford herd book society whatever that meant sollers frigging bull would know most of the video had been shot but they were still taking stills from different angles images to wither your soul breathing in all the degrading smells of violent death bliss heard a man distantly protesting no i work here of course come in early because i have clients how long am i supposed to hang around cant you at least twat bliss said it came out a bit choked up surprising him it wasnt the horror as much as the sad banality the two red shoes shed in different places the blue vinyl handbag sprung open letting out lipsticks and tissues and photos left where theyd fallen he saw a picture of a middleaged couple hand in hand on the edge of a field with a white dog only one handbag slim nothing else here slim fiddler head soco came up like a hippo from a swamp and i cant imagine they shared the first body it was as if shed been thrown like discarded clothing over a low wall maybe the foundation of a demolished outbuilding she was wearing jeans and a black fleece half off a thin arm was draped over the bricks the hand already bagged you could only see one of her eyes it was like sundried tomato looks like the head was banged repeatedly into the sharp edges of the bricks billy grace said the other one is less of a bigproduction number beaming the way only billy grace ever beamed the other one lay a few paces away in a patch of scrubby grass the pink fleece and the way she was halfcurled made her look like a prawn bliss thought a giant prawn for gods sake one hand down between her legs sexual assault probably billy bent down dress ripped here didnt do that herself but the rest of it as you can see is far less frenzied than the other one her face was unmarked it was a dolls face not a babys doll more like one of those russian dolls where one was inside another and so on the hair was brown with gold highlights probably died quite quickly billy grace said id guess she fell back on the corner of that brick see the blood there then perhaps somebody pulled her away let her fall again but the other one fought harder to the end id imagine billy straightened up under his unzipped durex suit he wore a blazer with a badge oldfashioned rugbyclub type not a lone assailant is it bliss said unlikely bliss returned to the first and bloodiest body took a breath and bent to the poor kid examining her neck a few scratches there that was all wheres the locket came off frannie slim fiddler led him to a patch of weeds try not to touch bliss squatted to where the leaves had been parted making eye contact with the virgin mary in light blue and gold the locket was silver tarnished very possibly romanian he said an unusual silence bliss half turned billy grace was peering at him over his halfglasses eyebrows raised bliss scowled piss off billy im norra complete friggin moron its from an icon russian orthodox kind of thing the romanians are big on icons of our of the virgin could have told him how once aged seventeen just hed had to take his ma and his most devoutly catholic auntie to this exhibition of icons in liverpool was it the walker gallery not long after hed passed his driving test anyway so hed been quite happy to relieve the old man of the chore just to get his mitts on the car keys for an afternoon bliss stood up and backed off to view both victims in the context of the location the violence was careless almost impersonal like storm damage theyve been left like rubbish billy like flytipping no attempt at concealment not what rapists do rapists if theyve killed they make some effort to cover up that include gangrapists drunk i dunno somethings not quite right be able to give you a more formal verdict on the sexual aspect later today wont be me billy ill be off back to oldcastle where i might even get left alone for a bit dcill be here soon this is the big one you think so mansel bulls a pillar of the rural community whereas these pitiful young things careful billy im too old to care francis this your mistress now what bliss tensed but didnt look at him up in the street annie howe in her light grey trenchcoat was getting out of her audi bringing her mobile to her ear just a figure of speech that was all not a chance in a million that billy grace knew or even suspected just a frigging stupid flip remark bliss turned his back on the crime scene to walk slowly as if reluctantly towards annie no he said no listen thats not whats gonna happen dont be stupid back in the audi bliss in the passenger seat all the windows up annie behind the wheel no makeup bliss hunched himself up against the passenger door explicit body language for anybody watching he didnt want to be here with this woman apart from anything you know exactly what its gonna look like actually i dont think it will annie said thats the point this is a double murder by any criteria the biggest case its also going to be immensely highprofile controversial and politically sensitive and urban nobodys going to make that distinction francis and anyway its what god wants so we have to live with it shed been talking to the chief on the bluetooth driving here fait accompli fitup the church clock at st peters began to chime the hour annie passed a folded paper across to bliss under dashlevel he stared at her i dont like the friggin guardian its all opera and foreign stuff its the daily mail i had to pick it up on the way here just read it will you sourly bliss opened the paper out to a doublepage spread a panorama of oldcastle farm on its bank above the wye photographed across the fields between bands of police tape rural idyll or killing fields police dont want to know in another picture the countryside defiance banner in the middle of the page a shot of a man sitting with his head in his hands the caption sollers bull shattered if its painful you can skip to the end annie said not sure i can move me reading finger that fast annie turned away tapping the steering wheel slowly with her nails bliss sighed near the bottom of the story it said west mercia police confirmed last night that the detective leading the inquiry di francis bliss is an incomer from merseyside di bliss has been with us for several years now a spokeswoman said and were fully confident both of his ability and the extent of his local knowledge we consider the claims made by countryside defiance to be illfounded and obstructive so just get on with it annie said and be nice to the television people look its the best solution except possibly for me but ill cope two incident rooms you get gaol street ill be taking a caravan over to oldcastle will there be a generator and a primus stove youll also get some extra bodies from worcester and two translators thats been agreed translators wonderful bliss could foresee long hours of watching peoples eyes for traces of guilt while listening to the soundtrack of a foreign film without the subtitles and you can have karen dowell annie howe went on looking out of the windscreen down the length of east street look im adapting to instructions francis its what i do adapt known for it off you go get the bastards before they can leave the country ohthere are two lithuanian nationals in the cells apparently brought in predawn drunk and incapable thatll be a start for you thanks ill eat them later bliss shouldered open the passenger door just remember what i said annie about what you know what bliss stepped out looked up into the sheeny sky scraped with brown clouds like the chickenshit on a newlaid egg annie check him out yeh just check him out who we are despite the metropolitan fantasies of a few powercrazed councillors hereford was still a big village when a very bad thing happened merrily was thinking ordinary life didnt yet accelerate around it something lurched shifted down a gear with east street sealed off traffic concertinaed it had taken her ten minutes to get from the top of broad street to the cathedral gatehouse you could walk it in two shed left the old volvo in the bishops palace yard meeting one of the canons jim waite who explained what had happened slaughter was the word hed used he hadnt said where the hell is god in this up in the gatehouse office sophie was at the window gazing down into broad street then across the cathedral green towards church street both of them linked into the hitherto more obscure east street the killings must have happened close to the centre of herefords medieval triangle of big churches all saints st peters the cathedral an alleyway linked east street directly to the cathedral close winding past the house once occupied by alfred watkins the antiquarian and where the hell was god a question that the previous owner had pencilled into the margin of her secondhand copy of frank collinss baptism of fire the book shed been reading till after one am itll become commonplace here sooner than we know merrily sophie turned sharply away from the window her glasses swinging on their chain like birmingham and manchester societys losing all cohesion she went to sit down at her desk shed had her hair cut shorter for spring too soon as it had turned out she was still wearing the winter cardie long after its time she looked unusual for sophie lost one only has to look into the hopeless faces of the drunks in bishops meadow lost souls in a purgatory of disillusion and charity shops both sophies hands were placed flat on the desk as if for stability i have no doubt that the vast majority are decent people trying to earn an honest living but theyre not the ones who create the need for a policeman almost fulltime on the door at tesco she looked down at herself dear god stop me merrily questioning the impact of social change isnt quite the same as joining the british national party merrily said sophie winced and we dont know whats happened yet do we merrily said we dont know if its a sexual thing or a robbery or a private matter a private matter thats just it isnt it sophie said we dont know what theyve brought with them we dont understand what kind of demons drive them and we do need to because were not london were a country town we know who we are or we always used to now one can feel a a weight of silent resentment and an apprehension but that merrily had been about to say that it wasnt exactly new in the middle ages thered been resentment in the city about the increasing jewish community even the revered bishop thomas cantilupe railing against them no forget it she wandered over to the window looked down at the cathedral green seasons slowly shifting out there winter retiring into the mist spring blinking warily in the tepid sunshine then the clouds took it away and she saw a lone daffodil still in bud flattened by someones shoe the bishops been quiet lately hes increasingly tired i think hell probably hang on until the autumn then well hear something sophie stood up ill make some tea ive itemized your calls in terms of apparent priority three inquiries in the past week none of which i felt you needed to be alerted about ones that rather querulous person who seems to think you can get her grandson off heroin by exorcizing his inner junkie ive taken the precaution of quietly alerting her parish priest and suggesting she talks it over with him thank you merrily sat down nothing from the holmer a fortnight ago shed been called out to a single space in a factory parking area where a manager newly divorced had like poor frank collins asphyxiated himself in his car several workers had claimed that theyd felt him sitting next to them in their own cars if they parked there the local vicar had dismissed it as hysteria nothing sophie shook her head filling the kettle in fact you really didnt need to come in well i came in because i need to make a possibly tricky phone call for some reason it was easier from here like you had the weight of the cathedral around you and sophie to consult pretty much the same thing its syd spicer now at credenhill ah yes sophie said how long have you known since the bishop approved it its been announced now has it you were inclined to forget that her principal role was as the bishops lay secretary guardian of episcopal secrets ive been a bit naive about all this sophie until a few days ago it didnt strike me that to become a chaplain you had to actually join the army or rejoin yes thats a requirement problem well i suppose i can tell you we were in two minds about his suitability since leaving the city for credenhill the regiment does seem to have become more remote from us not even in the same parliamentary constituency so hereford technically is no longer a garrison town appointing one of their own as chaplain makes them more remote sophie said nothing merrily looked at the phone much of the incentive had gone she looked up at sophie ok can i tell you about this lol had had to force himself to go back to work this morning couldnt bear to finish the one about the village musician who found recovery in the back of a jcb when the knock came on the front door he was messing with the lyrics for the simple trackway man one he was trying to persuade danny to sing a homage to alfred watkins the hereford man who discovered ley lines i am a simple trackway man who walks the lanes by ancient plan leading the people from beacon to steeple and steeple to stone and all the way home back in the s mr watkins controversially had traced possible crosscountry tracks connecting prehistoric ritual sites stones and circles and burial mounds and the medieval churches built on ancient sacred enclosures most of his research had been done in his home county and dannys native radnorshire unlocking the british countryside for future generations who wanted to connect again with the land janes hero lols song had been written carefully in the vernacular borrowing material from watkinss classic work the old straight track he was quite proud of it a song that shouldve been written decades ago to be sung in folk clubs and on village greens at whitsuntide or by chains of walkers stepping out to refresh themselves and the countryside at easter mr watkins as some unassuming lowkey pied piper of the border hills sitting on his sofa with the boswell across his knees lol sang trackway man to the wood stove glowing ashy pink against the morning sunlight across the fields where gates align ole scarecrow gives us all a sign where stand of pine marks sacred shrine and secret dell hides holy well he saw the man in the cap walk past the front window didnt take much notice and it was about half a minute before the knock came as if the man had walked past the door towards the village square and then either had remembered something or had second thoughts and turned back answering the front door lol didnt recognize him at first he wore a rustcoloured gilet and a leather cap incomer wear nothing unusual he had his chin up and his hands behind his back he had a quick efficient smile lol robinson yes my partner introduced me tyour music oh right the hand came out a leather glove removed ward savitch is this convenient too much reticence can be counterproductive sophie said you deserve at least an explanation they were looking at the sas base on google earth half surprised to find it there this unexpectedly large network of utility buildings parked vehicles a community probably bigger if more compact than the village of credenhill you pulled back and the wide view was all open countryside apart from the wooded slopes of the hill itself close enough to overlook the base you feel like youre breaking the official secrets act just doing this sophie like theyre going to know and the door will fly open and men will be there with automatic rifles sophie looked severe when they were at the old stirling lines they were part of the city part of the community mrs thatcher liked to call them her boys but essentially they were our boys part of hereford since the regiment was formed in thats a long time but the glamour years only began in the s after the sas had travelled from hereford to rescue hostages in the iranian embassy in london abseiling down the walls from the roof live on tv and we were always discreet merrily when a new recruit came off the train and asked for directions to the army base he wasnt told ive heard that we all knew where it was but we didnt tell just anyone the regiment was inside the city itself but it was anonymous and yet a presence like the cathedral call spicer sophie said abruptly he used you im tired of seeing people used merrily looked at her curious was she thinking that nobody had been murdered on the streets of hereford when the sas was still in town she picked up the phone put in the number huw had given her and was almost grateful when there was no answer no machine no voicemail last night shed told lol about syd at the chapel lol had met him once at the end of a very dark night in the malverns when syd had been very much in denial merrily had said you really dont see anything bordering on the paranormal and syd had said you mean you do she let his phone ring for half a minute before hanging up tried twice more before lunch and also called home to see if there were any messages on the machine sometimes if shed had to leave early jane would leave one for her jane whose mood last night when merrily had got in from the swan had been changing like traffic lights flickering erratically redamberredamber like shed wanted to talk about something but couldnt said nothing this morning either and you wondered if it would be better or worse when she went to university not that merrily had wanted to talk last night better not to mention savitchs bid to buy the swan until it actually happened with the vague hope that it wouldnt sophie in canon dobbss day was there ever any involvement with the sas back then in what way i dont know im just wondering if theres any precedent i can check the records perhaps it wouldnt be there if there was anybody less forthcoming than the sas it was dobbs so the combination of the two sophies smile was transient and it probably wasnt nostalgia at twelve they switched on the radio for the national news headlines and for the first time since new year merrily heard the nasal tones of frannie bliss horrific crime and we wanna talk to anybody who was in or near the centre of the city last night between the hours of eleven and one am doesnt matter whether or not they think theyve seen anything significant they may still have information that could be useful to us frannie how was he doing merrily had invited him round for a meal a couple of times since his marriage had finally collapsed both times hed said he was busy the phone rang and sophie turned the radio off gatehouse a pause the cathedral gatehouse in hereford who is this sophie listened an eyebrow rose fractionally ah one moment she put the call on hold merrily said me picked you up on from credenhill syd his wife sophie said mrs spicer im putting you through to mrs watkins what did she know about fiona spicer very little except that sas wives who survived the course were rarely insubstantial women i think we almost met once in the malverns my names yes i realize who you are now voice low and steady and not exactly friendly neutral southernenglish accent merrily pulled the silk cut packet from her bag stood it on the desk in front of her sophie frowned i ran into syd a few days ago im sorry i didnt realize you were back with him christ what did this sound like merrily stared at the packet extracting a spiritual cigarette im not back with him mrs watkins this is a visit is erm is syd there no merrily waited after a couple of seconds the silence suggested that mrs spicer had gone no a mobile shed picked up the number from the house phone but she was calling back on a mobile merrily looked at sophie back behind her desk making no pretence of doing anything but listening mrs spicer its the first time ive used the credenhill number i got it from huw owen my spiritual director syd consulted him and indirectly me about something and i just wanted to follow up on it did you something wrong here merrily lit the spiritual cigarette sometimes it worked do you erm know where he is mrs spicer he cant be far away his cars here you are at the house im at the house yes the army house hell be across the road attending to his flock fortunately hes not very sas when it comes to hiding spare keys so i was able to go in and take a look around first time youve been to this house yes im in the garage now syd said youd be moving in soon no response mrs spicer my husband worked with you once before mrs spicer said your name and number are written inside a book entitled deliverance a book much thumbed pages folded over that would make sense but you havent spoken to him today no a silence then mrs watkins somethings disturbing me would it be possible for us to meet of course should i come over perhaps i should come to you im staying in hereford at a b and b youre at the cathedral are you in the gatehouse above the entrance to the bishops palace id rather come to the cathedral itself wheres quiet do you know the lady chapel i can be there in about half an hour the dead line was for real this time sophie was sitting on the edge of the desk pale and watchful as a barn owl on a branch merrily handed her the phone to hang up liberal of the old school when dc david vaynor came in all seven feet of him if you included the big hair bliss was waiting for the pictures of the dead to come up on his laptop cleanedup pictures of the cleanedup dead done before the pm before the craniums came off pictures you could show to people with no loss of breakfast we mightve got them boss dc vaynor said shut the door son bliss closed his lappie vaynor ducking into the office despite being a cambridge honours graduate or some such and wearing a tweedy sports jacket he wasnt a bad lad locally born working class good contacts where they counted maybe these sloppy old sports jackets were all he could get to fit him right then go on goldie andrews boss on the plascarreg couldnt be that easy darth could it goldies been scuttling around the estate asking if anyones seen her lodgers female lodgers sisters whered this come from the new launderette at the front of the plas my cousins wife it is runs that good boy names marinescu maria and ileana jesus that sounds right the escu bit bliss began tapping lightly on the lid of his lappie how long they been missing just the one night not normally a cause for upset except they dont do things like that also its rent day and apparently they owe goldie for two weeks i just rang her up to confirm took it straight to sergeant wilton and he said to come in and tell you right away goldies lodgers yes bliss came to his feet the bottom line here being that its not exactly unusual for goldies lodgers to be on the game is it unusual for them not to be on the game she know they might be dead she will by now its all over the radio tv internet right then bliss pulled his jacket from the chair lets go and have a chat they can send the piccies to me phone he beamed nice one darth write yourself out a commen dation cheers boss do you um want me to yeh yeh come along but i might just go in on me own at first to chat to goldie walking out almost bumping into karen dowell thing is that woman owes me quite a bit karen boss we have a reliable sighting in the grapes in church street from halfnine and then the monks head tennish lovely get elly to put out an appeal for anybody who saw them in either karen me and darths off to goldies on the plas if you could tell brian wilton it looks like well need forensics and when the pictures come in from the morgue could you get them sent to me phone known inevitably as the plascarreg hilton it had once been a row of s brickbuilt terraced houses here before there was an estate goldie had got the first for peanuts renting out the bedrooms to working girls buying out the neighbours one by one as the new estate got developed at the bottom of their backyards and the value of the houses sank the sign outside said abbey view possibly referring to belmont abbey which you were unlikely to see from anywhere on the plascarreg without a platform crane although on a clear day you could spot the tesco tower bliss let goldie weep for a while two weeks rent shed never see that wasnt funny eventually she looked up over her lace hanky with the border of red flowers like little blood spots shoulda knowed soons i seen it was you at the door nothings set in stone yet goldie yous the angel of death you are boy couple of years now since two teenage boys in a stolen transit had booked in for the night paying in advance with hot cash from an armed robbery at a petrol station in the forest of dean two boys one seventeen one fifteen and a bottle of gordons oh and an old revolver with which theyd played russian roulette and at just after three in the morning one had lost i never said you wasnt understanding mind goldie said how long the girls been with you goldie four five months goldie set light to a rollup we connected straight off see the roma what oh yeh romany romania who knew goldies origins were obscure shed come down from a caravan in the black mountains before that it was a caravan somewhere in the south wales valleys some element of gypsy back there you could see it all over the living room the brass ornaments and the illustrated plates and the gilt pendulum clocks we had a goldie mouthed the ciggy touched forefingers in the air like that we was the cig waggling movin in yere it was like comin home her kept sayin that her did who maria was it goldie pulled out the ciggy ruby and emerald rings winking breathed out some suspiciously herbal smoke sheve got the best english she dos the talking so they were here for the winter yeh in summer goldie did b amp b difficult to imagine anybody wanting to spend a holiday on the plascarreg but then there were holidays and holidays in winter it was longstay guests cheap deals all meals out bliss watched the skin around goldies eyes crinkling like bits of old bath sponge lord above mr francis this cant be right theys good girls of course a liberal of the old school all goldies girls were good girls blisss iphone was buzzing gissa sec goldie no message just the pictures which somehow when viewed on his phone made him feel like a sick voyeur snuffporn goldie im gonna have to ask you to take a look at a couple of photos i ent their ma youre all right weve had them you know prettied up a bit oh dear lord goldie breathed in slow and phlegmy then pulled her glasses from their electricblue plastic case bliss flicked from one pic to the other a couple of times and chose the least horrible goldie pushed her unlikely blonde ringlets behind her ears and he handed her the iphone take your time sitting next to her on the old studio couch slabs of polished wood somehow coffincoloured set into the armrests waiting for her nod and then flicking to the other picture which was not so nice because of the eye given time theydve found a glass eye bliss counted five clocks ticking before goldie leaned back and crossed herself which is which goldie the one with the eye thats maria the one with the english lord above whats happenin to this town when dyou last see them im not sure yesterday morning they left i dunno about ten to go where whered they go when they left here town wheres anybody go they say where in town just town was they interfered with where would they go at night pubs clubs i dont know they only goes out one night a week safer yere we all knows each other on the plas they got any family anywhere in this country goldie shook her head none come over to work on the strawberries ennit figured thousands of them came across from eastern europe to work in the polytunnels last year goldie nodded and didnt go back a lot dont what did they do after that did they get more work this and that they work for you goldie bit of housework i mean outside work goldies eyes were narrowing ive always tried to help you mr francis and i think its been mutual if not more than mutual and in case you forget this is a mairder investigation bliss leaning on his accent were norall that interested in lifting anybody for minor stuff they never done no outside work for me never not even when they ran out of cash and couldnt pay the rent you never suggested how they might pick up a few quick twenties apiece im tellin you they done cleaning work an that was it where used to be at one of the stores on the barnchurch the factoryoutlet place you know wasnt fulltime and then they got let go when was that when it closed down yeh that would figure when bout a month ago all right ill ask yer again any reason to think they mightve been doing night work freelance they wouldnt im tellin you they was religious girls what about friends they have friends among other east europeans not many fars i know boyfriends no attractive girls goldie no boyfriend i knows of they went around together they looked out for each other all right bliss stood up lets see their rooms room they had one room between them he followed her into the hallway two neighbouring hallways once the dividing wall turned into an archway a reception desk in one corner had a steel grille to the ceiling well this was the plascarreg one staircase had been taken out so the other was isolated in the middle hollywood baronial anybody else in residence just now goldie its quiet it is we got a few comin in for easter anybody staying here in the past week occasional onenighter and the odd onehourer goldie was like she hadnt heard the bedroom doors had big plastic numbers they went from room three to room five bliss noticed room four was where theyd had to scrape teenage brain cells off the ceiling superstitious old girl goldie she led him along a corridor with three different carpets stopped at room seven unlocked the door with her master bliss put out an arm were gonna stay in the doorway goldie nobody goes in till crimescene gets here this ent no crime scene mr francis i objects to that its just that well need to examine all their things very carefully yeh its likely whoever attacked them it was a random thing but it may not be we also need the passports papers all that sort of stuff we need to find the relatives the room had dingy yellow walls two beds two single wardrobes but it was tidy there were two holdalls with shoulder straps under the window bliss keen to get inside them but he didnt move a wardrobe door was open the clothes he could see looked clean new even what sort of girls were they goldie all right good girls but polite tidy you can do better that that you have long chats with your guests oldfashioned nights with the tarot im a people person its why i opens my house if they had worries theyd confide in you i likes to think so course they had worries they worried about their family back home they was expected to send money back but there was never enough not what they expected i done readins set their minds at rest on the window sill was a small framed picture of a couple on a sofa smiling the window overlooked a playground a swing with the chains cut off near the top so it looked like a gallows you know what im after goldie they didnt have no enemies if thats what youre gettin at how could girls like that have was they messed with you can tell me that good question i cant actually bliss said not yet but we do think there might be more to it you said they worked on a strawberry farm which one couple i think one out near ledbury but they left because of the you know gettin pushed around and messed about messed about how you know what conditions is like in these places next thing to slave labour they was passing out and if they asked for water they got it in an ole petrol can disgustin theyre supposed tove cleaned up their act bliss said cautious the worst ones you believe that youll believe anythin maria she told me one of the other farms there was a woman raped by two of the foremen took in a shed and raped but nobody reported it course nobody reported it they knows their place they got no status young fellers they dint do what they was told they got the shit beat out of them and the women was raped less they gived it up willin them as gived it up willin got the easier work you mustve heard what goes on everybody had heard the stories karen dowell had come close once to getting a polish girl to give evidence against this albanian minibus driver who was demanding a weekly blow job for getting her to work on time then shed disappeared they could disappear very easily bliss said so the girls got out they moved to that place out on the brecon road magnum magnis a complex chime went off downstairs bliss thought it was one of the clocks doorbell goldie said could be my lads so they moved to magnis to be near hereford coincidence was a lovely thing but maybe this wasnt much of one it was a small county and magnis was close to the city when was this goldie last summer they stay the course this time the bell went again i better let your men in goldie said theyll wait they left there too goldie said the sisters something happen to them i dont know were they staying here when they worked at magnis or did they live at the camp at the camp they come yere when they left she didnt look at him i felt sorry for them i did they wanted to go home they was thinking how to raise enough cash to go home ill go down let your mates in bliss waited at the top of the stairs looking at the holdalls one pink one tartan never had liked strawberries ground to air the lady chapel was a serene shrine to motherhood recently renovated in quiet golds muted tints the gilded panels of its altar screen illustrating the domestic life of the blessed virgin mary merrily was alone someone had left a newspaper on a chair todays telegraph folded at the killing fields of middle england she picked it up sat down next to a madonna and child panel where the infant jesus had the face and the haircut of a middleaged estate agent did one killing make them killing fields and when did the welsh border become middle england the paper had been left here as if it was part of the countryside defiance campaign fortress hereford all farm doors locked at nightfall and dont expect any help from the police something not right about this why were people erecting fences spreading panic answer they werent local people local people were cautious but they didnt panic there was a colour picture of mansel bulls brother sollers in hunting pink and then downpage a small shot of frannie bliss caught sideon getting out of his car the nowtrademark dark blue beanie covering his closemown thinning hair at the foot of the story it said di bliss who came to hereford from merseyside could not be contacted last night but a spokeswoman west mercias brief quote in support of its officer was lukewarm a formality bastards merrily tossed the paper back onto the chair maybe the woman in green goretex had seen the annoyance on her face shed stopped a few paces away merrily stood up oh im sorry i didnt hear you coming shoulderlength straight dark hair under a black woolly hat cursory makeup she lowered a leather shoulder bag to the flags turned candid brown eyes on merrily youre angry mmm yeah well me too fiona spicer said it was about surviving marriage to a man who would vanish overnight usually for weeks at a time and sometimes she didnt know where in the world he was or why or when shed see him again or if exciting boyfriends for a while fiona spicers voice was thoughtful and seldom lifted but as husbands problematical most people this mightve been small talk icebreaking stuff the partners little quirks how fiona had known syd before he joined the army how theyd met on holiday a teenage seaside romance exchanging letters for a couple of years before they even saw each other again and it got no better for more than half my marriage my husbands keeping secrets from me me and the rest of the country where hes going what hes doing there theyd moved to the corner near the votive stand where three candles were alight i thought all that was over when he left the army but part of them doesnt leave ever hed keep going to the window as if he was looking for a reason to walk out sometimes id wake up in the night and hed be at the window in the dark they come out of the regiment at forty is that right at sams level you get a hazy kind of honeymoon period before they start wondering what theyre for if their life has meaning any more fiona took off her wool hat laid it on her knees i suppose i was luckier than most just a few months of agonizing before he hit god like a groundtoair missile syd gods warrior all gunfire and smoke as if saving a soul was the same as rescuing a civilian from terrorists he did settle down eventually probably as a result of emily going off the rails you must be relieved all thats over one problem ends another opens up suddenly its like the old days again secrecy lies obfuscation because hes back in credenhill he was never at credenhill but yes back to the regiment assuring me it was going to be entirely different this time first and foremost hed be a priest and that would be different i almost believed the bastard then the curtain came down again the vagueness the false optimism everythings fine everythings going to be all right and you know he means afterwards after what you tell me mrs watkins sam kept your number in his car sam oh samuel dennis spicer sd thus syd fiona was gazing up at the sanctuary the virgin at home two elderly couples filed through an oak door in the richly panelled screen to the right the audley chantry the thomas traherne chapel now recreated to honour in new stained glass the seventeenthcentury poet and celebrant of the mystical welsh border countryside who had also as it happened been vicar of credenhill did he know you were coming here merrily said to credenhill i rang last weekend suggesting i might come over get things organized and there was immediate resistance oh there were things he needed to do to it it was still in a mess well i like a mess gives me a sense of purpose hell im supposed to be living there in a few weeks no he didnt know i was coming compliance is an essential virtue for a regiment wife but im fiftyone for christs sake ive been through that phase so you went to see syd without giving any indication that you were coming it was easier in the old days when they were in hereford all that high fencing like a prison but it was still in the city credenhill you feel more exposed still i found the house easily enough end of the row near a little wood fiona had parked the car gone up and knocked on the door ready for syd saying this really wasnt convenient and maybe she could come back in a couple of hours but there was no answer fiona had her hands in the pockets of her jacket like sophie she was overdressed for the weather even a scarf as if shed learned from experience that you couldnt trust signs of warmth so you let yourself in merrily said i know where he hides things like spare keys not under the step and i didnt do anything furtive which always gets noticed the two couples came out of the audley chantry and canon jim waite appeared said hi merrily and then guided the visitors into the lady chapel merrily nodded at the chantry door why dont we go in there ill tell you what i know she talked about syd at the brecon chapel sitting in the shadows asking no questions and afterwards at huws rectory that unconvincing airy optimism its going to be all right its working out how theyd decided she and huw that there was probably a security aspect to whatever was troubling syd always a good getout fiona said and thats it is it theres a bit more he phoned huw yesterday to inquire about certain deliverance procedures they were on separate wooden benches merrily by the windows fiona by the door staring bleakly into a stainedglass starburst godface of blinding white let me get this right deliverance is exorcism yes to get rid of spiritual evil sometimes syd suggested to huw that an old evil had come back to haunt him would you have any idea what that might be there was a book dealing with it deliverance it was with two other books on the back seat of his car in the garage the car wasnt locked which is how i got your number fiona hadnt answered the question merrily didnt push it fiona said syd had told her the credenhill house was a mess but it had actually been very tidy everything in its place not the places fiona would have put things but all very neat hed lied to keep her away why not another woman hedve told me her face was flushed but only by the sun through the firework blaze of extreme stained glass the new thomas traherne windows four of them were small and ferocious with individual dominant colours the almighty white the crucifixion red the pagan green you never enjoy the world aright traherne had writtentill you are clothed in the heavens and crowned with the stars you had the impression that it had been a long time since fiona had found anything in the world to enjoy i made myself some tea she said sat down in the living room for a while thinking hed be back when he didnt come back i started to look around some of it you could come back to the house and take a look if you wanted to if you have the time if hes back he wont be overjoyed to see me there if hes back he can bloody well live with it no raising of the voice just a hoarse furtongued undertow thick with history fiona was looking into the second window which had an ephemeral christ figure in a shaft of light arms wide head bowed crucified without a cross do you know anything about the house merrily asked who lived there before i mean theyre not old houses are they its army housing end of a row detached you think theres something wrong with the house it might be one explanation if it was a house where perhaps people couldnt settle where successive occupants felt unhappy had marital problems sickness then new people living there might well get a sense of that youre so matteroffact about all this arent you fiona shook her head slowly as if her senses were adjusting to the atmosphere of another planet im familiar with it thats all merrily said but syd didnt have much patience with any of it out of his comfort zone they dont do comfort fiona said neither do i but im sorry this is beyond reason this is mad what did you find fiona unwound her scarf as if it was choking her the green glow of the end window lit the side of her face making her look faintly sick i went upstairs if it was going to be my home i had every right have to work out where to put the furniture much of which is still in store sure the house has three bedrooms two were full of boxes of stuff waiting to be unpacked the master bedroom well it was empty as if it had been burgled or something no clothes in the wardrobe and the dressing table all the drawers had been pulled out as far as theyd go all empty i see in the green window a figure possibly the poet traherne himself was running along a path towards a conical wooded hill fiona was slowly winding the ends of her scarf around her hands pulling it tight that means something to you it might go on the mirror had a dust cloth draped over it although there was no visible dust the whole room was extremely clean and bare the bed had been pulled away from the wall almost into the middle of the floor the bedclothes pulled back but not removed ohand there was no carpet it had been rolled up and put into one of the other bedrooms and there was a trail of white making a circle around the bed salt a lot of salt how did you know salts part of the mix for holy water sprinkled during a clearance an exorcism if you like but it can also be used on its own christ anything else and on the wall opposite the window there was a large wooden cross id never seen before probably to catch the first rays of the morning sun sams never done much of that crosses and pictures nothing ostentatious he says you should hold whatever you have in your your heart the only thing he used to keep in the bedroom was his bible not a gideontype bible in the bedside cabinet this was a massive old family bible half the size of a paving slab an heirloom no he bought it just before he was ordained symbolic i suppose something big and heavy that you couldnt just slip into your pocket a necessary burden i fiona spread her hands i dont know with sam there were always things you didnt ask it had brass bindings and a lock and he used to keep it on top of the wardrobe and get it down to dust it every sunday the odd thing is that it wasnt there there was nothing on top of the wardrobe not even dust what did you do i got out of there i felt quite cold fiona took both her hands out of her scarf and laid them on top of it her wedding ring was iridescent in the blazing stainedglass light merrily stood up turned to watch the figure that might be thomas traherne moving away along the path up the wooded hill which might be credenhill traherne had been the vicar at the church below the hill she had a strong feeling there was history here that fiona wasnt yet prepared to disclose those things you didnt ask i dont have the knowledge do i how about if i ask them that might be helpful if you dont mind ok merrily picked up her bag your car or mine swab city billy grace had found bruising around the pubic area in both cases but no traces of semen and no internal damage neither maria nor ileana marinescu had been raped or it seemed had recent sex of any kind so was there an attack with intent to rape bliss said to the class or was it something random group of lads coming back from the pub spot these two on their own maybe wander over see whats on offer maybe simply thinking they were prostitutes darth vaynor said they had decent cctv now of the girls entering and leaving the grapes in church street at pm on their own both times nobody following them very drunk presumably the attackers rich ford said the veteran uniform inspector and then it gets progressively out of hand about fifteen of them in the incident room including seven uniforms and slim fiddler and joanna priddy from crimescene rich ford months off retirement glanced over his shoulder cleared his throat perhaps i should mention that while the two lithuanian gentlemen helped into the hospitality lounge in the early hours were completely pissed one vomiting profusely all over the reception desk neither had any blood on him we did manage to talk to them this morning before they were checked out and it was fairly clear that neither of them had seen or at least remembered seeing anything untoward statistics showed overwhelmingly that most crimes against economic migrants in hereford were committed by other migrants maybe retribution for nonpayment of business protection or the required percentage for procurement of employment neither of which seemed to apply to the marinescu sisters however if this is to do with some existing conflict we know nothing about rich said theres likely to be retaliation isnt there could be trouble on the streets tonight and that could give us an in if the girls had been on the game bliss said wed have to consider the possibility that theyd intruded on someone elses street corner or pub of choice or failed to cough up the agreed percentage of their earnings to the pimp which in this case would be goldie darth vaynor said and we dont have any reason to think goldies lying about them not being involved in prostitution slim fiddler grunted less they was doing a foreigner cant be ruled out bliss said or as darth said that somebody thought they were on the game well come back to that lets just deal with the second possible motive robbery turning to brian wilton the office manager who brought up on the monitor a picture of the pale blue handbag found in bishops meadow down by the river a twin to the one bliss had seen in east street contents emptied out brian said wallettype purse found in the cathedral close empty bits of makeup kit also picked up between the cathedral and the river likely to be dna slim fiddler said were still waiting also that lays a bit of a trail bliss went over to the blownup street map tapped it with his pen quickest way from east street to the cathedral close is through this little alleyway almost directly across the street from the car park curves round past the old alfred watkins house into the cathedral grounds we might assume that after killing the marinescu sisters the attackers ran across east street into the alley going through the bag as they went why take only one bag karen dowell said if the other was left in east street and there was a few quid left in the purse i dont think we ever really considered this was about robbery karen im just gerrin it out the way what else any ideas personal rich ford said theyve committed some offence against their family according to goldie andrews they have no known family over here and they didnt mix much with other migrants what about noncompliance darth vaynor said they were invited to work for somebody but being religious they declined and maybe bliss wrinkled his nose have to be more complicated though like that they were threatening to come to us and how often does that happen he waited for more got blank faces they were talking to the romanian authorities but the suggestion so far was as goldie had thought that the marinescu girls were from a fairly rural area and maybe not exactly sophisticated bliss was still pretty sure mind that there was a lot of stuff goldie hadnt told him maybe in connection with the fruit farm time to float this one itll surprise none of you to learn that these girls came over to work in the tunnels in the last instance magnis berries off the brecon road so what do we know about magnis berries all shut when me and terry called in the other day and no particular reason to take it further at that stage silence aw come on children whatve we heard no suicides brian wilton said unlike some similar establishments rumours of intimidation threats bribery think back to the van driver who demanded his weekly blow job for getting a woman to work on time pretty scary for a couple of young lasses from a village in rural romania its a newish establishment karen dowell said they seem to have started up with full knowledge of the kind of reputations that some fruit farms had got themselves for bullying and poor working conditions brought in local people as supervisors i dont suppose they pay any more than the others but were not getting rumours then why did the girls leave we need to find out karen said if were descending on magnis berries thatd be rubbing shoulders with the mansel bull inquiry i believe the farms being extended onto what used to be mr bulls land it is i learned last night that he sold it a month or so ago causing a bit of controversy locally as youd expect absolutely bliss was blinking hard right well not too much is clear at the minute but i still dont expect this to take long weve gorra lorra dna to play with so need i say any excuse to snatch a sample from any bugger we grab it welcome to swab city ok karen assembly over bliss shut the door of his office waved her to the spare chair sat down behind his desk give the bit of controversy indeedy youre going to get overexcited now this is only from my mum right so it might need some more looking into i see mrs dowell as an impeccable source karen karen sighed magnis berries the parent company is in the vale of evesham well established fairly responsible so what you hear or what you dont hear is pretty reliable its still a shit job but nobody at magnis gets a bucket of muddy water thrown over them when they pass out from the heat but just because its not too bad for the wairkers once it gets out that a few hundred migrant workers are going to be housed in huts and caravans creating a new community twice the size of any of the local villages and all the fields spread with plastic youve got trouble and as its now about to almost double in size again double sollers bull agreed to this deal nobody locally knew that ground was even for sale until the deal was done which is not exactly normal procedure if you want to get the best price yeh yeh point is sollers didnt get a chance to disagree the deal was done by mansel bull on the quiet bliss leaned his chair back on two legs his elbows against the wall mansel bull very quietly behind his brothers back sells a chunk of his farm to magnis berries i think it was no more than about twelve acres but he also brokered a deal for three other neighbouring farmers to sell pieces of their land probably for well above the going rate which in a time of deep recession would overcome any resistance they might have the few enemies hed make would just be incomers from off the rosesroundthedoor types and sollers sollers came round karen said it was me id be nursing a grudge the size of wales boss bear with me he like physically came round to magnis berries i mean quite often oh hell look this is from my mum right and if it ever got out she was the source shed lose her job so fast yeh yeh i mean its not a major secret that sollers puts it about and although he hang on bliss was sitting up sollers puts it bit of a celeb karen said plus the number of women turned on by hunting pink and riding boots is still considerable hes discreet naturally with a useful marriage to protect lord walfords daughter in hunting circles that means a lot bliss was breathing hard karen could you possibly spell this out whereabouts has sollers been putting it this is only hearsay yeh i love hearsay just spit it out some of the migrant girls always hoping itll end in a fairytale marriage and a lovely home in england bliss shot forward the front legs of his chair clacking to the floor youre telling me sollers bull was shagging the wairkers it only once got dicey when a certain polish girl i understand he went back a few times too many and she got the wrong idea shows up at his restaurant one day demanding to see him which was how my mum first got a glimpse of the situation i think she mustve collected a good payoff this girl cause she apparently went home to warsaw or wherever soon after that anyway it was dealt with bliss was tapping his desk rhythmically quite fast he was practically accusing migrants of killing his brother that would be male migrants boss karens eyes were opaque i expect youll have to pass this on to maam though it being not your case any more sure although naturally ill need to visit magnis berries first ask some questions about their two murdered employees that restaurant karen looked unhappy theres a lot of irresponsible gossip i dont know if he goes to the farm any more it probably gave him a scare the polish girl i think maybe you should pass this directly on to maam dont you its the way things are done the marinescu sisters bliss said very attractive girls but also religious maybe a little naive karen stood up and opened the door and then shut it again just be careful frannie you know let the dci run with it your mas job is safe in my hands karen blisss fingers still going tappytaptap on the side of the desk like a little dynamo alone in his office bliss googled magnis berries found a discreet web site with the head of some romanlooking god wearing a wreath of strawberries blueberries and blackcurrants there was only one number in evesham bliss tapped it in got a chirpy lads voice magnis berries my names robin how can i help you today my names detective inspector bliss from west mercia police robin and you can help me by putting me through to batman its bat woman sir robin said bliss waited on hold listening to the inquiries unrolling on the other side of the door darth vaynor talking intelligently to someone in london connected with the romanian embassy in his left ear some halffamiliar classical music from magnis berries then a crisp educated female voice alex goddard di francis bliss ms goddard west mercia cid hereford youre the md inspector bliss a bit snappy not intimidated by cops ive already told one of your officers that we have very few people working in the wye valley at this time of the year and my manager has assured me he knows nothing that would help with your investigation cross purposes ms goddard this is not the mansel bull inquiry this is two of your former employees the marinescu sisters if theyre former employees i dont see how what have they done got themselves beaten to death in hereford oh good god as you were their last formal employer im interested in the circumstances under which they left inspector these people come and go in great numbers and while theyre the first at one of our farms to become victims of violence as far as you know my instructions to all the managers is that anyone found fighting or attempting to intimidate other workers should be summarily dismissed is wye valley your biggest farm i was thinking with the whole firm being called magnis berries we adopted the name last year magnis was the name of the roman town discovered not too far away and it gave us an identifiable corporate image in fact several of our other farms are two or three times as big she gave bliss the managers name roger hitchin and the unlisted number not that he planned to ring first he and karen could be there in ten minutes but then brian wilton came in to tell him that a couple of young women had arrived in response to their appeal for anyone whod seen the marinescus in the pubs around east street then elly clatter rang through about the inevitable press conference a necessary chore timed for two pm magnis would have to wait of course it might all come to nothing bliss was tingling to his fingertips demons lol found barry in the swan dining room putting out menus just had to talk to somebody about this its like youve gone to hell and heres satan in a cardigan offering you tea and scones its the way he is barry said taps into what he sees as the prevailing mood now what you accusing me of five tables were laid out with traditional stiff white cloths and napkins furled like water lilies lol counted another six tables bare wood redundant now pushed against the oak panelling all im saying is only four of us knew about it danny thomas merrily and i didnt even tell her until last night making me the most likely one tove blabbed to savitch barry pulled a dining chair away from a table waved lol to another what exactly did he say tells me his partner likes my fine music brigid that woman keeps a flat in the smoke because she cant go a week without a night at the opera with all due respect laurence i doubt she regards what you do as music at all good at this though isnt he knows his folk festivals too super idea actually mr robinson obviously never be a glastonbury here but perhaps a smallerscale cropredy or a green man real ale good herefordshire cider marvellous google is a wonderful thing barry said whats he offering you a site hes thinking one of his larger meadows up near the bridge lots of parking how much i may have misunderstood but i think it was free tribute to your status here laurence though hell want a percentage barry i dont have any status here nah the gig during the flood won you a bunch of new friends always been great public affection for the dance band on the titanic they all drowned lol said the dance band well thats true yeah barry opened out a napkin you got a problem here no getting round that lol recalled savitchs face exploding into a wide disarming smile hed expected arrogant distant and had got ordinary reasonable very scary he said people had him all wrong as if he was trying to distance himself from the bloodsport side how keen he was to revive the whole tradition more about merrie england than hunting and shooting merrie england like when the countryside was a recreation area for the aristocracy barrys smile was like the coalchip smile on a snowman lol understood hed been brought up in south london foster homes his dad had died in wandsworth prison so what was your response laurence im sorry mr savitch your ethos is not in the spirit of the music were trying to promote in fact we hate everything you stand for and you actually said i said it was a very generous offer but it was early days yet and he invited me to visit his establishment on thursday media launch for the family open day hes having on easter monday he gave me two tickets you and merrily me and my partner he wants the vicar trust me two birds with one sooner or later hell make a donation to merrilys church hell wait for an opportunity urgent repairs needed in the belfry something like that something that gets him noticed yet doesnt look like profligate largesse ive never heard you use so many big words before barry funny how despair can inflate your command of english of course if you do turn down his offer that would look a bit perverse but equally if you say yes id be in his pocket so im not going to am i ideas planted now he could go on to hold a bigger event with big names yours not among them barrys hands were efficiently twisting the napkin into another lily lol watched fascinated they teach you that in the sas yeah but with necks barry said in the end they went in separate cars fionas blue honda jazz leading merrily northwest along those pale seemingly pointless new roads which hinted at clandestine development plans then familiar wooded hills with an earlyspring greening like fresh mould an occasional long view across the hidden wye to the notched belt of the black mountains the sidewindow down but the breeze couldnt blow away the voices huwie he says just a slight problem a mere technicality a circle of salt had syd also forced himself to visualize the golden rings around and above his body mentally enclosing himself in an orb of light received wisdom received madness from a spidery old woman named anthea white who called herself athena and lived in an old folks home with her occult library supplemented with suggestions from the handbook of the christian delivery study group much thumbed pages folded over open all the cupboard doors take out all the drawers cover the mirrors a chance to step back and rationalize it huw again with chapel echo it cant be rationalized merrily hissed as if he were sitting in the car with her it isnt rational carly horne the skinny one with black hair slanting down over one eye thought bliss talked like that comedian yeh i know bliss said lily savage carly said who karen dowell smiled bliss didnt ask they were in the least grotty interview room he sat down next to karen so you heard it on the radio news stations i listen to dont do news to be honest carly said taylor magson told me this bloke at college he knows which pubs we do and when i said i remembered these russian girls he was like hey you better go tell the cops romanian karen said the girls were romanian got us an afternoon off college anyway what courses are you on im doing secretarial shes beauty therapy jammy cow the other one was heavy and sullenlooking her hair was cut short and the acid colour of lemon cheese her name was josceline singleton she had on a highnecked top and pink leggings you know those pictures you showed us carly said was that them dead bliss gave her a rueful smile thats really sick carly said karen said how long you been going in the pubs carly years but i dont drink much to be honest when i got college next day so this is the monks head bliss said lounge bar ten oclockish bit later when these women come in theres only one bar now since they started doing live music weekends you ever see these girls before carly shook her head were they on their own yeah they looked kind of you know isolated i used to feel pissed off about them coming over here taking our jobs and stuff but i feel sorry for them now i do when you read about them having to live like seven of them in one room thats why i went over and talked to them really well i was on my way to the lav to be honest and i like bumped their table oh bliss sat up so you actually talked to them talk to anybody me i mean we didnt discuss the government and stuff it was just like so where you from kind of thing and then she comes out with this place i ent never heard of so that was a bit useless i dont think they wanted to talk to be honest same with a lot of these ethnics they dont really wanner mix with us do they its the language josceline singleton said they dont know a word of english except benefits carly said thats my dad hes a bigot he is bliss said you told the sergeant some men followed them out yeah a few blokes in the pub was looking them over how dyou mean like you know grinning at each other making fists and stuff kind of give her one you know and then followed them out what time was this not sure maybe about quarter past eleven how many of them how many joss i wasnt counting to be honest wasnt like they was goodlooking or anything and quite old three i think there was three they was ethnics too how do you know that you can just tell cant you would you recognize them again you dont really take them in do you less theyre a bit fit all right bliss said im gonna leave you with ds dowell id like you to try very hard to describe these men how old how tall what they were wearing yeah carly said all right i mean when you think about it couldve been any of us couldnt it like murdered it was jane with her growing feel for the landscape whod pointed out that credenhill existed on three different levels the village itself was strung out aimlessly modern housing a line of convenience stores set back from the main road it was looking already like the suburbia of a muchextended hereford which it might one day become an ignominious future in the shadow literally of its impressive ancient history merrily and jane had once walked up the huge afforested hill to the east which carried the remaining earthen ramparts of the biggest iron age hill fort in the county not much to see now but some historians said credenhill had once been the celtic capital of what became herefordshire an elevated fortified community with a population of more than three thousand it had once looked down on the later roman military town of magnis long gone now as you followed the winding track you could see down below when the trees were bare a spread of low buildings vaster than it looked from the road a quiet self contained community with intersecting roads and parked trucks the third and most modern credenhill to which the elite warriors of the british army returned some of them seared and scorched and riven by demons applauded from afar but not allowed to talk about it except to people like syd spicer merrily slowed when the gates of the camp appeared on her left two police cars were parked alongside one of the buildings armed guards at the entrance none of this to merrilys knowledge outside of routine the army housing was across the road she followed fionas jazz into the estate which was like any other housing estate except somehow quieter parking behind the jazz outside an end house next to a wooded field she guessed their arrival would already have been clocked by somebody somewhere all the hundreds of times shed driven past never actually stopped here before you didnt you just didnt memories of the frank collins book were with her now frank a christian in the sas bothered by the old question of god and warfare in the end hed justified it simply to himself soldiers killed to prevent innocent people dying the regiment as knights trained to deal with evil frank had been raised among tough kids in workingclass newcastle breaking the law like the others she guessed hed been a good priest merrily came out of the old volvo with a ridiculous caution as if she might be in someones cross hairs for no obvious reason she pulled the collar of her woollen coat across her dog collar and buttoned it it was all very quiet she looked around and saw nothing moving on the estate no curtains twitching no wind a sky like tarnished brass further along the main road was the turning to credenhill church raised up on the right strange connection coming here direct from the chantry where thomas trahernes vision burned in stained glass this was a tiny parish in his day averaging about two baptisms a year but it would be wrong to think he wouldnt recognize the place now hed know the fortified hill at once and the vista across the wye valley to the black mountains on the welsh border the big things didnt change he might wonder though about the metal frames for polytunnels which she could see in the distance to the south might even find a kind of beauty in their skeletal caterpillar symmetry traherne could find beauty in most things did syd ever go to trahernes church she felt uneasy she was on army ground had no doubts where syds loyalties would lie while merrily was locking the volvo fiona was already walking towards the front door between bare brown bushes and then she stopped glanced over her shoulder towards merrily who moved towards her fiona nodded at the white door it was half open oh merrily said hes back then no sooner were the words out than she knew how wrong she was fiona didnt move as they were surrounded it happened very quickly as if this was a surprise party but all the guests were men and none of them expressed a greeting after what seemed a long time one of them turned to merrily mrs spicer she saw an older man standing between the brown bushes shaking his head im sorry the first man said and the older man approached fiona quite slowly mrs spicer we met once before briefly my names william he wasnt in uniform none of them were fiona nodded yes i remember william was solidly built and had a full grey moustache he wore walking boots he said should we go inside no fiona said id rather not her face had gone grey like fresh plaster merrily took in three other men one of whom she recognized stubble and broken veins not military it was terry stagg detective sergeant william said who is this woman please fiona halfturned as if shed forgotten merrily was there shes a friend of sams in the church a priest she stood before william her head tilted up to stare him in the eyes youd better tell me mrs spicer i think wheres my husband mrs spicer william said im afraid i have some distressing news i very bad news it was merrily who nearly cried out fionas lips were tight she still hadnt moved yet she seemed far away from here as if replaying a scene which had occurred in her midnight thoughts so many times that emotions could be dispensed with a lovely thing jane used to know kids who loved messing with dead things but shed never been one of them so shed been dreading this all day at this stage of your school career if you didnt have any particular classes you had the choice of coming home to work on revision yeah right when she got off the bus there was no sign of the volvo outside the vicarage so she went directly round the back to the garden shed at least thered been no blood on the path this morning not yet four pm the sun still high but weak the shed was just a leanto against the highest part of the wall wasnt kept locked and it had been the only place she could think of last night needed some help with this really even mum who as a kid had wanted to be a vet and knew a bit about injured pets and livestock mum would have an idea how the bird had died could hardly take it to mum though who knew nothing about the earlier incident with cornel and the beer tangled web jane began to part the garden tools remembering pushing the sack behind them she threw the door wide pulled out the spade and the hoe and the rake and the hedge loppers tossing them onto the lawn behind her but oh god no this could only be mum now shed have to explain everything which would lead to a chain of explanations and that would get lol in bother too for not disclosing what had happened on the night of the storm she was in deep trouble and hadnt even dealt with the nouniversity situation yet jane closed the shed door walked away to the end of the garden leaned against the churchyard wall staring over at the old graves considering the worst options could cornel have pinched it back would he have gone to that kind of trouble he couldnt have seen her last night could he couldnt surely have been in a fit state after the kicking hed had and throwing up in barrys yard last night jane had awoken twice with the gritty ghosts of dead flies in her mouth and shuddery memories of the quick efficient way in which cornel had been damaged that almost feminine cry of pain big tall cornel breastfed for months and months cornel the winner who could do anything he wanted because the bank was paying cornel had been very afraid had done as hed been told had taken the sack away except hed been told to bury it and hed only buried it in the bin on the square but what about the other guy who had just disappeared who hadnt seemed like the kind of guy who would just disappear oh christ the very worst option what if he d seen her jane began to sweat went over the whole garden frantic now looking behind all the apple trees into the long grass under the church wall leaning over the wall to see into the churchyard why the hell had she taken it what was it supposed to prove she ran back around the vicarage out of the front gate and down church street towards the river pulling out her phone shed call eirion hadnt called him back last night just dropped him a quick text promising to explain tomorrow shed tell eirion everything but his damn phone was switched off jane leaned over the bridge watching the slow water making dark languid circles around the pillars and buttresses after the psychotic nights around christmas the river was back to its old torpid self and there was no sign of a bin sack down there owre you janey oh he was leaning over the bridge next to her teeth clamped on an unlit ciggy pale sunlight swimming in his specs hadnt even heard him approaching jane looked down at his feet gomer youre wearing trainers hay n brecon farmers two for the price o one thats erm normal in footwear isnt it two pair girl dont worry you ent gonner see me doing no joggying you dont fool me gomer jane found a smile i bet youve got a hoodie and a baseball cap in the back of the jcb ent even seen the bloody ole thing for nigh on two days dannys got him workin over by walton makin a pond been fillin my time with a bit o spring maintenance in the churchyard found some bloody ole briars muster got missed last autumn so gomer eyeing jane head on one side took up the vicars offer of borrowin the ole loppers he put the ciggy back in his mouth stood with his hands behind his back rocking slightly oh jane said erm from the shed exackly from the ole shed back o the vicarage right wooh so you erm jane looked into gomers glasses opaque white discs relief enfolding her like an old bath robe you probably found a black bin sack sure tbe gomer extracted his ciggy bit of a story to this is there janey jane felt her shoulders slump got him back at my place you wanner she nodded and followed him down from the bridge they walked up to the bungalow with the fading buttermilk walls where gomer had lived alone since minnies death gomer sometimes crap situations just rearranged themselves for the best with divorce and death and stuff jane had never really had a grandad her worst recurrent nightmare was probably the one in which gomer had died gomer didnt judge well not jane anyway so she told him virtually everything in the sure knowledge that it would go no further he leaned against his wall listening chewing on his unlit ciggy when shed finished he opened his garden gate dull buggers some o these fellers he said for all their college papers he was really scared gomer and probably shocked that the guy could you know do whatever he did he obviously knew who it was you sure it wasnt barry i heard his voice only barry see hes had his times oh i know barry could have done it but he didnt definitely not him signs of springtime action in gomers garden a rake and a hoe leaning against the wall with a stainless steel spade its blade worn thin and sharp ent much into gardenin see janey cept for the ole veg but minnie her always liked her daffs these is in memory kind o thing theyre nice gomer erm gomer nodded towards the garden table the black bag was underneath it tied up with orange baler twine he went over and dragged it out placed it on the table undid the twine jane looked around nervously the bungalow was raised up behind substantial hedging tightly cut obviously you could see over it back to the river bridge and in the other direction the church street pitch all the way up to the market square but nobody could see into gomers garden shot it jane said quickly i think they shot it cornel he was going oh ill have a blast at anything that moves was he now he said it was all ok as long as you cleaned up afterwards scumbags gomer they went onto someones property and shot it i was going to put it back in the litter bin but then i thought no its evidence shot eh thats what you reckons gomer brought it out and laid it on the iron tabletop it was pretty battered but you could tell it had been a lovely thing with like a lions mane all golden jane swallowed dismay set in i know this doesnt really prove anything they could just say it was an accident theyre just haccident gomer ran a hand over the feathers this dont happen by haccident huh janey gomer sighed and brought out his ciggy tin this boy ent been shot well i didnt really look it was dark and see that jane saw there were spots of blood around the beak she didnt understand that ent good girl gomer said bergen its not your fault of course huw said in the scullery the red light was still blinking on the answering machine the air swollen with its bleeps merrily sank down at the desk youre a hypocritical bastard you know that holding the big bakelite phone with both hands her stomach felt like a crumpled paper bag about four hours sleep last night and she hadnt eaten since breakfast barely remembered driving home very slowly ignoring the answering machine taking two paracetamols with a glass of water she fingered a cigarette drew a hard breath you as good as told me something was coming you were afraid for him she felt momentarily dizzy merrily the old black bakelite phone a present from jane felt like some kind of barbell in her left hand everything was heavy even the waning sunlight she slid her dog collar off sorry i said how did he actually die where was he found on the side of the hill he was in a shallow ditch a depression near the foot of some steps you saw his body no god no i just remembered the spot when they told me earthen steps the soil held in by boards walked up there once jane and me and is there any reason to think they dont know theyre not sure theres no suspicion of foul play why did they always say that play jesus therell be a postmortem obviously huw said yes merrily was unbuttoning the top of her clerical shirt wiping a hand across her throat she was cold but sweating they go running up there huw said the lads from the camp bound to there seems to be nothing to suggest it isnt natural causes as if hed just collapsed gone for a run just like old times but he wasnt up to it any more especially with all that weight the big rucksack still on his back the bergen the word had been used several times after theyd gone into the house syd had been found with his bergen beside him the big framed rucksack that the sas carried their kit in what they carried sometimes weighted with bricks according to the legend on exercises who found him i dont know walkers a lot of people go walking up there theres a car park and everything he mightve been lying there all night or since early morning and they let you into the house with his wife i think they were grateful to have another woman there one of them had made tea theyd sat fiona down with her sugary brew and asked her some simple questions when had she last seen syd what had been his state of health state of mind she hadnt wept shed kept on her goretex jacket and her woollen hat and her scarf the suppressed grief in the room had been like a still white steam fionas first word little more than a breath how a man who in the course of his career might have lost his life in a dozen different countries and hed gone out on a muddy hillside less than a mile from his kitchen his kettle we dont really know the man called william had said he might have fallen and hit his head he might have had a heart attack mrs spicer do you know if he had any health problems chest pains tightness of breath he had a medical before his appointment didnt he a silence and then william had asked fiona if she knew why the bedroom door was locked is it shed said vaguely putting her tea on one side her expression saying it was too sweet merrily had gone into the kitchen to pour another feeling inadequate here as a parish priest you spent long hours in houses of bereavement but not often surrounded by men whose experiences of death would always outweigh yours by the time she came back william and the detective terry stagg had gone upstairs the other two men outside to a police car merrily had said to fiona do you want to come back with me where ive got spare rooms at the vicarage nobody should be alone at a time like this we dont really know each other do we fiona said they were alone in the living room it had magnolia walls a sofa a small tv and a white melamine bookcase with a couple of dozen books in it merrily recognized the spines of the deliverance handbook and a time to heal with its narrow black cross against sunburst red fiona stood up and went to the window where the view was over the camp over the fields over the river wye to the black mountains and wales i dont particularly like the country fiona said ill stay in hereford tonight then go home till till i have to come back what about your daughter ill phone her when these people have finished with me is there anybody i can phone fiona shook her head something kept telling me that the only way wed stayed the course so far was by having long separations now weve got the big one her mouth twitched i dont like the country it was no good for him shed turned away from the window as if she never wanted to see that view again she must have prelived syds death dozens of times she starting doing practical things very methodical she gave me her phone numbers and the three books shed found in syds car telling merrily to put them in her bag before the men came back merrily didnt tell huw about the books hadnt looked at them yet then they came back downstairs this william and the cid man and then some uniformed policemen came in and a woman i dont know if she was army or police familyliaison but she was there for fiona while this guy william took the opportunity to get what he could out of me mod you dont ask do you william had followed merrily out into the front garden his heavy moustache was oldfashioned a lord kitchener job authoritative back then today it looked faintly comical mocksolemn william was stocky built like a pit bull whereve you come from mrs watkins ledwardine thats a village few miles over yes i know where it is in fact ive an old army friend living there james bulldavies i know james knew him well enough to be sure hed never been in the special air service i meant whereve you come from just now william said from hereford fionas staying there we met at the cathedral where i work sometimes how well did you know syd mrs watkins we were better than acquaintances worked together once the motion of an eyebrow suggested that william had an idea what she was talking about but he didnt follow it up hed gone to stand on the edge of the lawn hands behind his back neighbour saw him leave here yesterday evening bergen on his back as he apparently did most evenings he was found lying by the side of his bergen hed taken it off as if to sit down for a rest more or less full kit inside and mint cake water bottles over sixty pounds made weightier by a rather hefty and cumbersome addition not the apocryphal bricks would it be a family bible williams eyes had widened fractionally fiona said he always kept a big family bible in his bedroom merrily said on top of the wardrobe she said it wasnt there any more i see yes youre quite right a bible merrily followed william onto the front lawn where the grass was still slippery from the winter he jerked a gloved thumb back towards the long hump of credenhill the remains of its fort camouflaged in forestry if he was running up that hill with a bergen containing that kind of weight we have youngsters trained soldiers who think theyre tough enough for the regiment collapse after a few miles carrying less than that how old was syd fiftytwo fiftythree i dont know merrily had been thinking of the vivid green window in the traherne chantry the figure of the poet or somebody running along a path towards a wooded hill that was probably credenhill you all right mrs watkins sorry goose over my grave could i ask you something who lived here before syd william had looked at her sternly there a reason for that question youd probably think it was a fairly stupid one not another chaplain here no the last chaplain had his own house nearby i believe this was a sergeant with a wife and a son they were here id guess about seven years until he retired what exactly were you expecting still erm alive and kicking all over the world he landed something of a plum job with a film production company as a stunt adviser of some kind oh well thank you merrily had wondered if hed mention the drawers pulled out the mirror covered the salt around the bed he didnt but she was convinced he now knew about her peculiar role in the diocese might even have rung james bulldavies while he and stagg were upstairs but he couldnt be sure if she knew what was behind the bedroom door why might syd have a big heavy bible with him mrs watkins ill need to think about it thats what you advised syd to do right the drawers the salt i told him what you did huw said told him what youd done in circumstances that mightve been different giving him another opportunity to tell me exactly what was bothering him merrily sighed open the cupboard doors take out the drawers expose all dark places leave nowhere for evil to hide maybe all symbolic hooks for the mind and maybe syd had thought it was all crap but hed done it just the same and then died you think its possible he killed himself huw said high suicide rate among exsas men they come out cant adjust to normal life and depression sets in but syd had come through like he said things were looking up daughter getting married grandchild on the way yet merrily was remembering the sense of an optimism as synthetic as airfreshener why the procedure with the kit though huw said his bergen part of his old identity as a serving sas man and his bible his big bible representing the other half of him but also from what you say a bit of a talisman and he goes up the hill carrying his whole identity his memories the weight of his religion whats the significance of the hill would he have done exercises up there when he was in the sas they werent based at credenhill then its just a good place to run he was running away getting away from a house he thought might be contaminated not a word from this feller about his bedroom not to me theyll want to keep that out of the inquest brush it under the carpet itll be natural causes or accidental death or at worst spicer taking his own life while the balance of his mind were disturbed drawing a line we dont have to draw and happen wont because we failed him talk about it tomorrow eh huw said silence except for the answering machine bleeping away like a lifesupport system merrilys bag was hanging over the back of the chair she pulled out the three paperback books laid them out on the desk one by one deliverance new edition scuffed and tatty wellthumbed pages turned down but nothing underlined no margin notes only the ledwardine vicarage number and then there was wordsworths britain a little itinerary this one was also quite tatty dark green far from new merrily flipped through it nothing was marked the third book was a larger paperback on the cover a roman soldier had his short sword raised over a cowering man in rags against a background of fire fiction it had a blurb they came they saw they slaughtered it was called caradog and it was by someone called byron jones merrily turned it over the price was a us edition the lurid cover the language and the print size all suggested this was a book for children well older children or young adults although it had probably been published before that term was in use caradog another name for caractacus the british leader who held out against the romans and whose last stand was once supposed probably wrongly to have been on herefordshire beacon overlooking syds last parish in the malverns so no big mystery there caradog carried a very brief biographical note on the author byron jones was a special forces soldier in the british army he is now an expert on roman and ancient british warfare exsas then a book written by a former comrade if thered been time to examine syds bookshelves at length merrily might well have found andy mcnab chris ryan all the others she flipped through the pages to be absolutely sure that none of them had been marked then gathered the books into a neat pile leaned across the scullery desk and pressed the green piano key on the answering machine fiona spicers voice very dry very firm merrily im sorry could icould you do something for me im not sure about the army protocol here but could you bury him she pushed her chair back sat with space all around her a sign like a pointing finger from the clouds the ultimate responsibility the loser the cock was a tumble of feathers his neck coppery and gold in the late sunlight ent a fox done this neither gomer said fox goes for the neck and he dont leave much behind maybe he was disturbed jane stepped back from the garden table as gomer lifted up the birds head she wasnt squeamish but an image from last night had stayed with her from when shed first opened the sack under one of the lamps on the square the ruined eye peeping up the body was battered feathers broken maybe from the kicking cornel had given the bin sack see the blood on his beak thats the real giveaway ennit gomer turned to her you all right there janey hes beautiful gomer that golden like a lions mane his hackle aye nice bird he is you dont see the ole breeds too often nmore i mean i dont know much about chickens and things but it didnt seem like his neck had been wrung or anything and the way they were talking about shooting anything in front of their guns gomer struck a match ignited his rollup janey id ave to say no man done this goin by the injuries and the breed im not following you gomer took a drag on his ciggy gamecock he is game jane sprang back from the table like it was electrified but thats died in the ring sure to a cockfight but that its like bearbaiting and stuff history illegal been illegal for over a century but that dont mean it dont go on see on the quiet where few farmyards gypsy camps jane stared at the dead cock her fists and chest tightening big money in it see gomer said betting lot of it about when i was a boy some folks then they couldnt figure why it was banned cocks fight what they does but they dont kill im just tellin you what the cockers say all about mating like stags sure once they seed the other cock off its over but you puts the buggers in a pit what they cant get out of the losin cock he ent got nowhere to go do he fars the other birds concerned hes still a contender so it dont stop specially with all the money ridin on it and gomer looked uncertain go on jane said well they got these spurs ennit metal spikes couple inches long on their legs see where this leg yeres that makes it more fun does it jane took one look jerked herself away more blood more feathers ripped out most of em dies from head wounds or eyes like this boy i reckon i just dont believe this gomer whens the last you heard of it by yere thirty year ago sure tbe used to be a reglar cocking fraternity kind o thing dont mean it ent been goin on ever since on and off just means its more underground kind o thing under cover of gamefowl breeders clubs gomer nodded at the dead bird werent so terrible bright o that feller just dumpin him in a bin he offered him to barry for the kitchen that werent bright he was drunk jane turned away from the table her eyes filling up she heard gomer putting the cock back into the bin liner and felt suddenly heartsick you seem to know like a lot about it gomer she turned back as he tied up the sack what does that mean uncle gomer said when i was a boy i had this uncle bred gamecocks hedve died when i was mabbe eight or nine i remember goin with my ma to clean out his house and we finds all these photies ones the ole feller with his prize bird and another cock dead what the prize cock killed and heres my uncle gwyn great big beam all over his face gomer shrugged thing is he never seen it as cruel do he gamecocks they had a real good life long as it lasted spoonful of porridge spoonful of treacle eggs barley nothin but the best fore a big fight and when you thinks of all these poor bloody battery chickens fattened on drugs never loosed out in the fresh air and then they dies on a conveyor belt yeah that totally stinks but it doesnt no gomer said it dont a cock dont even have to die in the ring see but its like with them ole what you calls them ole roman fellers gladiators one o them he gets the thumbsdown curtains ennit specially if he ent put up much of a fight ent the same for the crowd see if both of em struts out at the end its sick gomer puffed awhile watching the sun this that savitch cornel was one of his clients guests i mean its bad enough they think they can go round just shooting anything but you think savitch is actually staging cockfights gomer lowered the sack to the grass he cant be that daft can he what you wanner do with this ole boy isnt it evidence you gonner be a witness girl i dont mind in court against the kind o lawyer this banker fellers gonner hire thats even if it went that far one dead cock is all you got we dont really know where he died or how ent nothin there for certain to say he went in the ring hell janey i might be wrong you wouldntve told me if you thought for one minute you were wrong what about barry he saw it all he seen was a dead fowl in a bin bag hes been around that boy but it dont mean hes ever seen a cockfight yeah jane shook her head gloomily and like is he going to want to tear up his meal ticket and the cops couldnt give a toss about rural petty crime apparently she looked up there just has to be a connection with savitch its the kind of thing hed do give the city guys a little extra thrill show them how hard people are in the sticks this banker feller dont seem likely he owned the cock do it he said it was rubbish mabbe he had money on it brought him back the loser to eat because it had let him down this other feller twin brownish suns in gomers bottle glasses pretty savvy for an old guy who mum reckoned had rarely been north of leominster or south of ross the whole of his life i didnt really see him and i didnt recognize his voice you figure they was both at the cockfight janey sounded like it he was sneering at cornel this was before he hit him he said it was about manhood he said cornel wasnt ready i have no idea what he meant what do we do gomer how about the rspca the league against cruel sports mabbe ill talk to a few folks gomer said see what i can find out you know people who might be involved gotter get their fowls from somewhere mating season now ennit cocks is well up for a fight gomer tapped the sack with the edge of his trainer looked at jane bury him proper jane nodded the sun had sunk terminally into cloud and the air smelled sour she watched gomer pick up the black bin sack with its sad bundle of feathers her fingers were curling tight like the poet with jane it was always more than body language she could give off fury like smoke when merrily ran into her where church street met the square she was still in the school clothes she normally couldnt wait to shed and she looked starkly monochrome against the vivid pink sky or maybe everyone would look like that tonight merrily shook herself sorry flower had to go to jims we were clean out of bread you werent looking for me were you no i yeah no there was something wrong but jane turned it around whats happened you ok bit of a shock thats all syd spicer who was vicar of wychehill in the malverns ok hes dead he was found this afternoon on the side of credenhill where the earthsteps are where we walked that time apparently hed gone for a run on the hill mightve fallen hit his head i dont know im sorry thats awful was he still a mate kind of they walked out onto the square under a brushing of rain lifes very often crap jane said have you noticed and she might well have gone on to explain if barry in his black suit with his polished shoes hadnt come briskly down the steps of the swan striding across the cobbles asking merrily if she could spare him a minute if you could call that asking barrys office was behind the reception desk a small woody windowless space with nothing at all to say about the swans jacobean origins it had a strip light that turned barrys face bluewhite now im nervous he shut the door pointed merrily to his leather chair you come in here last night asking me what might frighten a man trained not to be frightened of anything and next day hes bleedin topped himself barry nobodys saying that probably natural causes maybe an accident accidents like that dont happen to men like syd besides that would hardlyve caused what you might call a small tremor in the ranks whats that mean merrily instinctively pulled the cigarettes from her bag then shoved the packet back barry waved a hand nah light one you want this aint public space its ok she closed her bag who told you these things get round you were with fiona yes one in a million that woman she understands better than both mine did anyway he stood over her waiting merrily lowered her bag to the floor all right what happened i was asked to talk to a group of clergy on a deliverance training course last friday night and syd turned up with something on his mind which he wouldnt talk about not to us so we assumed it was sasrelated whos us huw owen my spiritual director looking steadily up at him you knew syd well didnt you well enough to know his wife obviously i served with him he was a friend for a time yeah for a time we didnt fall out or nothing i saw him a couple of years ago he seemed ok you can usually tell when theyre not i heard he was in full kit when they found him he had a bergen thats all a lot of weight in there including a very big family bible this has kind of knocked me sideways barry merrilys right hand was shaking and she placed her left hand over it barry pulled out the other chair sat down opposite her im sorry didnt mean to sound like i was interrogating you huw was convinced syd needed help kind of help he didnt tell us did he some people are embarrassed by the anomalous especially the clergy he sat in the shadows and he listened to what we had to say in the chapel like he had to deal with it himself get it out of the way you had dealings with him before though yeah he consulted me about something he either didnt believe or wanted nothing to do with he told me more than once that he didnt like that kind of thing he wanted me to deal with it this time i can only assume this was something he did believe in however reluctantly or that it was personal even in here you could hear the plink plink of the pool table in the public bar no voices no laughter just cue on ball it sounded random directionless lonely somehow frank collins barry said not long before he died he became chaplain to twentythree sas the reservists so not as close as syd only when his book came out it hadnt been cleared by the mod and he had to resign got very depressed about that looking at it from the other side maybe it was the church what done for frank collins its true that when things get difficult you dont always get the support you might expect from the church the church can be strangely cold could be none of this applies regiment suicides are mainly blokes who only ever went inside a church for a mates funeral some of its posttraumatic stress some of its because you get altered and normal life dont seem like life at all and aint worth holding on to merrily thought for a moment listening to the pool game barry can i hang a name on you and then before he could reply she came out with it byron jones his eyes went blank like the poet he said merrily had quickly googled byron jones before she came out not much at all really he was certainly an author but not exactly a bestseller or not any more the most recent reference was actually barry said he was a poet he sat waiting for a reason to continue syd had one of his books on the shelf merrily said caradog a novel for older kids about the roman invasion of britain yeah i did hear he was writing books a number of them have a go at that as you mayve noticed but there was only one bravo two zero not many millionaires among the rest you ever read anything by byron jones barry lost interest when i heard they werent about the regiment anything about the regiment we tend to collect for various reasons it was for kids anyway most of them are written under pseudonyms andy mcnab et cetera is he his name is jones byron i was actually there the night he got that we were due to fly out to somewhere or other about a dozen of us in the paludrin sorry the social club at the camp valentines day coming up and one of the boys hes got a card for his girlfriend what hes leaving for a mate to post and hes trying to compose a verse to write in it were all helping as you do hes sitting there this boy with his notepad getting nowhere specially with our suggestions some men sniff their armpits others tubes of glue i wont go on but you get the level then this person were discussing byron he looks up from his sun and he goes never forgotten this it was so unexpected he looks up very slowly and he goes in this dreamy sort of voice some men win at snooker and some at poker too but only one who dares can really win a girl like you merrily smiled get it barry said who dares wins big cheer goes up and somebody goes this lads a regular byron and so for ever after he still didnt look the type but how many of us did what type was he spare one for me barry nodding at merrilys bag fag she pulled the bag onto her knees found the packet and the zippo barry extracted a silk cut and lit up so syd was back in touch with byron was he i dont know im just telling you his book was on the shelf and you just happened to notice it she said nothing byron jones barry blew out smoke thoughtful i dunno about this merrily is he a real writer i mean some of these guys they have somebody to do it for them but i suppose hed need to be famous for that hes not famous and the poetry like i said that was a joke i mean was he interested in poetry or was syd wordsworth that kind of thing byron joness book was next to a book of wordsworths poetry not that i know of byron was into history he joined a local history club and theyd do these field trips what with local people maybe i dunno what did they do you know just poking round looking for bits of history archaeological remains in the countryside around stirling lines back then in hereford was syd in this history club probably so he and byron were mates mates barrys smile was tight i have to say is not a word youd readily apply to byron he wasnt friendly not being funny barry straightened his black tie folded his arms look i never knew him well enough to say too much he was very singleminded on exercises very competitive i put this down to him being a bit nearer the end of his army career than the rest of us and no promotion like he had something to prove i i really dont know about this not going to be filing a report on it barry its just i cant help feeling i let syd down even though he didnt want to talk to me barry inspected his cigarette like he couldnt believe hed already smoked half of it byron was i mean ruthless was not a word we used seeing as how we all needed to live there sometimes but byron was less inclined to take prisoners you know what i mean youre aware that im telling you this in total confidence and if there are defence issues doesnt worry me a lot blimey you think if i get too close to something embarrassing i might get waterboarded i think you should not take the piss out of these people frankly and you didnt just see byrons book on the shelf did you it was pointed out to me but no explanation was given i didnt know anything about byron jones until now is he still around i mean here he was i know where he was cause his wifes there exwife ran into her on a touristboard beano last year shes doing b and b in the golden valley another failed marriage then actually the marriage survived quite a long time mostly through absence i suspect yeah ok thats not a bad idea if you want to know about byron you should to talk to liz big liz i expect theres things she could tell you if she was minded to and i never said that why wouldnt i just talk to byron himself not advisable merrily raised her eyebrows barry leaned back i could give her a call if you like tell her youre all right that sounds like you want me to talk to her i dont want you to talk to anybody but if youre determined to open this can of worms im trying to work this out you think theres something i should know but you dont think you should be the one to tell me or you cant tell me barry looked worried he didnt often look worried i wasnt expecting you to toss byron jones into the mix if you get an approach from anybody we havent had this chat and it wasnt me put you on to liz all right sure and byron i mightve made him sound funny the poetry and everything he wasnt do you know what i mean he isnt merrily searched for anything in barrys eyes but it was like theyd been switched off and she wondered if the evil from syds past finally had a name impaler there were security lights on stockade poles at either side of the entrance the sign had a roman helmet on it karen dowell was sitting in the passenger seat arms folded over her seat belt apprehensive you havent told her have you no reason to bliss said this is my inquiry which just happens to overlap her inquiry norra problem occasionally he wished he could come clean to karen about him and annie shed be shocked rigid but no way would she blab and if she ever found out some other way shed never trust him again and that would be very bad but he couldnt there wasnt anybody in or outside of gaol street he could tell and it was hard to imagine a situation where there ever would be was there really a roman town here karen i think the actual sites about half a mile away i remember we had this school outing there once of course absolutely nothing to see but empty fields one kid burst into tears he was expecting something like the colosseum always remember that bliss drove between the lights almost immediately you could see newly covered polytunnels like big white worms nobody about at all in summer the tunnels would be like wasp nests im not even on overtime for this am i karen said ill make it up to you kid one day needed her local knowledge this was what it came down to there were details he might miss on his own he parked near the top of a low hill in front of a long shed with a poorly lit glass porch we should really be in town karen said if even rich ford is predicting trouble rich fords an old woman been around a long time boss and hes got a nose for undercurrents if theres some underlying migrant issue here we know nothing about i think he could be right spot the retaliation and youre there yeh well this wont take long the manager roger hitchin was waiting for them a vaguelooking feller who said straight off that he was no use to them didnt deal much with the migrant workers not being much of a linguist just a man who knew about the business of growing strawberries which was why he wanted to introduce them to the firms personnel liaison officer vasile bocean a romanian whose halfwaygood english had apparently lifted him out of the ranks putting him into a permanent caravan with electricity vasile told them that proud of his caravan couldnt be more than twentyfour spiky hair with gold highlights hitchin left them alone with vasile and they talked outside the office under a metal awning vasile seemed to be a permanent resident now going out with a local girl and yes he certainly remembered the marinescu sisters he beamed from village near sighi oara bliss nodded he knew that much confirmation had come in late this afternoon from the romanian police the parents already contacted photos exchanged talk of family members coming over to take the girls bodies home elly clatter had finally put out the sisters names in time for the six oclock news sighi oara a short laugh from vasile bocean is very famous town very small but very famous vasile was grinning as though bliss and karen ought to recognize the significance sighi oara transylvania famous tourist place oldfashioned buildings like middle ages but most famous vasile raising his hands making his fingers into claws as birthplace of mr dracula really vlad tepes impaler bliss let vasile enjoy himself explaining how this english writer had borrowed this notorious serial killers name and his castle and his reputation turning the already uncuddly vlad into an eternal emblem of the undead these were country girls then bliss said when it was over unsophisticated huh simple simple girls people there is all very weird detective everything they believe curses evil omens spirits of the dead mr dracula woowoo im sure these girls full of all that vasile waggling his fingers spooky stuff bliss exchanged glances with karen bulky in a blue fleece looking like she wanted to be anywhere but here simple country girls vasile can get preyed on like dracula preyed on girls karen gave him a look bliss heard the rattling of a breeze on polythene glanced down the valley where no lights were visible probably because of dense woodland who preyed on the marinescu sisters vasile you know dont you karen barely spoke to him until they were back on the outskirts of the city it had started to rain i had to push him bliss said his english wasnt that good he needed direction he was upset karen said he was shocked his grasp of english wasnt great he was very distressed when you told him what was done to them and you capitalized on that he didnt know he didnt even know they were dead yeh it occurred to me when he was having a laugh about dracula that hitchin hadnt bothered to tell him about the girls the firms way of distancing itself saying we just employ them whatever they get up to in their own time nothing to do with us bliss wondered what vasile was paid as personnel liaison officer he figured about fifty pence an hour more than the pickers at least weve planted the idea karen hell be thinking about it and then we go back and talk to him again sex vasile im talking about sex dont tell me it doesnt go on and not necessarily always with consent women get raped on these farms vasile you know that its just that they dont come and tell us about it because of the possible repercussions vasile had said cushions because theyre afraid of it coming back on them people get beaten up on farms like this too injured hurt isnt that right vasile i never our information vasile is that these girls they were having a bit of trouble while they were here no no im not saying it was anything to do with you but if you dont tell us what you know there might be repercussions when we eventually find out you know what im saying cushions cushions yeh its not as if hed ever make a witness karen said as they came up to the westgate traffic island is it i dont expect that to be necessary karen listen to me vasile suppose the marinescu sisters had been the victims of sexual harassment men asking for sex in return for favours easier work that never happen here vasile backing off shaking his head hands going like windscreen wipers on fast mode i swear to you vasile a few people are known to have taken their own lives because of intimidation bullying not here maybe but other farms we know what goes on and maybe we havent asked as many questions as we ought to have but murder this is very very different two young women beaten to death in the city right under our noses anybody who withholds information about that doesnt tell us what they know were gonna take a very dim view of it maybe theyll go to prison these people who conceal information maybe theyll get deported listen detective please i tell you everything i know these girls all they talk about is about how this place is bad in what way vasile with ghostmen mr dracula ghostmen come in the night i dunno of course you dunno because im telling you because what came in the night vasile was ordinary men no listen to what im saying im talking about men from outside you understand im not trying to blame your people your workers for things they didnt do which happens sometimes doesnt it sometimes they get the blame for bad things done by local men bosses i know there was a boss who was very interested in some of the girls and somehow i think you know that too the name bull karen said all the name bull meant to that boy was the murdered man on the farm who he felt he had to keep saying he didnt know in case you were trying to hang that one on him as well he knows more than hes saying he thinks hes gorra good job with prospects and the futures rosy and no way hes going to jeopardize that by grassing up somebody important you notice how his english seemed to get gradually worse the more we pressed him bliss felt karens wobble of rage we we pressed him this blind obsession with nailing sollers bull to the wall its turning you into a what something i never thought you were mother of god this is nothing to do with what sollers thinks about me or how well he knows me fatherinlaw sollers finds a source of uncomplicated sex with women he doesnt even have to talk to vasile is the intermediary shall we say pimp whatever all this spooky girls transylvania shit he thinks were that thick this is an oldfashioned gut feeling karen remember them sure and youre an oldfashioned detective frannie which is no longer a compliment the blokes those kids saw in the pub bliss said whos to say they werent paid to do it one job big money theyre probably on their way home now pulling two murders together one knife one bluntforce because they both have connections to a man you dont like it was you who yeah and i said tell the dci leave it to a senior officer who hasnt got a very visible axe to grind bliss drove slowly down towards the turnoff for gaol street traffic was light the higher than usual percentage of police cars was very evident he wasnt expecting to see annie tonight though a latenight phone call couldnt be ruled out karen was right it was best he needed annie to get sollers needed annie to want to get sollers share back home merrily went directly through to the scullery called fionas mobile answering service she thought of leaving a message wasnt sure what she wanted to say she sat looking at the american paperback with the roman soldier and the fire they came they saw the book fell open at page caradog was a warrior born to it from childhood he had been taught that fighting was something to be relished and when necessary he killed without much thought but he was learning that there was something different about the way the romans fought and killed he wanted to know what it was what had made them the finest fighting force in the world so that he might use it against them who was he really where was he barry had avoided telling her byrons real first name there were ten million joneses in the phone book ethel was slaloming between merrilys ankles and she got up to put out some felix she could hear the sound of the tv from the parlour a chance here of discovering what was on janes mind take some hot chocolate in meanwhile she rang lol to explain the situation it was important to keep him in the loop start sharing more guard against slippage it was on the news lol said about the body on credenhill no name god syd spicer a silence then he said dont even think of shouldering any its not about blame merrily said quickly its about finding out what was damaging him and making sure nobody else is affected this is supposed to be my manor if he was keeping something from us because it involved national socalled security well thats not my problem either you need to be careful with those guys me a harmless lunatic a medieval throwback oh ive been asked to do his funeral oh no lol said not that and then there was someone at the door an efficient tapping as if with the tip of a walking stick or an umbrella or an army officers baton merrily watched james bulldavies shaking out his umbrella shuffling on the doormat angled like a tower crane not ah keeping you up am i its not yet nine oclock james coffee bit late for caffeine james stood his umbrella under the light of the world print no hell might as well thank you merrily led him into the stoneflagged kitchen chilly in here in these days of postaga economic restraint im sorry i was meaning to call in after mansel second cousin twice removed something like that hadnt spoken to him in years nothing wrong just never that close still a hell of a shock though rather admired him for his refusal to give up the family home the way we did ours otherwise lived within his means which both his wives seem to have seen as being tight with money but shocking as you say shouldnt happen country going down the lavatory james pulled out a chair at the refectory table and spread himself over it in his ungainly way he was wearing an old tweed jacket grey woollen tie reason for disturbance you met a friend of mine earlier lockley william never bill despises bill dont know why he said you were friends shipped orf to the same school for our sins christ col brecon also served her maj together as young chaps briefly before he took a slightly different path now this man spicer what does william do with the regiment nothing too active now had his time in the sandpit they keep him on chaps like him have their uses if its only a long memory james coughed this is me talking to you by the way not him not them fairly clear that i suppose you know id never suspect you of making covert inquiries on behalf of the ministry of defence army county this someones fingers snapped and men who were never quite retired came out of civilian limbo james cleared his throat here far as im aware purely on behalf of my old friend lockley as far as youre aware or could ever expect to be aware james my heads starting to ache james shifted in his chair like a minor rockfall didnt just drop out of the cot merrily fully aware of the degree of suspect politics which may appear to be lurking behind anything involving the military fully aware of that good go on having him as standin chaplain not universally applauded james sighed irritably hate this kind of thing poor chaps gorn that should be an end to it however one or two things still leave cause for concern the atmosphere had altered the banter was over the coffee pot began to burble merrily went to it james cleared his throat again probably know what they found in spicers bedroom i didnt go in wasnt invited james was silent all right merrily said i may have an idea what was in there i ah made it clear to lockley that i had considerable respect for you as a person wouldnt like you to be buggered about however they that is we i were wondering how far youd be prepared to share she turned to face james a mug in each hand share things are sensitive were in wars could be for some time not made easier by the nation being in two minds about the need for it though with all the loss of life theres a lot of sympathy at present for the chaps who have to fight anything which might affect that sympathy or the morale of the fighting man which between ourselves is getting bloody close to rock bottom ptsd combatstress obviously needs to be watched rain skittered like moths on the high window merrily frowned i know how hard this is for you james but youre going to have to spell this out merrily this hells bells they dont understand this stuff not their field of combat lockleys jobs to ensure that whatever was bothering spicer could not if it ever emerged be damaging to the reputation of the regiment mightve been the onset of mental illness mightve been something personal or foolish or what do they think it might be james didnt reply share means share james twoway street merrily waited james sat there for some moments concretejawed she guessed he often wondered where hed be now if he hadnt been dragged out of the army after the sudden death of his father to pull what remained of the estate together not too successfully as it had turned out savitch was the squire now she began to lose patience maybe i need to consult my boss before this goes any further james looked up sharply who are we talking about the bishop oh he looked relieved dunmore well yes of course absolutely fine apparently you could only take that one way small county with a long history of cooperation between church and military it felt like the walls were closing in on her with a sinister splintering of old brittle wattle though wed rather you said nothing to the other chap james said owen merrily let the mugs come down clunk on the table james smiled ruefully chin sinking into his tie complicated times mrs watkins even in our own little world savitch bidding to buy the swan heart of the community he coughed apart from the church of course no you were right the first time should talk again james stood up looking sorrowfully down at the spillage on the table but i think you understand where were coming from broadly speaking and ah perhaps it is a little late for coffee after james had gone jane was still in the parlour sitting on the sofa but the tv sound was off and she was talking into her mobile yeah she was saying ill consider it when she came off the phone and didnt ask whod been here well absence of curiosity was often a sign that jane had something of her own to conceal and when it was weighted with a muted fury which couldnt have been more apparent if the kid had been slashing the sofa that was eirion jane said tossing the phone onto a cushion as csi miami played silently on the tv shiny flawless technopuppets moving in digitized choreography against glass walls and orange skies how is he merrily said bit bored with university he isnt doing anything just learning stuff most of which he isnt going to need his fifteenth year of learning weird when you think about it the whole university thing like your mental energy levels are about as high as theyre ever going to be and it just gets poured down the system was that what the rage was about some acrimony with eirion and then you come out in serious financial debt jane said to them with no guarantee of meaningful work its a scam eirion reckons if they can get a stack of foreign students paying an arm and a leg theyre more than happy on the box a beautiful pathologist with uncovered glossy hair and perfect makeup wielded an electric handsaw and a dead mans brainpan was eased away like the top of a softboiled egg without appearing to notice what was on the screen jane switched it off i might get an early night merrily sat up in bed the rain had stopped no vehicles on the streets only the occasional flattened notes of footfalls on the cobbles the clawpatter of a dog on a lead townies talked about escaping to the country but there was no escape out here everybody knew where to find you too much had happened today none of it good but there was still work to do under the bedside lamp she read mother julians account of changing skin colours on the dead christ half his face coated in dried blood merrily marked the place with a postit sticker there had to be a logical sequence for this meditation and it should be stored in her head no sitting at the top of the nave with a clipboard just a low and steady voice minimal inflection not a preachers voice julians voice she worked with the book for an hour until around midnight applying more postits syd hadnt used them pages of his deliverance handbook had been folded seemingly at random as if simply to mark his place the book was uncaredfor as though hed carried it around in his pockets and then thrown it at the wall because he couldnt find what he needed you picked it up and you could almost feel the frustration shed left it downstairs with julian of norwich shed been thinking there would at least be distance of course there wasnt after six centuries mother julian was upclose and breathing resisting impulses to look away from the horror because she knew that while she gazed on the cross her soul was safe apart from the cross she had no assurance interesting merrily stopped work went to the window and prayed for the capacity to interpret and to understand what had driven syd spicer on that final exercise then the bedside phone rang merrily me barry you aint gone to bed or nothing only i phoned big liz shell be happy to talk to you on the understanding its off the record wasnt planning to use it in a sermon barry you er havent spoken to james bulldavies by any chance no not for a couple of days anyway look youll need to make it earlyish tomorrow lizs got her first easter guests arriving after lunch start of the season can you do nine prompt and wear the vicar kit thatll impress her merrily dreamed of having to watch a postmortem on jesus christ several of them in a gallery overlooking the table james bulldavies stooped and solemn william lockley behind his lord kitchener moustache and in the darkest corner syd spicer with his steady softtoys gaze she kept walking away from the metal table and out of the door then finding herself walking back into the morgue through a different door watching and worrying because the wounds of jesus christ as listed in the new testament did not include a circle of black stitches between the eyes and the halo where the top of his skull had been sewn back on blue sparks when the mobile whined bliss was camped in front of the massed ranks of cctv monitors in the big telly room you talk yeh give me five minutes annie howe said if its not a good time good as any tonight looked like rich fords reasoning had been well offbeam in the aftermath of the carnage it was unnaturally quiet on the night streets of hereford theyd spotted a handful of blokes who roughly fitted the inexact descriptions given by carly horne and joss singleton but nobody worth more than a mild tug bliss signalled to vaynor to keep tabs and went downstairs and out to the car park and called annie back i was gonna give it another halfhour and then stagger off home whats your day been like weve set up a phone line specifically for reporting rural crime anything suspicious anything which we may live to regret as we pursue flytippers and kids stealing apples on the positive side we may actually have a response to the coded appeal for the guy who saw the man covered with blood and i had to let stagg go for a while when this sas chaplain was found anything in that looked borderline suspicious at first but it doesnt seem to be nothing much for us to do they look after their own it was spitting again bliss moved under the awning by the door where are you home thought about staying with dad decided that wasnt a good idea ah the tv i saw you handled it well bliss had done six tv interviews including satellite only one reporter had slipped in a rogue question you feeling more comfortable on an urban case inspector they didnt use it far as i know maybe theyll save it for if the ruralcops issue comes up again ah yes annie said which it well might im afraid here it comes bliss moved out into the rain annie said the chief constables had an email document copied to both mps from countryside defiance containing what purports to be a list of over two hundred unsolved rural crimes in this division over the past year like what theft of equipment and vehicles arson damage to property a rural bus company having seats repeatedly slashed yeh by a rival bus firm if its the one im thinking of point of honour for some of these redneck bastards to settle their own scores half your rural crimes its stuff they keep to themselves feudlinked neighbours with a grudge leaving each others gates open cutting fences according to countryside defiance annie said some farmers apparently have given up reporting crimes because theyre tired of wasting hours of the working day balls on worthless interviews and statements when in the end no one is ever arrested and they never get their property back most thefts from farms are twats in vans cruising the lanes seeing whats unlocked chancers from the west midlands south wales its not organized what are we supposed to do about that put all the dozens of friggin patrol cars we havent got into hundreds of miles of twisty little lanes stop and search you imagine how well thatd go down and theres something else annie said at some point bliss forgot where he was finding himself the other side of the main road by the steps to the magistrates court some drunk staring at him from under a street lamp it was pissing down now reminding him of the night during the floods when hed doorstepped annies dad and come off worst go home boy charlies finest sneer go back to liverpool or wherever it was you crawled from long outstayed your welcome down yere exdetective chief superintendent charlie howe former head of hereford cid it was all different now the organization more remote bliss had met the chief constable just the once he recalled a mildmannered bloke not a big sense of humour but that had never been a qualification the fucker wants me out essentially yes he told you on the bluetooth this morning didnt he on your way to east street i didnt say anything then because i didnt really think he was serious and it didnt seem a good time to discuss it the cowardly twat francis theyre all the same its a difficult job at a difficult time difficult time the drunk was still staring at him bliss lowered the phone advanced on him will you piss off a sardonic rubbery grin and a finger and the drunk moonwalked away im sorry annie said its kneejerk and its probably unjust and its a small county not quite set in stone not yet if hes told you annie its as friggin good as hes told me because hes heard theres a longstanding hostility between us hes told me because hes hoping ill expedite it i imagine he thinks ill quite enjoy expediting it he say how he expects it done the usual its to be made clear to you quietly that di is very much as far as youre going if you stay here other opportunities will be aimed in your direction bliss stood with his face tilted into the rain letting it come francis im going home im switching off no listen that annie sounded tired and distressed thats not the half of it bliss sat in his kitchen until getting on three am under the naked bulb from which kirsty had taken the lampshade one of the clutch of lowenergy bulbs that came free from the lecky company coiled white tubes like frozen intestine hed been picturing annies incident room her little outpost at mansels yard a message to the farmers were here for you and were local people maybe you remember my father maybe you were in his lodge bliss stood up took his mug to the sink and held it under the tap with both hands for too long numbingly cold water cascading over his wrists remembering something else charlie had said that night in the rain you never deserved kirsty nice girl good sensible head on her shoulders well rid of you boy well rid small county he turned away from the sink hands dripping staring at the bright new brass lock on the back door the locks had been changed now front and back kirsty would never again get in to sniff the sheets check the bathroom cabinet for cosmetic anomalies the kitchen cabinet where the brazilian decaff was the only bit of exotica that annie had ever introduced it was now entirely possible that annie would never come here again with her overnight bag and her expensive brazilian decaff bliss dried his hands switched off the coiled bulb and went and sat down at the table in the dark in his head he was joining the wires they ran from his fatherinlaw chris symonds wouldbe gentleman farmer to sollers bull who knew the family to charlie howe who knew the family and what about lord walford sollerss fatherinlaw and former member of the police authority former made no odds hed still have the contacts chris symonds says you consistently neglected your wife mr bliss had it actually come from kirsty no stranger to false memory syndrome his wife of course i wont be doing anything about it hes not worth it ill just be glad never to have to see him again bliss could still hear annies voice in the mobile as he was standing in the rain outside the mags court the words still tight in his head like a migraine abuse physical confused at first im not getting this annie hadnt realized who she was talking about theyre saying that your abuse of your wife also had a physical dimension and then who who who who hed been screaming into the phone until he realized that might make him sound like someone who easily lost it and lashed out at his wife there was no abuse do you understand annie making his voice very calm physical or otherwise or if there was it was onesided she knows that all too well well of course she knew it but that didnt matter didnt matter whether he had or he hadnt didnt matter in a small county bliss sat there in the dark head in his hands remembering as he often did the first time hed seen the dci as a woman opening her front door to him on a december night wearing the jeans and the loose stripy top hair down glasses on the end of her nose those little blue sparks of static electricity maybe he shouldve seen the way this would go sometimes i dont like you just last night and then this morning in her car after her bluetooth discussion with the chief im adapting to instructions francis its what i do adapt known for it thing was he had seen the way it might go his eyes had been open the whole way he knew what annie was and what he wasnt after that unexpected glorious compatibility on the night theyd nailed steve furneaux together hed been fully prepared for a slow descent into the old brittle vipertongued daytoday disparaging a relationship as workable as a frozen toilet and here was the really sad bit had even been willing to endure it for those brief moments of defrosting the hairdown glassesontheendofthenose moments the blue sparks bliss parted his hands and let his forehead come down on the tabletop again and again and again part four yet in all this i wanted as far as i dared to get a real sight of hell and purgatory julian of norwich revelations of divine love a soul in camouflage abruptly big liz rose went over to a sprawling oak sideboard and came back with a green cardboard folder which she handed to merrily just in case you thought we were never happy liz had wide grey eyes and copious white hair pulled back into more of a cob than a bun and she was big tall wideshouldered wearing a long sheepskin waistcoat in the wedding picture she looked bashful in a complicated white veiled headdress and the man shed married was all smouldering hero in his morning suit and winged collar with his thick dark hair he could be very charming liz said always good with my parents that was half the battle then they were sitting near a bay window in a highceilinged mauvey chintzy sitting room with a wide stone fireplace and a view across the golden valley to the black mountains my father before i got married he said elizabeth youre going to have to be very strong stronger than an ordinary wife and very discreet for the rest of your life and youll have to make allowances because these are not ordinary men your father was in the army no just very patriotic and colin being a career soldier in an elite regiment he could do no wrong im not very good at people i just go along with things colin jones right how long have you lived here the stone farmhouse at allensmore south of hereford was victorian and lofty big bones like liz there was a small crenellated tower in the roof aligned to the front porch with its double doors it was my parents house my mother started the bedandbreakfast side i grew up here and they always said that when colin came out of the regiment theyd sell the grounds retire and move into a cottage and let us take over the house at the time colin seemed delighted but liz gave a small helpless shrug i didnt realize then that was only because it would give me something to do keep me occupied while he did other work what kind of other work he took a job with one of the privatesecurity companies in hereford went abroad for weeks at a time as a bodyguard to various businessmen it was a bit on and off and then it stopped that was when he started to write his books nonstop once hed started one early morning till late at night he had a lot of energy too much for ordinary things he didnt get involved with your business here wanted nothing to do with it we had separate lives almost well except for sex and that was liz looked away out of the bay window never very loving but i made allowances anyway she placed her hands primly in her lap there we are i suppose i thought they were all like that oh dear she blew out a short startled breath then sat back looking a little surprised as if shed let herself be tricked into saying too much merrily looked around at the nests of chairs and coffee tables and saw why byron jones might have found it hard to settle here even the bookshelves had ornaments on them little wooden boxes and china figurines and what might have been golf trophies widely spaced lizs second husband was out playing golf apparently it seemed likely shed arranged this meeting for early in the day not as barry had said because she was expecting guests after lunch but because she knew that this morning theyd be alone big liz owed barry shed met him on a tourism course when byron left barry had helped her keep the business afloat attract some grants leading you to think that barry had been sorry for her and maybe knew more about byron than hed revealed last night as for liz she was oddly incurious hadnt once asked why a vicar might want to know about her first marriage it seemed enough that merrily had been sent by barry id begun to think it was all history then barry rang and told me about syd lizs face became glum oh dear you never know what you should or shouldnt say im still a bit of a patriot like my dad where did you meet colin disco in hereford i didnt go very often but my cousin was staying with us and she was all for that kind of thing it wasnt very long after the iranian embassy siege in london when the regiment rescued the hostages and they were national heroes and all the girls in hereford do you remember that perhaps youd be too young well i wasnt living here then but i can imagine what it was like madness they were like pop stars it was when young men started pretending they were in the regiment just to get the girls colin though i didnt even find out that he was one of them not for a while he was actually one of the team who got into the embassy no no just in the regiment though he never made a thing out of it never in fact not long after we got engaged he said he was thinking of leaving hed had enough but he didnt go until he had to and by then he didnt want to you mentioned something being history what was that clouds were lowering like a big gloved hand over the southern black mountains and the air was occasionally ripped by the screams of duelling chainsaws from middledistant woodland yes liz said eventually the trouble between colin and syd i may have mentioned it to barry once im trying to clear up a few things syd and i worked together in the merrily lifted a hand to her dog collar liz nodded as if she understood said she thought colin and syd had been quite close friends in the regiment so she was pleased at first when syd had turned up one afternoon not long after the publication of the first book just passing through syd had said colin had been out when he arrived and he said hed wait and they had a pot of tea syd and liz and quite a long chat syd had not long been ordained as a minister and liz remembered hed said it was as if his innocence had been restored i think it was something hed been building up to coming to see colin not just passing at all did they meet in the end it was a sunday colin had been out shooting as soon as he walked in i sensed it was like an encounter between two hostile wild animals colin still had his shotgun and a bag with what hed shot wood pigeons i think standing there with his gun under his arm i said well im sure you two have a lot to catch up on i was uncomfortable the whole atmosphere had changed and i realized there was something badly wrong between them i dont think they even noticed me go out so you didnt hear what they talked about i didnt want to liz looked agitated i shut myself in the kitchen and put the radio on loud classic fm if thered been guests in i dont know what idve done but it was out of season i heard syd shout in quite an anguished voice theyre dead theyre all dead now didnt see him leave who might he have meant all dead liz looked out of the window there was a long view over pastureland channelled by woodland to the foothills of the black mountains and then the smoky shelf of the mountains themselves i dont know my dear colin never mentioned it afterwards i do know that resolving a dispute with colin was never easy he didnt forgive anyone quickly if at all and of course he always seemed to despise the church even though we were married in one i didnt like to mention that before with you being he once said christianity was not a mans religion certainly not a soldiers religion so could the antagonism between colin and syd have been anything to do with the fact that syd had taken up a religion that colin had no time for merrily shifted in the squashy chair for a moment there shed felt something of syd spicer in the place the quietness of him almost an absence a soul in camouflage possibly i dont know liz said i thought this sounds silly but i kept thinking it was something to do with the books the books had started not long before byron had left the privatesecurity company in hereford when the foreign jobs had become fewer hed begun talking about all the money that guys like the man known as andy mcnab were making from sas memoirs and spinoff novels liz took merrily upstairs where there were five bedrooms off the landing the doors of all of them hanging open a scent of fresh linen and a light musk from a dish of potpourri on a window sill five doors open one closed narrow gothicshaped midway along the landing the tower room where byron had written his books a lot of controversy at the time about sas memoirs the ministry of defence didnt like it and colin thought they were right when some new regulations were imposed to make it harder for them he thought that was good he always said that what he was doing wouldnt affect national security in the least because his books werent about the sas well not directly this is the ancient britons the celts against the romans he said all he was doing was using his experience of close combat to show what it was really like he was going to be the first writer to really get inside the heads of the old warriors he used to go running up the hill where theres a celtic fort credenhill but i thought no the other one dinedor the old stirling lines was close to it that was interesting the sas had moved its headquarters from the shadow of one iron age fortified hill to a site directly below another i think some roman remains were also found around the camp itself and he was very interested in that he joined a local history group in fact lizs forehead furrowed im not sure they didnt actually form it themselves while still in the regiment hed read a lot of books by the time he left he knew all about the celts and the romans and he had this idea about caractacus who he called caradog the welsh name colins family was from wales although he was born in london the later books were written in the first person as if he was caradog you know ive only seen the first one he was furious when publishers kept turning him down one of them said it had all been done before and colin rang the man up and raged at him no this has never been done before you effing idiot was it always going to be for children oh no no it wasnt it made him furious when the only publisher who was interested said it should be written for children he said he was going to forget the whole thing then the publisher came to see him a woman i think shed persuaded him it was going to make a lot of money how many has he written five hed stopped by the time we parted he was quite bitter used to say theyd led him on with lies about selling the books all over the world but they only ever sold one to america and the americans demanded all kinds of changes which made him angry his publishers kept saying it would build a readership when it became a series but it never really happened it was always going to be the next one liz unlocked the door of the tower room and the potpourri scent followed them up four steps from the landing the room was westfacing whitepainted walls one small window no furniture only cleaning utensils bathroom sprays and bumper packs of toilet tissue hed shut himself in here for whole days he could go a long time without meals i was glad at first when the publishers wanted him to go to schools and talk to children to promote the books but he hated that he didnt particularly like children or pets an encumbrance he didnt like encumbrances liz looked down at the boarded floor had she wanted children and byron hadnt wouldnt make any concessions in the books to young people i tried to read them but i had to skip some of it scenes where people are garrotted and worse there was a lot of bad feeling with the publishers in the end his editor she rang one day when he was out very upset he didnt like having a woman edit his books she sounded quite frightened actually very shrill he didnt write another one after that broke his contract but they didnt try to stop him or get any money back i think they were worried about antagonizing him any more were you frightened liz id learned to keep out of his way when he was angry i kept thinking of what my father said the pressure he mustve been under the things hed had to do he certainly never touched me in anger when things became too much hed go out walking a lot and shooting sometimes hed stay out all night i got used to it well you have to dont you liz had left the door of the tower room wide open pushed back against the wall she was standing against the frame her hair coming loose some nights he wouldnt come home and thered be no explanation i never once thought about other women he didnt like women enough i knew he went to hereford drinking with his mates and i just assumed he was unfit to drive and sleeping on someones sofa seems everyone knew except me but then im not very bright he used to say that merrily sighed liz tried vainly to pile her hair back stella who helps here told me in the end i think she was embarrassed on my behalf not like it was just one woman he was playing the field as if he was in his twenties again in the pubs and the clubs he was you know walking out with them stellas brothers a minicab driver in town and he picked colin up twice with different women drunk and all over one another in the back i was sick to my stomach and it took me a long time to ask him about it when i did he admitted it at once apologized and offered to find me a good lawyer all very businesslike how long ago was this weve been divorced exactly two and a half years married paul last year known each other since we were kids its fine its all right quieter now i was glad when colin took his books away all the secondhand books hed bought for research not the kind of books you wanted guests to see pagan religions and the occult i was always worried hed leave this door unlocked and someone would come in and dont like this room you could see the marks where bookshelves had been taken out lizs hair had come free now like a cloud of white steam she swivelled her head looking from wall to wall as if there might be blood oozing out of the plaster when he left i cleaned it out and put a bed in here a woman came to stay for two nights an older woman the outspoken type you could imagine as a magistrate miss pleston came down to breakfast next morning and straight out with it how often do you clean your rooms insisting there was a a mens stench it kept waking her up and shed had to open the window oh merrily had gone still inside the weird excitement of the unthinkable and could you smell anything i no didnt charge her for the room you cant afford that kind of talk perhaps she was making it up i dont know merrily halfturned had a discreet sniff only jeyes fluid wheres he now liz brinsop near credenhill do you know it i know of it passed the signpost hundreds of times never actually been though the church was apparently worth a visit couldnt remember why he took aerial photos hed been on a course in the army so he could take pictures from helicopters for surveillshould i be talking about this what was in the pictures well there isnt much there at brinsop just a few houses and farms and things and an old manor house on the outskirts and a church of course and lines on the more distant aerial photos hed drawn lines and marked things with crosses did he explain that kept showing me the pictures and saying what a terrific place it was and how we should live somewhere like that i didnt think he was serious then suddenly hed bought some ground he had a separate bank account for his earnings from the books and hed bought this ground before i knew anything about it about twenty acres part of a farm where theyd sold the house separately he said he could get planning permission for a bungalow or something there and convert the outbuildings for accommodation he wanted you to move to brinsop sell this house liz shook her head vaguely still baffled my father had died and my mother had gone to live with her sister in pembrokeshire and colin said there was nothing to stay here for now he said i could still do b and b well i didnt often say no to him but this house means a lot to me and it was in my name was this before he went off the rails about the same time i suppose after we separated he just moved over there he was in a mobile home apparently like a big caravan do you know why he wanted to live there to be back near the sas i dont really understand it they dont talk to you after youve gone the ones left in well they do but they dont tell you anything youre not part of the family any more he was quite bitter about that too bitter about a lot of things what does he do farm still write i think hes a consultant to one of these firms that runs these survival courses selfsufficiency and i dont really know merrily nodded picked up her bag then put it down again liz erm please say no if you think its silly or offensive but would it help at all if i did a little blessing thing in here huw owens primary rules never leave the premises without dropping a blessing or a prayer never leave anyone agitated or stressed never leave a vacuum liz looked as if she didnt quite understand and perhaps didnt want to yes all right she said thank you colleagues karen dowell was on the phone when bliss got into gaol street just after halfnine but still managed to flick him a warning look glancing at his office door which was shut someone sitting in there bliss decided that if by some serendipitous anomaly it was the chief constable hed smash the bastard before he could get up partly because the chief was bigger than him and partly because he felt like shit this morning shivery and lightheaded like when some hovering virus was figuring out if you were worth taking down and partly because it might just be the finest thing hed ever do in his life he nodded to karen opened the office door walked in with his aching head held high and it was annie howe the old annie the dark trouser suit the icemaiden white shirt the no makeup the no jewellery sitting behind his desk marking the homework bliss shut the door behind him might have slept last night but he didnt think so he remembered the sun coming up before his wideopen eyes before the clouds had smothered it hed got up drunk a whole pot of tea hoping that annie might call him from malvern before either of them left for work nothing if youve gorra screwdriver on you annie ill take me name off the door im meeting a witness at ten annie stacked the reports looked up at him why im here rather than oldcastle i thought you might like to sit in witness to what a man in a field covered in blood oh agreed to meet in town if we can protect his identity actually it was the girlfriend who rang in from a mobile im meeting them at gilbeys told her i might be accompanied but that wouldnt change anything they walked up towards high town well apart on the pavement annie was wearing a grey doublebreasted jacket a long white woollen scarf i do hope the chief realizes this wont be bloodless bliss said dont do anything stupid there may be room for manoeuvre rather be out than have this shite chuck in me papers youre being ridiculous annie quickened her pace nobody wants you out of the job might even simply be a case of staying in west mercia just leaving the division no no no no rage ripping into bliss as he caught her up on the corner near the zebra crossing you dont understand do you ive only gorra close me eyes and i can see them kairsty and her old man sollers bull and his friggin fatherinlaw from the house of friggin lords all the foreign hunters behind countryside defiance and the tweedy twats who like to think they still control this county and the chiefs just watching his back its how they survive and right there in the middle your old man charlie howe with one hand held out for the money and the other making some masonic sign corruptions embedded in this county annie like like the blue bits in danish friggin blue try and cut yourself a slice that isnt riddled with it you could say that of just about anywhere yeh well i dont live just about anywhere and one thing ive noticed is that when they go down the bad guys when they go down in hereford its always the outsiders they turned along the narrow passage leading to gilbeys bar where the citys movers and shakers occasionally moved and shook in its own secluded little space up against the back of st peters church we have to sit outside annie headed for the farthest table under a tree and in the shadow of the steeple you go and order some coffee ill wait here in case hes early do we need pink carnations inside bliss scanned the clientele a few faces that he vaguely recognized fortunately nobody he actually knew hed thought maybe annie had asked him along because she had something encouraging to say to him about how theyd fight this thing together but that evidently was not going to happen when he came out there was a woman sitting with annie midthirties paleskinned windstraggled blonde hair tucked into the collar of her red leather jacket this is my colleague francis bliss annie said francis this is janette jan the woman said bliss sat down the other side of jan and when will your friend be joining us she wont jan said bliss looked at annie who smiled colourlessly jan is our witness francis it took a moment ah bliss said jan told them she was taking up an appointment after easter as head teacher at a local primary school bliss said you mean out there in the sticks out there yes jan said the person shed been with in the car on the night of mansel bulls murder was married but wouldnt be for long theyd been at college together found one another again after fifteen years she was the reason jan had come looking for work in the hereford area there might not be complications with either parents or governors but there just might its necessary to be discreet and take things slowly this is after all a rural area youre quite right there jan bliss said it very much is he wondered if her girlfriend was fairly well known in the area and if the husband had any inkling jan still looked nervous you wont get me to give evidence in court you do accept that annie said we can talk about that later there wont be a later if i dont get an assurance annie howe nodded at least they got an accurate location a good halfmile from where theyd stopped searching for blood traces in the fields covered some ground this guy the access involved several unmarked singletrack lanes there was a derelict barn you couldnt miss jan said and the ungated field entrance was about fifty yards after that bliss made notes asked her if shed seen any other vehicles on the way there and jan shook her head said nobody lived up there any more ive walked that whole area im staying in a guest house at tillington about three miles away looking for a cottage so ive done a lot of exploring around essential preparation for taking over a local school kids can be evil wee sods if they think youre an innocent abroad and your friend shes local do we have to go into that bliss shrugged credenhill jan said though not originally bliss didnt react was it possible that jan was snuggling up to some sas mans missus while he was in foreign parts thatd make anybody nervous in your letter annie said you called mansel farmer bull was that how your girlfriend knew him its what they called him in the local shop bliss said when you saw this man in the field did you also see any sign of a vehicle offroad perhaps or any other people we didnt hang around if im honest out there in the middle of nowhere it was pretty frightening wed only just arrived so we still had the engine running and the headlights on when he came rushing out of the dark as if hed been blown out by the wind you say you couldnt see his face what about his hair i think he had hair i mean i dont recall him as bald or anything but it couldve been slicked back with the with the blood i dont know tall short thin fat he certainly seemed tall and wellbuilt i suppose and quite fit id imagine the way he was moving i go to the gym twice a week but you wouldnt get me out running in those conditions let me play devils advocate here annie said how do you know it was blood how do you know he wasnt simply plastered with mud red herefordshire mud and then i heard about the murder afterwards you mean and put two and two together and made eleven you wouldnt be the first to make that kind of mistake in a situation like that chief inspector i spent many hours agonizing over whether to send you that letter knowing that if it got out that a respectable married woman was having a relationship with a gay woman who was about to become head teacher at the school attended by her children yeh ok bliss said what did he do this feller when he saw you stopped i mean he had to or hedve run into the front of the car then he turned away and ran off almost casually as if he was an athlete running for pleasure and he was full of endorphins you know what was his you know his mood you gerra sense of that it was this is going to sound crazy but it was as if he was loving it despite all the blood obviously we thought it must be his own blood and you think even as youre backing the car away youre thinking does he need help and yet that really wasnt like he was relishing the blood bliss said im thinking the way a new huntsman a foxhunter when its his first time they splatter him with the foxs blood blisss eyes met annies saw a flickering warning there he smiled im afraid ive had nothing to do with blood sports jan said annie asked her do you think he saw you i dont know he mustve seen what kind of a car you had and if you backed up and accelerated out of there he must have known youd seen him bliss said he watched jan playing nervously with a stray blonde curl women of a sapphic persuasion it wasnt as easy to identify them any more in a few ways she was more girlie than annie i did think of that yes jan said another very good reason not to want to be identified wouldnt you say bliss said if we were to show you some piccies felt annie howes head coming round on him with the weight of a gun turret it would be very unlikely that id recognize anybody from a photograph jan said as i say it was all terribly fast and rather blurred bliss saw the waitress leaving the doorway of the bar with their coffee and cups on a tray what about your friend she saw less than i did screaming her poor wee head off by then i firmly trust you werent actually going to do that annie said that you were saying it just to annoy me jan had left they knew where to find her bliss licked his spoon why not itd be with a selection of other photos planting the idea that west mercia police suspect sollers bull of killing his brother got that twats prints all over it telling her about his and karens visit to magnis berries last night and the reason annie scowled bliss shrugged dont tell me you wouldntve done the same as it happens i did know about mansel selling the land to magnis done behind sollerss back according to sollers it was a decision made without much forethought mansel was using those top fields for training his sheepdogs and then simply decided hed had enough the offer came and he took it shortly before he was killed hed arranged to sell all his dogs to berrows from kington who youll know jeremy hes taken them all five dogs thats a bit odd isnt it whats so odd about it apart from the timing mansel presumably didnt know he was going to be murdered hed lost the patience for it according to sollers not winning trophies any more thats all it is bliss said nothing sat and looked at annie sitting with her jacket open her long woollen scarf hanging loose the slender neck the carelessly brushed pale hair right annie said wed better get back ill send slim fiddler to find that field and ill make sure he goes over every last blade of grass good luck bliss contemplated the oval miniature of his own face wizened into the sugar spoon spent a couple of cliffedge seconds reconsidering his decision not to tell annie about kirstys first little bombshell when it all comes out wont one of you have to move to another division isnt that how it works annie said presumably you didnt get anything useful from magnis berries nothing of immediate significance no annie stood up buttoning her jacket the tower and steeple of st peters in the wedge of white sky behind her for a moment bliss thought she was smiling as she looked down at him then she said dont dont what dont assure me again that you never hit your wife i believe you however for the foreseeable future she tucked a twopound coin under the coffee pot i think we need to be colleagues what colleagues annie said people who work together burned halfway along the golden valley a green hill bounced up on the right its summit shaped by the earthen ramparts of another british camp tiny compared with credenhill but they were everywhere a whole layer of landscape sculpted by ancient britons still here still dominant merrily was driving slowly under clouds like the rolling smoke from a grass fire shed brought a flask of holy water up from the car and done the blessing with liz an appeal for calm and light in an oppressed place most times you were uncertain an unaccountable manstench in the towerroom wishful thinking miss pleston and yet a faint sensation of something resistant had come back at her and shed walked downstairs feeling unexpectedly drained maybe she was just overtired and underfed or affected by the mindaltering properties of jeyes fluid no barry had been right byron jones was not funny it wouldve been interesting to see the books hed kept in the tower old pagan religions and the occult merrily thought about the people of the hilltop camps whose priests had been druids talk to jane and they were kindly natureworshippers and all they ever used a sickle for was cutting down mistletoe read the roman accounts and you got blooddrenched savages well into human sacrifice they probably didnt smell too good either in the straggling village of peterchurch she pulled into the parking area opposite the norman church called home to check the machine and found just the one message merrily this is fiona spicer i think we have loose ends a voice still perfectly contained wholly together a widow of one day merrily sat staring across the parking area at a childrens playground which looked like a small power station lit a cigarette and called fiona lol had been in danny thomass barn since eight danny was walking up and down in the straw rehearsing a verse of trackway man talking it into the mic among the hills where shepherds watch well march towards the skyline notch from tump to twt well mark the route what the hells a twt lol i thought you were welsh im from radnorshire it ent quite the same i thought it was a radnorshire word i dunno maybe a burial mound a small tump rhymes with route anyway thats all that matters this dont seem like your kind o song somehow danny said them biblical quotes at the start set me up waymarks writes jeremiah lol explained how alfred watkins had collected bits from the bible which seemed to support the idea of ley lines he was thinking it would be quite good to use them with a kind of monastic echo resonant just trying to connect danny you were born here im just dont know passing through just cause you lives yere it dont necessarily mean you connects danny squatted down in the straw between a vintage marshall amp and jimi the sheepdog did once mind had what you might call a spiritual experience where i seen the poetic truth of ley lines looked at the veins in my wrist and seen the arteries of the countryside magic that was i thought it was acid well aye it was but a visions a vision ennit bloody hell what a long time ago that was i was only a kid thirteen fourteen you were dropping acid at thirteen very progressive area radnorshire in the ole days boy sides nobody knowed back then what it could do to your brain radnorshire danny grinned then abruptly his face was solemn seen much of young jane past day or so uh not really that business in the swan where she poured that fellers beer got a bit overshadowed that did when the word come in about mansel bull an ill wind never seen her like that before serious the changes round yere gettin to her savitch getting to all of us one way or another only gomer and me we got a problem danny said fiona said no commiserations sympathy cards i wont even open dont want to be treated like an invalid when youve lived with a vicar you know all the bereavement rituals merrily thought naked grief was easier to handle youre not still on your own are you emilys on the way up to hereford with her boyfriend and i have things to organize better than thinking im sorry we didnt get a chance to talk last night and im grateful for what you did and what you might have done if we if wed been in time you will take the funeral well if you i dont do quickies fiona whats that mean well it doesnt mean endless eulogies but there are things i need to understand whatever he wouldnt tell me its not going to rebound on him now which is one reason ive just been over to allensmore to talk to byron joness exwife that was quick when you were talking about the books that syd was reading back in the cathedral i dont recall you mentioned byron jones so when i found that book with the others i was certainly surprised to see a copy of that book on the desk a pause ok the last time i saw one was when we were at wychehill a parcel arrived one day with a copy of caradog inside newly published this was when they were still friends i thought they were a short time afterwards i opened the wood stove because it seemed to be nearly out and you know how you can tell something used to be a book for just a second before the ashes collapse syd burned the book without even reading it he never explained though he now seems to have acquired another copy they were good friends once byron was a bit older than sam he came out of the army first but they stayed in touch was syd in byrons localhistory group his what liz says byron was in or might even have set up a society to study the history around stirling lines romanobritish history the inference being that this was where he got much of the background for his fiction i know nothing about that though its hardly something youd need to keep secret liz said byron despised christianity not sure if he despised it quite so much before sam got into it sam was hyper at that time his groundtoair missile period merrily shifted in her seat looked over towards peterchurchs norman church with its fibreglass steeple it was called the st peters centre now and it had a cafe and a library was this what uncle ted had in mind for ledwardine which reminded her there was a parish council meeting tonight to discuss it bugger she said you do know about syd going to visit byron at lizs place when was this liz said two or three years after byron left the regiment possibly around the time caradog was published would that have been after the burning of the book i didnt know that sam had ever visited byron fiona said or imagined hed want to what did liz say about it merrily told her everything including the shotgun which provoked a short sour laugh perhaps he felt he needed it as protection turning the other cheek was the one christian premise i always felt sam could never quite swallow youve met liz one or twice at funerals walking metaphorically half a pace behind byron theyre often the ones who get hurt in the end wholesale philandering goes with the territory like vikings but not sam sam was a misfit who didnt know what he wanted or where he wanted to be the army straightened him out for a while religion messed him up again did he ever mention brinsop who its a hamlet near credenhill where byron lives where according to liz he seems to think its very important for him to live syd ever mention it no and if you were thinking of going to visit him id urge you not to some of these guys theres another side to them which is great in warfare but in ordinary life relatively antisocial fiona do you have any idea what all this is about you mustve given me those books for a reason kneejerk reaction probably a mistake i dont know anything about deliverance and wordsworth no idea what thats about either merrily i have to go have people to see solicitors and whoever you see to register a death im sorry danny pulled down a squared bale of straw and sat on it likely you dont know much about cockfighting well me neither us ole hippies we never done that stuff foreign to our nature but it went on round here part o country life country folks was cruel too danny reached over and turned off the amp gomer found a dead gamecock in the vicars shed turns out young jane put it there told gomer a feller dumped the sack in a bin on the square feller was this cornel oh lol closed his eyes god you ent lookin as surprised as i figured you might be no lol pulled the boswell across his knees and told danny about what he and merrily had watched in the swan the night before last only we got the impression from barry that it was a pheasant he still stayin at the swan this cornel i think he just comes in for meals now i dont know where hes staying how did jane know it was a fighting cock her didnt gomer knowed straight off gomers on the case ent nothin gomer wouldnt do for jane is there jeez why they gotter danny pulled off his baseball cap sent it spinning to the straw cockfights they tells us were in recession so we gotter degrade ourselves by stagin cockfights for the freakin tourists who who dyou think you really think savitch would risk his reputation by supporting something illegal and universally condemned gomer phoned around farmers dealers drew a blank wherever its happenin it ent at no farms round yere gotter be some bastard from off now where was the ole ledwardine cockpit lol shook his head ill tell you danny said up by the top bridge where the river come through in the floods used to be a pub there knocked down seventy eighty year ago you can still see the outline they reckons like a depression middle of a copse now cockpit was back o that pub so that lol stroked a sinister eminor on the boswell would be on the ground bought up by the court last summer when wassname wickhams sold up youre saying that whatever remains of the old ledwardine cockpit is now owned by ward savitch suddenly lol could see why this just might be savitch all for traditions the first man to stage a cockfight in ledwardine for a century or whatever even if he only did it once or twice for selected guests jane know about the cockpit not yet boy see the problem case closed far as janes concerned and it looks very likely doesnt it i mean how else would cornelve been to a cockfight exackly danny stood up strapping on his telecaster so whats gomer do now boy do he tell her or dont he bein as how hers likely to go off like a rocket even if savitch wasnt charged with anything lol said thinking hard it would make him a figure of hate sure to would you be able to tell if you saw the pit whether it had been used recently gomer might but private land now big fences not this weekend its open to the public on easter monday still be restricted access public wont get near an active cockpit lol said tomorrow however laying down the boswell in a manger full of last years straw he told danny about savitchs visit and the offer of a site for an openair music event half afraid that danny whose musical aspirations had been frustrated for so long would see it as a onceinalifetime opportunity to stage some kind of welsh border woodstock danny sniffed and smiled ent life a bitch so ive got these two tickets for the press launch and reception for invited guests be far more informal fewer stewards not much security right if i gave the tickets to you and gomer would you be able to maybe find out one way or another a short worried whine came out of jimi the sheepdog as danny stood up gripped the telecaster around the bottom of its neck pulling it hard to his gut what time compers bling at one stage the narrow lane to brinsop pointed you directly at a wooded flank of credenhill you felt that if it didnt veer off soon youd vanish into a green mouth the first time merrily missed the turning to the church then spotted in the rearview mirror what might be a bell tower at approaching midday a pale blue hole in the clouds was broadening into a small lagoon she reversed into the next track and the long hill fell away to the side nobody about no other vehicles no village plenty of fields woodland a few dwellings and a church on its own set apart merrilys stomach was hurting really needed something to eat maybe she should go home only twenty minutes away three warnings about byron jones secretive embittered obsessive she didnt want to find him not yet just to get a hint of what in brinsop had caught his eye the church was at the end of a private track with weeds growing up the middle a sprinkling of homes old and newish barns and sheds and then the volvo was up against a fenced field of ewes and lambs a dead end with the churchyard alongside raised up jane maintained that an elevated churchyard always indicated a former pagan ritual site but then for jane signs of paganism were everywhere ok merrily stayed in the car and leaned back easing the pressure on her stomach do this properly she pulled her bag onto her knees and consulted her contacts book dick willis priest in charge of the credenhill cluster of churches a cautious guy not far off retirement the signal here wasnt good but she got him ah brinsop he said the jewel in my crown im afraid ive never been before then i mustnt spoil it for you merrily is there a problem there i certainly havent heard of one but when one hears out of the blue from your good self do you know a guy called byron jones colin jones ah now that would be the man with the private army base say that again i exaggerate he calls it the compound once a pig farm a mile or so out of what used to be the village the farm became derelict the house was sold off and this chap bought the land lived there in a caravan then suddenly built this rather lavish bungalow as if hed come into money what did you mean by private army not an army a base he has a training area with an assault course and all that sort of thing he run courses for military enthusiasts and the place is done out like a real army base with high wire fencing and authentic warning signs part of the mystique i suppose looks more secret and exciting than the actual sas place down the road boys will always be boys merrily he had planning permission for all this not always needed and some of the objectors were appeased when at his own expense he planted extensive woodland to conceal the site that was about a year ago mr jones is exsas i believe well yes that always helps doesnt it especially in this area does he come to church if he does its not when theres a service on dick willis said the sun was just visible through the cloud like a pound coin in a handkerchief as merrily got out and locked the car she shook herself felt a little better the site was fairly remote but the churchyard was well looked after nothing overgrown here and most of the uncrowded gravestones were upright a huge sentinel evergreen stood beyond the wooden gate looking taller than the church which sat behind it under the hill a compact greystone church with a conical belltower more central wales than herefordshire but comfortable in its lusher ground and the site jane might well be interested different levels perhaps a suggestion of earthworks and across the lowest field beyond the church a small darkgreen lake or a big reeded pond or possibly a moat all woodedin a lovely spot really this was one of those churches that had had to be here jane would say had to be here sacred ground long before christianity merrily walked past the church porch towards the water and was pulled up by a name on a gravestone directly in front not ornate but tall and prominently sited and making an instant connection with one of the paperbacks on syd spicers desk sacred to the memory of jane winder who was born at keswick cumberland and died at brinsop court in this parish october in the year of her age this stone is erected by william and mary wordsworth of rydal mount westmoreland in affectionate and grateful remembrance of her faithful services continued through fifteen years good god merrily began to tingle that sense of the preordained a piece of an unknown jigsaw the piece that slotted in to tell you there was a jigsaw william and mary rydal mount westmoreland the wordsworths the wordsworths were here she walked back to the porch went in always the same when you approached an unknown church that frisson of mild apprehension as you turned the ring handle some resistance but the door wasnt locked it gave and she went in and whatever she was expecting perhaps given the location something frugal cold drab rudimentary it wasnt no smell of stone or damp she made out lurking colours and not only in the windows much metallic glistening from the chancel merrily waited at the bottom of the nave waited for something to happen something to move shadows to part blimey she said to nobody she could see this was all strongly medieval medieval like in the actual middle ages a concave golden canopy was shining over the altar like the reflector on a lamp there were three gilded angels wings aggressively spread brandishing candles a treasure house out here in the deep sticks it was all so entirely unexpected as to be approaching the surreal merrily picked up a leaflet from the pile and took a seat at the back chairs lightcoloured wood not pews a lot of money had been spent since medieval times enhancing what was here the angels were confidently balanced on the top edge of the chancel screen guarding a christ on the cross a chesspiece kingly christ in a golden crown not suffering but proud and triumphant in control and when you looked more carefully you began to see all the dragons merrily came back to her feet everywhere dragons were dying there he was redcrossed in a window and here he was again more modern and explicit on a pedestal in full armour with his foot on the dragons neck his spear down its throat merrily opened the leaflet st george brinsop church was dedicated to the dragonslaying patron saint of england the leaflet said the church had been saved from certain ruin in the midnineteenth century old windows rediscovered and restored it had never looked back since acquiring much sympathetic embellishment by sir ninian comper ecclesiastical architect and gothic revivalist in the early twentieth century his work included the angels on the wooden screen and yet for all compers bling it still felt like a country church small enough to be welcoming some bright modern stained glass a st francis window with birds a first world war window with crucifixion symbolism and one in memory of wm wordsworth poet laureate a frequent sojourner in this parish back to the leaflet wordsworths wife mary had been a sister of thomas hutchinson who was leasing the twelfthcentury brinsop court the poet often spending holidays here with his wife and his sister dorothy merrily stood up feeling ignorant parochial why hadnt she known about this the next church to trahernes at credenhill traherne and wordsworth separated by more than a century but two poets with a lot in common lovers of landscape solitude nature mystics odd was it odd she walked into the chancel looked back to where the far window was halved by the bar of the screen split by the shaft of the cross this was very much a theme church st george the principal one why did you always feel sorry for the dragon instantly disliking the smug bastard with the spear the charitable view was that lance deep throat it was a piece of early sexual symbolism she padded across the nave as usual alone in a church merrily didnt feel alone but this time it wasnt just about god that little green book of wordsworth poems suggested that syd spicer had been here byron and syd byron who despised christianity not a mans religion not a soldiers religion she felt syd pondering this lighting up hed want to smoke in here too rich for syd this place wouldnt have liked the golden angels phoney high church iconography hed said of what had been inflicted on his own church at wychehill grotesque syd you just knew preferred drab damp and frugal merrily moved on to a small lady chapel with more wordsworth memorials a medieval stone coffin lid in the floor reminded her of the knights templar church at garway stories everywhere written in glass and stone many of them modern and literal but no less effective for that and then she came to what unmistakably was the real thing out of place isolated but probably predating the wall into which it was set a stone slab carved images st george again an early depiction george in dragonslaying mode but on a horse this time she consulted the leaflet originally a tympanum a piece of ornate masonry between the top of a door and the arch herefordshire romanesque she knew a bit about that early medieval the leaflet said that a stone in an adjacent field was believed to mark the actual spot where st george had killed the dragon sure the st george who apparently was turkish the dragon whose legend was set in the middle east merrily imagined syd tapping his ash on the saints helmet knowing he couldve taken george unarmed any day of the week never quite understood how saints like george fitted into the fabric of christianity a medieval thing probably an excuse for crusades brutality masquerading as valour a frenzy of pure excitement there was a whiff of cigarette smoke syd spicer was back the syd of an overheated confessional afternoon in the church at wychehill when hed used those exact words recalling the lethal focus you acquired in the regiment a frenzy of pure excitement i understand the rush you get when you convince yourself that in the great scheme of things its not only justified but necessary when you know that a difficult situation can only be resolved by an act of swift efficient intense and quite colossal violence god merrily was jerked back against the stone by a shuddering in a pocket of her jeans she fumbled out the mobile there was no sound for a couple of seconds wonky signal then fionas voice youre there arent you brinsop at the church alone yes id better tell you fiona said the having done it merrily took the phone outside and stood by the grave of the wordsworths faithful servant jane winder looking across to the possible moat the clutch of trees on what might be an island the viridian march of conifers up the flank of credenhill there was a party fiona said a publication party not for byron one of the other betterknown sas authors a friend of sams so although he didnt like parties much he thought we should go and there were a lot of people there that sam hadnt seen in years so he was doing a fair bit of catching up are you still there ill try and improve the signal merrily moved up to the high ground behind the church overlooking lumped and tiered fields where a village might once have stood the signal had moved up to two stars when was this about a month after the book was burned i hadnt been feeling well that night and sam was talking to his old mates so i slid away and sat down at a table on my own and then byron was there not liz just byron sam was conspicuously avoiding him but he came up to me very charming and attentive very smooth and elegant in his heathcliff way got me a brandy and sat down said he didnt know what he was doing here hed never particularly liked the author we were supposed to be celebrating and his book was rubbish this was in london no it was a countryhouse hotel in buckinghamshire wed decided to stay there so sam could have a few drinks all free the publishers were spending a lot of money on this guy at the time a lot more than had ever been spent on byron anyway and he seemed to be taking it as a personal slight but he was very nice to me coming out with all sorts of bullshit how he wished he had a wife like me who understood understood what oh you know what it was like leaving the regiment having to slow down your metabolism all this his metabolism didnt seem to have slowed at all he was very intense whatever he was talking about very concentrated much i suppose as youd imagine hed be on some operation behind enemy lines in fact i remember thinking perhaps that was how he saw this party someone elses wealthy publisher someone elses inferior book as though he was at war with other writers whod been in the regiment the underdog because his was a kids book this was before harry potter i presume probably there was a tremendous frustration there pretty soon hes pouring out his troubles and im trying to be sympathetic wife didnt understand him wife didnt understand anything wife was completely bovine after a while i was starting to find it repellent selfpity i can handle it was the venom i didnt like against liz against life anyway as i said i really wasnt feeling terribly well that night eventually i excused myself and went to the loo and then went out for a breath of air in the grounds which were extensive though not remote like you get round here you could always hear traffic and he was there where emerging from the bushes as though he was on an exercise the exercise being i was the exercise igod i cant believe im telling somebody about this with sam lying in a mortuary it makes me feel sick i feel sick now and i felt sick then he was drunk no i dont actually think he was i dont think he needed to be i wish i could explain what i mean by that it was as though the the night had released something in him sorry that sounds stupid not to me go on when i said i wasnt feeling well he put an arm around me and said some air might help and he walked me away from the terrace down across the lawns away from the floodlit area what could i do hed been a friend he said he wanted to talk to me seriously very focused he told me sam was making a terrible mistake in going into the church that he was throwing away his life and damaging his country and if i didnt want a life of misery i should stop him or leave him bloody hell fiona he said sam was an idiot who didnt deserve me and a coward he actually said sam was a coward and when i opened my mouth to protest he his lips were there and he started to touch me fondle me as if it was the most natural thing in the world and im going no thank you byron lets go back now i was pretty terrified naturally also terrified that sam would find us a pause merrily moved back towards the car thats not how it seems fiona said i knew that if sam had found us what wouldve happened it wouldve ended in some appalling violence but sam was becoming a priest he was trying to become a priest hed had long talks with other priests used to say there were aspects of himself hed have to alter if it was going to work theredve been no turning of cheeks here would there what did you i mean it wouldntve mattered who came to the rescue would it the result would be the same do you know what i mean sooner or later it would involve sam in violence these guys that was the only way it could ever be resolved im not saying its the only language they understand or that theyre stupid and mindless but byron fiona broke off as if she was trying to rethink this to see if there was any other way it might be viewed byron the way he was that night it seemed to me in those moments that that was what he wanted he wanted sam to come for him he wanted an excuse to release some kind of animalistic rage you mean at syd or just i mean that he wasnt attracted to me as such it was because i was sams wife jesus there was a real kind of a real evil about it i suppose that is an emptiness a hole where love and humanity should be is that evil oh yes the clouds had gulped up the sun merrily starting to shiver walked down through the little gate and stepped down towards the car the fields looked raw and winterstripped so what happened convinced that fiona unprompted would simply not have finished the story i didnt resist him he had me against the side of a garage block and i didnt resist he raped you it was over very quickly it was for him i think not so much the doing it as the having done it what i remember most was the sound of his breath a hollow sound as though he was drawing breath from somewhere else afterwards he just said goodnight i dont think he even remembered my name youve never told anyone youre the first one in a million barry had said that merrily smoked half a cigarette put on her coat and went back into the church byrons church up to the glittery chancel but it didnt feel right she walked back down the nave and across to the romanesque stone tympanum st george spearing a snakelike dragon an untypical st george in a kind of pleated skirt essential violence fiona had said shed gone back into the hotel through another door gone upstairs to their room and locked herself in and showered for a long time and put on fresh makeup and a different dress syd had been looking for her she told him she hadnt been well she said shed been sick and had had to change all that night her skin had felt greasy and shed had a filthy taste at the back of her throat merrily thought about denzil joy found she was breathing far too fast and became aware that on the wall opposite her above the church door another act of violence was evoked in smoke she stood staring at it uncomprehending for a few moments taking several long breaths before approaching it across the space at the back of the nave it was not smoke nor was it imagination she stopped flipping feverishly through the leaflet the th century wall painting above the door is of the crucifixion like most wall paintings there wasnt much left could have been a dampness stain like the grey monk in huws chapel two pains the first wrought to the drying while his body was moist and that other slow with blowing of wind from without all the colours gone the cross gone he was a corpse or very nearly drained of all resistance his head dead weight had collapsed into an elbow his body was brittle as a chrysalis flaking into the wall loaded fourthirty too quiet in the cid room an air of getting nowhere boss youre dead on your feet karen said go home eh im all right just sick of drawing blanks not even as if its a wall of silence bliss quite liked a wall of silence justified the use of a wrecking ball problem here was that once you were over the language barriers the bulgarians romanians lithuanians poles would tell you anything you wanted all of them shattered by the east street atrocity not an enemy in the world these girls cleanliving religious just wanted to make some money to send home men of course not they were inseparable anyway the prevailing opinion now was that theyd somehow perhaps innocently offended one of the criminal gangs that the men seen by carly and joss in the monks head were hardcore following the sisters out pretending to fancy them that was just an act something will give karen said on the third day something always gives now please will you go home me and darth can hold it together till the morning have a big glass of whisky and go to bed anything breaks well send a car for you yeah bliss said now boss straight home im gonna make a call first ill be in my office in the office he didnt quite shut the door and stood by the gap out of sight listening but nobody seemed to be talking about the di beating up his wife and nobodys expression changed when he walked back in claiming hed left his chewy behind bliss sat down and put in a call to jeremy berrows who farmed beyond kington where herefordshire met the paler hills of radnorshire jeremy lived with a lot of sheep and a lot of sheepdogs also with a beautiful woman called natalie who was known to the police from way way back but it was all right now you sounds a bit on edge mr bliss jeremy said he was what people called an oldfashioned kind of farmer open to superstitions and signs and portents a haloed moon three magpies the ash out before the oak all that jeremy thought his land confided in him bliss said youve got mansel bulls dogs i believe all of them theyre a gang he didnt wanner split them up problem with that were talking to everybody whod had dealings with mansel wasnt exactly a deal bit of an agreement thats all between two blokes as knew a bit about dogs and sheep not everybody got along with mansel but he looked after his dogs and you came and took them after he died before just as well his brother woulder stopped it trained dogs worth money or mabbe hedve had the whole bunch shot what mabbe thats unfair jeremy said see apart from the inhumanity of that jeremy it would indicate a fairly strong element of not exactly honouring his brothers memory jeremy didnt reply bliss liked the sound of the silence hed once listened to the lovely natalie at the right time and whilst jeremy didnt exactly owe him word is bliss said that sollers wasnt too pleased when mansel sold that ground any whispers about that dont go much on whispers too many of em round yeres been about me and nat as you know how is she good how many local people knew about natalies time in detention was debatable the probability was that the gossip was just about how a little woollyhaired farmer held on to a serious beauty from off but it was unlikely either of them would ever be able to relax jeremy youre a straight sort of bloke as farmers go so ill be straight with you i think theres quite a lot sollers bull hasnt told us i accept you dont listen much to gossip but how did you feel things were between mansel and sollers different generations different attitudes mansel was a businessman in the ole sense tight as a ducks arse but you knowed where you was sollers is all for the image puttin hisself around prize cattle at the royal welsh diversifyin farm shops and cafes huntin i was at school with him for a few years lady hawkins and what was he like at school head boy figures see im guessing mansel would realize sollers wouldnt be too keen on him flogging that ground to the fruit farm so whyd mansel do it bit of pique maybe no no that wasnt it at all he jeremy sounded uncertain again like he was worried about breaking a confidence hes dead jeremy he was killed it was mairder remember wasnt going well thats all the dogs mansel thought mabbe he was losin it what his marbles his skill had three shelves full of awards come close to winning one man and his dog on the box once then it wasnt workin nmore used to train his dogs down by the river but sollers wanted more ground for his cattle and he had to move up to the top field not used much for stock usually they just had the hay off it and it wasnt the same seemed obvious to me it wasnt the dogs but he was losin heart mansel either he was on top or he didnt wanner know got that much in common with sollers at least im not sure what youre saying jeremy couldnt hack it dogs was all over the place some days hed give a command dogd go for it real slow or run off back down to the river couldnt count on em he was gettin real depressed thought it was his age got so he didnt wanner take the dogs out nmore so you got all these valuable dogs for nothing from a man whos known for being tight as a ducks arse too many dogs is more of a burden than anything mr bliss we agreed mabbe hed have em back one day i told him i reckoned it wasnt about him and it wasnt about his dogs they works fine yere poetry im not getting this youre a copper mr bliss nobody spects you to get it had to be a reason them top fields wasnt used much and that was how it was for years generations mabbe i had a walk over it when i went to fetch the dogs some places the air feels loaded a place looks quiet but it ent a lot of ravens too for some reason ravens bliss thought about this and it was vasile bocean all over again you know what jeremy he said im tired he sat at his desk for several minutes all right raised a catholic and whatever anybody said you never lost that and all the baggage and what jeremy had been hinting at feelings atmosphere he wouldnt entirely rubbish any of it privately in the midnight hour it was just nothing to do with police work it didnt help he got up and stood by his window the sky was like the inside of an orange peel the light nights were coming didnt like them any more dark was best watching the lights going out across the road on the hill above great malvern colleagues only the way those words had been pinballing round his head all day telling himself she didnt mean it shed come round hed find some way of bringing her round have to couldnt lose this couldnt let it just come apart like a cheap supermarket bag somehow he had to get kirsty to refute any suggestion that hed ever abused her physically she could call him any kind of shit as long as she told the truth about that sent it back up the line bliss pulled out his iphone checked his incomings no emails of any consequence just the one phone message annie howe thank christ bliss clicked on it annies voice was very low but not so low the words werent metallically distinct didnt think i could be surprised any more at the level of your blind stupidity bliss clapped the phone tight to his ear both hands around it in case anybody came in dont know how you could have thought for one minute that i wouldnt find out your wife your own bloody wife deadness for several seconds anyway annie said thats it end of message bliss wrenched the phone away from his ear stabbed at the screen to call her back all right no he couldnt explain why he hadnt told her about kirstys suspicions except to say that he hadnt believed the bitch couldnt imagine how she could possibly know about annie still didnt know annies phone was switched off bliss stared at the iphone all the little symbols the ten thousand useless friggin apps rubbed the cold sweat from his forehead so who had the bitch told he strode out of the office through the cid room without speaking to anybody down the stairs and out of the building his face and the back of his neck feeling like they were badly sunburned the energy of sorrow lol watched merrily collapse back into his sofa late sun honeying the room red veins pulsing among the ashes at the bottom of the woodstove as so often these days merrily looked vacant wipedout so where do i go from here lol was thinking maybe a new career it was a crap job the clergy and no indication it would ever get better so much open contempt now the church god the afterlife all delusion thinking it and getting a buzz out of saying it loudly in public on tv and the only people who shouted back were the crazy fundamentalists like his late parents whod cut him out of their lives merrily had come home this afternoon to find the answering machine going uncle ted the churchwarden trying to lean on her before tonights parish meeting about his plans to turn the church into a greasy spoon it was about paying bills the bleeping of the answering machine had chased her out of the house and across the road in search of sanctuary i think i need help shed said and theyd talked for an hour sharing an omelette and toast shed told him about last nights visit from james bulldavies and everything shed learned about a man called byron jones from barry from joness exwife and finally syds wife fiona you believe this man raped her you think its something shed invent but she didnt go to the police or to anyone syd wouldve killed him and now hes dead does mrs spicer want you to do something about this im not sure lol sat down next to merrily how would she feel about you simply dumping it all on bulldavies who asked you to share she wouldnt like that im only telling you because i know it wont go out of this house i mean who is william lockley why does he want the information does he want to use it or suppress it who am i working for so tell bulldavies what youve heard about jones without naming names and then back off cant now not with syds funeral that lol said was a mistake he slid off the sofa gathered up two logs from the hearth opened the stove and put them in watching the fire seizing one thinking of the insatiable furnace in a crematorium where quickie funerals were conducted by a duty vicar whod never met the customer and this this was the summation of a life merrily would protest where was the electricity the surge of transition the smoothing of the final earthly path by the subtle energy of sorrow no wonder some of them didnt rest she didnt do quickies a properly conducted funeral needed the history bottom line if shed felt an obligation to syd before now it was cast in bronze what was i supposed to say no thanks best to find somebody who doesnt give a toss lol its like hes haunting me the way he showed up at the chapel i keep hearing that flat voice in my head when im not expecting it samuel dennis spicer church of england smell his cigarette smoke in church isnt there a term for that psychological projection arising from guilt selfrecrimination lol said misplaced no this is something else merrily stood up walked to the window looked across the cobbles at the vicarage he was taking steps to protect himself against something he considered evil he goes out on credenhill with a bergen full of bible as if he knows he isnt coming back and he leaves these books behind like clues to something one pointing directly at a man who went from good friend to bitter enemy just do a meaningful funeral pray for both their souls or something sure she smiled walk away credenhills twenty minutes down the road and always go the other way to hereford lol had planned to tell her finally about jane and cornel and the cockfighting but that would be too much for her to handle needed to deal with that himself at least with danny and gomer on the case he felt better about it get the evidence share it with jane then take it to the rspca and the police let jane take the credit if it worked out shield her from repercussions if it didnt he sat down on the hearthrug looking up at merrily on the sofa she looked small vulnerable and there must be something he could do ok he said why dont we try and work this out dont have much time parish meeting at seven maundy service tomorrow chrism mass at the cathedral im not going to make that this year why does easter always come at the wrong time does barry know anything about this i dont think barrys told me everything he knows i dont think he knows about the rape but he does think byrons a dangerous man warned me not to try and talk to him but you still went to find him no i just went to the church because there was clearly something there that fascinated him he mustve spent virtually everything he had buying that land where he now stages war games behind barbed wire lol leaned back against an inglenook wall the rift between him and syd what was that about all we know for sure is that he hated syd becoming an ordained priest byrons own religious beliefs if he had any appear to have been pagan saw himself as a celt like his hero caradog locked away in his tower room turning himself into caradog leaving caradogs ambience if ive got this right lol said caradog held out against the romans until he was betrayed and captured and taken to rome where his oratory made him a celeb a hero but byrons fictional story seems to deviate hes not interested in oratory his caradog has to impress the romans with his military skills which are obviously akin to sas methods i called in at the bookshop to see what the chances were of getting his other books but amanda says theyre out of print and caradog was a druid he worked with druids according to the stories what might jones have been doing then in that tower room maybe meditation visualization to focus his mind for the writing and the smell i dont even want to think about the smell did syd know byron was at brinsop when he took on the job thats the interesting question id say he did my feeling is that he always knew where byron was at any given time when byron was at allensmore syd went to see him maybe to try and sort something out but maybe not theyre all dead hes saying all dead now who did he mean merrily spread her hands in defeat lol said would syd have known do you think the reason byron wanted to live at brinsop or at least have an idea lets assume he did lets also assume there a connection with this very unusual church which byron kept photographing from the air how would he do that not a problem in this area hed know people with private planes helicopters a lot of the sas had contacts with shobdon airfield recreational parachute clubs all this its just that aerial photography might suggest the site of the church is more important than the church itself lol said and lines hed drawn lines across the aerial photos woooh leys possibly not saying a word to jane i dont want her within five miles of byron jones leys if they exist are preceltic lol said bronze age or earlier im just telling you what liz said id quite like to look at byrons book sometime its in my bag merrily gathered it up from the floor and stood in fact theyre all here ill leave you the wordsworth too any perceptions flashes of inspiration would be very welcome merrily just inside the door he grabbed hold of her hugged her hard im sorry what for exactly she kissed him and he felt a quiver in her been letting things slide he murmured when somethings finally paying the mortgage you tend to go at it round the clock in case it doesnt last and you forget whats really important at least you dont have god on your back swan later lol opened the front door up the street at the eight till late jim prosser was taking in his paper rack a news bill said hereford horror lol watched merrily walking back to the vicarage the voice in his head sang do something but he didnt know where to start seer takes fire the blood on the book cover was embossed glossybubbled against the backgrounds matt black and greys and the white title caradog they came they saw lol took it over to the desk in the window flipping through for any local place names nothing he recognized immediately but it was after all fiction he took the legionnaire from behind a thrust to the spine and then as the man fell back moved around and hacked off his head from the front a practised upward stroke they were easy meat most of them mercenaries whod never seen rome they obeyed orders and understood discipline hed give them that but they lacked the ability to think for themselves or operate in small units and as lowly foot soldiers they were not attuned to the higher energies known to the elite and now at last known to caradog who felt them rising like fire from the pit of his gut a fire kindled from the sun itself cartoon violence kids loved this stuff but theyd probably turn off at the first mention of higher energies lol scanned several chapters finding two more references to caradog drawing energy from the sun at one stage holding up his sword to catch the light before going calmly into battle and efficiently slaying a large number of romans druids worshipped the sun it was a start lol opened up his laptop put google on the case there was modern druidry the religious arm of greenpeace and there was the kind the romans had known altogether darker with animal and possibly human sacrifice but the roman accounts might have been propaganda he googled wordsworth and brinsop quite a lot wordsworth had been poet laureate when he was holidaying at brinsop court and then the net as occasionally happened threw up an unexpected link not to brinsop but somewhere not far away which sent lol back to the small green book wordsworths britain a little itinerary he found it tucked in after tintern abbey a poem commemorating roman antiquities discovered at bishopstone herefordshire while poring antiquarians search the ground upturned with curious pains the bard a seer takes firethe men that have been reappear romans for travel girt for business gowned and some recline on couches myrtlecrowned in festal glee why not the poem was dated and carried a note from wordsworth describing its inspiration a roman pavement discovered only yards from the front door of bishopstone parsonage in full view of several hills upon which there had formerly been roman encampments doubtless including credenhill with its iron age fort in wordsworths day any kind of camp might be considered roman lol put a block of ash on the stove and dug into the shelves for an os map hereford leominster and surrounding area cleared his desk and opened out the map to the area west of hereford it brought an invisible landscape into existence in various archaic fonts and symbols roman road course of again and again roman roads either side of the wye one skirting credenhill under the hill was brinsop the church marked only by a small but earthworks and moat nearby signifying an area of extreme antiquity bishopstone a hamlet with a church was no distance from brinsop directly east of it two more roman roads made a kind of vformation into the point of which was tucked something identified on the map as raf hereford which could only be the sas camp just before the roman roads converged on magnis roman town the ruins of which according to several internet sites had still been visible in recorded memory much of the masonry had gone into the foundations of hereford by the antiquarian william stukely was discussing a fine mosaic floor unearthed at kenchester and the remains of a temple and also noting that one colonel dantsey had paved his cellar with roman bricks around the original roman army camp there had been evidence of streets and shops the remains of a shrine had been uncovered near the wye part of a villa found in the river itself lol went through to his kitchen for a glass of water digesting the key point the sas quite recently had moved its headquarters from hereford itself to a former raf base at the convergence of two roman roads serving a roman military base back to the roots brinsop church however was part of a different story he remembered it now remembered a wet sunday when he and jane had been enthusiastically defacing another copy of this same map circling every stone mound cross and old church marking up every conceivable alignment of prehistoric sites and then checking them out to see if theyd found anything that alfred watkins had missed alfred watkins of hereford the original simple trackway man on whom lol and danny had based the song whom jane claimed for an ancestor lol pulled down his copy of the old straight track watkinss masterpiece the book which long after his death had sent generations of brits young hippies old hippies prehippies posthippies like lol post posthippies like jane out into the countryside to find the stones and mounds and mysterious church formations that lit up an alternative britain ok most archaeologists rubbished the idea but it was still exciting to think of being surrounded by ancient landscape patterns which also drew in churches because so many of them had been built on sites of prehistoric pagan worship you saw church towers and steeples you saw four thousand years of ritual and in the middle the romans alfred watkins had suggested that the roman roads had often followed the old straight tracks in his view more by design than accident as if the romans had merely widened existing prehistoric routes lol felt a twitch of connection hed known that of course even worked it into the simple trackway man from moat to mound well mark the ground from barrow to camp well carry the lamp from roman road to traders track and over the pitch and all the way back interesting to think this guy byron a man who could rape a friends wife might have been on the same trail fascinated by the same magic landscape hed drawn lines across the aerial photos lol found a pencil and using the edge of the old straight track as a ruler drew in three of the lines that he and jane had found radiating from brinsop church one linking it with four other medieval churches brinsop church was on a site of some significance and although it was only a few miles away hed never even seen it the sun was low in the sky over ledwardine but there were a good two hours of daylight left to find what could be found lol picked up his car keys went out to his truck two hours magic dragon brinsop church was locked now maybe the smoking ghost of syd spicer was inside waiting there in motionless crampless silence the way the sas could waiting for a signal lol moved among the graves through the soft light the bell tower was crisp against the cooling sky the giant conifer black like a knobbly monolith it didnt matter that the church was locked outside the landscape had revealed itself the ordnance survey map was opened out in his head the lines drawn in at the end of the short grass before the woodland began its march up credenhill you could see like an entrance to the underworld what the os map identified as moat alfred watkins thought some moats might have been dug not for protection but to mark the tracks by reflecting sunlight or beacon fire or lamplight lol had looked across the dark stain of the moat to the wooded thigh of credenhill imagining the pale essences of longgone villagers walking the spirit paths that intersected here syd spicer following some distance behind cautiously adjusting to being dead in the adjacent field a stile gave access to a squat monolith on top of a circular stone slab with a metal drain cover set into it on the stone it said the dragon well as it was unlikely that a dragon had died here what did it actually mean half an hour ago standing at the side of the lane somewhere around kenchester lol had gazed out over the fields which enclosed the ghost of the roman town hed seen isolated farms and further away on the higher ground the frames of this years polytunnels spreading like wormcasts hed driven past the sas camp with its armed guards a military base built close to maybe even on top of the buried remains of another what could that mean what could it mean to byron jones a cyclist was bobbing along the lane dipping periodically behind the hedge heading this way lol waited the man wheeled the bike to the dead end of the track he was thin and bearded maybe in his early sixties wearing a scarf and a flat cap nice truck he said animal or warrior animal a match flared the guy applied it to a rollup used to have one meself comfy for a truck he looked like an archetypal peasant therefore obviously from off on your own mate its what country churchyards are for lol said being alone not so much these days one of the finest st george churches in england this but who bovvers now the guy checked him out again then took a step back hang about i fink stone me i was at your gig in the floods at ledwardine hey how cool is this lol smiled a bit bashful this never used to happen at all but it had occurred a dozen or so times since christmas local recognition a mixed blessing forget what i said the guy said this is exactly the right setting for you lol there should be a soundtrack sunny days the edges of his londonish accent were rounded off as if hed been living here a good while well you know that was a long time ago lol said well i had it first time around im proud to say hazey jane first album i ever bought by a band a good bit younger than me big fing that when you first accept younger guys can get it right seventeen was you another lifetime lol said the guy put out a hand arthur baxter bax i live a mile or so back there over the pitch still come here most nights on me bike meet the dragon uhhuh you feel his breath like a blowheater exactly bax grinned you know the story um no you got time got all night mate the missus is rehearsing a community play down the leisure centre at credenhill dragons drinking at the well right george comes down off of credenhill lookin for trouble slash slash spear downa froat all over bax took a meditative drag you out here looking for inspiration lol if youre not dont spoil it for me i wanna point to a song one day and go i was there when he got that one bax drew deeply on his cigarette offered it to lol try this it aint bad a certain sweetness drifting up more than one kind of dragon lol smiled shook his head nodded at the truck bax assured lol that hed been biking these lanes pleasantly stoned for the best part of two decades never once been stopped tell you how far back this all goes bax said if we could get into the church youd see this old stone slab with a picture carved on it of st george and the dragon only george is wearing like a skirt which means somebody seen him either as a crossdresser or a roman soldier you know the little whatsits they had wiv the belt st george is portrayed as a roman well thats the answer innit thats what its about its the romans slaughtering the celts you really here for inspiration lol told bax about the simple trackway man which could use another verse bax was delighted clapped his hands a lot of roman stuff around here too lol said or there used to be i was reading this poem by wordsworth the men that have been reappear yeah yeah i know it often wonder did he see them bax waved his spliff bigger than they know that roman town me and the missus found maybe a dozen coins down the years and the men who reappear bax shuffled around prodded a tyre on his bike i live in hope lol said ever come across a bloke called byron jones round here should i have i think he lives in a caravan or he did oh bax blew out smoke you mean colin jones probably do he dont live in the caravan no more got permission for a bungalow on the edge of his land the compound nice too swimming pool compound thats what it looks like all that high barbedwire fencing dont know him exactly we are acquainted he does intensive fitness training got a gym in there and an assault course where you swing over a pond on a rope that kinda caper you know him know of him exsass and then he was a minder quite well fought of in these parts bax sniffed as they are the sass people like you ever go on these courses me nah wouldnt be able to afford it though occasionally mr jones offers a oneday crashcourse sort of thing to local boys for nothing excellent for local relations bax took a long noisy pull on his spliff now down to a fragment blimey that dint last long did it lol smiled i was wondering if that wasnt the dragon you came here to meet the magic dragon poor ole thing he aint too welcome at home no more not since the missus joined the wi when we first come here and she wore cheesecloth we grew it in the dingle gotta pay for it now in town but tell you one thing mr lol it aint slowed my brain enough that i cant tell youre fishing for somink nah nah bax held up his hands like saucers i dont wanna know mate you wanted me to know youd tell me wouncha lol didnt know what to say it was an odd dreamlike encounter brinsop church snuggling into its shadows behind them only its bell tower showing like a periscope to be honest he said im not quite sure what im looking for but a new verse for the song would make it worthwhile bax said what about the fings what reappear i thought you hadnt seen them i know a bloke who has bax said you interested pain it was still fully light when bliss reached the entrance to chris symondss farm so he drove past crawled around the lanes for a while needed to be sure the kids were in bed he drove out towards moretononlugg through the flatlands towards the western horizon saw no way round this any more but to take her on how the hell shed found out about annie he still had no idea but if she knew then she knew and he was tired of playing games hed let her know that yes he was prepared to leave the division hed go on the transfer list directly after easter with the single proviso that the shitstirring stopped as from now as from tonight any more lies about physical abuse any whispers about him and annie howe anything and hed flog his car and give his last penny to the flashest lawyer he could find to trash her through the courts and anywhere else she showed her devious little face tell her now on the doorstep no discussion no explanations no attempts at selfjustification then piss off back home get the best nights sleep he could manage and throw himself into nailing the killers of the poor bloody marinescu sisters before he left hereford credenhill rising like a crusty loaf across the shadowed fields told him he was only a few miles from magnis berries and he felt a pang of guilt about his behaviour there the way hed leaned on vasile bocean and yet why did they leave vasile i told you they always seeing dead men ghostmen they were fired dismissed for that they was causing upset bad vibes praying out loud lighting candles is fire risk health and safety vasile had said he thought they were in the end happy to take some money to go maybe they took the ghosts with them or maybe they didnt all the murmurings that went on afterwards bliss could hear jeremy berrows telling him about places where the air was loaded and mansels sheepdogs had become uncontrollable hed thought of going back alone to talk to vasile again man to man but the problem was that when peoples testimony bordered on the unlikely it negated everything else theyd told you making them useless as witnesses guaranteed to get you laughed out of court he turned the car at the next junction and headed back to his fatherinlaws farm jane lit a candle on the altar and sat down in the choirmasters chair she was alone hadnt seen much of mum tonight parish meeting at the village hall uncle ted usual trivial crap but at least it kept her out of the church the full preparation now systematic relaxation sitting upright hands on knees slowly sensing the body from the toes to the top of the head it was getting a lot easier practice jane was finding she could almost slide into a relaxed state these days without the tedious preliminaries meditation probably the only procedure which actually transcended all the halfwayworkable religions of course jane only did this in here when she was sure she wouldnt be disturbed by uncle ted or some other tosser didnt want anyone to think shed found mums god the easter holiday had begun tonight tomorrow would be the first day of what was in effect the last school holiday shed ever have when the big summer holiday began it wouldnt count because shed have left school not a break but a springboard into adult life whatever that was about jane listened to her breathing shed brought along the copy of revelations of divine love from mums desk mum had marked a section where mother julian was welcoming the sickness shed contracted at the age of thirty wanting it to bring her as close as possible to death to know the reality of dying in the hope this would cleanse her and bring about a spiritual rebirth ok a touch masochistic but this was not a woman who messed around maybe knowing there were some secrets you could only learn through pain jane went into some chakra breathing a kind of energy conveyor belt but soon lost the cycle the body was still but the mind wouldnt switch off shed seen cornel again tonight hed parked his porsche on the square but instead of going into the swan hed followed his jutting chin down church street like some zombie on the prowl and shed watched him enter the ox where the serious drinkers went shed almost gone after him mum would be in the village hall for at least two hours but wasnt sure she was ready to handle it had to be done right getting off the school bus shed run into gomer outside the eight till late hed looked embarrassed admitting as they walked down church street together that he was getting nowhere talked to everybody he could think of either side of the border and while some could remember when there were illegal cockfights nobody knew of any happening hereabouts at present gamecocks were still being bred but for collectors poultry buffs not for fights ent gived up mind gomer had said jane didnt think he was optimistic but look that was ok that was actually good it meant local people werent involved now the finger of suspicion could only be pointing one way she knew a lot about cockfighting now not something shed ever wanted to study but this was not a responsibility she could walk away from shed sat down in her apartment and spent nearly two hours on the internet downloading everything except the cockfight videos fights had been staged for over two thousand years and were still happening mainly in the far east south america less publicly in the uk where theyd first been introduced by roman invaders bastards she couldnt stop thinking about the bird with the lions mane but mainly she couldnt stop replaying what shed heard last night outside the kitchen door james bulldavies complicated times mrs watkins what with savitch bidding to buy the swan dear god the final insult the oakpanelled jacobean core of the community how many people knew mum had obviously known already and taken a decision not to tell the kid hey lets not have jane doing something stupid but she wasnt a bloody kid any more and whatever she did wouldnt be stupid jane concentrated on her breathing taking the air down to the solarplexus chakra preparation curved bars of blackening cloud made the western sky look like an old ribcage as bliss turned like he had hundreds of times along chris symondss farm track in a glow of excitement once upon a time at the thought of seeing kirsty in tight black jeans and a straining top waiting for him where the track forked by an ancient oak tree with a trunk wider than his car a dirt track in those days now it was tarmac the real thing not one of your itinerantgang jobs that cracked up in weeks this one was in better nick than the county roads possibly even quietly laid by a few of the same fellers bliss had heard the word was that chris was putting himself up for the council next time he turned left at the fork driving slowly without lights following the track leading to the stone outbuildings converted into classy stone holiday cottages one of them currently occupied by kirsty and the kids bliss slowed did a tight threepoint turn and parked on the grass verge a good distance away didnt want her looking out and recognizing his honda and not answering the door just as well when he got out of the car not fully closing the door to avoid the noise he saw another vehicle a lightcoloured discovery half hidden on the edge of the pair of fat leylandii which separated the holiday cottages from the farmhouse and threw their front doors into evening shade no sign of kirstys ka chris symonds drove a discovery maybe shed borrowed it to cart stuff around worst scenario would be that chris and pat were in there in which case a mere exchange of bitter words would be the least hed get away with bliss was about four paces from the door when there was muffled click and then he was standing like a socialclub compere in overlapping circles of garish lemon light he backed off sharpish who the hell had installed security spots a shadow crossed the upstairs window and he heard a muffled biffing the heel of a hand repeatedly hitting a jammed window frame and then as it gave way a voice from up there bloody thing see told you it was nobody not even the paparazzi trailed by a sound he hadnt heard in a good long while kirstys little shockedbutthrilled plumpedout giggle bliss crouched in the damp grass at the edge of the track until the security lights reached the end of their cycle and went out and he could see the figure in the window out of shadow up there the shock and the pain came sudden and vicious like a knifethrust in some clammy alleyway as the setting sun showed him that the parts of sollers bull visible above the window frame were unclothed dont go there it took a while to come out it always did around here the two brothers had been introduced by bax as percy and walter they lived in a small redbrick cottage nineteenthcentury at the end of a row of modern houses and bungalows near kenchester they travelled in the slow lane the silent walter who was probably over ninety wore an apron and made the tea percy had never heard of anybody called lol before short for laurence lol said hed crawled up from brinsop in the truck behind a man on a bike well well percy said walter handed lol tea in a china cup a lowwattage bulb its brown flex hanging over a blackened beam had probably been on all day coal was burning in an iron range there was a tv set that had to be fifty years old and probably didnt work any more the room smelled of well it smelled of old blokes lol writes songs bax told percy too many bloody songs now all sounds the same percy was a few years younger than walter his hair was white and curly no proper songs bax said folk songs songs about life and songs about things what goes on he winked at lol that people dont talk about much no more talk they wanted me to give a talk look percy said womens institute some woman comes round asks me to give a talk that was my missus percy wasnt gonner talk to a load o women they spreads stuff all over women does and they gets it wrong always a problem with women bax admitted ent i dont like to talk percy nodded at walter he dont like to talk much never has look i likes to talk long as folks gets it right what i tells em half the buggers they dont listen proper nmore bax nodded talks back dont listen percy said after a while he seemed to notice lol sitting on a stool by the door lol was listening percy nodded approvingly tell lol what you seen in the long field that night bax said in the feeble light the already muted colours in the room had died back into a sombre sepia percy did some thinking wouldnt appen to ave any more o that scenty baccy would you boy he said eventually halfway down church street jane began to feel cold and a little stupid in the sawnoff white hoodie that shed worn in the swan the night shed met cornel but hed been pissed then and she needed him to recognize her ready for this now knew exactly how shed handle him sure hed come out of the ox at some point maybe he was here with his cockfighting mates eventually she went in and had a glance around mistake watkins slobby dean wall at one of the gaming machines dont get excited wall jane said calmly im only looking for somebody yeah wall looked at her bare bits sucking in his breath it looks like you bloody are too jane took a couple of steps inside stink of stale beer only the ox could sell beer that smelled stale when it was fresh out of the pump mens eyes were flickering her way from all corners of the cramped bar with its tobacco beams and stained flags a barmaid was clearing glasses from a table six pint glasses in two hands fingers down in the dregs clinking she looked up and it was lori jenkin who worked parttime in the eight till late jane leaned over lowered her voice im looking for cornel your mum know about this jane got a message for him thats all somebody said he was in here this was going all wrong she needed to just like bump into him i think hes in his room lori said im not sure hes staying here the ox had two spare bedrooms which jane understood were used mainly by sad downmarket commercial travellers too pissed to go back on the road a guy with a porsche staying here that did not sound right lori said ill get somebody to give him a knock if you like no no its ok its not urgent ill catch him again jane got out of the ox under dean walls soiled beery gaze and stood there feeling like a prostitute shivering they always underdressed apparently this wasnt working give up for tonight go home rapid footsteps across the street and oh jeez it was mum walking up from the village hall jane hung back keeping close to the shadowed cottages but after a few paces inevitably tonight mum looked back and saw her jane walked up hands jammed in her pockets to pull the hoodie down over the bare bits how was she going to explain this meetings over already uncle ted couldnt make it so we had a fairly restricted agenda thank god apparently he erm tried to ring me earlier mum glancing sideways at jane as they walked up to the empty square taking in the skimpy apparel and then glancing away jane look i know its none of my i needed to walk and think and stuff didnt realize how cold it was they reached the square with its tumble of black and white buildings the weary lanterns coming on outside the swan soon to be owned by janes fists tightened so mum said you were thinking and stuff last day of term last school holiday the future everybody had been demob happy at school those facing a levels probably less so but nobody quite as messedup as she was mum said im not so old i dont remember what thats like youve made a decision that could determine the rest of your life and youre thinking god have i done the right thing oh jane went to stand with her back to the opensided oakpillared market hall like most of the guys at school they just cant wait to get the hell out of here and go to london or paris or new york sure me i dont even want to go to university there it was out ah mum said so thats it three years thats like flower compared with the rest of the rest of my life yeah it is actually about more than that though isnt it and like for what a degree means nothing any more theres guys out there with phds who cant spell coops is dr cooper and he just works for the council and the the forces of darkness are gathering herefords already as good as gone all crap superstores and charity shops and women getting murdered in the back streets jane and if i leave if i go ill come back and itll all be shit here too jane felt the pressure of tears hadnt intended to go this far that sounds bonkers doesnt it so why do i keep waking up depressed and frightened frightened how frightened that like in ten years or something im going to be looking back with this awful selfhatred because i didnt do what i shouldve done at the time flower yeah i know teenage angst a phase its always a phase isnt it well how do you know for sure when its a phase mum is it after you like walk away live in a city get a mortgage get pregnant grow up i dont know mum said they were alone on the square only a faint wisp of the woodsmoke which used to scent the whole village jane felt like they were both enclosed in a cold vapour mum looked young and waiflike tonight in her dark jeans and woolly no dog collar not even a pectoral cross like somebody who hadnt grown up after all who still knew nothing it made jane want to cry with despair what about you what about you and lol if bernie dunmore retires and you get a bunch of extra parishes dumped on you and lol has to go back on the road because nobodys making money out of cds any more how long are you going to last as an item then actually crying now couldnt help it lets go to the pub mum said what lets go to the swan and get a drink men who had been reappearing oh aye percy knowed about them he sat in the ochre glow of the firelight and the haze of scenty baccy and he talked and giggled as the small windows grew dim walter had gone off somewhere hed doubtless heard it all before these tales of the people who came up the fields in the river mist no faces no feet maybe bax had too but he didnt seem to mind he was an incomer and the fact that someone like percy would talk to him at all about such matters even after thirty years was clearly a source of pride to him lol was thinking this was percys routine his act his gig his repertoire the tales told rebored remoulded over many years what was interesting was the way the anomalies were mingled some otherworldly and some just odd in an ordinary way to percy there seemed to be no difference the people who came up from the river all he could say was that they were greyish and one had a birds head and sometimes you could see through them to the winter trees behind oh aye hed seen them on three occasions in his life only for a few seconds mind each time it was when you didnt see them that they were dangerous when they got inside your tractor and fiddled about that was how harold wilding had lost a leg and he was lying there a new furrow filling up with his blood and he reckoned he could hear them laughing then percy talked of lightless vans and trucks on the lanes after midnight men driven like sheep along the paths over stiles they had no faces either and there were other things percy had seen but couldnt talk about give him time bax had murmured but there hadnt been time tonight bax had looked at the clock coming up to half past ten and said he needed to be off before his wife came back from her rehearsal he left percy a couple of baggies on the sideboard behind the clock and they said goodnight course hell deny to the end of his days that hes the least bit superstitious bax said he was born here like his old man worked hard all his life on this ground and these things were what happened now and then like gales and flooding nobody wrote to the papers about it they were leaning on a fence behind baxs cottage looking out towards the darkening fields where villas had stood with mosaic floors and perhaps bathhouses and the rows of wooden barracks where the roman squaddies slept probably a bit like some of the huts occupied today by migrant workers on the fruit farms bax said only with better facilities the vehicles with no lights lol said and some of the men with no faces thats the sass innit anyfink odd happens round here folks exchange glances nod to one another and say noffing they dont question it theyre patriots whatever fings those boys get up to its done for queen and country for the security of us all so thats all right innit what sort of things not entirely unknown for them to help themselves to a farmers stock is it on an exercise dropped in the wilderness with no food and you got to exist for whole days on what you can find in the hedgerows or trap and kill been known for them to lift the odd sheep or a chicken from a farm some of the farmers if they know where they are they give em a big fryup in the barn makes sense but not round here surely this isnt the wilderness bax said nothing lol gazed over the fields it felt like they were standing at a sea wall overlooking dark waters the distant black mountains like the far arm of a wide bay joness place he heard himself say can you see it from the road not any more no signs to it i didnt see any secrecys part of the image the punters like that so im told lol had the map from the truck could you show me where it is on here bax sighed fishing out a spectacle case and holding up the map to the last of the light whats these marks all over it its a ley map we made four or five going through brinsop church dont know how you feel about leys maybe somefing to it lol look do any of these lines go through byrons land lol mate bax bent and rubbed his knees then straightened up i dont know what to say at this point you listen to a geezers music over the years and you fink you know him dont get me wrong ive very much enjoyed our evening and i got a great respect for what you do but we dont talk about our neighbours to strangers thats right one day ill explain bax pulled a pen from his jacket can i deface this map a bit more feel free lol held the torch while bax worked out some distances then drew a small cross thats the farm is it wiv your line going right frew the top corner near his boundary where he had his excavation that what this is about they have a digger him and his partner from hardkit geezer who owns the land overlooking it reckoned there was archaeologists involved dunno what was found nothing was ever made public then jones had conifers planted inside his boundary fence hardkit lol said you did say hardkit kenny mostyn he owns the hardkit shops hes joness partner you dint know no no i didnt kenny mostyn of hardkit byron joness partner ward savitchs partner kind of do you know of any ancient monument on joness land anything they might want to excavate no and hes trust me hes not the kind of bloke you ask lol nodded looking up at the sky figuring there was a good halfhour of daylight left well id better go he said youve been very helpful bax ill send you a copy of the album when its out brazilian decaff seeing the female silhouette through the frosted doorpanel in the dusk bliss thought annie almost wept it had come to this memories of winter nights when shed parked around the corner walked briskly all muffled up down the icy drive to the back entrance the sweet oldfashioned romance of it what a twat hed become bliss unlocked the door thinking he hadnt even made the bed i thought id better come round karen dowell said two reasons one i really didnt like the sound of your voice on the machine bliss started to laugh and went into a coughing fit and obviously didnt get that wrong karen said hed called her on his mobile from the car having tried annie twice switched off and he hadnt left a message but hed left one for karen how long have you known because this had so explained karens attitude advising him to back off pass the information about sollers and the fruitfarm girls to annie howe you want to be a bit careful boss thats all under the circumstances bliss backed up the narrow hallway switching on lights sorry i was not drinking i hope karen stepped into the living room pulling off her baseball cap looking around god you into minimalism now frannie or is this all she left you you want some coffee show me where the stuff is ill make it i had your coffee once before look he felt stupid now i didnt expect you to come over i told craig it was work i feel like a twat you are a twat god frannie i thought you knew i just didnt see how you could not know well i didnt thats the kind of shite detective i am karen stood there shaking her head bulky uncrushable farming stock and then i thought about it and i was thinking well if by any chance he doesnt know all the history what are you saying karen oh my god you dont know any of the history do you karen tossed her cap on the sofa from which all the cushions had been stolen he hasnt always been a rural pinup frannie there was a time when being seen around with kirsty symonds was serious kudos for a guy like sollers bliss stared at her youre saying that my wife and sollers bull were an item before sorry to spring that on you when quite a while back actually couple of years before you showed your face in hereford anyway bliss collapsed onto the naked sofa karen wrinkled her nose actually thinking about it she cantve been all that long out of school at the time mother of god sorry must be a lot to take in she used to tell me she always went out with farmers she said i was the first feller who wasnt a farmer and didnt go on about sheep prices all the time we used to laugh about it how do you feel about discussing sheep prices it became a euphemism for you know back in the days when we made up euphemisms for it when we were both laughing at the same time you never her asked which farmers she went out with karen why would i care they all look the friggin same to me industrial woollen shirts and hairy arms not sollers however no bliss looked down into his hands not sollers karen sat down opposite him in the chair by the cold grate looked across at him a bit apprehensive as though she still wasnt sure how much to say when did it end karen or when was it suspended just fizzled out i suppose sollers was at college and mixing more in you know hunting circles with the nobs i suppose that was how he met charlotte walfords daughter walford was a hunt master i think and then one thing led to another that is did charlotte get pregnant i think maybe that was it my mum reckons it was never destined to last they pretty much lead separate lives now since the kids went to boarding school i wouldnt imagine lord walford knows about him picking up again with kirsty but like from what youve told me its pretty clear chris symonds does sollerss big x shoved among the trees just the other side of the farmhouse porch symonds never liked me despised how i earned me crust and now coming up to forty and still not behind a big desk at headquarters who else knows karen looked glum all right tell me stagg fuck no actually it was stagg who got the whisper on his travels from the inevitable nosy neighbour probably made his year couldnt wait to go blabbing to the dci as you can imagine when was this this afternoon bliss closed his eyes total explanation of annies phone message him thinking shed somehow found out that kirsty knew about them has it got out to the press i think on balance it wouldnt be too much in sollerss interests for it to be in the papers that there was a private issue between you and him maybe not what was evident was that kirsty mustve made it clear to sollers that her husband didnt know about them that shed never told him and if he had found out kirsty had him and annie in her back pocket for bargaining purposes how long had kirsty and sollers been meeting quietly months years bliss thought of how shed looked the last time hed taken the kids back the short skirt the classy makeup thinking shed done that for him to let him know what he was missing he felt not so much humiliated as ashamed and afraid afraid of the implications for the future his kids and also you know what this means it means i cant touch him karen it means i cant nail the cun he straightened up sorry sorry if i sound like im coming apart its because i am the friggin twisted irony of it have you even got anything on him anything you know how much ive got then its nothing and no legitimate reason to connect mansels murder with the marinescus ill make that coffee bliss followed karen into the kitchen theyve been stirring it for me did you hear that did you get that from stagg too how it got back to the chief constable that me and kirsty were splitting up that it was down to physical abuse karen turned slowly whos saying that bliss shrugged karen said sollers chris symonds kirsty herself hardly matters now its done its job persuaded the chief to take steps to remove me from the division youre not just accepting that no obviously not but even taking on the chief through the federation or whatever means im out of here one way or another a few of us wont stand by and watch it happen wheres the coffee ive had it with this place anyway cupboard over the sink vaynor karen reached up to the cupboard me rich ford even whats this karen was holding up the last jar of brazilian decaff kirsty mustve left it bliss said quickly no wonder you were doomed this is what the dci drinks is it youve not got anything else i dont spend much time at home these days out of interest do you think kirsty knows sollers was shagging a polish kid from magnis berries that was a while back do you want some more bad news yeh id love that karen its what keeps me alive it doesnt karen opened the coffee jar this is the other reason im here doesnt look like sollers bull killed the marinescus had them killed i never said he did it himself no karen shook her head i havent given this to brian wilton yet i met a woman earlier tonight one of the toms middleaged lady who sings in the cathedral choir takes all sorts no not one of the toms boss shes manageress of harriets of bridge street clothing emporium for the maturer lady bliss shook his head two young women came in looking at clothes a bit too old for them there were three elderly customers in at the time and the girls were being very solicitous to the one not being served like what about this one really suits you you try it on i look after your bag kind of thing how do you know it was the marinescus showed her the pictures how disappointing bliss said come to something when you cant even trust a girl with an icon of the holy mother any more he started to laugh before he could cry another curtain closing anyway karen said harriets is a small enough shop for the staff to notice these things and some tops had been nicked the previous week when she offered to take care of the bag herself the two girls were out the door in a flash doesnt surprise me a great deal bliss said also ties in with the new gear in the wardrobe at goldies is there a word for a female fagin the marinescus were hard up its not the first karen said last time they got away with it this was a much bigger store than the mailorder surplus place up on the holmer bliss waited karen spooned coffee into mugs this was another old lady right eightythree they took her bag containing her purse photos of the grandchildren all the usual she was very very upset they called the police and then they had to take her home remember it now bliss nodded vaguely karen stood with her back to the cooker the proprietor rang up the old lady next day she wasnt there shed been rushed to hospital the previous night did we know about that no we didnt she had a long history of strokes and anyway she made a brief recovery the family agreed to keep quiet didnt want her getting fussed the shop woman told me that when i rang her three weeks later that would be a week or so ago the old girl had another stroke and died in hospital i see handbag bliss was thinking of the marinescus the way one handbag had been emptied out at the scene the other and its contents trailed all the way to the river i think you should get to bed boss karen said an early start might be advisable from the killing house no more than a third of the tables in the lounge bar were taken merrily had followed jane to the one under the smallest leaded window its old glass thick and fogged like frogspawn cider please jane slid into the short bench under the window merrily bought two mediumsweet ciders from barry looking around for lol no sign barry gave her a mildly inquiring look she leaned across the bar voice lowered liz was quite forthcoming in the end though why i should tell you any of it considering how much you didn t tell me one side of barrys mouth twitched merrily carried the ciders back to the table shadows hung shiftily either side of the mullion so archaeology is erm history jane didnt smile its a joke anyway archaeologists cant get to grips with anything much any more unless the council wants to do something crass with the land and whatever they find it still gets built over id just keep getting annoyed youll still keep getting annoyed if you dont have any qualifications the only difference is youll be regarded as an annoying crank no one will have to listen to you jane shrugged merrily sipped cautiously at her cider or maybe youre worried that the world of archaeology isnt yet sufficiently attuned to the concepts of bronze age geomancy and earth energies you accept all that some of it but im not an academic just a jobbing c of e shaman in the ruins of christianity and you dont believe that for one still wake up in the night in a cold sweat watching a ghostly dawkins coming through the wall janes smile was a long way behind you wont have to keep me ill get some kind of job yes im sure you will merrily thinking dont push it dont get into an argument plenty of time yet well there wasnt but actually i was going to ask you something as you know more about the ancient world than i do though maybe roman archaeology is not your thing prehistory my thing we know too much about the romans anyway coops is your man hes well into the romans what were you going to ask me credenhill not roman no but there was a roman town below it magnis all under farmland now right yeah but probably more extensive than they imagined credenhill is this something to do with syd spicer possibly merrily gazed into the inglenook where the fire was in just the logs smoky grey and not apple ok here they were mother and daughter in the pub adults not much if anything she couldnt discuss with jane any more syd was at huws chapel last week genning himself up on aspects of deliverance we never found out what he was looking for i need to find out whether that had any relevance to his death need to dont ask jane shook her head you lead a very weird life mum i know whats up with barry whys he keep looking at you i think he wants to talk but not with me here right he can wait no its ok jane sank the last of her cider slid to the end of the bench i need to call eirion again hes coming over at the weekend staying tonight with his dad and his stepmum and then coming over to hereford to see some mates from school and then he wants to stay with us if thats ok i said id meet him in hereford tomorrow afternoon its always ok but are you ok yeah im ok im glad we always remember were on the same side merrily said you know that yeah i do thanks for the drink mum and like thanks for you know not biting my head off and she was gone leaving merrily deeply unsettled thanks for not biting my head off had she really said that jane a new glass and a bottle of brecon spring water arrived on the table barry slipped into janes seat didnt think youd want another cider but i can go back no thats fine thank you how much do i on the house barry nodded towards the fire door through which jane had left problems there janes a bit overwrought about proposals for the village cant help thinking shes heard something about savitch and the swan not from me nice when a kid bothers about heritage yes i suppose it is never felt part of anywhere before and so if she thinks anyones trying to damage it merrily poured out some water i suppose you want to know how i got on with liz put it this way ive learned more than enough in the course of the day to support your opinion that byron jones is a man to be avoided if at all possible good unfortunately it may not be possible so id quite like you to tell me everything you were keeping quiet about last night theyre dead barry all dead now whats that mean barry wasnt drinking tonight he glanced over his shoulder could mean a lot of things i could go and ask james bulldavies and hed ask william lockley and lockley would feed it back up the line and five weeks later james would come back and tell you your question was inappropriate barry looked down into his cupped hands on the tabletop remind me which of us started all this merrily and then tell me how necessary it is to go on with it merrily moistened her lips with spring water can we go back to when you said byron had changed last night you suggested hed become abnormally ruthless when did that happen barry looked around again nobody was close id say there was a change in him after the iranian embassy operation but i thought he wasnt i know he wasnt but he thought he should ve been missed out on all the acclaim no kiss from maggie thatcher barry shrugged luck of the draw but he didnt see it that way merrily remembered watching it live on tv a sunny early evening in london a very public operation normal tv programmes cancelled for the final act of the big news story of the week half the nation gathered round the box as cameras tracked the masked men abseiling down from the roof into the embassy where six terrorists were holding twentysix hostages smoke bombs going off all but one of the hostages rescued all but one of the terrorists killed shot dead with practised efficiency by the boys from hereford some of whom even now were only ever filmed in silhouette james bond for real and it had turned soldiers into superstars when you say the luck of the draw they just pulled the boys from the killing house its all in the public domain now theres this training building they call the killing house where we practised how not to shoot the good guys by mistake word comes through theres a job in london they pick the boys whove just completed that aspect of their counterterrorism training driven out of hereford down to london in the white range rovers frank collins was one wasnt he did the smoke bombs why did byron think hed been passed over because maybe he was i dont know what happened i wasnt there but he mightve made some small error of judgement in the killing house or elsewhere situation like that you cant afford the smallest mistake a guy who was closer to him than me he reckoned byron was convinced hed been dropped because they thought he didnt have the bottle for it that was how he seemed to have translated it i thought you werent even selected for the sas unless your courage hes the kind of guy gets fixations even the regiment cant alter your personality something drove him further into himself and into his training personal training he never stopped no more social life for byron when he got married were thinking whered she come from syd wasnt in the embassy operation was he even peripherally no he wasnt and before you ask most of the embassy boys are still alive can you think why byron might have wanted to live near credenhill dont make much sense to me he never served there merrily poured out more spring water barry what are you not telling me blimey vicar look all right it would be silly to say no psycho ever got into the regiment although selection does weed them out you think hes psychotic im not qualified to make a mentalhealth assessment its my understanding and for christs sake keep this totally to yourself he was later seen by army psychiatrists you know why um yeah i do more or less same rules of course i wasnt there when this happened either but it was an exercise in the beacons where youre divided into two opposing sides its about fitness and tactics and ingenuity thinking on your feet in reality youre on the same side you know where it stops or you should do what did he do nothing that was the point thick fog young guy falls some distance down a slope bangs his head on a rock dies a week or so later in hospital byron was lying in the bracken watching when it happened it was suggested he couldve warned the boy he was close to the edge he didnt they were on opposite sides for the day and it wouldve drawn attention to his position byron didnt know when to stop it was according to what we heard it was like hed forgotten you had to stop couldnt understand why anybody was even questioning his attitude i believe there were other occasions when his common humanity was called into question how not going any further down that road the guys on the end of it theyre mainly still around and it wasnt like he was the only one can you explain that a bit more i cant explain it at all merrily you said before that even the regiment couldnt alter a mans personality something did yeah barry said something did what it meant of course was that nobody in his right mind wanted to be in byrons gang any more which was causing a bit of upset so in the end he had to go he was given an admin post and then he went where did syd come into this he didnt syd had gone before it got tense because im wondering if this could be a reason for the rift between syd and byron liz and fiona both think it was something to do with syd getting ordained but they could be wrong all i can tell you merrily is byron wasnt popular the last years a wary stillness around him now merrily had the feeling that while hed been talking hed worked something out something he was still unsure about it was becoming clear that anything she pulled from this was going to have to be worked for she looked around the bar james bulldavies had come in with alison amanda rubens and her partner gus still no sign of lol in view of all this she said it seems more than a bit odd that byron should want to come back and live near the new camp at credenhill you asking me if he had a grievance to work out no way that dont happen more likely its just business if hes running an adventure centre for sasfantasists nowhere better to put it than near the sas merrily shook her head had a drink of water he seems to have virtually cleaned out his bank account just buying the land well its paid off if hes bringing in the punters syd was in this history club that byron started right was he do you know any of the others who might be prepared to talk to me no too quick too casual but you must know a bit about the history club barry because it was you who first told me about it yeah so you know who was in it at least some of them barry took a long resigned breath i knew them yeah knew them yeah barry said knew you satisfied now the thorny night the clouds had sunk to the horizon in layers of brown like the sediment in cough mixture an early yellow moon was floating free very close to full the night was saying just do it lol had driven slowly along what the map had identified as a roman road right through the centre of magnis where you turned right for kenchester and then back towards brinsop common hed reversed the truck tight up against a field gate the kind of place youd never leave a vehicle in the daytime but at least it was out of sight bax was right you couldnt see the place from the road only the recently planted woodland a black cake of conifers at the top of a slow rise credenhill hard behind it like a prison wall there was an entrance with a cattle grid but no barrier except about thirty paces in a galvanized gate ordinary farmissue closed with a padlock hanging loose nothing to suggest private land except the sign quite a modest sign black on white mud around the edges the compound training centre trespassers unwelcome the night that had said just do it went quiet lol stood and looked around hed put on his walking boots he had the minimaglite in his jeans but there was still enough light to see where you were going so he left it there he didnt have a jacket his sweatshirt was worn thin he had to push up the sleeves because he could feel the cold through a hole in one elbow he climbed over the gate but left the track stepping into a thicket of low spruce there was a caravan at the side of the track derelict long abandoned a coating of mould rags at the windows further along an old cattle trailer its tyres long gone was held up on concrete blocks a little scared maybe but fear wasnt the worst of emotions fear could be a stimulant while shame and regret could destroy you letting things slide forgetting what was important lol walked close to the hedge couldnt see far ahead now and then something splintered under his boot he patted his pockets in case hed dropped the torch but no it was there he turned the top to switch it on shielding the beam with a hand something made of grey metal lay between his boots he bent down a grey panel the words digital interface printed along it part of a cctv camera smashed he looked up and saw a pole from which it might have fallen he picked up the camera metal sturdy professional industrialquality no need to worry about showing up on a monitor in byron joness study then lol carried on up the side of the track wasnt going to be stupid about this hed go as far the wire fence and just uh the pain had come from several places almost simultaneously it ripped up through both legs and lol stumbled to his knees then lost his balance fell over threw out a hand to push himself up and it was snatched and stabbed all over he tried to roll away and dragged his hand free and made it to his pocket and the maglite its light showed rusting metal tendrils wound around his lower legs like a manacle of thorns oh god this was the fence had been he looked up and saw double strands of barbed wire stretched between poles like arched lampposts between the strands he could see where a hole mansized had been cut where hed walked into the wire cuttings coiled on the ground brutal metal brambles someone had done this someone had been and smashed the cctv cameras and then taken wirecutters to the fence someone had broken into joness training facility breathing through his teeth lol began to unwind the wire barb by barb until he could stand up he stayed there for a while as though if he moved it would go for him again slowly he pushed his hands down his legs damp jeans fused to the skin by warm blood and cold dew his hands hurt he found three more deep cuts on fingers that wouldnt be holding down a chord for a while danny would be furious he found a ragged tear in the wrist a dark cord of blood unravelling into his palm as he stepped away from the barbed wire a severed strand whipped past his eyes and he realised that without wanting to be he was now inside byron joness compound bleeding all over it lol crouched behind a bush everything here seemed to come with spikes and barbs and thorns and the metal had seemed more alive than the winterbrittle foliage a filmy moonlight exposed a space surrounded by conifer woodland like the exercise yard in some old pow camp halfcindered huts around the perimeter an oil tank on concrete blocks close to the centre a barnsized building of galvanized metal with no windows nearest to him a nissen hut half buried in bushes and brambles when a small tight creak came from the hut lol almost threw himself back into the wire one of the doors one of the doors had moved he sank down again breath slamming into him like a punch he waited mustve been five minutes nothing happened nobody came out but he knew the doors were open someone had left the doors open out this is not good get out not that it was going to be easy driving home with this hand he touched it tentatively with the other one the blood was coming faster his palm was full of blood lol felt his wrist and the flap of skin that came up under his probing thumb was the size of a plectrum he made a shameful strangled noise turned away towards the hole in the wire into a hot white blinding blaze and the quiet shadowy movement of men all around him in the thorny night crucible merrily went directly round to lols but the lights were out she fumbled in her bag for the key went inside the door to the living room hung open the boswell guitar on its stand the draught sending shivers through the strings if lol had gone over to kinnerton to rehearse with danny wouldnt he have taken the boswell she would have called him on his mobile but this happened all too often there it was on the table under the window bugger she came out into the usual sensation of being watched neighbours at their windows just happening to notice the vicar slipping round to her boyfriends cottage her boyfriends bed under cover of darkness she felt a rush of angry despair wishing hardly for the first time that she was living here with lol wishing she was normal thinking about what she might do if she left the church to choke to death on its own tangled politics walking across the corner of the square to the vicarage merrily wondered what she actually could do sod all there was nothing else here for her just as thered be nothing for lol nothing he could live with if savitch was in virtual control of a bijou tourist village what if they were both to get out would he want her to go with him leaving jane who wanted to go nowhere else when she got home jane had gone bed she evidently did not want to talk any more merrily fed ethel then went into the scullery and sat down under the anglepoise lamp and switched on the laptop dead all dead now barry could remember three of the other members of the history club merrily pulled over the sermon pad and wrote down the names before she forgot them mostly nicknames jocko killed in a car crash near bristol hed been drunk greg kicked to death in a fight outside a bar in madrid hed been on holiday the third one known as nasal merrily easily found on the net by googling nasal sas murder sunday times april a former sas man serving a life sentence for the murder of his girlfriend has been found hanged in his prison cell rhys harran was said by friends yesterday to have been unable to cope with incarceration he had been involved in several fights with other inmates of londons pentonville prison harran known as nasal because of a sinus abnormality was jailed two years ago after being convicted of strangling his longterm girlfriend cassie welsh at their home in fulham the court heard he had been suffering from posttraumatic stress syndrome after service in western iraq and had failed to adjust to civilian life harran who left the sas in was described by a former colleague last night as a real tiger of a bloke his army career included operations in the falklands afghanistan and northern ireland abruptly merrily switched off the computer and rang big liz at allensmore liz said i went into the tower room tonight alone in the dark was that a good idea i dont know in some ways colin feels closer now than he did before you came but perhaps thats because i was forced to go over old ground im starting to see the bad things id turned a blind eye to just you know small things intimate things that i didnt realize werent i was a virgin you see i didnt know some things wheres your husband paul i havent told him he doesnt even know youve been i think you should tell him everything merrily said youve kept it to yourself too long and liz when you next go into the tower room humour me say the lords prayer if you can remember it and discuss it with your husband all of it tell him im a crank listen could i check something when syd came to see byron what year was that oh dear im not good on same year as the first publication of caradog that would be i expect are you all right im fine liz one more thing you remember you told me about byrons publisher coming on the phone once a woman do you remember her name ah i do know this one alexandra alexandra bell i remember it put me in mind of alexander graham bell same publisher still im not sure you want to speak to her ill try and find the number if you can hang on itll do tomorrow but if i could mention your name to her that would be useful she might not even remember me i suspect she will liz all onetime members of syds team his gang working together in bosnia and operations during the colombian cocaine war over twenty years ago then the history club barry had said stubbornly car crash barfight hanged in prison theres no connection it dont mean anything three exregiment dead not of natural causes all their deaths are different it means nothing how could it he was right of course these were men for whom violence had been a way of life who found it hard to adjust when they came out of the army who were often emotionally damaged it was no big deal except that they were all mates syds mates assume that his visit to byron at allensmore had coincided with nasals death maybe hed even read this same account in the sunday times gone to tell byron that another member of the club was history merrily began to make notes on the sermon pad under the anglepoise but she was too tired to construct a logical framework and anyway there was something missing something which almost certainly related to byrons reasons for coming to brinsop where the church with its celebration of necessary violence was a kind of spiritual crucible she sprinkled some dried catfood in ethels bowl put out the lights and crawled off to bed pausing to look out from the landing window where she could see across church street through the wintry trees lols house still in darkness she awoke at two back to the landing window still dark at lols but perhaps hed come in gone to bed a vehicle crossed the square but it was a lightcoloured van shed rung lols landline twice finally leaving a message just asking him to ring her back whatever time he got in now she wanted to ring danny but it was far too late greta at least would be in bed and greta had to work in the morning and oh god the maundy service the next time she awoke she was in a corridor sporadically lit lumpy with pipes and the smell was of antiseptic and bleach and there were double doors and an old leathered bench and the need for a cigarette im afraid you cant smoke in here breathing the uneven respiration of the chronically sick a dim and wobbly light greywhite sleepers weve always had him in a side ward an iron bed tubes brace yourself lowering herself into a clammy vinylcovered bedside chair summoning reserves of compassion as she peered below the hair dyed black into the reptilian eyeslits green tubes curling up either side of the nose like a smile hands out of the sheets rubbery snaking hands and the smell dont wake up dont wake up see it through dont wake up and jesus dont let him touch jane with his curling nail on yellowed finger scritch scratch the air rushed through the corridor like a hollow scream trailing an awakening into halflight and exhaust merrily sat up to find the dawn gleaming like raw meat in the bedroom window part five theyre all mad in one way or another theres kev who knows hes a reincarnated viking theres si who only reads books about the paranormal only a few of the boys are normal but theyre so normal that theyre weird what a bunch of crazies we are and we go out with our lethal weapons every day frank collins baptism of fire fizz it was nearly light but not quite the sun still below the tesco clock turret when bliss raided the plascarreg hilton dc vaynor with him and three of rich fords uniforms two of them women no enforcer they just rang the bell and a worriedlooking asian lady let them in and then goldie was there halfway up the reduced baronial stairway in a yellow kimono with pink dragons on it and matching turban wassis wassis you wont find no drugs yere mr francis and thats a damn fact we ent never had no drugs and anybody yere who says we ave norra problem goldie bliss opening out his arms with transparent generosity we find any dope you

of the guests try to leave without settling the bill goldie stood her ground arms folded like a very mature geisha as bliss mounted the stairs come on now goldie how much more considerate could her majestys filth be to a respected senior citizen what is this whats it about clothing and fancy goods goldie were collecting for oxfam gotter warrant have you has stevie hawking gorra gcse in physics now back off you old witch within half an hour they had quite a little boutique going in the hallway designer tops silk scarves perfume odds and ends of jewellery much of it still in the wrapping

paid for mr francis i got all the receipts somewhere how much did they owe you who the gairls how many weeks rent for that nasty little room i dont remember yeh bliss smiling kindly down at the old girl youre well known for having no head for business they were sitting in extravagant peacock wicker chairs in what goldie called the breakfast room just the two of them nobody breakfasting yet it was just gone halfseven bliss was due to meet karen at gaol street at nine hed had four hours intermittent sleep flying on blind rage so much cheaper than crystal meth all right goldie said a few weeks thassall swearder god and i never pushed hard for it some weeks i let them off it i did yeh thats why the morning they were missing you were all over the estate after them because it was rent day i never shurrup you know what i think i think and it just kind of came to me in a flash the way these things do i think that you told them ways they could pay in kind if people wants to give me

streets goldie said only cause they wouldnt bloody do it as decent iconcarrying russian orthodoxoh the shame of it goldie bliss leaned towards her sniffing at the perfume she evidently wore in bed oh the ignominy of one of herefords leading hoteliers nicked for fencing leggings and camisoles what you want and all the extra menial offences which might come to light what you want off me all right bliss lifted a calming hand lets stand back a little from this allow me to bring you up to speed on west mercias investigation of the murder of the marinescu sisters leaning back into the silly chair bliss talked very simply and with compassion about an old lady whose handbag had been stolen by two young women in a mailorder surplus store and whod been so upset that shed subsequently passed away this old lady bliss said her name was cynthia wise from bobblestock she had five children and i think sixteen or seventeen grandchildren all this background had been waiting for him when hed arrived at gaol street well before dawn a little fizz in the air at a normally cheerless hour i never knowed her mr francis i never goes near bobblestock yeh but what a tragic story eh goldie could be you couldnt it in a year or two yknow if that was my gran god rest her little old soul id feel more than a bit aggrieved at these people coming from the fringes of the euroheap as good as murdering innocent pensioners for a cheap handbag and a couple of twenties cause the death of a decent muchloved old lady and what happens to them if they get nicked first offence bugger all what kind of justice is that goldie i still dont know goldies cold eyes jittering just enough for him to know he was in what you wants well i havent actually made up me mind yet but im you know im wairkin on it always helped you out mr francis you knows that goldie folding her arms hands vanishing into the opposite sleeves i dos everythin in my powers to help the police bliss sniffed not done much at all the more i think about it norenough to melt me stony heart on this one well i dont know about no handbags goldie so far back in the chair now that you could hear its fibres twisting you wont find no handbags yere thass a damn fact well no the only place id expect to find a stolen handbag is at the bottom of the wye with a brick inside oh yes closing in i suppose you could try talking to me maybe a few anecdotes youve heard from your clientele and the gentlefolk around the plas bearing in mind that i dont care where it comes from if its sufficiently entertaining and contains an element of verifiable truth and youve gone quiet goldie i needs time no you dont not really but go on ill give yer five minutes during which you can tell me why the girls left magnis berries was one of them raped threatened with rape or a beating if they didnt do what they were told or was it simply just an unhappy love affair with a man who wasnt what he seemed what did they disclose to you over the cocoa and the tarot now listen mr francis i dont know about none of that you gotter believe me no cocoa no tarot neither i brings out the cards one night they was near to crossing theirselves them ole villages in romania its like nothin changed in centuries i says right you are loveys i understands what we talking about the dead goldie looked up defiant thats why they was told to leave bliss was silent oh fuck was this contagious dead people all around in the mornin mist the cold comin off of em dead men got so nobody would work with them so they was told to leave and thats it is it i knowed you wouldnt understand bliss felt his mood darken goldie that earns you no points at all and youre out of time so lets go back to the old lady heres the bottom line if the killing of maria and ileana marinescu is linked to what happened to granny wise and the killers were to find out exactly why youre bloody mad you are why those girls were forced to target old ladies in a hitherto safe city if by some unfortunate leakage of investigative data they were to find who was running the marinescus they or their mates might think there was unfinished business goldie you know what i mean goldies wicker chair creaked in a fragile way youre an damned evil bastard you are mr francis yeh bliss said and the wairst of it is from your point of view i might soon be departing this division so i have absolutely no reason to look after you any more aggressor the light in the church was dusty brown a muffled sunglow in the chancel this early it always felt like some ornate derelict cinema merrily had washed and dressed very basically a couple of hours before shed need to get ready for the maundy service no sign of jane yet so shed fed ethel and run across the road to lols house the early light had hung a grey pall on the empty living room where the wood stove was dead shed tried the knocker pointlessly and then she was walking back across the empty pinklit square panting dazed and wideeyed with panic could she ring danny at kinnerton this early she was not possessive didnt pressure didnt chase not a worrier she sat on the edge of the chancel the church keys lying on a stone flag at her feet shed prayed then let her fears lie for a while unexamined as fleshcoloured light through the high plainglass windows laid a greasy sheen on the pew ends been letting things slide lol had said you and me both merrily picked up the keys and stood she already had her mobile out not at all mrs watkins greta thomas a woman whod spent half a lifetime competing with amplifiers i been up hours merrily waited in the dewy churchyard until danny came on and said no no lol wasnt there no he hadnt been last night neither when you seen him last merrily about fivethirty last night i had a parish council meeting and i thought wed arranged to meet in the swan but he didnt show up and hes not been home he dont go many places do he his truck its not like him is it id ring the police but its just a few hours and hes a grown man theyd probably just laugh at me you got any idea at all only a worstcase scenario i better come over now danny said on the refectory table there was a note written in dying biro mum sorry totally forgot es birthday need to get the early bus into town ill call you love j jane needed to get a birthday present for eirion before she met him in hereford this afternoon eirions birthday again so soon was he nineteen twenty even feeling halfrelieved at not having to tell jane about lol merrily started making tea and toast which she didnt want just giving her hands things to do while waiting for the news on radio hereford and worcester like if there was nothing on the news everything would be ok the only local item was ward savitch talking about opening up the court to the public over easter to thank the delightful people of ledwardine for being so welcoming when the phone rang in the scullery merrily abandoned both the toast and savitch it should have cleared her head like a bucket of water from a deep cold well any other time liz said a colleague of yours died leaving unresolved issues relating to a man i had dealings with yes i no longer publish him of course alexandra bell said nor i imagine does anyone it was the worst three years of my career so i feel under no obligation at all to protect whatever remains of his reputation heartening to hear that liz finally got away a faint australian accent an editor of childrens books you expected circumspection a touch of the fastidious but this was a woman who wasnt holding back who had clearly waited a long time to let all this out to the right person merrily sat down and lit a cigarette maybe she was the right person but this really wasnt the right time erm i didnt want to my original intention was to try and find out the substance of the other two books in his caradog series which now seem to be out of print dont know how much you know about publishing reverend watkins but firstnovelists are normally easy to work with you want changes made theyre so grateful to be getting into print they seldom argue he argued he simply ignored all my suggestions and refused to answer my questions if i asked about the historical basis for something he wouldnt tell me need to know was one of his phrases have you met him no as a writer he wasnt arrogant he wasnt boastful had no pretensions to be any kind of stylist he simply thought that if he came up with good enough stories and they were good stories no question it didnt matter where they came from but childrens fiction requires if anything more attention to history so well yes merrily watched the sunlight gobbling up the dusty panes in the scullery window the day racing look if could so in the end i went up there to see him oh id been before when we first signed him to persuade him that caradog would work better as a childrens book a boys book he was charming a very attractive man i think he thought i was just a girl with a chequebook i dont think he realised id be his editor the second time he was very different when was this probably six months later around this was when a number of issues had arisen about his manuscript sexism extreme violence a lot of that oh christ yes lot of kids books involve megaviolence but not how can i put this not delivered with the relish the exultance that byron displayed im no wilting lily i come from a part of australia not widely known for being ultrapc but to me it was unsuitable for young readers without major surgery in the end we got away with reducing it to the bald facts as in he cut the mans head off he rarely minded us toning down his prose no prima donna stuff there what i found most iffy and im not what youd call a person of faith was the way the violence was equated with religion in what way merrily pulled over the sermon pad and a pen in the first book caradogs faith doesnt seem to be defined we assume hes a pagan but what kind i did some research of my own theres a story that caradog was converted to christianity while in rome after his capture now that might be a myth but its an accepted myth in byrons book however in the second book hes already been converted here in britain by whom by himself im sorry caradogs first battles with the romans are in the east in kent and theyre largely defensive but at some stage he travels west to attack roman settlements and he becomes the aggressor would this be at credenhill dont remember what i do recall the reason caradog is able to inflict such wholesale carnage is that he and his men are beating the romans at their own game theyve studied and adapted and developed the romans own tactics which are strengthened by certain religious practices he explain what these were in gratuitous detail which was one of the reasons i came to see him came down this day on the train and we went out to lunch in his land rover it was winter really winter when i asked if we might have the heating on he said it didnt work plus the land rover was open at the back and it was absolutely flaming perishing when we got out at the pub i could hardly speak for the cold didnt he notice if he did he certainly didnt comment on it afterwards id foolishly asked if we could visit some of the locations not realising id be expected to follow him on foot to the top of a very steep hill not wearing the most suitable footwear when i stumbled he stepped in to stop me falling good of him by seizing my left breast oh god i was pretty scared but he didnt try to kiss me and he didnt touch me again it was as if it had never happened he pointed out aspects of the view which i dont remember at all and then we went down and he dropped me off at hereford station and that was that merrily thought afterwards he just said goodnight i dont think he even remembered my name he touched you as she heard a vehicle drawing up in front of the vicarage drive please godim sorry are you saying he touched you as he might have touched say a man oh no it was done in an explicitly sexual way but without in some way it was done without emotion with firmness rather than what you might expect with dispassion i really dont think i imagined that presumably liz doesnt know about it god no i told her later how difficult he was as an author and if it hadnt been a threebook deal wedve dumped him i doubt she passed the message on did you see him again i did not i reverted to emails the fact that the second book in the series was rejected by his american publisher i think convinced him to softpedal they were far more sensitive about the religious aspects than we were bible belt and all that im still not quite getting this the books seem to be suggesting a violent merciless type of christianity which makes men into pitiless killers they slaughter everything women children in their path without an atom of remorse and the training for this militarised savagery is described in exhaustive detail id email you copies of the original manuscripts if i hadnt binned them years ago is that what you wanted to hear its not what anyone wants to hear i dont want to know what hes done but if you do have to see him best you dont go alone can i call you back if so many more things she needed to ask but the possibility that the vehicle outside might be lol have to be tomorrow alexandra bell said i have meetings all day why i called you so early it was good of you yeah well no worries only a floating dread when merrily made it back into the kitchen clawing her way through a fog of anxiety all of it now involving lol the sun had come out and the refectory table was lightly dappled suddenly perversely it was a lovely spring day the first of the year and it wasnt lol at the door it was danny thomas and gomer parry gomer had an unlit rollup between his teeth he was wearing one of his own gp plant hire sweatshirts under his old tweed jacket we been round the lanes danny said talkin to folks we knows one feller he seen a truck like lols gettin some attention then it was took away i dontwhere merrily looked from one to the other gomer with his cap rolled up in both hands like an overstuffed brown baguette dannys pitted bearded face expressionless his mobile in one hand danny said and then i just had a call merrily this ent good spout no all right bliss said we wont bring anyone in just yet we need to gerrit all neat before we make a move karen dowell was with him in his office in gaol street also darth vaynor newly promoted to position of trust on his desk in white sunlight a file victoria buckland aged twentyfive a woman of violence eighteen drinkrelated convictions four for assault the latest of these included violent assault on a teenage girl during a brawl outside a dancemusic venue off widemarsh street the most interesting was the attack on a man shed been living with one snappish hungover sunday morning victoria had stabbed him in the right eye with the brokenoff spout of a teapot oh she was a celeb victoria and cultivating it the tattoo on her left arm said i do the fucking karen said you remember nerys edwards dc at leominster vaguely bit her on the face victoria bliss nodded i do remember her now i remember the scar but if that was down to victoria she could onlyve been what nine mother of god passenger in a car nicked by a couple of kids not much older it crashed into a lamppost and victoria had some bruising and abrasions so nerys bends down and lifts her up bad mistake not one anybody could feasibly make now is it bliss looked down at the picture winced i take it we have her on the streets at the right time we have her in darth vaynor consulted a printout four or five pubs so far including the monks head we also have her twice in high town in the early hours at she was depositing a lager bottle tidily in a litter bin thats gorra be a first hard to believe even goldie andrews grassed her up vaynor said all the way to the hossie bliss recalled the lad with the spout who couldve died was still insisting he stuck it in his own eye goldie however im pleased to say spotted the writing spraypainted in gold on the wall at the top of her naff hollywood stairs you have a way boss karen said victoria is just the icing karen you baked the cake shed done some exemplary work on this mustve been in long before dawn on the phone then slipping over to bobblestock soon as hed rung in from goldies to see granny wises family all right it wasnt exactly the result hed wanted but maybe that was partly why shed worked so hard on it bliss felt grateful and a little ashamed so were gonna do this right and were gonna bring them all in at once background again karen she had this little family tree drawn on the pad demonstrating how easily even the most respectable units could become polluted the late cynthia wise former primary school teacher two daughters one of whom lynne was originally married to a peter singleton a publichealth officer with the council shed got all this from the other daughter who lived a few doors away from her late mothers house up in bobblestock lynne and peter get divorced theres one child josceline custody to lynne of course lynne is then remarried to a widower gerald buckland father of three of whom victoria is the eldest mr buckland got form one conviction for drinkdriving boss seventeen years ago people like victoria sometimes they just happen what about joss not known to us in any respect until she and carly horne volunteered as witnesses which somehow always looked a bit iffy to me a quiet kid according to her aunt possibly too quiet still waters kind of thing after her parents divorce she seems to have blamed them both withdrawn into herself not happy in the buckland home only person she was really close to is her gran grannie wise karen smiled sadly we gorra statement from auntie karen no and were not likely to get one families boss especially extended families containing victoria buckland but at least im confident she wont be tipping victoria off how close is joss to victoria the aunt thinks not very but joss is not the most communicative kid as we know bliss nodded never mind well get there dci know about this yet dci has one or two things to deal with this morning karen said you probably havent heard have you full morning assembly the whole gang a strong buzz five numbers on the lotto everybody waiting for the bonus bliss said this should be fairly straightforward ds dowell will bring in josceline singleton and carly horne arresting both if necessary dc vaynor and a few other biggish lads will pull victoria buckland shes probably still in bed so well need a couple of women volunteers anybody he was coming down now feeling a bit queasy probably just needed more coffee rich ford stood up ill put family liaison on standby just the three of them you reckon francis id be inclined to say not wouldnt you were looking at victorias known associates cctv tells us she was with different groups at different times whichever permutation of them killed the sisters would split up afterwards women on women francis im not ruling out this being an allfemale attack no but what about the signs of sexual assault well yeh but rich they werent big signs were they it was comparatively superficial like an afterthought im thinking of damage inflicted by a woman or women to maybe suggest it was sexual revenge you reckon rather than racial thats how it looks in the wake of a fairly despicable robbery and the tragic consequences a little girl emotionally insecure loses her beloved granny the only relative shes close to except her big notorious stepsister yeh well bliss had been remembering joss singleton the quiet one with the citrus hair her mate carly horne doing all the talking casual nonchalant got us an afternoon off college anyway although you couldnt help being knocked back by how unshockable kids were these days he was inclined to think these two hadnt been around for the final act they couldnt have been so cool if theyd watched two women die like that could they still some basic questions to be answered like how did they know it was the marinescus whod robbed josss gran now im thinking that was most likely down to victoria herself who has wide contacts this is still a small city and there arent that many double acts on the street at any one time the fact that goldie knew this was down to victoria well no surprise at all there you could fill yellow pages with all goldies contacts how long had she known it was victoria though at some point hed have to go back on his own for a bit of a hearttoheart but not till victoria was safely banged up ok he said lets all do this quietly let me know as soon as you have them as the room emptied he looked up and there was annie howe in all the excitement he hadnt even noticed her come in annie was wearing her coat no makeup and she had her rimless glasses on mustve left very early you sound sure about this francis i think we can send the interpreters home bliss said scary isnt it little girls whatve we come to these girls actually came in here fingering some blokes they claimed were eyeing up the marinescus very cool you think that was bucklands idea bliss shrugged annie nodded across the room your office annie said ive never known you not want to be in on a roundup bliss shrugged not gonna be a siege is it not even victoria shell scream and threaten look around for a bottle accuse the cops of feeling her up especially the women i dont need to see that again he sat down hands behind his head anyway its karens collar shes been up half the night havent we all i dont know the details about that yet annie sat down opposite bliss he stared at her tingling with emotion and caffeinerush impressed at the way she could separate her private and professional lives seemed promising at first annie said now its slightly silly but still odd a call to the rural crime line person seen acting suspiciously couple of miles from oldcastle in a truck worth a punt it stood up too secure compound with warehouses cctv cameras smashed hole cut in a wire fence and of course the offender still on the premises youve got him then hes downstairs stagg brought him in last night by all accounts stagg was practically wetting himself with excitement thinking he was on the verge of cracking oldcastle it was apparently two hours before somebody persuaded him to call me this feller in the cells this is someone we know right annie sighed laurence robinson musician of sorts also known for his association with your friend the vicar of fucks sake annie youve gorra be kidding bliss sat up hands dropping away from the chair arms i dont do kidding as you know robinson denies it denies breaking in but he had injuries requiring stitches were still looking for the wirecutters in the woods and his trucks been brought back being gone over as we speak annie this is i mean i know you dont like mrs watkins or her god but this yes it seems faintly ridiculous but the faintly ridiculous often turns out to make perverse sense and he does have psychiatric history that was twenty years ago and all right what am i supposed to do francis you tell me he was caught on the premises whats he saying when stagg finally got him into an interview room he was saying very little refusing a lawyer not helping himself at all according to stagg he sounded guilty by the time i got here hed been formally arrested and binned for the night it wouldnt be the first time staggs overreacted on the other hand who owns the premises guy called colin jones a codirector of hardkit they have a warehouse there and a gym run survivaltype courses rent out equipment jones is exsas hes coming in later to make a statement but hes confirmed that the fence was intact and the cameras functioning at least until early yesterday evening they dont have a nightwatchman apparently not and theyve never had any trouble before you want me to talk to robinson no i do not annie was staring at him her coat had fallen open underneath she was wearing the stripy sweater shed had on the night last december when hed gone to her flat and annie stood up you have what seems like a result run with it and keep on running bliss said annie looked away tap on the door terry stagg leaned in maam annie went out bliss stared at his desk a result yeh but hardly the result anybody wanted and not his result all hed done was put the squeeze on a semiliterate woman of seventyplus karen had pulled his chestnuts out of the fire and hed get the credit do the talkinghead the radio soundbite weve now arrested several people in connection with the marinescu murders and we expect there to be charges nothing else i can tell you at this moment thank you unless of course you want to give me something on sollers bull bliss smashed his fist into the desk it hurt he was glad annie came back to the door her angular face was unreadable they were so not an item any more this time she didnt come in actually francis there is one thing you could do while youre waiting talk to robinsons partner shes in reception and then get rid of her would you girlie returns either it would happen or it wouldnt as the morning wore on jane was beginning to hope thered be a getout there were three buses to hereford today and shed missed one watched it coming as she was waiting down the street from the ox it gave her an hour before the next and then like another four hours before the one after that ok this was the decider if the bus came before there was any sign of cornel then fate had decreed she should be on it that would be fate lifting it out of her hands shed been down to the ox earlier mr cornel whizz williams the lugubrious licensee morosely scrubbing the bar down dunno where he is but he ent paid his bill yet and thems his bags so i reckon hell be back leather cases in front of the bar airline stickers on them jane had hung around for ten minutes then walked back up to the square wandering quietly around being anonymous no sexy stuff today she was in the highnecked black bench jacket fully zipped up jeans and trainers an old red beret of mums this was business a handful of people had gathered to wait for the second bus she hadnt joined them but stayed within range looking into the bookshop window where two copies of mother julians revelations of divine love were displayed on impulse she went in and bought one from amanda rubens youre joining the meditation tomorrow jane maybe think itll work into the valley of pain and death an easter miracle thatll be amanda said as jane left the shop the book jammed into a jacket pocket the bus was coming round the corner the morning sun bursting in its windows chariot of fire jane felt a certain halfguilty relief and stepped out across the cobbles then a dark grey shadow glided in front girlie returns cornel said from inside the porsche jane looked up blinked and then walked slowly over like she didnt know who this might be but was intrigued a few people moved around her some giving her a glance before getting on the bus remind me cornel murmured over his raunchy little engine growl do i owe you an apology could be me going automatically into the voice shed used on him that night in the swan i was like a bit pissed very charitable of you cornel said but i was a lot pissed he was wearing this kind of dated short chamoisleather blouson jacket over a khaki shirt with camouflage patches on it and sunglasses he didnt look cool maybe a little sad look do you need a lift i was getting the bus into hereford actually but if you want to get a cup of coffee somewhere you could park on the square with you youll miss the bus i like wanted to ask you something im not going in the swan girlie not too popular you know the bus was up against the boxters back bumper the driver jerked his thumb cornel youre like blocking the bus stop so hop in stone me girlie its a porsche massrapists dont drive cars this conspicuous janes scenario had them on foot or in the back room at the ox lots of people around but she supposed he was right never been in a porsche before the passenger seat moulded itself around her she hardly heard the door close there you go that wasnt too hard was it where we going i was going to hereford jane said i could go that way i suppose cornel drove off into old barn lane speeded up jane looked over her shoulder at the diminishing square ok look she said i was pissed and you said something about shooting cats ive got a cat i didnt shoot your cat did i well no but i was legless cornel came out of old barn lane hit the bypass with a satisfying tyrebounce and shot her a glance whats your name again jane and what did you want to ask me i she floundered hadnt expected things to escalate was still talking in girlies voice like what you said about paris ah paris france cornel began to smile the skin over his face stretched so tight that when he opened his wide mouth it was as if you could see his skull the sun was behind them now the fresh countryside opening up all the way to the black mountains but that wasnt the way they were going and it didnt seem to be towards hereford either cornel had the top down now flooring the porsches accelerator on the bypass oh and i didnt go out killing sheep and chickens either ok mr savitch needs the support of all the farmers and landowners he can schmooze jane looked across at him hint of cynicism there in relation to savitch besides he said chickens are too easy even for me it was like a gift ok go for it jane took a breath they like kill one another anyway dont they maybe thats more fun concentrating on not looking at cornel even when she felt the flicker of his glance well cocks anyway this time of year feeling the pull as his foot came off the accelerator cornel slowing down very gradually saying nothing coming off the bypass at the smallest exit lane which was just there for the sake of a couple of farms the road surface was full of potholes from the winter there was no other traffic when they hit a straight stretch cornel just stopped in the middle of the road it was you wasnt it me nicked a sack from a litter bin his lips were stretched his big chin thrust out the porsches engine was muttering she could of course get out now if she wanted to just climb out and walk off he could hardly leave his porsche in the middle of the road jane watched him warily what did you see jane i saw you put a sack in a bin thats thats it i just wanted to see what was in it and then you took it i just wanted to show it to somebody my grandad what for he breeds them she had this bit all worked out and hes always breeds what you know i dont gamecocks jane backed hard against the cars door and like hes always going on about how great it was in the old days with all the betting and how they used to feed the cocks special diets and like it wasnt really cruel because they had a good life and he he still breeds them whats he do with them cornel released the handbrake let the porsche creep along the lane like a hunting cat well thats it jane said nothing he just breeds them and hes like oh i wish it was still going on like oh id give anything to put one of my birds in the ring again so you told him did you where it came from no like i told him where i found it but not how it got there and he had a good look at it and hes like yeah thats been fighting so what did you see before you took the sack what was there to see could blow it all if he thought shed listened to him getting humiliated by the brummysounding guy im just coming up church street and i seen you toss the sack in the bin and walk off i was like curious curious when i seen it i thought it was like one of his my grandad inspired she was cruising just dont sound too glib so like thats why i took it to him thinking maybe somebody shot one of his birds but it wasnt one of his but when he seen it he got all excited and like its his birthday next week hes like seventyeight and i was thinking if i could like arrange for him to go to a cockfight one last time oh i see it was probably stupid thats why you came to the ox last night is it because your grandad wants to go to one last cockfight before he dies what did you do with the bird got rid of it in the river cornel nodded he let the porsche pick up speed the next time he spoke it was kind of sadly lies huh they just come pouring out of you dont they girlie criminal damage merrily was ready to scream at bliss until she saw the state he was in coming through the door from the stairs his jacket trailed over a shoulder out of breath a harsh pallor on his face he looked older and he looked barely in control like a man feeling his life running away from him frannie no wiping his hands in the air his voice sharp and shiny wheres your car he followed her out and they sat in the volvo on the bath street car park he had his iphone in one hand she hadnt seen him since christmas his face was damp and his eyes looked far back he shut them for a moment i was gonna come round and see yer when was that a few times but you were busy merrily was trying to hold on to that sense of twisted relief shed felt when danny had told her that lol had been arrested for damaging a wire fence where is he hes in a cell of course frannie this is lol its not my case merrily but if you can throw any light on the situation ill pass it on bliss turned to her head on one side she sank back into the patched seat shed called sophie at home asking if she could find an emergency standin for the maundy service it had happened before never exactly endearing her to uncle ted maybe it was her life that was spinning away i dont know what its about lol tried to ring me but i was on the phone probably a situation where he was only allowed one call so he rang danny thomas instead you know the guy merrily ive got till this phone goes off which could be four or five minutes weve suspects being brought in for questioning about the marinescu murders youre getting somewhere on that yes tell me about lol there were things he probably couldnt say to danny in the time he had so i really dont know what he was doing at brinsop im sorry bliss said i know me memory isnt what it was but did i mention brinsop frannie for gods sake you know him all i know is there are two smashed cctv cameras and a hole cut in a wire fence nothing stolen so it could just be criminal damage or thats insane no hang on my guess is unless theyve found a big pair of wirecutters in his truck with lols prints all over them hell get police bail and hell be out within an hour and if the owner of the property doesnt wanna take it any further itll disappear whos in charge be annie howe oh and i think the owners coming in himself later well have to see if he wants to press charges colin jones bliss looked up merrily watched curiosity pushing through the weariness like a baby birds head in an old nest then the phone in his hand began to bleep and he shouldered the car door open merrily this conversation may not be over when bliss was back in the station merrily stood on her own at the edge of the police forecourt across the road from the redbrick magistrates court how many other women had waited here for their boyfriends to be bailed how many vicars she started to laugh it sounded discordant a bit manic she left a message on dannys phone saying the situation now seemed less fraught lol would probably be bailed dear god when the mobile chimed and she brought it to her ear she found that her cheek was wet danny neil cooper mrs watkins county archaeologists department jane said you might want to talk to me about magnis do i have that right magnis yeah sorry neil youve caught me on the merrily sat down on the carpark wall military base on the welsh border road from caerleon neil said built in the late first century in the time of claudius when the occupying army was having trouble with rebellious celts anything specific youre looking for well religion i suppose a warriors religion nothing meek and mild something that might put the celts if theyd adopted it in a state of mind to beat the roman army on its own terms youre talking about caradog here probably a door under the police awning had opened and lol was coming out quite slowly the way a discharged patient walked out of hospital you see if youre talking about this area neil said most of the soldiers defending roman britain were probably not romans at all just a ragbag of recruits from all over europe theyd been absorbed into this great disciplined military structure and taught the basics so caradogs success isnt that extraordinary he wouldnt exactly have been taking on the cream of rome where did this religion idea come from a novel actually so it didnt exist merrily stood up and lol saw her the sun finding the first strands of silver in his hair he stood facing her as if slightly bewildered by the fresh air and the traffic it felt as though the whole city was watching them as she walked across the phone at her ear well of course it existed neil cooper said its a roman religion favoured by the military elite its mithraism neil can i call you back i have to go grassed the edges of the bandage were pink lol pulled his sweatshirt sleeve back over it five stitches the cops took me straight to the hospital merrily had pulled off the road a few miles out of the city where the suburbs leaked into the countryside she let go of lols hand relief and compassion turning to an irritation she didnt want to feel i still dont see why you did it what you expected to find i know it was stupid i can see that now it just seemed like i was being pointed at something if i went there something significant would jump out like half the hereford police five of them lol said all because of the truck apparently there were sightings of a pickup truck near oldcastle the night mansel bull was killed he told her how after his wrist had been stitched theyd put him in a cell in gaol street banged up instant flashback eighteen again slammed into the system fear had flared inside him he knew how easy it was to get yourself convicted of something you hadnt done through being in the wrong place the wrong vehicle theyd put him into a little grey interview room that stank of guilt hed kept telling them exactly where he was the night mansel bull was murdered giving them a list of people they could call danny thomas barry james bulldavies ds stagg didnt seem to be interested lol had met him before and hed seemed ok but now he was a predatory stranger a schoolyard bully swollen with ignorance and conceit he kept looking at my hands and the stains on my sleeves he said did i like that the feel of blood all over me he asked me that twice like hed thought of something really clever still lol leaned his head back over the top of the seat where the headrest had broken off the other cops in general were ok one went out and brought me some chips what did you tell them i said id been working on some songs went out to soak up some atmosphere it sounded bonkers even to me but then they found the ley map in the truck so obviously i was bonkers they still took a swab for dna you see annie howe no right lets just get back home merrily started up the car you need sleep uh lol shook himself i need if youve got time i need to get something sorted where brinsop the wide fields were opening out before them into what remained of magnis which was nothing you could see merrily switched off the engine arent we both too tired for humour this wasnt good they were parked where a rutted mud track finished inside a wood near the top of a hill which jane didnt know except that it was nearer leominster than hereford and therefore not where she wanted to be trees mostly conifers were dense on three sides a mesh of branches overhead janes left hand was already behind her groping for whatever passed for a door handle for a start cornel said how about you drop the hokey accent your mothers the vicar of ledwardine and you havent lived here that long jane thumped back against the door which of them had betrayed her lori from the ox or dean wall who hated her from way back cornels tongue tickled his top lip you want to take a walk jane no i dont maybe she could manage to get out and maybe she could run but cornels legs were a lot longer than hers and he was clearly a fit guy despite all the drink there were things you couldnt easily do in a porsche if one party was unwilling that would be so much easier on a lonely wooded hillside so best not to move what do you want cornel said halfturned towards her one hand on his thigh jane looked him in the eyes like im supposed to feel threatened up here its a small county all i have to do is scream what are you like cornel shook his narrow head then tipped it back and let out a roar help help this girl keeps grabbing my cock a crow replied from somewhere flashes of hard white sunlight were splintered by the stillwintry trees jane was shocked into silence what do you want cornel said she didnt feel scared any more just stupid if youre this big successful banker why are you staying at the ox even to her it sounded sulky a bit childish i like the ox cornel said its full of sad oafs who live with their mothers and wear wide wellies to stick the sheeps hooves down while theyre we all knows that one jane said in a small voice round yere where you really from all over cheltenham liverpool but this is where i belong wheres your dad dead car crash years ago my dad lives in la now cornel said got out while he could my stepfathers a maths teacher at a comp in middlesex last year his entire salary came to so much less than my bonus pretended he was pleased for me but anybody could see how totally pissed off he was really right its moments like that make it all worthwhile the day you watch your pompous little stepfather eat shit cornel leaned back hands behind his head theres my confession now its your turn why were you looking for me and dont say you werent you were in the ox twice cockfighting i told you uhhuh cornels head shaking that was girlies reason yeah well its my seems to me girlie wouldntve come near me again after that distressing incident in the swan no no listen im telling you the truth if savitch is running cockfights i want him exposed i want it in all the papers so he can never hold his head up here again and has to leave savitch the vicars daughter takes on ward savitch you dont know me this used to be a good place i mean ledwardine seeing it become the new cotswolds was bad enough all these women hugging each other in the street how are yoooo mwah mwah but having it turned into some bloody hunting resort for bastards who think you can get away with anything if you can afford to pay people to look the other way i see cornel tapped his fingers on the steering wheel i see you see what where youre coming from you did go to a cockfight oh yeah its one of those things they make you do prove how hard you are savitch lets get some lunch cornel said lol seemed to know exactly where he wanted to go merrily was wary experiencing a fleeting fear that he might have lost it and he was actually taking them to byron joness place the fields looked wide and bright and open sporadic woodland isolated dwellings a clear grey border of small mountains the foxbrown soil and the bones of magnis over a rise a small timberframed farmworkers cottage had appeared a ramshackle porch peeling render a man on his knees inside a circle of spanners and a spilled socket set tinkering with a quad bike when lol got out of the volvo he came to his feet wiping oily hands on his jeans fawt you might come back if only to find out why you grassed me up lol said sideshow a brass oil lamp obviously still in use hung low over the table the underside of the central beam was blackened two chocolate labradors prowled around watched by a ginger cat on the window sill but only the rayburn growled yeah i heard he was friends with a lady vicar bax said thats nice just the three of them around the table in chairs painted in primary colours baxs wife was at work at the farm shop owned by sollers bull im sorry bax said but anybody could see that no way was this boy going home till hed had a peek over mr joness fence didnt want him hurt was all what else can i say you couldve told me lol said told you what whatever you didnt tell me that made you think i might get hurt bax shook his head slowly dont do that mate even if you fink you know a guy from his music merrily understood bax belonged to an established subcategory of incomer the old hippie goodlifer whod made a go of it eventually winning the respect of the native farmers but knowing all the same that if he put a foot wrong theyd turn on him bloody londoner give them an acre of ground and a few sheep and they think they know it all hed learned the rural virtues of caution circumspection and some other word beginning with c that meant you kept your head down and didnt spread gossip if you wanted to survive to actually get somebody arrested merrily said youd have to be very worried about what might happen to them yeah well bax nodded at lols bandage what happened there barbed wire lol pulled his sleeve down wire which had already been snipped presumably by the same person who brought down the cctv camera cant tell you noffing about that mate thats a mystery that is one of several apparently merrily said yeah bax massaged his whiskers i had a good long chat with percy one night a lot of the old funny baccy getting smoked and he really opened up all the other stories come out the ones he still feels a bit aggrieved over as a farmer he fell silent percy had dealings with byron jones lol asked dear oh dear bax said it seemed that percy and walter had sold off the family farm and the buildings for conversion they were welloff now but still kept bits of ground a few acres here a few there mostly rented out for stock and grasskeep but periodically percy would invest in cattle and sheep again just to keep his hand in at least he used to until the night when somebody stole a young bull from his herd of herefords percys about to report it to the police when this package appears in the back porch brownpaper parcel bout this size bax opened his hands out shoebox length containing what you might call a considerable sum of money no note just the money compensation good compensation but no compensation at all far as percy was concerned but what could he do i dont get it lol said i fink we talked about the sass helping themselves to stock a bull whatever they do bax said it dont get questioned too hard everybody supports them you get used to their little ways except this probably wasnt the sas was it lol said i wouldnt fink so no any idea what happened to the bull merrily asked unlikely tove been nicked for breeding purposes mr baxter what did you think might have happened to lol if you hadnt called the rural crime line bax leaned forward in his spindly chair inspecting a burn mark on the tabletop two travellers show up one night in a van this aint gossip this is fact be not long after jones moved in so they didnt know who he was looking for scrap you know bax looked up warily bear in mind this never come out no cops involved this geezer got systematically done over while his mates still squirming around in the barbed wire fair play they never fingered jones too much to hide spect but there you go no police no defence lawyers done and dusted jones beat up the guy maybe they was used for practice bax might have smiled this is how its done boys what boys i dunno whatever boys was on the training course at the time these courses they say its all a bit unorthodox blokes arrive like soldiers back of a truck back of a van posh blokes usually city blokes living the sas life for a few days dont ask me what that means folks make allowances but the travellers that was a bit of a sideshow this widely known not widely known at all had it from a mate of mine in hereford scrap dealer who saw the state of them when they was back in business bad guys in general avoid the area dont know whose place they might be breaking into who needs cops all them rules and paperwork when you got mr jones whats it like up there merrily asked him whats there bit like a golf course manufactured landscape pond size of small lake wiv a rope bridge across quite a few sheds joness new bungalows halfway up the hill wiv a pool bout four wooden chalets parking area but you can tell its not your ordinary holiday place no flowers and most of the trees are pine and fir so its screened off all year round functional no women nah they say jones is seen around town wiv women but he dont bring them back look im sorry you mind if i ask what your interest is here its the sas chaplain who died on credenhill he was a friend and he had some past involvement with byron sorry i cant be more explicit only id rather you didnt say noffing about me wiv regard to jones the spooky stuff thats different percy always says he dont like talking about it but he loves it really some of it he exaggerates some he dont lol said so those figures in the mist that percy saw im not sure its all as easily explained as like oh its only mr jones and his course students odd fings happen dont they percy says hes seen figures lol said to merrily where the roman town was in the river mist one had a birds head he aint the only one neither bax said but thats neither here nor there less you got a weak heart they aint gonna harm you but you can get harmed which is why i set the cops on you im sorry squire as they drove away they could see the afforested hill from end to end a rambling natural mansion with great wooded halls and conifered corridors and the earthen backstairs where syd spicer had died mithraism lol said i dont know anything about that do you not much it was mentioned once at college by a visiting lecturer pagan religion curiously similar to christianity neil cooper recognized it immediately when i mentioned byron joness soldiers religion i dont think theres ever been a suggestion that caradog adopted a roman god to improve his fighting prowess but it obviously worked for byron he was practising it it would answer a few questions why he was getting careless with other peoples lives it might also explain the rift with syd who went into christianity with the wimps and the women not a mans religion byron jones had told his wife certainly not a soldiers religion what do i do with this lol i keep saying this perhaps you take it and dump it in its entirety on james bulldavies james is not the most imaginative of men really really not your problem merrily turned onto the brecon road past fields scrubbed raw by winter a landscape seldom noticed no villages no church towers just a road that started on the edge of the city of hereford and finished in wales on the other hand lol said more than a bit hesitantly hardwickes what fifteen minutes away he jerked a thumb over his shoulder in that direction i knew you were going to say that if anybody can put a kind of perspective on this dear god do we need that kind of perspective of course she might not be there any more lol said she might even be wedve heard merrily said tightly wed know ok lol said i didnt want to say anything about this im just a dreamy whimsical songwriter looking to pull tunes and textures and things out of the air i dont know why i went to that place last night i just did and it was a bloody awful place merrily slowed awful how im probably being subjective doesnt matter tell me it just i dont want to use emotive words it just sounds like a cliche this is no time for songwriterpride lol it was like it didnt want to let me go like even the barbed wire was alive and hungry yeah i know lol put up his hands in defence i know what that sounds like go on so when the lights when i found out it was only the police i was so relieved i wouldve confessed to murder just to get the hell out of there merrily took the next left and turned the volvo round clumsily in the mouth of the junction hardwicke then hells kitten it was a shock really she was in a wheelchair brenda cardelow proprietor of the glades residential home pushed her into a big lounge freshly painted in magnolia bright red cushions on four cream sofas like big jammydodgers a bulky cardigan around her tiny shoulders a blue woollen rug over her knees of course cardelows entirely to blame for this miss white said in her littlegirl voice tries several times a week to kill me utterly psychotic mrs cardelow a large woman with bobbed white hair said nothing apparently still trying for dignity it was never going to work but how little she knows miss white smiled crinkling her malevolent mascaraed eyes the poor cow has no comprehension of what i shall do to this place when im dead mrs cardelow sighed stepping away from the wheelchair miss white turned her sooty smile on merrily how charming you look my dear and robinson with a bandage to hide the needle marks hadnt realized you people put it into the wrist nowadays so long since i used to watch crowley shooting up lol smiling patiently had wandered over to the window which had a long view down the garden over the wye to the radnorshire hills pale as old mould lol had a jittery rapport which merrily found unsettling with anthea white she who insisted on athena you dont mind if i leave you mrs cardelow said one can only stand so much of this she gives the other residents tarot readings and tells them when their friends are going to die miss white didnt react sat gazing placidly into the coal fire behind its guard not looking up until there was the click of a closing door has she gone shes gone merrily said miss white tapped the arm of the wheelchair i keep a cyanide capsule in here you know to be used if ever i see a doctor approaching with a catheter lol said for him ah how well you know me robinson miss white giggled a sound like the chinking of old bones in an ossuary merrily coughed what erm hip common or garden im apparently in the queue for a stretch in some frightful nhs hellhole where if they dont like your face they slip you a fatal infection somewhere else to haunt in the interim i do rather like this chair it allows one to move around in a perpetual meditative state would you like me to describe your aura not really jaundiced what a worrying amount of yellow youre afraid of losing control in fear of your immortal soul again oh dear god keep her out keep her out merrily moistened her lips recalling the first time shed been to the glades when thered been reports of a presence on the third floor and the then proprietors had wanted an exorcist to calm the residents underestimating miss whites propensity for playfulness like the elderly kitten she so resembled a kitten with over fifty years experience of the techniques for personal growth circulating in the ruins of the hermetic order of the golden dawn hells kitten but how strange to see the two of you in the same room at last an item her eyes twitching from merrily to lol and back again flitting in and out of one anothers energy fields like neurotic damsel flies delightful in its way but it must not go on much longer do you hear me arching suddenly out of her chair expanding into so much more of a presence sort yourselves out at once you dont have long to decide before something makes the decision for you and that may not be the one you hope for thank you miss white merrily said lightly a constriction in the throat dear god how stupid was it to have come here now remind me watkins what was the name of the detritus that became briefly attached to you merrily hesitated just like she had the first time there were clergy she could name whod have her defrocked for even talking to this woman no dont tell me miss white said how could i forget it was delightfully appropriate joy yes yes joie de vivre joie de morte hes back is he he isnt back it isnt me this time its someone else someone who cant come in person due to being dead but not at rest athena i dont know the glades had a lift and they went up in it to the exotic room on the third floor not much had altered the same afghan rugs on the walls the same book cupboards the same radiogram although the whisky bottles inside would be several generations down the line miss white sent her chair whining softly to the uncurtained sash window and turned her back on the view of hardwicke church which was greystone welshlooking like brinsop a small bell tower with the bell on show your church shed said that first night is like some repressive totalitarian regime everyone has a perfectly good radio set but you try to make sure they can only tune in to state broadcasts signalling merrily to the parker knoll armchair and lol to the bed her face became momentarily serious so its mithras is it if youd be so good merrily said which one the original persian lord of light who predates zoroastrianism or his very much darker roman descendant who may just spoil your day do you mind awfully merrily sat down we had a oneoff lecture at theological college it was about dealing with the smartarses wholl tell you jesus was just another permutation of the pagan archetype wasnt mithras born on december th indeed and his mother was a virgin and he never had sex his crib was visited by adoring shepherds his followers were baptized and worshipped on a sunday they represented holy blood with wine and at this time of year ate hot cross buns and all this half a millennium before the birth of jesus merrily said whats left to spoil miss white frowned always encouraging theyre just patterns athena death and rebirth all that early christianity slipped into the timehonoured seasonal rituals so people could begin to see them in a new light now that the world was finally ready to learn about the unifying chemistry of love there you are a quiet revolution and no blood shed but his hows that glib i prefer succinct merrily said never entirely comfortable with all this though the candles of faith flickering feebly under the arc lights of history and scholarship the nights when you couldnt get to sleep and doubts hovered in the shadowed corners challenging you to snap on the bedroom lights and discover there was really nothing there nothing at all except athena white showing her little teeth if you know all this watkins what do you want from me well thats all i know about mithras and mithraism although i think i recall old pictures of him in one of those caps like a beanie the phrygian cap ill accept that the little chap was less handsome than christ with that perpetual petulance but then the roman mithras was all about finding spiritual fulfilment through killing an ancient sun god adopted by roman emperors hailed as the protector of soldiers a sun god worshipped in darkness in underground chambers stinking of blood now what exactly are you looking for dont know how it works basically only that it was eventually supplanted by christianity supplanted thats what you think is it well it certainly came off second best even at the time did it miss white hunched herself up coquettishly like a venomous bushbaby in the fork of a tree i imagine youre familiar with the missives of st paul who instructed the ephesians to put on the whole armour of god the breastplate of righteousness the helmet of salvation the sword of the spirit what a thug that guy was merrily said uncertainly and where did he get it where did all that military imagery come from his home town of course tarsus a veritable hotbed of mithraism onward christian soldiers mithraism wasnt supplanted by christianity at all they existed side by side for centuries and one fed the other scholars ask why mithraism suddenly disappeared it didnt of course merrily sat shaking her head whatever you got from athena white you had to pay for big time consider watkins its not merely the military imagery thats seeped into the churches its the whole ethos think of the crusades the spanish inquisition the ghastly bush and that grinning shit blair who took us to war and then had the audacity to turn catholic miss whites eyes lit up now there was an interesting coincidence the bloody thread of the true roman religion does he even know do you think not for me to say hold up your bloodied cross and what do you see the handle of the sword of mithras the sword which now forms what some might think of as the spine of christianity well thats not quite tell me this watkins how do you know that you yourself are not to some degree a child of mithraism merrily smiled because athena im a woman miss white clapped her tiny hands excellent reply now we can begin cutting edge danny looked up at the black iron gates which wouldve replaced a standard wooden fivebar the wall of dressed stone where it used to be chicken wire what we gonner be looking for then gomer blood feathers empty lager cans he had his new phone with him supposed to be a decent camera in there with a shedload of pixels should do the job shading his eyes he looked out over the shining roofs of all the cars to the high ground behind the court its all changed cant change the countryside boy gomer said you reckon the ole unicorn was up by the top bridge and the cockpit was in the field behind the yard so i reckon its gotter be up by that stand o pine well fenced off danny said so we gotter do it the hard way hed been hoping they could get what theyd come for without having to go in with the media and the gentry and the dickheads in chains of office far as he could judge from the number of parked cars there was likely two hundred people here press radio and telly and a bunch of bored freeloaders helping themselves to a rich bastards hospitality halfway up the courts new gravel driveway they were stopped by a stocky woman short bleached hair a warning finger on her lips regional bbc were interviewing savitch with his house in the background the reporter mandy patel smiling up at him and nodding hard the way tv reporters did but nobody ever did in real life oh dear me no savitch was going not the new cotswolds this is absolutely not about the socalled new cotswolds this is about the old marches lifting a fist like hed just coined a new slogan what a dick a phoney cheer went up from behind him from folks danny had never seen before whose idea of the old marches would be around gomer turned away fishing out his ciggy tin in his old tweed cap yellow muffler red and green trainers from hay and brecon farmers he looked like part of the stage dressing now its a fact savitch was saying that last year by far the highest percentage of british incomers tthis area was from london itself however you included of course mandy patel said indeed yes of course mandy but whats seldom understood is that most of us dont want tbring london out here we want tsustain and fortify the essential character of the old marches everything we do here comes out of the area local skills local tradition i want to win the respect and trust of the real people jesus wept this was how the americans used to talk in iraq while all the corpses got shovelled off the streets hearts and minds gomer sniffed rolling his ciggy got a few hard looks but nobody was gonner challenge a man who looked more old marches than any bugger here danny looked beyond the tv people at the tartedup farmhouse its reblackened timbers bulging like black botox lips around the white plaster he saw men in oldfashioned leather jerkins women dressed as serving wenches with trays of fizzy wine he saw a load of phoney shite there wasnt much more to savitch than spreadsheets and flowcharts but a few folks would clock the muted tweedy jacket and what looked like working mens boots and go gotter hand it to him at least hes making an effort to fit in some country folks when it came down to basics were no wiser than town folks mandy patel lifted a finger then the cameraman straightened up from his tripod and savitch shook hands with both of them and moved on along the drive people patting him on the back ok thanks the woman with the short bleached hair said to danny you can go through now thank you for your patience looking down her nose at gomers ciggy then turning away talking to a woman with a nametag that said country pride magazine danny hung around listening going to ask you about countryside defiance rachel the magazine woman said i see youve a stand over there well sure this rachel said and danny recognized her now from the tv countrydwellers are still seen either as dinosaur gentry old hippies or retired rosesroundthedoor types if we dont start appealing to younger people with money were going to be dead in the water darling danny turned away feeling like he was drowning in liquid shit saw the tv woman and the cameraman tripod over one shoulder head across the lawns past the green displays solar panels domestic windturbines geothermal heating and other expensive kit that never quite worked smiffy gill doesnt come cheap rachel said but hes certainly good value if youre trying to show how cuttingedge the country is hes not here is he the magazine woman looking hopefully around rachel frowning might come later meantime talk to ward talk to kenny whos an absolute treasure frighteningly macho talk to the local councillor pierce whos youngish and local and bent as a bloody ole forkend gomer said before danny towed him off gomer we dont draw attention right danny had nearly suggested that they call it off when hed heard about lol being in the slammer but gomer had said it could be even more important now to nail savitch on the cocking and mabbe he was right they moved on down past a white van with oldcastle catering on the side danny beginning to see folks he and gomer had worked for digging new soakaways wildlife ponds also the usual ledwardine notables james bulldavies tapping the greenoak frame of a new barn that was never gonner be used for hay swimming pool more like poor ole james likely figuring out that it had cost more than his entire stableblock and his new roof realizing he was part of history but mabbe not the kind savitch was looking to restore between two buildings not yet converted was a dark green marquee with hardkit hardkit hardkit stencilled in black all over it and these display boards with photos of men covered in muck alongside a track ended at a stile an empty field on the other side stubbled with the dead stems of last years docks and stumps of trees and piles of branches gathered for burning that it gomer up there colder now muckylooking clouds converging as gomer and danny scaled the stile and walked up the field the sound of a medieval band floating up behind them drums and possibly a crumhorn merrie englande as they moved up the rise danny looked around from landmark to landmark the church steeple cole hill the court itself in its own green nest then he saw they were standing on the edge of what surely had been the cockpit behind the longdemolished unicorn pub you wouldnt be able to tell in summer but the grass hadnt really started growing yet and the shallow bowl was obvious not many trees left around it and only a few scrubby bushes in the middle so it had been preserved at one time sure tove been and that was the point wasnt it one time shit danny said no blood no feathers no beer cans the ole ledwardine cockpit was wilderness disappointment plunged deep into dannys gut im sorry gomer gomer didnt move mabbe we was a bit dull to think they was doin it yere danny said most likely it moves around farm to farm like a circus where gomers fists clenching in the air like mini diggerbuckets they was moving round wed know about it he was right they likely would it danny hesitated gomer it possible you was wrong about that cock gomer didnt even answer they climbed back over the stile to the sound of some audiovisual presentation going on in the hardkit tent the voice of smiffy gill madbastard presenter of the octane show which danny had watched just once when itd been about jeeps just had an amazing time on the quad bike kenny mate but i would wouldnt i smiffys hawhaw laugh danny couldnt stand no more of this figured hed forgo the free champagne lunch guaranteed by lols tickets unless gomer you all right gomer bloody let her down this time ennit jane gomer you done everything a man could do mabbe we was wrong about savitch mabbe her was wrong no gotter be folks from off it was local folks id know danny felt suddenly choked up things were changing yereabouts things were happening that even gomer parry didnt know about because gomer parrys era was nearly over he looked at the hardkit tent had their catalogues through the post same as most country folk only now they were inviting him to spendplus on a waterproof jacket three year ago they was just this one tiny little rundown shop with the window all blackedout looked on the verge of closing down now a bloody chain with jackets at twofifty listen gomer was standing by the halfopen flap of the framed porch at the front of the tent his ciggy was out his face looked flushed hed taken off his glasses like this improved his hearing for us the quad bike is just for getting to the location another voice not smiffy after that yow got to rely on your own power look now danny got it he walked over stood in the entrance a flickering darkness inside he could just make out rows of chairs about twenty people watching a video on a bigscreen tv stereo sound turned up loud danny stepped inside on the screen two men were bawling at each other across a moonscape smiffy gill with his kooky grin and a wiry guy with a shaven head and a kind of circular beard like a big o around his lips smiffy said so kenny im guessing this is where the men get separated from the boys a picture came up of a landscape that was nothing but rocks and shale sloping down nearvertically to a roaring spitting river two men in crash helmets were crossing the gorge on this unstablelooking rope bridge give the lad a coconut kenny said then heavymetal music was coming up under the crashing of the river and smiffy gills laughter and the temperature in dannys gut dropped a few degrees as he walked out to gomer shit danny said in his ears the whoops of smiffy gill getting into his harness for his river crossing in his head the metallic rumble of a new jcb tractor with a snowplough attached gomer going this a hexercise pal then the long cold silence then the short laugh then give the ole man a coconut the beast within no more kitten so you think its happening now do you athena white said and you think its happening here in a way merrily said on some level yes i do miss white had directed lol to one of the book cupboards a repository of information rather than a bibliophile store with many books stacked horizontally to get more on the shelves shelf four sixth from the bottom flaking cover yes that one and the one below it she leafed through one of the stained tomes it smelled of whisky mithraism is still quite widely practised by pagans remind me of any ancient cult ill show you its modern counterpart most of the contemporary groups of course are harking back to the original persian mithra the sun god the lord of the wide pastures as hes referred to in a cobbledtogether but rather pretty ritual all very green and comparatively bloodless some groups even let women in now i dont think thats what were looking at merrily said how did it come to be a roman religion i dont think anyone knows senior romans to begin with emperors generals then spreading to lower officers if not the ranks the chaps most interested in promoting a state of mind conducive to warfare mithraists called one another brother fusing themselves together as supremely efficient fighting units like the sas i suppose if its any small comfort watkins one writer comments that the roman cult of mithras adopts the paganism of the original persian cult without its apparent tolerance of other religions and the harshness of christianity without its redeeming qualities of love and mercy a combination therefore of the least humane aspects of both christianity and the original mithraism does that suggest the roman religion was to an extent manufactured im sure it does the romans were such pragmatists even the vikings seem soppy in comparison even as magic its considered to be a lower form happy to trade with elementals and demons rather than with what you might call a spiritual source make of that what you will but gosh frightfully useful in a scrap how widely did it spread in britain its not ubiquitous but far from invisible a very good example of a mithraeum one of their temples was found in london also a famous one at hadrians wall in northumbria what about this area thats what i was miss white lifted an old brown book the mithraic world attempting to discover i dont think so actually i think the nearest evidence of mithraic worship is at caerleon which was linked to hereford by a roman road but theres probably a tremendous amount of roman archaeology as yet undiscovered in the credenhill area so it wouldnt be surprising if there was it wouldnt surprise me the romans often built shrines and temples in the shadow of iron age hill forts with a pile of books accumulating at the side of her wheelchair miss white talked for some time of what little was known of mithraic theology and a concept of the afterlife nothing quite comparable to the risible islamic promise of an unlimited supply of virgins for chaps martyred in the cause thats the stuff of mens magazines and yet there are similarities in the way it must have been used by the romans those who died in battle were expected to have an untroubled afterlife as a result of the rituals theyd practised and the degree of attainment and the rituals were well following a baptism you would have a series of grades or degrees spiritual ranks raven lion soldier and so on each with an appropriate facemask each an initiation to a higher level through tests involving danger and suffering we read of the twelve tortures of mithraism ordeals which might bring the candidate to the very brink of death from which obviously they would emerge much strengthened a universal concept if you consider your chaps forty days and forty nights in the wilderness constantly exposed to psychic attack bit different really not so different from the ordeals where recruits were made to sleep on frozen ground or in snow or were branded and buried alive though i suppose the less savoury ones like being compelled to eat animals which are still alive merrily was immediately reminded of one of the more repellent anecdotes in the late frank collinss book where collins in north africa or somewhere was urged by a senior officer to carry out an ethnic custom involving biting the heads off live poisonous snakes and eating the stillthreshing remains and they would be taken to the very edge of extinction miss white said gleefully in the sure belief that they are going to die pushed to the absolute limits of human endurance very sas it was all starting to make sense how byron jones married mithraic ritual to his own experiences in the regiment but how far had he practised it for real in a ritual context miss white was talking about haoma a herbal drink ingredients unknown named after a premithraic persian god but probably also adopted by the romans because it stimulated the senses and induced an unstoppable aggression a drug of war athena lol had his os map opened out on the aztec bedcover where might we be looking for a temple of mithras tapping the putative ley lines issuing from brinsop church have any been found under churches in the same way you sometimes find a crypt built around a neolithic burial chamber not unknown robinson according to this book the odd mithraeum has been found under a church one in rome for example but again im not aware of any inside british churches but you see one could be anywhere this whole area has been a military playground for two millennia interesting how it continues to attract the army and the mod to this day a landscape quietly dedicated to war miss white was pointing to a spot a few miles south of brinsop where it said satellite earth station satellite dishes collecting intelligence surveillance from all over the world and feeding it to gchq at cheltenham where as it happens i worked for a period in my civilservice years bloody place leaked like a sieve athena you were a spook dont be cheap robinson and what did you do to your wrist it got entangled in the barbed wire around a private military playground not sure i like the sound of that merrily sat back and thought about some implications what does a mithraeum look like like a public toilet miss white said rectangular fairly basic and utilitarian apart from a few astrological symbols and a representation of mithras himself and of course partly or entirely underground to simulate a cave certainly no windows and a channel down the middle for the sacrificial blood oh what did you expect are we talking about human sacrifice or bulls miss white said all the pictures of mithras show him slitting the throat of a bull leaning across a knee in the bulls back a hand hauling back its head fingers in its nostrils or so it seemed carnage where the sword or long knife went in the act performed dismissively the perpetrator gazing away directly as it were into camera it was known as the tauroctony athena white displayed a doublepage illustration sitting the big brown book on the blue blanket across her knees in all the sculptures and carvings and basreliefs mithras always looks away in much the same way as the greek hero perseus as he prepares to cut off the head of the gorgon averts his gaze merrily would rather have averted hers but kept on looking frozen registering all the detail hearing arthur baxter at his kitchen table unlikely tove been nicked for breeding purposes lol was the first to find his voice they still do this the modern followers of mithras if they do its hardly mainstream all a psychological exercise now in the roman myth the slaying of the bull in the cave is seen as a creative act releasing all manner of good things positive energy along with the blood to the modern mithraist the bull tends to represent the ego which must be overcome the beast within us cut him down sacrifice that side of your essence and dont look back but the romans did it for real their temples clearly were designed for it the bull might have been sedated before being butchered torn apart so that the initiate would be covered from head to foot with the blood so it would be like an abattoir lol sitting on a corner of the bed looked unhappy unlike miss white who seemed stimulated by thoughts of bloodspatter one wonders precisely when blood sacrifice that staple of the old testament was brushed under the christian carpet for a while certainly christianity and mithraism were rivals and then christ appeared to have triumphed while mithras simply disappeared up the arse of christianity so who really triumphed did they take it this far at your college watkins merrily looked into lols eyes the room was awash with bland spring sunlight bringing up the richness in the afghan rugs so this is the summit she said the final act the last step to attain the highest grade when the initiate takes on the persona of the god miss white put her hands together as if in prayer although you never liked to think what she might be praying to what might it do to a person now athena we have a man hardened up by lying in the snow made braver by coming close to death where does he go next ah watkins so much for you to dwell upon that dark seam of masculine aggression the spinal fluid of the church what might it represent this insidious flaw in the very foundations of your poorly fabricated faith im not talking about the church im talking about an individual practising a religion created in the days when hed be expected to stroll through a village torching dwellings and hacking the limbs off babies where would that level of aggression take him now what kind of training would he need to control it down in the bowels of the glades a gong was banged heavens miss white said lunchtime already before the lift doors opened on the ground floor she said radical corruption of a religion theres always fallout its corrosive a maxim worth remembering is if the worse can happen the worst will in the gilded opulence of brinsop church they confronted the earlymedieval sandstone tympanum the mounted st george with his roman soldiers skirt thrusting his spear between the dragons jaws more like a big snake than most dragons merrily stepped back but no way is it a bull no but lol pointed with his good hand to the frieze at the top of the slab that looks like a bull doesnt it he bent feeling the sandstone with both hands and these are definitely lions another of athenas degrees of mithraism also the crow raven yes there was also astrological symbolism here and there in the fabric of the church are we suggesting theres an element of mithras embedded in this landscape maybe literally it could be simply that the earlymedieval artisans who made this slab copied images from roman artwork that theyd found in the ground in the remains of magnis mustve been quite a lot left in the eleventh and twelfth centuries that made sense unfortunately what also made sense was that if you wanted an aspect of mithras acceptable to the church you might look no further than st george that was the trouble with churches full of green men and sheelanagigs and all the walleyed mutants in the pagan directory and now maybe a killer in saints armour merrily watched lols gaze panning slowly around the stainedglass light show george was everywhere even though much of it was down to sir ninian comper working as recently as the s a window in memory of the ornithologist herbert astley of brinsop court had been signed by comper with his emblem a strawberry plant lol said how prescient of him huh polytunnels oh right how much more of this merrily sat down in a chair at the end of the back row feeling as though shed been mugged fragments of faith scattered like credit cards in the gutter arena early afternoon cornel found a slot for the porsche on corn square in leominster and jane followed him down the street and across to the blue note cafe bar all period jazz and blues posters cellarclub darkness all day long except it wasnt in a cellar the wood where theyd parked was no more than four miles from the town and theyd come most of the way in silence just one word stopping jane from walking off to the bus station and never looking back the word was savitch i thought everybody loved him in these parts cornel sugared his coffee thought he was the villages salvation brought the dump alive fairy godfather grim reapers closer but then i also thought you fancied me a little bit cornel said i have a boyfriend who in a couple of hours would be waiting for her in hereford under the clock in high town actually the last time shed been in the blue note was with eirion and theyd sat under a vintage blind lemon jefferson poster killing themselves laughing making up tasteless names for damaged old british blues singers like quadriplegic cyril hewlett and morbidlyobese dilwyn lloydwilliams it was like a different lifetime when she was young and free and now she was thinking she might never get back to that i find it quite distressing actually cornel said that you actually thought i might be planning to rape you you were trying to take me upstairs the other night jane i was legless and you played along we all thought you were up for it anybody would they were taking bets on it for bets men out on a jolly tend to get childish cockfightings a jolly is it there was no cockfight that night and anyway if you dont enjoy a good cockfight youre hardly going to be up for the rest of it the rest of what dont totally trust you yet jane would you really expect me to even though cornels face looked grey and creased in the dimness she realized for the first time that he actually wasnt that much older than her maybe twentyfour she felt a rush of determination for some reason he was no longer a supporter of savitch and she needed to roll with that she brought her coffee cup to her lips then put it down again ok i told you a bunch of lies my grandad i lied about that my grandads one lives abroad i dont hear from the other neither of them breed gamecocks far as i know i got all that from a mate i took the cock to and he told me how he thought it had died i hate cruelty ok he sat looking at her with not respect obviously but he was probably more comfortable with this admission in cornels world women would always have to be a bit shocked at what men did jane picked up the coffee cup again took a long slow sip considering the evidence he was no longer staying either at savitchs place or the swan no longer hanging out with his mates maybe theyd gone back to london but hed stayed on his own and he wasnt happy look at the mindless way hed been driving like he didnt care if he crashed he peered at her in the gloom so you think im going to tell you about the cockfights and help you tie ward savitch into it somebodys got to stop him before he buys up the entire village and youd expose him how being as how savitch is ringfenced and lawyered to the gills my boyfriend jane said hes a journalist is he really he can get the story out all we need to know is where its happening where hes doing it cornel had started to laugh you dont know me jane said i can do this and you think im going to tell you what i know you dont have to be implicated we dont have to name you a silence holding her hands together under the table which papers your boyfriend work for then he freelances for the sunday times you mightve seen his name eirion lewis she was on safe ground here a big fat paper and nobody ever remembered reporters names only columnists so whats in it for me cornel said she didnt know what to say jane you just dont know who youre messing with do you you just dont fuck with these guys for the sake of a few bloody chickens and some fleariddled badgers badgers jane stared at him badgers are vermin cornel said they cause tb in cattle thats debatable youre saying they go after badgers as well with dogs where you dig out the badgers and set dogs on them and the dogs and the badgers both get ripped to keep your voice down like hell i will not me all right cornel looked up to where three women were sitting down a couple of tables away not me personally i dont like to get my hands dirty you only dont dig out badgers for hygiene reasons shut up but thats something else savitch organizes for bored rich bastards right jane drop it youre a kid go away have fun anybody jane said through her teeth anybody who expects me to go away and have fun while this obscene shitjust give me something on savitch cornel why cant you do that a silence between them you could hear everything every gush and tinkle from behind the counter every scrape of a chair leg one of the three women at the nextbutone table was talking about how shed only take some guy back if he promised to cut down on the booze you told anybody about this no instinct saying lie think about it later one of the women at the other table told the first woman she was making a big mistake because they never cut down on the booze whatever they told you unless some quack told them their lives were on the line cornel said so you didnt tell your mother for instance god no why would i shes in a difficult enough position as vicar anybody gets the shit on savitch its better its me im just a pagan yes cornel said they were laughing about that in the ox yeah well they would those morons some of them found it rather titillating yeah dean wall moronic slob like i go out dancing naked its just native religion its my central interest ancient sites and stuff studied it for years cornel had his smartphone out flicking through some stuff on the screen then he handed it across whats this then huh look at it if you know so much about paganism tell me what this is the picture blinked up at jane very clear in the dim light you were looking down this weird kind of stone vault like the crypt of a church with a fairly primitive plinth at the end a tablet of stone with a carved face on it with like a mohican haircut primitive but not prehistoric and definitely not celtic is it roman you tell me well where is it cornel didnt reply jane had another look you could see stone blocks like seating stepped up from a closedin area like an arena shed seen arenas like this on the net well not exactly like this but the same size a small closedin area impossible to escape from if you were poultry holy shit cornel what is this where it happens the cockfights thinking back to the web sites shed forced herself to read it was starting to make sense the sport which had apparently been introduced to britain by the roman invaders was this some little purposebuilt roman arena a cockfight colosseum you going to tell me where this is cornel cornel smiled why should i then why are you showing me this just thought you might know what it is obviously you dont know as much as you jane put the smartphone down again looked cornel in the eyes they do badgerbaiting here too you could just imagine that the squeals the yipping and the ripping in this claustrophobic vault blood all over its walls it had savitch written all over it the way he was always going on about reviving old traditions cornel please jane im a stranger here i dont even know what the place is called guys who go there what usually happens is theyre taken at night sometimes blindfolded but you know where to find it youre asking me to take you jane read the car number plates over the bar again right to left id keep you out of it id just take some pictures on my phone and that would be it i hate to be boring cornel looked at her and not just at her face but whats in it for me cornel ive got a boyfriend and even if you hadnt you wouldnt fancy me would you jane said please poultry contest if danny had ever seen gomer this mad before he didnt know when it was hangin offence sure tbe the ole feller was flattened

you want to stick around i believe hes due to call in later sure to danny nodded a bit curt walked away without looking behind him to find gomer they went back to the jeep on the parking area where they unwrapped the sandwiches that dannys wife greta had put up for him sat there eating them very slowly not saying much danny pretty unsure how he felt about this it was around fourthirty before a battleshipgrey bmw fourbyfour pulled in hardkit in a neat curve across the bonnet they watched a man jump down he had on a shiny suit and a bow tie and carried an overnight bag wassis about gomer said danny moaned bloody dinner ennit its on the tickets lol give me this feller cant be goin to no cocking tonight mabbe afterwards gomer said mabbe a few of em sittin with their cigars watchin the feathers fly not yere savitch wouldnt risk it we better find out then aw gomer ent gonner get a better chance gomer sat back tilted his cap over his eyes mabbe a long night boy cheated darth vaynor and elly clatter arrived in the cid room simultaneously bliss ejecting from his office all caffeinedup im not wearing this son not like she can hide in a cupboard under the frigging sink last her dad knew darth said she was living with a bloke in a flat in belmont we turn up there front and back only to find the guy in the sack with somebody else didnt know where victoria had gone didnt seem too upset mind just grateful hed still got both eyes how long since she went days duh whatever day this is that kind of guy you know observant right bliss looked around wheres rich i want this frigging city dismantled elly clatter said francis if i could just what bbc are here they no tell them to piss off tell them well let them know soon as francis ellys hands on his shoulders they know its all over the net carly horne was with some of her mates when karen picked her up karen came over nodding bliss moaned kids a big social networker elly said theres now a friends of carly facebook site campaigning for her release bliss let out his breath in a slow rasp if he ever came face to face with the little twat who invented facebook so what that means is sky elly said and bbc news so far what it also means karen said is that wherever victoria is shed have tove gone blind and deaf not to know were looking for her meanwhile carlys denying everything and joss is saying very little time for you to have a go boss yeh bliss said i think it could be mentally sharpening a knife on a steel a mile or so before ledwardine merrilys phone chimed and she pulled onto the verge i dont know quite what you were expecting fiona spicer said but ive just been given the results of the postmortem it was as though her voice was in a straitjacket natural causes oh if hed been younger fiona said theyd be using terms like if i can say this idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy im told it means a sudden inexplicable heart attack in an older man even one as fit as sam its less inexplicable had you any reason to think he had a heart problem no and if he had im not sure he wouldve told me he liked to deal with his own problems as you know yes how do you angry cheated angry that he wont see his daughter married finally fissures of a deep grief under her words cheated by his god nobody to blame but his damned god can you understand that yes i can understand it fiona ive a few other people to call and emilys arrived our daughter and her fiance i suppose that means theyll release his body so we can perhaps i could call you tomorrow if thats convenient i do remember what good friday involves for a vicar whenever you like if im in church ill call you back as soon shed gone would not share the sob merrily put the phone on the dash and told lol felt like shed been kicked i realize people can go for years without knowing they have a heart condition but this is there may still be an inquest but itll be a quickie no reason for anything to come out not now she picked up lols hand below the bandage since hed told her about his minutes of fear inside byrons compound shed felt they were together again in a deeper sense flitting in and out of one anothers energy fields like neurotic damsel flies it must not go on i was thinking i could leave it for a while until after easter see if it made any more sense now if i dont do something now lol squeezed her hand as if to show he still could start by telling james about the possible reemergence of an ancient roman pagan cult and the possible involvement of a retired sas trooper in the theft of a bull we both know what you can tell him lol i hardly like even to mention it out loud you mean bull lol said mansel bull merrily put on her sunglasses and started up the car thanks for saying it first watch much tv carly carly looked up ebony hair still slanted defiantly across one eye bliss said bet youve seen all them womensprison reality shows could be worse inside couldnt it get to wear your own clothes have yer hair done decorate the cell think youre scaring me carly said of course theyre a bit misleading them shows they only talk to the mouthy prisoners the ones whore a bit of a laugh and speak english no point in following one of the many smouldering resentful east european ladies on her majs guest list i fear youre sailing perilously close to racist shores inspector mr ryan nye said everyones favourite duty solicitor all glossy black hair and geek specs interesting how the smarmy twat was always first out of bed for something newsworthy bliss shook his head you know me better than that mr nye im just thinking how aggrieved certain migrant ladies in the slammer might feel at having to share a landing with someone who set up two of their innocent compatriots to get murdered innocent bollocks carly halfway out of her chair bliss smiled had it coming did they look carly im just giving yer a chance to make things easier all round well have the dna matches up soon and thatll be that though i think its only fair to tell you that poor little joss has already seen the light ryan nye looking at him trying to work out if he was lying bliss just looked sad it was that ugly scratch just below the left shoulder blade that did it no wonder she was wearing a highnecked sweater you got any scratches anywhere carly we can get yer a plaster and a dab of germolene should i summon a doctor and a nice police lady to hold your clothes i never carly wrapped her arms around her chest you listening you wont find no dna cause i never touched either of them women could be you never did carly but that doesnt make a lorra difference nowadays whether or not you struck any of the fatal blows you still helped engineer a double murder the courts draw few distinctions any more you were involved kid bliss paused the flat of a forefinger angled thoughtfully under his bottom lip now it could be you didnt realize it would get that far if you were able to convince us of that it might help you no end though pairsonally carly id find it hard to credit cause your attitude so far has been unremittingly cocky with norra hint of remorse the attitude in fact of someone who feels the world can only be a better place without the likes of maria and ileana marinescu someone almost proud of her no yes carly said nothing bliss was also silent for a while coming on like he was thinking something out giving it nearly half a minute before he said how well do you know victoria buckland carly now was that a little shudder see we know victoria of old and shes gorra hell of a talent for selfpreservation the very last person to put both hands up and say no no its all down to me officer those kids had nothing to do with the actual violence im a grown woman me and theres no way id let young girls take the rap for smashing anybodys inspector mr nye perhaps we could save some time may i have a word in private with my client absolutely mr nye bliss said ill be just outside if required cult the tinroofed leanto that james bulldavies called his study overlooked the stable yard they could see alison out there forking sodden straw into a barrow jamess face was stretched his washedout eyes mottled with uncertainty normal way of things this makes very little sense even you must see that normal way of things merrily said she wouldnt sit down never your favourite word is it vicar normal out in the yard alison tossed the fork into the barrow she looked tired i should be doing that james said shouldve been done hours ago but we had to go into town this morning see a man about an overdraft or a woman as it turned out things are bad recession still people dont want to burden themselves with extra horses feed bills vet bills itll lift my lifetime you think james frowned watched alison wheeling the barrow away shouldve made william lockley clear out his own shit may not be his to clear merrily said not all of it she felt the ground becoming marshy shed left lol on the square in search of danny and gomer feeling obliged to come here alone and i know my limitations james he sat down in the hard chair behind an old oak desk stained with cup marks drumming his fingers on a worn blotter sas are the finest in the world at what they do train train and train again and the pressures being commensurate with the rewards of the job theres little doubt that some chaps get drawn into odd byways but the idea of a cult in fairness much of it seems to have developed after they left the regiment james grimaced drew in his chin this roman army business youre suggesting thats actually in some way become central to the exercises devised by jones and mostyn for their clientele think what people pay to go on buddhist retreats and stay at ashrams add to that a powerful physical regime and the almost mystical glow that surrounds the sas and this includes the ritual slaughter of animals i believe so for some participants the ones considered suitable and discreet and able to meet the fees an elite belonging to an elite has always been very sexy and not really a swindle id guess only in that nobody should have to pay for spiritual knowledge no i i think it almost certainly works i think it alters them psychologically and in quite dramatic ways i think there might even im sorry doesnt matter but you have to remember were looking at something specifically shaped to the military two thousand years ago when life was cheaper that we can imagine which today might have some questionable side effects on some people dangerous you think very i think james said what about savitch thats all circumstantial the link is hardkit which supplies the equipment and knowhow for savitchs hunting and paintballing weekends was at his press launch today everything in place all boxes ticked green energy but also farmerfriendly james craned forward onto his elbows no right at all to resent that man my family whats left of it we cant do anything for the community any more barely hold ourselves together but savitch is used to hear him sneering at anything that didnt fit his ludicrous concept of what country life should be about now he smiles tolerantly witters on wistfully about tradition not a sham as such he just you cant stand him can you is it that obvious james looked pale with defeat but hes such an insubstantial man that its hard to see him getting down and dirty with the likes of jones and mostyn i dont think he does i think that killing for savitch is something done from a safe distance with a twelvebore and nice gloves i think he simply passes some clients on to jones probably via mostyn for a cut and even then i suppose its like sas selection many wont go all the way and the ones who dont slink quietly away dont like it merrily army turns out men danger of this creating monsters all right whats the bottom line thats where it gets even more speculative then speculate id much rather go and lie down in a dark room but merrily pulled out her cigarettes without the usual request for clearance its just about conceivable james that somewhere along the line this takes in the killing of your cousin mansel she lit up as the legs of jamess wooden chair screeched on the stained flags william lockley was back on the phone within half an hour of jamess call james just listened his chin retracted eyes halfclosed have to remember mrs watkins is not actually in your employ william he said after a while then spent some more time listening and then barked all right will do and hung up william conveys his respects with a polite request for you to pop into hereford me idve thought merrily had her cigarettes out again she shut the pack and pushed it back into her bag where in hereford seems colin jones is coming into police headquarters in about an hour seems that after the events of last night the police thought it might be a good idea to visit his premises jones said he wouldnt be there today but as hed be in hereford hed be happy to call in at gaol street he says he wont be pressing charges against the man who broke into his premises good to know merrily said guarded lockley thinks it would be a good idea to make the most of joness presence in view of what you told me theyd like you to be there when they talk to him as a consultant they william himself and the senior investigating officer howe annie howe asked for me i dont think so james she watched alison leaning the barrow up against the house wall then taking off her leather gloves i expect im the one wholl look stupid if none of this stands up to scrutiny that bother you if it bothered me id be in a different job she called in at the vicarage to put out dried food for ethel and check the answering machine for once no messages on the way out she noticed a brown jiffy bag propped up against the wall and took it back inside the bag contained a largeformat lavishly illustrated hardback book risking all the sas experience another killandtell regiment memoir by trooper z there was a sheet of black swan headed notepaper marking a page barrys scrawl across it more from the public sector there were just pictures on the marked pages in colour one with a pencilled cross against it showed a bunch of smiling guys in tshirts holding up white mugs the caption said teatime in colombia for l to r greg syd jocko and nasal various guns were laid out on the parched grass in front of them syd was only vaguely recognisable his teddy bears eyes were covered like all their eyes with a black rectangle all dead all dead now except for byron of whom there was no sign passed away carly said victoria i reckon she thought joss didnt like her well nobody likes her that much to be honest and like most of them she dont care but joss was her little sister you know little sister lemon hair and a frozen scowl but you forgot underneath they were both little girls citrushaired joss and carly with her black nails little girls who got the life beaten out of two women they didnt know carly said victorias like ill find out who they are and well deal with them bliss nodded in an understanding kind of way while wondering how he could make her cry she explain exactly what she planned to do to them just deal with them we never thought its not like shes you know gone that far before is it as far as we know carly as far as we know tell me what you saw didnt see nothing i wasnt looking i mean it was cool at first but then you thought like maybe its not not that cool eh bliss said killing people carly turned away bliss eyed her with dispassion lets go back im talking about after joss phoned victoria to say the sisters had left the monks head and were heading up towards the cathedral what happened then what did victoria do shes like in the middle of the street the narrow street with the cobbles church street amazing how kids could be born and grow up in this city and didnt know the names of its streets and she like shes got her arms folded like this and shes not moving like if anybody tries to come past theyre gonner get you know and when these two seen her just standing there the marinescu sisters yeah they like cut off into this other street east street yeah and did you follow them we started to but vic walks over then and shes with this guy guy you knew no joss know him dont think so you know who he is now no ill be asking you to describe him in a minute and it better not be like the description you gave of the nonexistent fellers who followed the marinescus out but lets not break the flow uh was there anybody else in east street no what happens next vic she puts on these gloves kind of gloves black suede woollen mittens rubber gloves long that like unroll up your arm and the guy he put on gloves too i dint see to be honest bliss glanced at mr ryan nye who was looking down into his hands not yet five oclock but the light seemed to be fading early today as if something had sent the year into reverse up at the end of the table karen was watching the tape machine as if it was a lie detector bliss said go on carly vic catches up with the you know the women and shes talking to them we couldnt hear what they were saying then its like one of them she just trips like stumbles over and the blokes come out of like nowhere and he catches her what was victoria doing laughing just starts laughing real loud and going like oops kind of thing like the woman was a bit pissed and shed slipped and then they all like vanished thats all we seen vanished where into this where people park and what did you and joss do then carly looked at mr nye mr nye didnt even look up i think inspector he said that you can understand how intimidating my client must have found victoria buckland even though she had no reason to believe that ms bucklands intentions extended beyond shall we say putting the fear of god into the marinescu sisters apart from the gloves bliss said mr nye said nothing carly bliss said didnt you or joss feel tempted to have a little peep at what or who was going down on the car park no really i dont wanner talk about this no more where were you exactly just round the side of the building and you saw nothing but you surely heard they werent even from here now carly was jerking up and back like somebody had set light to her clothes they were bad bitches they robbed josss gran the bitches robbed her handbag with all her personal stuff in it and she was so upset she died is that why you took their handbags carly i never took nothing with the pictures of their parents and the little dog leave me alone um carly mr nye said you remember what we talked about i wish i was dead i wish i was fucking dead bliss shook his head settling back in his chair watching stupid little carly horne come slowly to pieces for the tape it was one of those country garages that didnt sell petrol and didnt have a shop looked like a semiderelict chapel of rest a bloke in brown overalls seemed to recognize cornels porsche came shambling round to his wounddown window wannit again chief same one as before the bloke nodded cornel got out his wallet turned to jane this is where we leave the car why because it just is cornel drove the porsche round to the back of the garage where an old grey van was parked when he got out the garage guy handed him a ring of keys with a wooden tag on the end cornel gave him a small fold of notes then leaned into the porsche for you girlie the luxury transport is history the sun had gone in jane slid out of the porsche zipping up her jacket beginning not to like this again it had taken them a long time to get here as if cornel had been stalling theyd walked around leominster and hed kept wanting to buy her things like she was his girlfriend now and shed kept refusing while feeling a bit sorry for him and then theyd gone into a pub where shed had one cider and hed swallowed two pints of bitter which would probably put him over the limit he didnt appear to care now he was around the back of the porsche opening up the boot pulling out a leather bag and a bulkedout rucksack lugging them back to the van get in whats this about just get in eh jane this is necessary it was dark inside the van which smelled of oil and rust cornel clanged the clutch pulling out into the lane jane fastened her seat belt the strap was frayed and flaked with mud that guy seemed to know you thats because ive hired this heap a couple of times before what for because a porsche can be a bit obvious oh right jane supposed it would at a cockfight so were going there now wait till dark but oh god you mean were actually going to a that bother you i dont know thought you wanted evidence erm ok nailing savitch would be the best thing shed ever done in her life and there might be a few other people there she could identify maybe even sneak some pictures of them on the mobile shot from the hip but what if anybody recognized her no secret in ledwardine where she stood on these issues jane watched cornel wrestling with the steering he was driving without a seat belt shed felt sorry for him a couple of times and ok she was grateful that he was actually going to help her but that didnt mean she could actually like him there were two sides to him the ruthless and the kind of weak and hed done things obviously hed shot things without a thought and hed been to a cockfight and wanted to eat a cock because hed lost money on it how do you get on these courses anyway sponsored by your firm i was the first from my bank as it happened heard about it on the grapevine heard what how some other guys were so impressed that they kept coming back for more you could see the effects somehow in their attitude well not only that some guys it was almost awesome the difference so you got to come back the van went rattling onto the main road its suspension creaking when jane looked at cornel to see why he wasnt answering his face seemed to have darkened lot of envy in my business jane people whisper lies and get believed people who didnt want you going all the way all the way because you just might go further than them and that would never do because they went to eton and you struggled through the system and so the knife goes in dead carly said hes like shes dead this is the man bliss leaned across the table the man with victoria and then hes like all i done was push her and then victoria shes a bit annoyed she goes oh she fell on a kerb kerb kerbstone thats what she said she says oh she mustve got a head like a carly jerked back her ravens wing of hair flying up i cant do this bliss said head like a eggshell carly twisted away and then she goes youre f cant we do it later tomorrow i might be able to remember better im all carly bliss said i want you to tell me precisely what victoria said the words exactly as you remember them she says youre fucking right shes passed away something penetrated blisss spine he leaned across the table she used those actual words passed away yeah and what did the other one say the other sister i dont reckon she understood what they was on about then there was like a bit of a like a scuffle and then like victoria carly grabbed mr nyes arm i cant say this stuff tell him i cant do this tell him youll note my clients level of distress inspector this was quite evidently something so abhorrent to her that she could hardly believe it was happening point taken mr nye for the moment carly what did victoria say next i wont have to see her again will i im guessing not for many years if at all bliss said softly if you tell us the truth i cant go to prison carlys cheeks all zebrastriped with damp mascara you gotter promise me i wont go to no prison out of my hands carly i mean you know sometimes i get listened to but youd have to get me on your side first and youve gorra long way to go before wheres my mum did you call my mum carly you refused to have your mum in with you well now i want her bliss thought about his own kids how they might turn out after exposure to the influence of a rich cocky farmer with hunting skills carly mustve seen the darkening of his face she seemed to throb gonner be sick bliss didnt move what did victoria say after she noticed the lady had passed away come on carly carly sniffed hard eyes filling up what did victoria say carly carly leaned back in her chair face shining with teary snot thats she said thats a bugger then she said were gonner have to do the other one now bliss watched karen dowells lips forming a distinct o i think this might be a good time to take a break inspector mr nye said blood sugar should have seen this coming from the first tap of james bulldaviess umbrella on the vicarage door in this job looking stupid was part of the package it was a rectangular room with pale yellow walls and a row of windows overlooking the east city william lockley accepted the padded chair at the top of the conference table he wore a crumpled grey suit and a grey woollen tie and his moustache screened his lips an air of wariness if lockley looked less than comfortable maybe that was something to do with women things you could discuss with them things you couldnt and then there was annie howe putting down her briefcase taking the chair opposite merrily who was trying not to stare no rimless glasses longer hair hoop earrings a soft stripy woollen sweater soft stripy youd almost think there was a man in the background were here because ms watkins seems to have convinced mr lockley that i should be considering a possible connection between the death due to heart failure of samuel dennis spicer chaplain to the special air service and the murder of mansel bull is that correct as if she was addressing a fourth person at the table at least the voice hadnt changed still crunching ice cubes and the link howe said would appear to be a third man colin jones a man in whom mr lockleys people seem to have been interested for a while been felt lockley cleared his throat that an eye should be kept on him yes although nothing was conveyed to us until now when it might just be getting embarrassing nothing to say until now annie howe leaned back arms folded a posture reflecting decades of resentment between the police and softshoed spooks who wrote their own rules who exactly did you have keeping an eye on jones mr lockley people we trust mostly exarmy and its been very lowkey for example we once booked a chap into a tourism course that joness exwife was attending which was quite productive merrily sat up those old contracting walls garrison ledwardine annie howe bent to her briefcase and slid out a laptop which she opened up on the table and theres another man in whom we ve had a mild interest over the years kenneth mostyn joness business partner since establishing hardkit hes been suspected of selling imported surveillance equipment illegal at the time though nowadays theres not much you cant obtain through the internet mostyns very much a type lockley said more common in the us where you find whole communities of them in cabins in the wilds living out their fantasies of the collapse of civilization every man for himself usually armed to the teeth he certainly sells a range of shotguns how he became involved with jones can you throw some light there simply convenient for them both mostyn had a side enterprise running adventure holidays canoeing rock climbing but it didnt have the glamour that an sas connection confers the joint enterprise operates under a rather enticing cloak of secrecy students brought in at night sometimes blindfolded or driven around to disorient them quite soon through word of mouth it became you know the thing to do if you could afford it and perhaps we should also mention ward savitch chap running champagne shooting weekends for corporate clients highlevel contacts in the city venerable financial institutions putting their executives into an intensive course designed to make them leaner and fitter especially useful and this is the ingenious part after the recession and the huge backlash against the financial sector particularly banks and bankers the old killer instinct shrivelling under the public spotlight so the idea howe said is to get them believing in themselves again and not only in themselves lockley looked at merrily apparently merrily felt small and unprepared like when you arrived in an exam room and your mind had been wiped sometimes when she looked up the room would blur forgotten how tired she was god knew what she must look like she fingered the bulge of the cigarette packet through the fabric of her bag some of this is going to sound a bit loony id expect nothing less from you ms watkins annie howe said then lifted a placating palm i apologize go on building a case against people not what i do obviously all i can give you is possibly enough background to shape some questions essentially mr jones follows a pagan religion adopted by the roman invaders of britain two thousand years ago a soldiers religion which there was a tapping and a very tall young guy put his head around the door to say that down in the canteen mr jones was getting a little restive making noises about having to attend a dinner what do you want me to do maam annie howe lifted a finger perhaps i should have reminded you both that colin jones came in this afternoon in connection with last nights breakin at his premises hes downstairs and apparently happy to answer any questions we might have for him rather interesting in itself that lockley said im guessing you wouldnt normally expect a man whos had a minor breakin to visit the police station just to say he doesnt want to press charges well says he was coming into town anyway but my guess would be that he was disconcerted to find quite a large police presence in his backyard last night annie howe turned to lockley get him up he knows what you want to talk to him about he knows its about spicer howe looked at merrily looks like you get to ask the questions yourself ms watkins were those contact lenses magnifying an old malice or what the mouthy ones like carly he could enjoy the scrap so bliss had left joss to karen and darth never been as good with the deep and the silent karen had more patience and she was local and so was darth theyd get there good as cracked really bliss sat on his own in a corner of the cid room all falling into place whod done what one sister killed accidentally the second purely to keep the lid on it in cold blood pitiless head repeatedly banged on the bricks until she died in hereford made you shiver whod suddenly cranked up the violence level in this county the sexual assault probably an afterthought to make it look like a rapist attack but who could say who was the bloke how much of it was down to him it would doubtless come out when they brought victoria buckland in which in theory should not be difficult but then in theory they shouldve had her already bliss stood up and went to the window the end of the rush hour brake lights like snail trails under the purple sky maundy thursday was always purple good friday black no matter how lapsed a catholic you were good friday would always be black a black easter too this year in both his professional and private lives he might leave the city find a coppers job on the other side of the country but there would still be loose ends here one of them forever sticking out like a fuse awaiting a lighted match his kids the worst of all scenarios was his kids being brought up by hunt hero sollers bull bliss wanted to smash a metal chair into the toughened glass shatter the skyline and there was annie images of annie his mind filling with one every few minutes tousled hair and a stripy sweater a shadowy areola under a white nightdress the longer he left it the harder it would be to tell her that he a copper hadnt known about kirsty and sollers bull too late now maybe hed write her a letter one day from a bedsit in gloucester or swindon or wherever he wound up bliss stood at the window watching homebound traffic couldnt see himself going home tonight not with buckland out there he was no longer tired anyway his body was burning with blood sugar here came the footsteps on the stairs light and unhurried here was a man who kept quiet as a comrade plunged to his death in the brecon beacons here was a man who calmly dismantled his marriage here was a man who raped his friends wife in the grounds of a hotel in buckinghamshire and then said goodnight mr jones maam the tall detective said william lockley did the introductions knowing him from the old days brothers in arms all that byron this is detective chief inspector howe senior investigating officer in the mansel bull murder case byron jones nodded he wore a dark suit and a midblue silk tie to match his eyes he was guided to the foot of the table facing the door the optimum nothreat comfort seat merrily thought as lockley moved to sit opposite her next to byron and this is mrs merrily watkins lockley said whom i think we could describe as an investigator with the hereford diocese really byron turned his bright blue eyes briefly on merrily what does the diocese investigate overdue books from the chained library merrily said that kind of thing byron didnt smile by then looking away he was not what shed expected but then what had she expected cropped hair multiple scars byron lockley said i think i should say at this point that this is just a discussion a chat without prejudice it will not be recorded it will not be used in evidence this began as a routine police inquiry which seems to have crossed over into our territory and frankly were all a bit confused and hoping you can help us merrily wondered if this sounded as phoney and patronizing to byron as it did to her byron said nothing as you know lockley said the regiment lost its new chaplain this week youll also know the circumstances and that it was a bit of a shock for all of us who knew syd myself included byron said though none of us id guess knew him quite as well as you did byron he was a mate but not recently no not recently another knock on the door two uniformed male cops came in ostensibly with coffee but possibly merrily was thinking to familiarize themselves with the layout and seating positions of the people in the room it had been william lockleys idea that they should place byron jones near the door where youd never seat a suspect annie howe took the chair next to merrily opposite the two men the first lights were coming on in the city below them you could see the greying steeple of st peters where the late frank collins had been a curate byron shook his head at annie howes offer of sugar for his coffee turned to william lockley is there any suggestion that syds death was suspicious before lockley could reply howe said quickly that nothing had been ruled out and byron appraised her thoughtful you think somebody might have killed him chief inspector were still examining the evidence or did he kill himself merrily said if he had killed himself would that be a surprise to you mr jones byron looked at her properly for the first time and she felt able to study him older than shed imagined older than syd although syd had been the first to retire so he actually might be a little younger he looked like maybe like a cathedral canon ascetically lean with thick white hair he looked above all he looked calm and distinguished suicides hardly unprecedented among men who served in my former regiment byron said posttraumatic stress disorder is far from fully understood his teeth unexpectedly were jagged with thin black lines down the front ones as if theyd been scored by a pencil it made him look as if he had more teeth as if he was smiling when he wasnt it made merrily think of sas men who were caught and tortured teeth and pliers she said can you think of any good reason why syd would be particularly stressed how long you got i was thinking since leaving the army we didnt see much of one another any particular reason for that mrs im sorry watkins i may be wrong here byron said but i think when a clergyman rejoins the army hes no longer under the authority of the diocese he was a mate byron merrily said he turned his blue eyes on her again an emptiness a hole where love and humanity should be and she fought against a blink instinctively putting a hand to her chest where a pectoral cross would lie nothing shed left the vicarage too quickly this morning she heard annie howes voice flat and formal mr jones perhaps you could tell us how you came to develop what we can only call a pagan sect inside the special air service syds candle byron scowled then how would you describe it annie howe said i would call it byron said a discipline of course he would merrily was feeling hollow with fatigue yet nursing a need to smoke this man out a discipline based on worship of a roman god she said i dislike the word worship byron said in the army we did not worship our officers merrily recalled that in the sas only senior officers were addressed as sir no lack of respect the regiment was informal it was about mutual trust and reliance practicalities you saw mithras as your mate if byron was surprised that she knew about mithras he wasnt showing it i would call him a device is it possible you could explain that for us byron said nothing william lockley pushed his chair back not as if paganisms against the law byron weve moved on since witchburning in that case whys the hereford diocese here neat shes here because neither annie nor i would know what the hell you were talking about byron lockley said oh i think you would william i think youd have a better idea to be honest this is my business my living im hardly the first veteran to use what he learned in the regiment as the basis for a new career but carry on mrs watson erm all this started back at the old stirling lines in hereford i think when some roman remains were discovered within the precincts coins pottery not much but enough to get you thinking a few of us had an interest in military history wed be spotting things when we were out and about roman roads celtic forts having a bit of welsh in the background i thought i identified with the celts but the celts were a bunch of drunken hooligans compared with the romans the romans had a commitment which even today is unequalled except possibly by you merrily said by the regiment if you like the last allmale corner of the army byron leaned back stretching his legs under the table so that merrily instinctively moved hers out of the way you know much about mithraism mrs watson or maybe think you do maybe youre someone whos looked at it from the christian perspective thinks she knows what it represents and misses the whole point mithraism was a soldiers religion you could see parallels for a start i dislike the word religion but yeah we were young men full of energy youd have to be dull not to recognize some of it you mean like initiation rites out of darkness into light through barriers skirting the boundaries of death mind games william knows lockley said if im getting this right i suppose the best and most widely known example would be the one where the chaps are taken up in a helicopter blindfolded and ordered to jump out without a parachute not realizing the choppers only a few metres above the ground is that what you mean mind games the romans didnt have that kind of terminology but they understood the twelve tortures merrily said yeah we found good parallels there in physical and mental endurance of hardship i could give you names of historians and psychologists that we consulted the aim being to develop a progression of exercises linked to the mithraic grades that would lead to a level of resilience courage essentially attributes of manhood which some people think have been allowed to lapse lockley was nodding encouragingly my students come out of this fundamentally altered byron said better men more successful men in every respect if theyve got the balls to see it through and the money lockley said presumably were not a charity william it costs a lot but you ask the guys weve trained if they think it was worth it we thats you and mostyn he mainly provides and maintains the hardware and has he been initiated merrily asked not one of my words we dont even use the term mithraism to the students not until theyre able to understand what it means but mr mostyn wouldve been your first civilian whatever the word is neophyte byron winced id also like to stress that the students choose how far to take it some will drop out most of them will drop out at some stage but a small number will cross a threshold and begin to revel in it an elite ive no quarrel with that word we encourage levels of excellence byron looked up narrowing his eyes do we need all these lights its not very green is it also a bit like an interrogation that what this is william an interrogation an edge of impatience now william lockley looked at annie howe she stood up went to the switches on the wall and killed all the lights except for two at the top of the room the reflections of the conference table vanished from the window and the early glow of the city came up under the long beach of the evening sky thank you byron said i find light pollution offensive annie howe sat down again next to merrily you seem to be saying this is all pure psychology rather than religion finally sinking in is it byron looked pained i mean do i look like a fantasist we analysed mithraism took it apart found out how it worked then reconstructed it for our purposes the romans werent hippydippy spiritual types they were practical and pragmatic this is a system for selfdevelopment the only one of us who ever talked about religion was syd spicer merrily said for confirmation syd was a member of the original history club oh yeah you could say that along with erm jocko and greg and nasal annie howe pushed her chair back curious the names would mean nothing to her but lockley would know all dead merrily said like syd whats your point byron looked irritated nothing more what conclusion could you possibly be drawing from that what conclusions was syd drawing they were all looking at her now byron smiling but not really i wouldnt know you were presumably practising this form of selfdevelopment when you were still in the army to the extent of our knowledge we were learning about the use of meditation and visualization to achieve focus and it carried on when syd left sure sometime after youd both left the army and gone your separate ways syd possibly had reason to think it had escalated and the other guys jocko greg and finally nasal had all died which he thought you baffle me mrs watson one was a drinkdriving smash one a drunken brawl and the third topped himself in the wake of a distressing domestic incident whats your point i think syd was suggesting to you that the regime theyd been following had made them reckless prone to seeking out violent situations byrons expression conveyed an element of pity merrily struggled on maybe he felt theyd let in something they couldnt control nothing gained without sacrifice and in this case the sacrifice was their humanity byron looked at lockley how long do i have to suffer this shit merrily looked away and tried again you never wondered why syd left the regiment and immediately threw himself into christianity syd was religious he had to think that what we were doing was spiritual and when he realized it wasnt he went cold on it byron smiled or did he he sat looking at merrily the lines in his lean face were like hieroglyphics in sandstone syd was fascinated by all the places where mithraism overlaps with christianity how you could appear to be practising one religion but it was really the other and nobody would ever know we used to talk about that oh no merrily shaking her head too quickly i dont think so you dont eh you claim to have known him you never think there were times when his behaviour wasnt strictly priestlike i heard he once beat the living shit out of a street dealer who sold his daughter pills i merrily was hit by a memory of what shed once seen syd do to a young guy in the malverns when theyd needed information in a hurry his famous evocation of the sas buzz the rush you get when you convince yourself its not only justified but necessary when you know that a difficult situation can only be resolved by an act of swift efficient intense and quite colossal violence we were soldiers byron said we knew about immediate action we didnt do turning the other cheek annie howe stood up youll have to excuse me im afraid ive been drinking too much coffee today ms watkins howe looked at the door and back at merrily oh merrily rose out of a fugged image of syd spicer smoking in his church on a summers day knowing that his deity was entirely ok with that ill come with you byron leaned back arms hanging down limp as empty sleeves so relaxed the state of his teeth gave him a dark grin yeah he said mithras he really lit syds candle control this isnt working is it howe said hes tying you in knots sorry tired complicated day merrily backed off towards the top of the stairs a wreck in sweater and jeans no makeup a woman whod left home too quickly a long time ago but i can certainly see why byron agreed to be interviewed agreed annie howe moistened her lips took a long breath merrily thinking that despite the softening effects of early middleage they were never going to be friends too much rancid history its a setup howe said im sorry youre here to look like a fool im here to witness that and jones quite clearly is only here because it was suggested to him presumably by lockley that it would be very much in his best interests to get his defence in first defence against what with a view to preempting any possible police investigation of his activities damage limitation and its working wouldnt you say well it out of byrons presence the flaws in his argument were beginning to show here was fiona he told me sam was making a terrible mistake in going into the church that he was throwing away his life and damaging his country was that coming from a man who knew that syd hadnt forsaken mithras but what the hell would any of that matter to howe or lockley this wasnt about theology a door opened and di frannie bliss appeared cradling a mug of coffee annie howe didnt quite look at him no arrest yet francis bliss said good evening reverend he looked worse than this morning a sweatsheen on his freckled cheeks feverish eyes were covering all the nightclubs i suppose howe said young coppers looking faintly ridiculous in clubbing kit were also doorstepping all her socalled mates as if anybodys ever grassed victoria up apart from your friend on the plascarreg bliss came out of the doorway like he was about to say something smart then he shrugged good point actually increasingly im wondering why goldie andrews did that i thought you had her over a barrel cleverly manoeuvring her into a corner howes voice rinsed in acid nothing changed did it maybe i was just too plain euphoric to ask some significant questions bliss said think id better go back down the plas boss on me own this time no take vaynor hes going clubbing then take care howe said coldly and be sure when you eventually bring buckland in that shes undamaged that a joke maam bliss stepped back through the doorway not looking at annie howe as if hed been expecting something from her that she hadnt supplied the atmosphere between them no sweeter than it had ever been all this in front of a civilian merrily had a sense of unreality nothing quite what it seemed even annie howe looked for a moment almost vulnerable as she turned away from the closing door the whitegold hair pushed back behind the ears the woolly riding up the back of the creased black skirt she turned again to merrily those three men you mentioned to jones nasal you might remember him killed his wife yes youre suggesting that whatever they and jones and possibly spicer had been doing had made them less in control of their aggression i certainly think syd was thinking along those lines on the day it was in the paper that nasal had hanged himself he went to see byron at his wifes place in allensmore no violence on that occasion just harsh words harsh words howe shook her head jones looks to me ms watkins like a man with a huge chip on his shoulder but basically nothing to hide nothing that would be of particular interest to me anyway you reckon merrily took a step back no choice now i need to tell you something purely for information if you take it any further at this stage ill have to deny having said anything annie howe steered merrily into an unoccupied office a room without lights and shut the door how sure are you of this sure as i can be without forensic evidence wheres spicers wife now no listen im telling you for clarification only if she didnt report it then she isnt going to say anything now why didnt she report it because she knew how syd would react and what that would do to his prospective career in the church youre saying that like all these other guys jones lost control no thats thehe didnt lose control thats the whole point this was a rape in cold blood i think byron jones raped syds wife as an act of violence against syd himself and spicer did he know its a good question all right howe said tell me the rest very briefly weve been away too long tell me about the taking of bulls i really cant imagine that would be easy unless the bull was sedated im told that even in roman times it would be sedated maybe it was even done in the field if it was remote enough i dont know any kind of blood sacrifice is senseless and sickening to me but it was done and it looks like it still is only one man wields the knife that would seem to be the idea he emerges completely covered in the bullswhat annie howe had the door held back her eyes wide open to the lights well go back the god of the regiment the conference room was still halflit with the city murmuring below byron jones was telling lockley about the archaeology the pattern from the sky how did you know lockley asked discoloured ground paler grass in the shape of a rectangle i kept very quiet about it of course i did individual skills are crucial in the regiment lockley said to howe and byron went on a photography course got the chopper pilot to go back over it byron said give us a closer look took some decent pictures and later sent them to an archaeologist i knew in germany as it happened without identifying the location he thought it was probable so thats why you went after the land what did you use before that we improvised caves a disused reservoir but to have the remains of an actual mithraeum exciting took everything id got but i knew id never get another chance like this put the digger to work initially but most of it was done by hand spent three months on it sifted all the soil kept everything in little trays didnt find much bits of masonry and a stone tablet very worn handful of roman coins but that didnt matter it was confirmation of a kind and there were other pointers i wont bore you with showing that this was part of a ritual landscape you mean credenhill and brinsop church merrily sat down and the alignments with other churches and ancient monuments you have been doing your homework mrs watson im impressed its not a roman ritual landscape were probably talking neolithic the romans fitted in in the way christian churches would be built on neolithic ritual sites pragmatic so where is this mithraeum byron tapped his nose need to know he said you dont was there much left some reconstruction was required another good reason to keep quiet about it merrily glanced at howe who nodded is this where the bulls are sacrificed then merrily asked byron laughed leaning back from the table his jacket open merrily thinking that however old he was he was still very fit no paunch under the leather belt and relaxed too relaxed for this situation popular farmer murdered by former trooper off his trolley byron said how can we ever trust them again excuse me annie howe said am i missing something here byrons been putting two and two together lockley said and making seven thats your big inquiry isnt it doesnt take a genius perhaps howe said you could tell us about the bulls you took rustling too eh byron said is there no depth to which this scum wont sink tell me do you have any evidence of that do you deny ever taking a bull absolutely its ridiculous but central to the practice of mithraism merrily said surely it was two thousand years ago in the days before the slaughter of livestock was subject to regulations even then thered have to be a compromise as according to the legend mithras personally hauls the bull to his cave and how do you get over that problem meditative visualization do i need to explain that all right i will the candidate is summoned to the mithraeum he travels from wherever he lives books into humble accommodation or brings a tent and spends a day in contemplation of his role during which hes permitted to drink water but must eat nothing he bathes in a river usually the wye hes brought blindfolded to the mithraeum where his comrades are gathered the ritual begins his comrades william flipping him a glance just so we know anyone from the lines involved in this not any more like i said when these ladies were powdering their noses none of this need concern you william it started in the regiment just a few of us now its moved on im not saying it wont come back one day as long as the camp sits on magnis lockley glanced towards the window he seemed unsettled as though the world had skidded out of his mental grasp what does that mean merrily said as long as the camp sits on magnis when you were talking about a ritual landscape with its own god the god of the regiment by your rules im an atheist for a few seconds nobody spoke down in the city a car horn blared its about mindset byron said you dont know what i mean do you none of you not even you william communism in your day and the ira now its men driven by religion who dont care what happens to them in this life or how they leave it we could lose it this time because we aint got the mindset byron lockley said we dont do holy wars any more you think the crusades were holy william the crusades served mans need for extreme warfare mithras coming through merrily said call it what you want merrily put her head on one side holding byrons electric blue gaze hands clasped under the table do you ever think you might be dealing here with something so powerful that while experienced soldiers like you might be able to handle it civilians mrs watson youre in no position to make any kind of qualified assessment might just become a little crazy come back to me when youre better informed can i just ask when did you last see syd did you see him again after he came to credenhill as chaplain no reply merrily thought she glimpsed a flaring rage in his eyes blue lights in a ravaged landscape ive been wondering if you were the main reason why syd felt he had to come back mithras and you the demons from his past that he had to deal with merrily glanced at howe maybe he thought something still lived in him something repugnant that was buried so deep inside himself that he couldnt reach it something he had to come back and deal with winging it now she felt quite dizzy the room tilting a throbbing in her chest byron was still looking at her his hands either side of the chair ready to launch himself out of it and in his eyes he can enter you without moving that man one of the nurses had said and then it was gone byron didnt move chief inspector why dont i just give you a dna swab so you can compare it with whatever you found in mansels yard i still havent mentioned mansel bull annie howe said dont treat me like a clown you knew mr bull well i was acquainted with mansel and his family byron blinked mansel bull youre making something out of it because his names bull thats all this is am i right howe said do you know who killed mansel bull how would i am i right in thinking that in this virtual ceremony of the slaughter of the bull its considered important that the candidate imagines himself covered in its blood you can find all this in books and on the net but if you really think id go out and carve up a neighbour lets end it there annie howe began packing her laptop into her case im glad you felt able to open up to us mr jones byron didnt look at her or at merrily at the door he glanced back i once thought of asking you to join us william when they package you off maybe you should think about it bring you alive when youre least expecting it unimaginable mate but purely a psychological thing merrily said just a discipline william lockley rose to his feet flexing his shoulders is there an offence of desecrating an historical monument annie because as i see it thats all youve got may not even be an ancient monument howe said hes not your killer thats my opinion youre probably right its an oddball thing but if hes used it to turn around his fortunes good luck to him though if he thinks itll ever be embraced by the credenhill boys at the door lockley turned smiled worthwhile exercise ladies and i may be in touch to clarify a few points anything you want from me you know where i am annie howe strode across the room and shut the door firmly stood with her back against it her angular face unusually flushed what would spicers reaction have been do you think on learning about the murder of mansel bull i doubt it wouldve helped him sleep all right ill tell you something else we have a witness who saw a man in a field on the night of the killing drenched in blood and apparently high on the experience high well in a state of some apparent euphoria according to our witness oh merrily stood up bloody hell bit of a coincidence isnt it jones said he knew mansel bull and his at which point he hesitated and then said family i remember that too mansel bull didnt have a family as such howe said he had two exwives so i gather and a brother yes have you met sollers bull never hes an ambitious man someone i suppose youd call a member of the new countryside elite elite annie howe thought for moment would you mind coming to meet him if hes available well i give me half an hour howe said get yourself a cup of tea and a sandwich merrily wound up crossing the street to the pizza place grabbing a salad with hummus and couscous and a coffee sitting in the window with her phone on which neil cooper had left a message with his home number sorry neil i was going to call you back wasnt i if you remember we got as far as mithras magnis is very much my ongoing project but ive been wondering all day if its conceivable that you know something i dont you can relax i dont really know anything i would have asked you if there were any mithraic remains in this area not as far as we know the fact is although signs of mithraic worship are common enough in germany and italy evidence in the uk is rather sparser youre looking at four suggested centres of worship london york chester and caerleon now as it happens the principal roman road linking caerleon in south wales and chester on the northern border passes through credenhill so it wouldve been used by soldiers travelling between two significant mithraic centres through some fairly hostile country i would have thought and as they built a base here which became as were gradually finding out quite a substantial community surviving into the fifth century well ive often wondered why did they build a base here all to do with the wye neil said they were probably using the ford at hereford to get across you see the reason i wondered if you might have heard something is that theres a rumour been going round for a while about something of this nature being found in herefordshire rumour within archaeological circles stories of aerial photographs showing interesting linear patterns ive never met anyone whos seen one but weve been monitoring aerial surveys nothing found so i was thinking it might be apocryphal unless you or someone know otherwise you checked erm the brinsop area actually we have nothing obvious there that we didnt already know about i suppose if somebody wanted to keep quiet about it they could just cover it up with a temporary building or something it is a thought neil cooper said part six throughout the vision i thought i was being obliged to recognise that we are sinners who commit many evil things that ought not to be done and who omit many good deeds that ought to be done we deserve to suffer pain julian of norwich revelations of divine love anything you want the evening sky was blotched with small clouds like a field of late mushrooms brown and rotting jane stood on the grass bank watching cornel taking the leather bag from the back of the van a mile or so out of credenhill hed swung the van between some overhanging bushes branches ripping at the side windows when hed hit the brakes jane had been thrown forward the rotting seat belt snapping her head bumping painfully into the windscreen as the mobile started vibrating in her hip pocket she slid it out now and checked it while cornel was messing with his tool bag all she could see were small fields keeping wedges of woodland apart and ahead of them a conifer screen at the top of a rise the eastern horizon was formed by the great wooded bank of credenhill itself like a crouching bear a new text from eirion j whr t l r u what she wouldnt give to be able to return the call to be with irene with his reticent smile and his solid body just slightly overweight other people would surely be missing her by now ok mum would think she was with eirion but if eirion rang mum cornel jane said if youre worried about going to this place maybe we could do it some other time hed become morose his mood turning like the sky it was getting cold too and the vans heater didnt work this whole thing with the van it showed a calculating side of cornel a secretive side a jangle of tools what did he need tools for im sorry he said but wasnt it you that wanted to go not in the dark jane glared up into the fungal sky wondering now if she really had persuaded him if it wasnt the other way round hed been all too ready for this with the van and whatever was in the rucksack and the leather bag its always in the dark cornel said and jane imagined some squalid gathering in an underground chamber it was going to be horrible gruelling she wasnt sure she could even watch how far do we have to go mile or so a mile but its all muddy she felt it was important to retain something of girlie this is my best jacket were not all loaded like you it seemed to disarm him if you get messed up ill buy you a new outfit whatve you got in the bag wirecutters stuff like that you mean were going in like undercover or something it might help if you didnt ask too many questions help who where are we going is it a farm give me a minute cornel went crunching off into the woods gone to relieve himself jane gave him time to like get started and then pulled out her phone to send eirion a text but cornel was back before she could get more than a few words down she stashed the phone he seemed happier a big wide sloppy grin across his face he was breathing hard and fast ok lets do it jane followed him his long legs spidering across the darkening grass and the nettles until they came to a barbedwire fence cornel unslung the bag and then the wirecutters were in his hands they didnt look that big but they went through the barbed wire like it was bailer twine the ends springing away from the fence cornel still grinning like for him this was what the countryside was about what happens is anything you want barry said got a job interview next week lol did i say business in the black swan was slow barry had brought some drinks pulled out a chair and sat down with lol whod been trying not too successfully to lay down some lyrics between pacing the square waiting for merrily to call danny to come in anything where wiltshire oh lol didnt remember a ledwardine without barry originally the manager at the cassidys restaurant then seamlessly taking over at the swan wry unflappable trained killer in a black tie balancing a loaded tray while helping old ladies with their cases my second wife she lives down near swindon and were you know talking again i had it in mind shed come back up here but maybe this is best cant believe youre letting savitch drive you out of the area clean break new start done it before i can do it again you cant live with resentment laurence no mind you it gets hard sometimes barry said remember how you were accusing me of telling savitch about the openair concert thing wasnt accusing you exactly it was my fault shouldve found it marion it was found it this morning women and dusters always get into places men dont even see anyway there it was nicely concealed in a picturesque crack in that beam what are we talking about i just ripped it out before id really thought about it id ripped it out and stamped on it how bleedin stupid was that little microphone and transmitter laurence size of your thumbnail maybe wouldnt work too well when the bar was crowded but on a quiet day just a few of us there a bug you stand and you think whod do a thing like that savitch planted a bug dont know it was him but find out who you can win round who you can buy whos best avoided lol shut his lyrics pad thinking of everything that had been said about savitch in the swan speculation about some corrupt alliance with councillor pierce barry remarking that if savitch bought the swan there was no way hed be sticking around now there was no way he could who do you think actually planted it hes got half a dozen staff at the court i know hardkit used to market listening devices and spyvideo toys from their website could actually be mostyn himself hes been in a few times with his clients kind of thing hed do for the sake of it james bond barry what is happening to this place i shouldve left it in place fed him disinformation but i just lost it kneejerk getting old and crusty barry looked steadily at lol what you waiting for it seemed like a good time to tell him some things they seemed to have been walking for ever getting nowhere when jane tripped over something hard twisting and went down sitting almost tearful in the damp grass rubbing at her ankle and then angrily picking the thing up whatever it was cold wet metal she held it up to the emerging moon as cornel kept on walking up the rise following his jaw the way he did before tossing what jane took to be a grudging glance over his shoulder come on come on come on its just an old cctv camera put it down jane looked up and saw a wooden pole in the trees with a boxy shape on top wires spraying from it her ankle twinged she tried to stand and then went down again get up jane youre not hurt cornel said breezily hadda be done hadda be done you did it her bum felt damp her new jacket was ripped you broke somebodys security camera jesus cornel bit of payback now will you whats that mean jane squirmed to her knees still holding the remains of the camera cctv what kind of place was this cornel waited for her to reach him then he grabbed the camera out of her hands halfturned drew back his arm and hurled it deep into the wood payback for what jane said lower your voice eh jane im not going any further till you explain what you gonna do then girlie limp all the way home he turned away she hissed at his back payback to who and then absurdly whom he just kept on walking anger spurted inside jane like a blowlamp and it just came out the bloke who filled you in at the back of the swan cornel stopped oh hell mistake jane slid back down both hands grasping wet grass she felt the tearing of a fingernail story of her life never thought things out cornel look hed come shambling back and now he was hanging over her loose and lopsided like a hastily assembled scarecrow black against the cobalt night sky you slippery slippery little bitch yet he sounded pleased his jaw was rolling like he was gnawing something which was not right was it savage ballet blisss second raid on the plascarreg hilton was of necessity lowkey he parked in front of the shops got himself a bag of chips from the chippy went on foot through the estate listening to kids voices bouncing off the flatpack walls the urban birdsong of the night first thing he noticed was all the vehicles parked at the far end on the derelict land separating the plas from the barnchurch trading estate cars and vans and fourbyfours fifteen twenty of them like there was a party at the hilton but there obviously wasnt few lights on in there and only a couple of cars on the forecourt where a young lad was sitting on the wall smoking tossing bliss a glance what you want pal come to see goldie you gorra problem with that shes not in you obviously dont know her very well son bliss offered the kid a chip shes always in shes resting the kid took a hot chip bit nervously at the end goldie rests like an owl rests till it eyeballs a mouse bliss said i know these things on account of im her nephew from the north you go and ask her tell her its her nephew francis the kid slouched away leaving bliss counting the cars minute or so later he was back shrugging and bliss went in to find goldie in the chintzy brassy lounge watching tv eastenders or some similar shite in fiftyinch plasma she sat up when bliss came in but never took her eyes off the screen the remote was on the chair arm but she made no move to turn down the sound she wore a black silk robe and had a steaming mug that smelled of chocolate and alcohol why you keep pestering me im an auxiliary with help the aged bliss crumpled up his chip paper where do i put this stink the bloody place out ent good for you all that vinegar goldie pointed at a velvety basket i gived you what you wanted din i almost goldie almost on the tv a squat bald twat was threatening somebody whenever you accidentally switched on eastenders there was always this same squat bald twat threatening somebody turn it down goldie leave it bliss pulled up a cream leather chair next to goldies sat himself down victoria buckland goldie how long you known her goldie kept on watching tv since her was smaller than me thatd be before she started school then now youve been known to have a what we might call a wairking relationship with victoria havent you goldie goldie mumbled something that bliss couldnt hear for the noise of the squat bald twat knocking over furniture sorry goldie i said i wouldnt go that far as i understand it shes occasionally been useful when your guests neglect to pay their bills or complain about the standard of service goldie sipped from the mug like a crow at a birdbath see the situation is bliss said that we now know for sure that victoria and an associate had gone to administer retribution to the marinescu sisters for the personal reasons youll know about goldie said nothing on the box the squat bald twat said cause youve always been a bleedin slag is why now i really dont believe that victoria intended it to end the way it did goldie if one of the sisters hadnt been discourteous enough to die on them leaving poor victoria with no option as she saw it but to ensure the other one was too dead to make a capable witness goldie spun round at him chocolatemouthed and yknow goldie i cant help remembering what you said the first time we discussed it you said they were good girls who only went out on the town one night a week now obviously victoria knew which night that was who told her that goldie who told her which particular pubs they went to nothing im willing to accept bliss said that all victoria said to you was that she wanted to punish the girls maybe a broken arm flattened nose on previous evidence victoria doesnt do knives so nothing lifethreatening which obviously you wouldntve gone along with anyway seeing corpses dont require accommodation and how useful those girls were to you for errands and stuff and anyway you could come over all mumsie when they got back bathing the wounds applying some of your old herbal remedies think the world of you after that you ent getting me on this goldie was up in a corner of her chair her eyes blacker than the bald twats on the box bliss smiled when dyou last see her and dont say you cant remember goldie because selective memory syndrome weve gorra treatment room for that at gaol street you want to get dressed apply a smudge of lippie or go as you are goldie didnt move cured already then bliss said i gived you a name thass all i knows not interested in what you know im open for conjecture rumour gossip thats why im on me own whats the latest word on victoria goldie new boyfriend i heard that too big pole yeh hed need one he also got a name theyve gone left the country that was a jolt whereve they gone then dunno goldie shrinking back dear lord i dont know i ever finds out ill tell you tell me now goldie bliss stood up snatched the remote and snapped off the sound where you do think they mightve gone tossing the remote from his left hand to his right goldie leaping up geddout juss geddouter my hotel and then mother of god she was ripping open her robe you dont get out look ill say you was messing with me aw goldie shouldve brought a woman copper with you ennit wasnt smart enough was you now get out making a lunge for the remote bliss holding it over her head never seen her like this before victoria must reallyve put the shits up her this time bliss jumped back and hello he stepped behind the sofa switched the set off completely this time and the noise didnt stop a party buzz under his feet under the white carpet a party under the carpet bliss smiled and you never invited me goldie all right goldie pulled her robe across her chest theys taken a car across to france kind of car a red one bliss felt a tingle in both hands wheres the door to the cellar goldie no all right do it the long way im not fussed gwenllian cecilia andrews im arresting you on suspicion of goldie marched across to the tv switched it on prodded around till the sound went up way higher than it was before they just rented it off me thass all the cellar i dont ask no questions nobody can afford to ask too many questions these days where is it goldie wheres the door they made me ennit she was up close and her voice had gone small and tight threatened me see threatened to torch me out if i didnt let em ave the cellar again and again so i just sits tight and turns up the telly till theyve where in the yard steps down for the coal ta but im tellin you you go down there on your own mr frannie youre fuckin dead you are im not planning to go down there goldie that would alert your little friend outside im assuming theres a more discreet way in from the house maybe more than one mustve been three cellars at one time please go away but were her eyes saying dont go away well well bliss folded his arms tell you what lets both go down like fuck i will you shouldve had her by now useless the cops bliss followed goldie into the kitchen with its big shiny chip fryer and globe lights that made your head ache then through into a utility room with two washing machines and three steps down to a door at one end thats it goldie staying well back bliss sensed she wasnt unhappy now if anybody was listening theyd reckon shed done everything she could to get rid of him all the same knowing as she would that the harder she tried to get him out the more he wouldnt want to go the noise was like what you could hear coming out of edgar street when hereford united were actually winning maybe more like anfield really anfield underground put the lights out bliss said you dont wanner do this not on your own it made sense he stood watching his iphone waiting for karen to call him back or darth vaynor left messages for both the bloating noise was making him physically irritated like a rash his palms hot but dry as dust his head fizzing with static a roar of what sounded like approval made the door shake and blisss guts jitter goldie said you go back leave me your number ill call when theys leaving oh i see bliss smiled just so nobody gets nicked on your premises least you can do piss off goldie bliss pocketed his phone turned the key eased the door open a crack then slid out onto the top step where the fetid atmosphere picked him up like oven gloves five steps down there was a concrete platform a bloke on it hunched over a substantial videocam on a tripod pointed down into the circle of light made by big lamps like in a dope factory which it wasnt nobody wanted to watch grass grow this would be the kind of video you only found on the internet and maybe some gutter cable channel bliss flattened himself against a wet brick wall and saw that it was an actual circle down there inside a metal barrier waisthigh like a giant sawnoffdrum maybe sixty people around the metal ring all men as far as bliss could see except he could hear a womans voice high and whiny like a bandsaw when it first touched the wood finish im boy get fuckin stuck in you bastard we ent got all night now he saw her taller than many of the men saw her blackgloss lips working go for the eyes go for the eyes thats it was it his birthday bliss started to laugh and then he was coughing on the smoke and the fumes of booze and sweat and nasty twisted excitement at what was going on under the hot lights the flapping and the stabbing the spinning and circling the darting headtohead peckandthrust like some savage ballet in sandy dust and scattered twigs and roars and little jewels of flying blood one of the cocks had the other one against the barrier stabbing with its reddened beak in his rattling beanbag head bliss heard that voice again thats a bugger were gonner have to do the other one now the cameraman mustve heard him coughing and turned and bliss raised a hand youre all right pal and the man turned back to his camera and it was all like slowmo after that some bloke catching the movement from the floor and looking up and nudging his mate and he was looking up too but that was all right bliss didnt think hed ever nicked either of them smiling kindly at them wondering how he was going to stop this and contain them contain her probably needing to get backup get on his phone it was only when more eyes were raised that it occurred to bliss that not only was he the only feller here in a suit and tie hed been doing in this same suit and tie a fair bit of telly these past couple of days his was a face they all realized they knew from somewhere so when the cameraman turned for a quick second glance something inside bliss snapped like old rotted elastic and he pushed himself back against the wall brought up his left knee and slammed the sole and heel of his shoe into the cameramans back watched the guy go skidding down the steps the camera flying up and then toppling into the ring where he saw both cocks going for it couldnt contain a big caffeine beam as he was pulled to the floor he rolled away his back finding the wall bliss hows it going victoria she came towards him through the crush on your own is it do i look thick vickie wall of coppers halfway to tesco victoria sniffed hes on his own she turned away borrowing someones cigarette and then they were on him half the scum in the cellar the first boot arriving like a logsplitter in his spine before they started on his face victoria going dont arse about boys you dont wanner get nicked just do what you gotter and clean it up punching at smoke the inside of annie howes audi was more chaotic than you might have imagined maps and papers down the side of the passenger seat a plastic sandwich wrapper on the floor merrily watched her driving quite aggressively through the diminishing evening traffic perhaps the only detective shed ever seen in a trench coat light grey belted the collar pulled up against the pale hair how do you know hes going to be there i had someone ring him number withheld howe said and ask for julie or somebody wrong number fates on my side for once i thought mr bull might have been at savitchs dinner where he would have encountered mr jones and i want to get at him first sollers bull brother of mansel both men born to the county in the fullest sense merrily was thinking names swelling and flexing with the muscle and sinew of the land so hes either on his own or with his girlfriend howe said girlfriend the official story is that his wife catriona has picked up the two boys from their boarding school and theyve all gone to stay with her parents to keep the kids out of the glare of publicity but shes spent an implausible amount of time away lately its either a marriage in meltdown or theyve come to an understanding howes audi had left the suburbs behind and the nighttime countryside was gathering them in the amorphous vastness where the street lights ended you could go in with a flashlight but youd better have a stack of batteries sollers bull howe said is not a man who likes to pass up on the fringe benefits of fame how does he connect with jones for a start annie howe played the washers over the blotched windscreen applied the wipers i shouldnt be doing this at all as dci im an executive an administrator but tonight there arent many detectives unoccupied nobody i could trust with this anyway this presumably is to do with the murder of his brother oh yes i think were more or less convinced he didnt kill his brother he has a convincing alibi and theres no dna match at the crime scene but ill admit im punching at smoke but there are some questions id like to ask him and id like you to hear the answers you did rather well in the end with jones not from where i was sitting you think against the grain howe said my grain anyway that sounds like a subtle way of saying im a licensed crank annie howe didnt deny it it may be that jones has been in touch with sollers bull by now and he knows what were moving towards or it may be that theres no link between them at all i dont know well see what does frannie bliss think why do you ask that just that there seems to have been quite a concerted effort to discredit him over this sollers bull and countryside defiance whoever they are most of the time howe said quietly francis bliss is his own worst enemy hes had a bad few months domestically so i understand the audi was alone now on the brecon road where it sliced through invisible magnis night clouds were gliding like flatfish in the aquarium of a big pale sky the easter full moon was up there somewhere merrily was remembering her first meeting with annie howe the clinical interrogation of jane in the search for a missing girl a bad start getting no better as shed conspicuously sided with bliss through the years of attrition howe took a left towards the wye one of those lanes that you never had cause to go down because it didnt lead anywhere apart from farms howe slowed keeping the headlights dipped merrily dragged herself out of drowsiness peering through the windscreen following the headlights as they opened up the road bleaching the grass at the verges annie howe was talking again under no obligation to cover up what jones and mostyn have been doing but i intend to take it slowly if you see any indication that sollers knows more than he should about unconventional religious practices id be grateful if you kept it to yourself until were out of there and yes i am aware that you dont work for the police god tends to take a dim view of murder merrily said if only to see annie howe wince the car slowed a privatelooking sign on a righthand bend said oldcastle was it a castle at one time no idea howe said does it matter just wondered how longestablished the family was long enough even for this area merrily checked her mobile shed left messages for lol and jane lol said hed be in the swan jane presumably was out with eirion near the top of a wooded rise the full moon sprang out between the tall chimneys of the lightless farmhouse it looked like a shell a dead house merrily thought who could live unconcerned overlooking the yard where a previous owner had been slashed and hacked to death how long before the stain faded into a historical talking point a footnote in a tourist guide annie howe drove down beyond the house between wellgrown oaks sollers lives in a converted coach house but he inherits oldcastle seems likely doubt hell live there but nobody can see him selling it more likely turn it into a hotel or some sort of conference centre maybe even the official citadel for the increasingly wealthy countryside defiance their website carries a photograph of him in hunting pink with all the trimmings and handcuffs huh the countryside in manacles the foxhunting ban and other issues sollers bull lives to hunt a caged bulkhead light came on over the porch as annie howe parked in front of a metal gate next to a small car by the time they got the gate open and reached the porch door a woman was coming out wearing a calflength sheepskin coat its collar held together over her chin and mouth annie howe stood in silence and watched her thank you mr bull the woman said her back to them now and im sorry to have bothered you goodnight as the woman got into the small car and its engine started up a man appeared in the doorway oh he said annie i tried to call mr bull howe said but you were engaged bewildering times annie the phone only ever stops when i unplug it his voice was pitched up higher than you expected you could hear it lofted across the fields over the melee of a hunt you got something to tell me to ask you if you can spare the time of course coffee no thank you mr bull i suspect weve had rather too much of that today the overhead light made a twinkling star in an ear stud as sollers bull turned to examine merrily she saw a man of a little over medium height a keenly pointed face with deep bevelled cheeks he was wearing tight black jeans and a red tshirt with a message on it in black not a foxhugger the small car pulled away headlights on full beam maybe the woman was a journalist this is merrily watkins annie howe said didnt explain further she had her mobile out it had evidently been on vibrate excuse me she took a step back on to the path speaking into the phone dci howe and then after a silence her voice low and deliberate when was this karen before moving further away erm merrily looked up at sollers bull she was cold would you mind if i had a coffee ill put some on she followed him into a very classy designer kitchen this an old house mr bull not particularly nineteenthcentury and fortunately not listed so ive been able to do what i like with it the farmhouse must be listed though grade two starred was it a castle no older than that the site was known as oldcastle because of what was there before dont know what it was but the stones are probably in the foundations i see through a window merrily saw annie howe in the light grey trench coat up against a ranchstyle fence listening to the phone when she came back her face was paler than the coat but no less grey meant to ask you hows charlie these days sollers said sitting with his back to the red aga stretched out almost diagonally feet under the hardwood table hands behind his head charlie this would explain him addressing howe as annie it very much figured that the oldcastle bulls would be familiar with her dad ill come straight to the point mr bull colin jones how well do you know him sollers looked blank genuinely so merrily thought studying him younger than he looked in the papers and not so distinguished too flash for that byron jones merrily said oh well i know him sollers said though not particularly well have you ever done business with him howe asked kind of business cattle for example ever sold any cattle to mr jones i wasnt aware that mr jones was even in the livestock business or the meat trade come to that thats not quite answering the question is it sir annie howe began unbuckling the belt of her coat unhurried like she was prepared to stay until she got what shed come for only merrily sitting next to her opposite sollers saw that her fingers were unsteady fumbling it sollers straightened up in his chair his sleek pointy face looked foxy no ive never sold any beasts to mr jones or maybe given him one do you know what hereford cattle are worth sollers glanced from howe to merrily and back to howe what exactly is this about just so that we have this clear mr bull howe said youre saying that as far as youre aware no animal bred at oldcastle has ever been sent to colin joness establishment sent either to jones or his business partner kenny mostyn how would i know as far as youre aware i think youd better explain i dont have to explain anything howe said her skin looked cold as bone she hadnt said what the phone call had been about but then police business why would she law of the hunt thank christ danny said kenny mostyn and he was on his own and no longer wearing a dinner jacket dressed for action in fact dark jeans black fleece likely his suit was in the overnight bag over one shoulder danny had been worried that mostyn might be staying the night at the court and theyd still be sitting here when the sun come up stiff as corpses but mabbe mostyn wasnt overnightguest material looks like you was right then gomer they had the old jeep parked under a willow tree edge of the parking area only a couple of dozen vehicles left this was a select dinner party gomer had idd councillor lyndon pierce fellers on that level usual suspects mostyn just showin his face gomer said but he got business elsewhere to see to dont switch on yet let him get clear of the gate ent daft boy keep our distance all the way only thing worries me danny said is what if the scotch blokes told him about a feller lookin for him with a cock to put in the ring best i could think of at the time see too late to get fussed about that there was a furry growl under gomers voice now likely due to seeing mostyn dressed much the same as he had been that night in the snow everything coming back and the worst of it was that for just a short while surrounded by these lithe prowling young guys hed felt just a bit scared and even worse than that mabbe like an old man gomer was gonner hold that against kenny mostyn for ever it was like cornel was gobbling up the night wildly excited as he guided jane limping through the gap in the high wire fence holding her hand inside his which was big and dry the moon lit an open space with armytype huts metal gates leading to fields and woodland what is it big boys playground jane gave up the way his mood had altered she could only think hed taken something maybe when he went off apparently for a pee in the woods and she hadnt heard anything snorting coke from a folded tenner training centre cornel said assault course big pond they cross on ropes professional shooting range and all the things they darent do at the court because its too close to the village and cockfights cockfights yeah yeah sure so this is connected with the court courts just paintballing clayshooting a few pheasant shoots and all that regular shit and then youre asked discreetly if youd like to do some real shooting not for the wimps and the veggies and thats when you meet kenny for rough shoots in the woods back of the court and then maybe this other guy exsas leads a weekend in the black mountains or the beacons which is a lot tougher and the huntings on a whole different level you dont kill you dont eat and thats where you start paying for yourself you did that sure sure sure but all the time this is what pissed me off youre aware of other guys getting handpicked for really heavy shit i wanted that more than any of them cornel had his wirecutters around a strand of barbed wire where a hole had been cut in the fence kept leaning on the handles snipping bits off the wire when i was at the lse used to read all these sas books i identified with that different jungle thats all and these other guys are going off at midnight in a land rover and i go to kenny what about me and hes going we dont think youre quite ready cornel and im like what exactly do you want me to prove name it jane was trying to ease her hand away without making it seem like a snub but cornel kept squeezing it words spurting out of him cause i thought he was like my mate hed start taking me on one side whispering the kind of thing you appreciate knowing when youre on a shooting trip and the others are all upperclass bastards whove been handling shotguns since they could walk thought it was him and me one time i saw what i thought was this fox in the woods about to pop it when i realized it was a dog and that night in the pub when i was alone with kenny he said why didnt you just shoot it shoot a dog janes fingers stiffened lost a few points there cornel he said and after that i was always aware he was watching me making these little remarks asking could i hold my drink stuff like that like testing my resolve how determined i was to move on so im drinking more and im blasting off at anything that moves mostly missed but not always getting better bought my own shotgun getting there and he kept asking for more money and i kept giving it to him its a rite of passage hed say cost me over a grand for the cockfight and that was before the betting started that was him in the yard at the swan that was kenny my mate his mate telling him his balls had fallen off and to go back and cry himself to sleep come and see me again when youre grown up there was something horribly wrong about all this cornels fingers were easing janes apart pushing between them didnt like that made her think of sex jane let the hand he was holding go limp thinking to slide it out of his grip and get the hell out her ankle wasnt broken only twisted she could do this best to run into the conifers he was fit and had long legs and he could get to her easily if he could see her the trees were her only chance be like midnight in there cornel said you ever meet kenny ive never even been in one of his shops look cornel i didnt lie that night at the swan i didnt actually see anything it was too dark i just heard some of it from the bottom of the yard and like i didnt tell you because i didnt want it to sound like i was trying to humiliate you or anything ok absolutely fine fine fine fine its actually not fine is it its answered a few questions like i keep telling you i just want to see savitch brought down sure you do i do cornel stood in the space where the wire had been cut looking down into the clearing as if he was trying to think what had happened next jane could see his jaw working in the moonlight hear his teeth grinding so it was kenny took me to the cockfight bunch of us were supposed to be going but in the end it was just him and me and a bunch of gyppos and local trash some experience though booze and coke everywhere crazy like something from another century and you get drawn in it wakes you up the excitement incredible violence real energy came over with the romans cocking did you know that they seem to have got off on cruelty jane said the romans she could feel the sweat forming between their fingers i was drinking pretty heavily cornel said had a few hundred on this cock and the bastard lost felt pretty pissed off and kenny says put it in a sack get barry at the swan to cook it for you losers get eaten law of the hunt makes perfect sense cornel looked around right its clear come on finally letting go of her hand but before she could move away and maybe start running his big hand was around her left buttock steering her his fingers lingering on the wet seat of her jeans round there the doors in front of you a big padlock was hanging loose ha good didnt think theyd have time to fix it cornel pulled off the lock tossed it over his shoulder jane looked up it was just a big shed with a convex roof and heavy doors set into a wall of concrete blocks are you sure this is it go on push he prodded jane with his torch and she went up against the doors which immediately opened a bodys width and she went stumbling through down some steps he hadnt warned her about pain jabbed into her ankle she sank to her knees holding on to the step above her heard the doors close behind her didnt move go on cornel said go down the dead bird in the sack barry said i just thought get this bastard out of my bar id had a bellyful of cornel never once thought of cockfighting gomer sure about this doesnt usually make mistakes lol said not where janes involved would savitch do that on his own doorstep id like to think it was him and yeah if cornel was involved hes not exactly compos mentis is he cornel that makes sense always needs somebody to blame fighting cock lets him down he wants it cooked for his dinner juvenile well worse than juvenile i tell you what happened after that incident with jane i dont think so lol felt the pull of the stitches in his wrist remembering cornel peering into the bar wherever you are you little bitch i just want you to know it doesnt end here this is while everybodys talking about mansel bull barry said cornel very drunk if you recall goes into the gents presumably in search of paper towels when he only finds a hotair handdryer he forces the lock on the cleaners room and then he smashes his way into a couple of cupboards to locate the necessary which he leaves scattered all over the floor then he strips off his wet jeans and his underpants and marches upstairs to his room naked from the waist down not long afterwards a guest opens the door of her room to see a halfnaked man pissing down the stairwell lol winced what did you do i know what i wanted to bleedin do but im a genteel hotel manager now i did a mopandbucket job and then i rang the guy at the bank who booked cornels room and said perhaps they should think twice about the kind of people they send on these courses and he puts me on to another guy and i tell him what happened and he apologizes and says in this meaningful way to leave it with him obviously i never heard from him again and cornel left the next night at least i thought hed left until he shows up with the bird in the bag barry finished his beer odd that danny hasnt told you what they found at the court to be honest so much has happened since that until you mentioned danny id kind of forgotten about it if youve got dannys mobile give him a call ill do it now but when lol brought out his phone it was playing the riff from sunny days lol that you man eirion ive been everywhere eirion said left messages she doesnt do this i mean you never know which way shes going to jump but she doesnt stand you up you know jane pot kettle black annie howe you thought you knew how she was wired but now it was as if something in the system had gone awry this normally emotionless woman pinched and twisted by some painful insistent electricity shed had a shock and she was still getting aftershocks her questions were fluid and focused but some of them seemed disconnected and illogical and somehow not not police questions merrily drank a second cup of coffee too much but she needed to be on top of this i cant quite believe what youre implying sollers bull said you really think ive been serving up pedigree livestock for some kind of ritual slaughter somebody has mr bull were not talking about halal were not talking about halal then perhaps you should be looking at rustlers rather than poor bloody farmers that hidden heap of uninvestigated crimes in the countryside sollers was on his feet leaning back against the agas chromium bar annie howe sitting next to merrily at the table the long coat hanging open do you know kenny mostyn mr bull ive bought items from his shops what kind of items guns a shotgun for me an airgun for my son how olds your son were you thinking you might want to arrest him annie annie that was it that small county thing again howe and sollers bull knew each other socially but how well had it ever been more they were around the same age howe looked down at the table her whiteblonde hair turning rosegold in the kitchen light then she looked up slowly the woman who was leaving as we arrived a neighbour collecting for a local charity so soon after your brothers murder she mustve been keen annie pushing a straying strand of hair behind an ear mr joness peculiar religion did you know about that mr bull no does it surprise you nothing like that surprises me country areas are full of eccentrics who think they can get away with whatever theyre doing more easily out here how did you feel when your brother sold the top field to magnis berries sollers blinked then expelled an impatient breath shaking his head as if he found the question meaningless annie howe didnt move you dont have to answer any of my questions mr bull but but it might look suspicious if i dont for gods sake annie ive cooperated fully from day one ive given you a dna swab for elimination purposes ive explained exactly where i was when my brother was killed and who was with me sollers upturned his head bit his lip sniffed looked back at howe all right i dont like selling ground and i did not understand why my brother had done so you took it up with him of course i did he was my brother and he glossed over it hed actually bought that land some twenty years ago from a neighbour and he said hed never really felt it was part of the farm so when he was offered a good price he chose to get rid of it and that satisfied you look my brother and i were different people his kind of farming was more of its time instinctive merrily said what does that mean mr bull hed often follow his feelings rather than agricultural economics farming was in his blood he used to laugh at my business degree in a goodnatured way i should add was he superstitious what a ridiculous question annie howe said is it possible that your brother supplied bulls to mr jones as for that suggestion but he did keep herefords you know he did what are you doing chief inspector trying to prove in front of your subordinate that us being old friends in no way prejudices your inquiries we were friends of friends annie howe said that was all subordinate merrily smiled at least it showed that sollers had no idea who she was she turned the smile on him the boss doesnt have anything to prove to me mr bull a faintly amused twitch at the corner of annies mouth but it didnt last you feel happier now about your neighbours mr bull magnis berries and i certainly dont see how that im told youve been a regular visitor in a manner of speaking i like to keep an open mind about these things sollers said what things polytunnels much condemned howe nodded and the migrant workers you suggested to my colleague di bliss that migrant workers might be at least partly responsible for the increase in rural crime i was saying all kind of things that night id just seen my brothers butchered body and im sure your colleague exaggerated my comments well come back to that if you dont mind how well do you know ward savitch were acquainted what do you think of him another odd question im just interested annie howe said hes just a rich man in search of an identity wants to recreate the countryside as somewhere that makes him feel welcome lots of them around in the socalled new cotswolds some of them tv celebs like smiffy gill and now they have an official voice countryside defiance ostensibly the voice of the local people in fact financed and run by incomers for incomers i believe it began as a kind of businessclass social networking site on the internet then various resources got pooled and they were away good luck to them but youre their figurehead and youre not an incomer sollers bent forward ear stud winking im their muchprized wellknown local person who can get them into both grassroots farming circles and hunt balls and whats in it for you i dont like being treated like a suspect annie this is really not how i talk to a suspect mr bull but if thats how you want to some of us need incomers they buy meat from my farm shop they eat in my restaurant and i suppose it means you get to dictate some of countryside defiances policies dont like the word dictate they listen to me influence then the campaign against rural policing for example the campaign for rural policing which particularly targets di bliss sollers snorted mans a liability as im sure your masters are beginning to realize a crass little man who was particularly insensitive on the night my brother died why do you think that was because hes in the wrong place because he has no sympathy with country people especially annie howe said when theyre shagging his wife merrily knocked her cup over annie howe said that was mrs bliss wasnt it on her way out as we arrived the woman you identified as a neighbour not exactly a close neighbour well in a manner of dont you fucking sneer at me annie kirsty and i weve known each other many years long before her marriage to that oik which had turned sour long before she and i got together again and your wife my wife knows weve had separate lives for some time but were being responsible about it well stay married until the children leave home merrily righted her cup pulled out a tissue to mop up the coffee bloody hell and kirstys family also know sollers said relaxed again now and approve everyone who needs to know knows except presumably for bliss annie howe said nothing but something in her face quite visibly flinched too busy hiding his own indiscretions sollers said annie howe had started to say something it appeared to catch in her throat for a moment she looked almost nauseous and maybe sollers glimpsed that too he slid lithely away from the stove switched on more lights my information is that a physical relationship between serving police officers in the same division is normally frowned upon to the extent that should it become known about one of the officers is immediately put on the transfer list who would you rather left hereford annie bliss or i think you should consider annie howes voice cold even for her very carefully before you continue the lights were unhealthily bright halogen hell sollers dragged out a chair and sat down directly opposite them bliss he said or sergeant dowell annie howe was motionless pot kettle black sollers said you have any proof of this mr bull mrs bliss has been aware of it for quite some time and she should know dont you think annie was silent for a couple of seconds yes she said quite slowly she should know and all this sollers said relates to the murder of my brother how did your brother know no hesitation from annie in the pink light sollers bulls face froze for just an instant your brother annie said did he know about the resumption of your friendship with mrs bliss my brother and i didnt discuss social life we moved in different circles and you know what annie im not putting up with this any longer im going to ask you to leave did your brother know get out sollers said annie howe drove the audi back up the track with the headlights on full beam took the left at a fork let the car crawl up to the stone gateposts and a cracked sandstone sign oldcastle the metal gate to the drive was closed no lights rearing beyond it the house looked to merrily like a derelict nursing home three storeys a flat sheen of moonlight like tin plate on its highest windows annie howe flashed the audis headlights at the gates and waited lowering her window as a uniformed policeman emerged from a smaller gate to the side of the main entrance dont bother with the big gates george ill leave the car out here maam you do know theyre looking for you i can imagine im not here bad night maam yes i never trust a full moon george said nonsense howe turned to merrily you spare me another hour you had a phone call before you started talking to sollers bull annie howe pushed her hair back yes i had a phone call she parked to the left of the gates leaving the engine running the woman bliss was looking for the prime suspect in the marinescu case he found her oh she was attending if not running an illegal cockfight in the cellar of a wellknown flophouse and brothel on the plascarreg the woman is a large violent sociopath and the cellar was also full of men who have no reason to love the police for reasons known only to himself bliss went down there on his own oh god at a call was made by the elderly woman who owns the place uniform turned out in force blocked all the entrances to the plascarreg caught the suspect trying to smash someone elses car through a security fence five other arrests males and bliss was found in the ring he was taken to hereford and then transferred to the icu annie howes face was tinted in the bitterorange haze of the dashboard lights as the engine died they say hes in what in a few hours will probably qualify as a coma shouldering open the car door ejecting herself into the night something insane it was cold now there might even have been a frost a stray cloud was draped like a washedout rag over the bowl of the moon the only lamp was in the farmyard at oldcastle you havent got a coat annie howe said it was actually quite springlike earlier on i just jumped in the car ive got a spare one in the boot if you listen merrily said shouldnt you be back in hereford im not a doctor annie howe walked away into the centre of the yard she had a flashlight but hadnt switched it on the mobile incident room was parked at the top of the drive the bulk of it concealed by an extended barn the yard was far too quiet for a farm we had to get the livestock moved annie howe said so forensic could spend some time in the sheds and barns not that they turned up anything useful the flagstones were slick underfoot as if the blood was still here still wet merrily thought about those apocryphal stories where the blood from a murder never dried are they going to call you if if theres any change dowells at the hospital you do know theres no truth in what he said about bliss and karen dowell yet was it so unlikely that frannie bliss in the long nights of the coldest winter for many years would seek refuge with someone who spoke his language maybe why hed been so remote lately dowell has more sense annie howe said either bulls lying or kirstys got the wrong end of the stick not that there necessarily is a stick the edge had gone from her voice drained of attitude she looked waiflike in the moonlight the long coat was buttoned around her throat she sank both hands into its pockets staring at the ground jesus christ i thought he knew sollers was sleeping with his wife how could you know and he didnt it emerged during routine inquiries stagg found out couldnt wait to tell me i couldnt imagine how francis could fail to know about his wifes former relationship but you forget how secretive rural families can be i realise now that if he had known he wouldve been very polite and distant with sollers and unloaded the investigation on someone else long before he was ordered to to give himself some space to stitch sollers up from behind you really do know him dont you id probably have been more help in there if id known what you were looking for merrily said ive never known anyone break down and confess to a serious crime you know youre actually getting somewhere when they start to say no comment meaning yes i did it now prove it did he say no comment he told us to get out if he was entirely innocent hed be determined to carry on talking until hed convinced us of it get out means i need time to think annie howe gazed at the moons bevelled reflection in one of oldcastles attic windows merrily was thinking that if this was anyone else shed be asking if they could pray together for frannie most of them would humour her nobodys allowed in to see him annie said when they are ill be there good merrily looked up at the coldhaloed moon recalling the first time shed met bliss the spiritual cleansing of a country church which had been desecrated a crows entrails spread over the altar a stench of urine early days for her then in deliverance shed asked if they could send a cop who might believe that what she was doing wasnt a joke bliss had been a detective sergeant then with a fullish head of ginger hair im a catholic that all right for you merrily prayed silently alone eyes wide open head still fogged with shock annie howe said i need to get a feeling for what might have happened on the night mansel bull died i think i actually need to get yours she walked away across the flags to a tapedoff area halfway between the biggest barn and the house you can waste a lot of time looking for a motive forensics have overtaken psychology you no longer need to show why someone did it just that they did most convicted murderers come out of court in the back of the van and we still dont know why you still seemed to be presenting sollers bull with a selection of motives oh yes did mansel know about the affair with blisss wife and how did he feel about that he and kirstys father were the biggest farmers in the area were they friends or was there rivalry did sollers want mansel out of the way because the growing divergence of their ideas on the future of farming was threatening his plans was he afraid that mansel was going to marry again maybe this time producing offspring and then theres the sale of the land to magnis berries did mansel really do it without consulting sollers now why did you ask sollers if his brother was superstitious you wont like this i didnt even like you asking the question it was when sollers said mansel didnt feel it was part of his farm an oldfashioned farmer instinctive meaning he followed his feelings the implication was that he didnt like that ground even though hed bought it himself was it just not productive or what annie howe said youll need to explain as if to an idiot everything here is built on or around the roman town magnis there are superstitions connected with parts of the area its unlikely that mansel hadnt heard the stories a particular field gets a reputation for being unlucky crops failing stock dying tractor accidents merrily sensed a dampening of the air between them its what i do annie the alternative path you get tired of being defensive in the face of the secular society even your copper down there didnt trust the full moon you get the same with paramedics and nurses in a and e night of the full moon increased violence surveys prove it apparently so tell me where does irrational superstition begin theres an old farmer out at bishopstone or somewhere whos seen misty figures in the river mist and some appear real and some dont he talks of one with a birds head followers of mithras would wear masks to signify whichever grade theyd attained one of the grades is the raven men who had been reappearing so who was the hallucination drenched in blood annie said when they reached the barn doors two spotlights blazed into life high up on the house wall as though a play was about to begin on the stage of weathered stone flags annie howe fingered the police tape around six fortyfive pm on the night of the storm mansel bull sets out for his parish council meeting then receives a call on his mobile from the council clerk to say its been called off because of the weather mansel turns his range rover round and heads home who knew hed be attending a council meeting the other councillors and the clerk and his brother sollers she moved to the double doors opposite the farmhouse in both these barns there were cattle herefords including in a separate stall one bull you know that from sollers himself who initially was pointing us at rustlers now if for the sake of argument there was a plan to take some of mansels cattle the night of the parish council which mansel never missed might be seen as the most appropriate time wouldnt sollers know if something on that scale was happening it would take several people the coach house is lower down the hill screened by trees and reached by a different turnoff from the main drive they could easily get up here without being seen and on a night like that without being heard perfect conditions in fact for crowbarring a barn door was the barn door forced no perhaps because it didnt get that far because mansel returned in the middle of it and they killed him could easily be that simple if jones and his mithraism are irrelevant now give me your take on it me tell me something insane from the top of the farmyard you could make out in the moonlight the silver eel that was the river wye always venerated sometimes claiming sacrifices part of the landscape that the romans knew oldcastle was part of it too a vantage point perhaps built inside the longflattened ramparts of a minor iron age hill fort or a roman site with roman masonry now built into the foundations of this house sollers hadnt been specific perhaps he didnt know perhaps he did back at the edge of the police tape merrily bent and lit a cigarette she was wearing annie howes checked woollen coat the sleeves were too long but it was a cold night in weather like that most of us prefer to go home and bar the doors against the wind but when youre encouraged to go out and use its energy paganism again most kinds of paganism work with natural energy if youre in what might be considered a haunted landscape or one that you believe to be conditioned by over a thousand years of military endeavour im just giving you the received wisdom tell me to stop whenever you like i was interested in byrons description of sacrificial ritual that doesnt end in blood this is the man who makes his own way here camps in a field goes on a fast is it necessary for the sacrifice to be done in the temple i dont know if this was a roman site part of the extended magnis then they might find some justification for doing it right here leave quite a mess though wouldnt it rustlers have been known to butcher animals in the fields annie said thats what it would look like butchery for the meat all right so developing the idea that there was a plan to take mansels bull and have it slaughtered the candidate arrives at the height of the storm maybe accompanied maybe not part of the challenge you have to imagine someone whos been through all the grades the heat and the cold and the neardeath whatever has now reached the point where hes ready to take on for a short time the role of the god himself hes on fire but these are tension creases in annie howes spotlit face illustrating the hard time she was having with all this these are educated men annie highlevel freemasons ritual magicians theyre all educated men businessmen financiers guys in massively competitive industries powered by testosterone not known for their sensitivity and right now theyre angry and disillusioned reeling under accusations of collapsing the western economy and walking away with their massive undeserved bonuses fallen masters of the universe ok ill buy it for the moment how might this escalate to the murder of a man anybody can be a killer if theres enough anger greed ambition repressed sexuality how about the candidate you get drawn into something and if its changing your life for what seems like the better youre not going to jump off when it starts to get extreme artificial stimulants might also be involved the romans seem to have used something called i think haoma miss whites drug of war combined with dogma and ritual and a physical regime built around commitment to a deity real or symbolic could it be recreated bulls blood and magic mushrooms nothing like a brew merrily smiled wearily as they say in the regiment chemicallyenhanced excitement in the middle of a raging wind where you could hardly hear yourself think annie said suppose sollers knew about this told them what night his brothers going to be out what time he leaves what time he usually comes back from the council or was actually there when his brother was killed theres time all we know is that he was at his restaurant at seventhirty and he wasnt covered with blood what if sollers was here to see it extreme blood sport male model in hunting pink merrily thought ridiculously vain a figurehead for countryside defiance which he both supported and despised and then mansels back unexpectedly annie said and heres his beloved little brother and a man with a large knife merrily closed her eyes watched mansel bulls headlights blasting between the bars of the gate mansel barrelling towards them through the windwhipped night whos this its mansel mansel bull the bull the bull in his citadel the symbolism was both insane and inescapable annie howe was standing at the high point of the farmyard looking down between the bare trees at the moonlit wye her face latticed with white light and shifting shadows he has to come through this barely a whisper bliss yes sham the smell reached jane first didnt smell like any church or temple shed ever been in or imagined not herbs not incense more like a meat store the smell of raw meat always made her feel slightly sick now and she thought about the beautiful dead cockerel with his golden mane cornel shone his torch around for her it was smaller than it had looked in the picture on his phone half the size of a chapel one of those cold welsh nonconformist chapels jane could hear echoes of her own hypedup breathing go on cornel said go down hold on the torch opened up a panel of light in front of her she was in the wide trench down the middle this is it carefully jane stood up this is where they hold the cockfights it was like a car workshop with a pit where the car was ramped up there was a long rectangular gulley down the middle of the floor on either side of it rough ledges or benches like seating areas much of this below ground level sunk into the foundations of the hut so it was a nissen hut built over a rectangular pit or a trench as dug by archaeologists cornel was jumping down the steps pushing past her and strolling along the trench like he owned the place pretty clear now that hed been snorting coke talking faster moving weirdly eirion had done coke just the once well as far as jane knew eirion had said it was like ten minutes of cloud nine and then an hour or so all pumped up before you needed some more the knowledge that cornel was on something that was actually quite comforting like inasmuch as there was any comfort to be had for a vegetarian woman down here she called across to him so its happening later or its already happened what the cockfighting no doubt about that now it stank of it somewhere down here there would be blood there would be feathers jane pulled out her phone checked the battery still functioning but getting low and the signal was down to one blob which often meant you could manage to make calls but not receive them what are you doing jane pictures a stone plinth jutted from the end wall of concrete blocks below the plinth a rudimentary sink like a font but with more of a sense of altar about it above the plinth a kind of stone plaque or tablet quite big with figures on it in relief wait cornel said ill give you some better ones in a minute he unslung his big rucksack unzipped it started taking things out it was really cold in here half in the earth jane curled her hand around the phone in her jacket pocket and moved along the gulley it was lined with stone some of the marks near her feet did look like patches of dried blood can you shine the torch down there for a minute cornel didnt move in the ambient light jane tried to make out the marks on the stone benches theyre divided into segments like individual seats i suppose the audience sits up here and with both ends blocked so the birds cant escape there were chisel marks carvings in the surface figures like you saw in pyramids only more crudely drawn into the concrete probably done before it dried but chipped now some were in circles like astrological symbols it was actually pretty interesting or it would have been if shed been here with eirion rather than jane limped up to the sink a shallow pool in there dipped a finger into it then held it up and sniffed looked like water smelled of nothing much there was a flake of something like mud on the edge of the sink when she flicked it off it made brown liquid scribbles in the pool could this actually have been a roman cockpit her knowledge of roman deities was fairly basic as an archaeologist she was a onetrick pony stone circles henges bronze age burial mounds she brought out her phone again could you just like shine the torch here for just a minute i want to see if the lights strong enough cornel made an impatient noise and came over with his torch directed the beam at the plinth jane saw that one corner had been knocked off and it was all powdery its concrete its not stone at all she tried to see his face behind the beam what is this place been rebuilt its a sham absolutely cornel bent over her shoulder as she took a shot of the corner with her phone thank you what are you hed just lifted the phone out of her hand ive told you ill give you some better ones stand back girlie his arm went back and then there was the sound of something hitting the wall and bouncing off and that wasnt my phone was it probably wouldnt work down here anyway whatve you done the echo came back at the same time as cornels arm and then it got lost in a bang and another bang and a splintering crunch and then cornel had hold of janes arm and he was dragging her back and she was shutting both eyes against a rising storm of grit and the inside of her mouth was like in the yard at the swan when shed been choking on the cobweb full of flies cornel pulled her away screaming down the aisle pointing the torch ahead of them into a dust storm jane erupted in coughs only half aware of the stone tablet with the figures on it beginning to wobble as she watched it tilted slowly and began to topple towards them whatre you doing cornel was on his feet he was laughing the torch in one hand its beam almost solid with dust a shorthandled lump hammer in the other havent even started yet he said girlie engine noise where are you lol shouting the way you couldnt help doing when the voice at the other end was faint and kept cutting out he was on the phone in barrys office standing up he heard danny telling gomer to slow down and then gomers voice saying they didnt want to lose the bugger who ostyn kenny mostyn danny did some explaining lol kind of got the gist he saw barry in the doorway standing very still the way only barry did danny lol said listen to me its not possible youve got jane with you no it wasnt lol couldve wept when he came off the phone barry waved him to the swivel chair slowly he said gomer and danny lol said are in gomers jeep theyre following kenny mostyn because they think hes going to a cockfight where danny thinks theyre probably heading for the stretton sugwas route towards hereford but obviously he cant be sure lots of tracks and old farm buildings let me get this right barry said the rock n roll farmer and a man well into his seventies why they think theres a cockfight on and this mostyns on his way to it i dont know i suggested that when he stopped they should just drive past and then call me back dont go up any tracks good advice laurence but then this is gomer lol said like there arent enough problems with jane missing cornel had his back to jane now fiddling with something she heard the familiar repeat clicking of a stubborn cigarette lighter he wasnt my mate after all cornel said he stepped away from the altar where two curling flames were sending shadows coiling over the walls and up to the curved ceiling two small bowlshaped lamps like twin miniature mens urinals were sitting on the edge of the altar jane backed away there was still dust in the air cosy eh you took my phone in this world girlie you have to take what you want kenny taught me that kenny my mate take it when you want it where you want it thats what kenny said my mate taking pictures of me holding up the dead cock in the ring my mate where do you think those pictures ended up i dont know you dont know cornels face was fingered by shadows well you know im not sure about that you know what i think i think i havent actually got any mates he threw something to the concrete a bundle of something soft least of all you girlie you were never my mate youre a slippery duplicitous little slag look i dont know what youre jane steadied her voice im not your mate but ive got nothing if you just give me the torch and the phone i can take some pictures and then like if you just give me a day or so to expose the cockfight situ you stupidlittlefuckingbitch a bright sprinkle of spit in the thin lamplight as his body arched at her there was never any cockfighting here never you got that raven hed done it all cut the wire smashed the cctv camera hed been here before well of course he had there was a horrible smell from the lamps like rancid molten butchersshop fat cornel was leaning against the altar the lump hammer still in his hand the rucksack at his feet thing is girlie and ive thought about this a lot the night you humiliated me in the pub i do believe thats when it all started going wrong me standing there with my trousers soaked as if id pissed myself and all my mates laughing you started it you couldve walked away anytime and you didnt well in the frame for a shag who put you up to it girlie which of my mates nobody swear to god i was just fishing for information about what happens at the court bull shit kids your age its just clothes and clubbing and baby booze and the teenwitch bit in your case though idve thought i have never been a bloody teen and your boyfriend the bigtime journalist you think i didnt ask people if you had a boyfriend yeah yeah she knocks around with some fat welsh student he knows a lot of journalists and hes not oh shut up no im sorry jane moved back into the lamplight not having this im sorry but youre wrong youre shuddup jane flinched a little but didnt move if its not cockfighting she said what is it took my money and they hung me out to dry who one of the other guys was washing in the gents and he had his sleeves rolled up i thought it was a tattoo hed been branded branded like a bull and it was still fresh and livid the pain of that and he didnt he didnt care pain works its a man thing his teeth were gritted again jane recalled how at the back of the swan the man with the ashy voice had told cornel its about manhood this is some kind of temple right i thought you knew all about it but you dont know shit do you dont know much about roman stuff holy of holies just smashed the holy of holies and its not over yet why made it to raven and then it stopped huh took me out to the top of a hill had to spend the night on the top naked all night alone but i knew they were watching so i couldnt creep off no food all day they gave me something to drink so i stopped feeling the cold and then im seeing things fucking terrifying but when the sun comes up god next night we go out lamping hares it was spectacular im wearing like cornel cupped his hands around his face like a funnel the raven then ate raw meat freshkilled his body was vibrating again he was grinding his teeth then his jaw fell to his chest and that was it covered truck still comes maybe twice a week close to midnight there might be fifteen guys on the course but only two or three will go and im like whens it my turn why not me was that it theres higher degrees another six but it stops it fucking stops oh god it was about frustration it all came out they wouldnt let him move up to the next grade they took his money but they wouldnt let him move on hed kept on at kenny mostyn who hed thought was his mate what did he have to do what did they want hed gone around the countryside demonstrating how hard he was shooting at peoples pets following kenny one night to a cockfight thinking back kenny mustve been really pissed off when he turned up but he congratulated him on his initiative bought him drinks helped him place his bets of course he lost making a fool of himself got into the car legless but made it back trying to persuade barry to cook the poor bird hed become halfmad with frustration he really didnt understand and oh for gods sake jane didnt either twentysix cornels big jaw thrusting out his face all sheeny twenty fucking six with a mortgage half the size of the national debt a car that cost fifty k not half paid for im fucked he laid the hammer on the altar bent down to the rucksack and pulled something out like a folded jacket or something jane couldnt see got the push girlie did i tell you necessary rationalization had a message to ring my boss he wasnt even apologetic difficult times old boy difficult times then off to his villa in tuscany the bloated fucking toad jane watched a fist rebunching out of the same hand that had held hers knuckles shining with grease they shafted me mostyn and savitch and all the publicschool cunts who were egging me on to give you one cornel reached down and tugged on something i followed the truck hired the van so nobody would know it was me easy to follow people on these roads and then i came back hey but you know what was weird got in last night being really really careful and the police came the actual police im crouching there behind the altar they flash their torches around very quickly and then bugger off i creep up to the door and theyve nicked some other bloke couldnt believe it i felt cornel punched his left palm with his right fist magic when he started to laugh it was like a yelping he snapped on the torch and shone the beam at the ground where hed thrown down the bundle strikes me youre the first woman ever to come in here his livery lips wet or you will be kicking the bundle on the ground and jane watched the sleeping bag slowly unroll sacrilege cornels shadow was a momentary black bloom on the curved roof think of it like that were gonna have ourselves some sacrilege girlie janes recoil knocked one of the lamps off the altar hot fat splashing up as it went out and she bit her top lip so hard she felt the blood come cornels face in the mean light was creamy with sweat cornel was a mess cornel was a tosser keep telling yourself that jesus tell him cornel jane said even though she knew it was the wrong wrong thing to say she said it youre an educated guy you ever think this could be making you just a little bit insane dont waste time looking for his reaction look for a way out of here those stepped concrete blocks the seating the back row seemed to be some distance from the wall would have to be because this was a nissen hut and more than half the wall was curved part of the roof so there had to be a space youll get another job stepping back her raised voice gathering echoes look at the totally bent disgraced politicians who keep bouncing back and theyre like old so there was likely to be a concealed channel walkway crawlway around the perimeter follow that and youd get back to the doors cornel said dont try to engage me in conversation jane were way past that a twoone from the lse he wasnt a complete idiot was he jane saw him place something on the end of the concrete bench and pick up the hammer each time he smashed it down with a dull metallic splintering she winced and jerked and backed a bit further away it had to be her mobile please cornel suddenly near to tears and they were seeping into her voice you cant rape me the word was out pathetically but carrying a long echoape me jane zipped her jacket all the way up as his voice came back at her petulant along with a spurt of torchbeam doesnt have to be that just because you feel sorry for somebody jane said steadily doesnt mean you doesnt mean you can fancy them well she didnt feel sorry for cornel at all he was a victim of his own greed his own obsession she hated him she sank slowly down and fitted both hands under one of the shards of concrete which had flown off under the lump hammer it was too heavy to throw at him but she had nothing else she held it against her stomach letting her body take some of the weight as she backed away from the lamp and this place is horrible it stinks and its not even a proper ancient site its just cobbled together out of old building supplies and you know what i i think youve got this all wrong cornel i think youve been conned this is just a scam to make money out of guys like you jane flattened herself against the rough bottom wall and began to drag herself along it thinking maybe cornel wanted this place to bring out a side of him he still wasnt sure was there as if just being here doing violent man things its just a scam cornel to make money out of rich gullible do you see whats in my hand girlie jane screamed im not looking aware that he was pointing the torch at himself oh please down there you come near me cornel i swear ill have your eyes out sleeper as they drove up towards the brecon road the clouds had fled the stillwintry moonlight was spread like sour cream on the fields where the man who slaughtered the bull might have gone running his head floating inside the feral fury of his haoma high try explaining that to the crown prosecution service annie howe had said even if sollers had no hand in the killing if he was there he did nothing to stop it then into his car and off to his restaurant to fix himself an alibi what was he like when he arrived at the restaurant stagg talked to the staff they were agreed that sollers was in one of his reorganizing moods calling the team together we should do this we need to do that busy busy hyper that figures then after a suitable period of time he comes back and according to his statement hears the cattle making a noise in the sheds walks up with his shotgun and discovers the carnage shotgun common enough reaction for a farmer at night especially in an area portrayed by countryside defiance as the badlands expect the worst be ready dont expect any help from the police how did it all go sour merrily sank back against the headrest thinking of arthur baxter and his smallholding the good life eh where did all that go the baxes in their shapeless homemade sweaters replaced by the mostyns in killer camouflage and wheres mansels murderer now conceivably in some london nightclub or the theatre annie said wed need a list of joness clients present and past itll take work liaison with the met manpower overtime money even before we try to penetrate the wellprotected lawyerlined heart of the city will that be so much harder than penetrating the old farming families of herefordshire the car climbed the last hill to the brecon road you know why he explained in detail jones how the candidate came alone and slept in a tent and fasted for a day you know why he told us all that instead of delivering his need to know line thats just in case this guy really did do it killed mansel so jones could say he was on his own nothing to do with me guv you could be in the wrong job i thought the entire clergy was in the wrong job as far as you were concerned annie howe laughed and drove out onto the hereford road put her foot down before leaving oldcastle shed rung the hospital frannie bliss had come round for about five seconds it was enough annie howe had smoked one of merrilys cigarettes the lump of ridged concrete was too heavy and it was hard for jane to think how she could smash it down on cornel if he came for her but he hadnt hed gone quiet and shed lugged the slab with her into the gap behind the seating blocks sinking down there feeling like a rabbit hiding from a rabid fox the space was narrower than shed expected maybe cornel wouldnt fit in here she packed herself into it and waited in silence hearing him moving around and then a double grunt as if he was heaving himself up on something she heard a muted thuck thuck oh christ he was barring the doors jane let the slab slide down between her feet shut her eyes and prayed for help but when cornel spoke again his voice was quieter wherever you are girlie dont move if you dont want to get hurt but there was a kind of anticipation his voice like the whisper before a performance jane said nothing in case he was still just trying to find out where she was she hunched herself up back against the curving metal arms around her knees the chunk of concrete between her feet could see the top of the long concrete bench above her black against a grey haze if she stood up shed be able to see over it but if she stood up cornel could reach her get his arms around her she shrank into herself and there was more silence she could hear him breathing one long gritty snort oh god more coke jane grabbed the opportunity to squirm a little further down heard cornel moving around on the concrete bench breath coming in little spurts now all pumped up superman oh please please please please a creak from the top end of the building where the doors were and cornel went quiet nothing for a while and then unmistakably soft footfalls on the steps what jane saw the torchbeam bouncing erratically across the metal roof and she didnt think it was cornels the torchbeam steadied evening kenny cornel said merrily unlocked her car in gaol street and sat behind the wheel discovering that she was no longer tired perhaps the relief bliss nothing lifethreatening she called lol and then jane no answer from either she left messages she had a cigarette half out of the packet and then pushed it back in no mood to relax she called huw owen it took nearly half an hour to update him i think we can work this out she said we have enough to work it out lass go home its dark its cold and its good friday tomorrow and ill be locked into a meditation cycle you dont have to do anything i just need you to listen could be selling myself a scenario im just sitting here no bible no bergen no cross just old jeans and trainers and a coat borrowed from an atheist hardly the time for a crisis of faith lass when would be a good time merrily coughed sorry whos the adversary does there have to be one did wi spicer merrily looked around the empty car park as if there might be a shadow with horns and claws prowling the edge of her vision knowing that horns and claws wouldnt scare her half as much as what shed once seen in the eyes of an old dying man on a hospital ward start with elimination huw said is it mithras a sun god consigned to a cellar by the romans im not sure hes not one of the injured parties what if shes right the witch of hardwicke and the roman mithras is an insidious form of antichrist the mole the sleeper inside the church what if the sleepers been awakened going after spicer in the night what does he see merrily stared into the moon he sees three men standing round his bed one with blood where his teeth should be one with shards of glass in his face one with a rope around his neck and his tongue hanging out greg and jocko and nasal it had to be he told you he was oppressed by the presence of someone who was known to him a flawed person he was just being careful im guessing he meant three people his gang an sas operational team are very close sharing their individual skills a unit a single entity now add to that the chemistry of mithras according to byron it was syd who got into it first and syd was the only survivor because he went away and threw himself in the opposite direction theres another survivor merrily byron was he as close as the others was byron ever on a mission with syd its a fourman team usually i think the other guys were in mithraic terminology syds brothers now all dead in bad ways and syd feels responsible unquietly dead thats what youre saying they are when he comes back to the regiment sleeping in his army house under credenhill and then the technicality which has to be mithraism he tells you about what he calls a strong negative energy behind the apparitions manifestations whatever these guys were his mates his brothers his gang but one of them killed his own wife and syd doesnt know since mithras if jocko greg and nasal are at all benign any more and the negative energy the fuel all around athena white called it a landscape quietly dedicated to war but its also at various points in its history been dedicated to the roman mithras i mean more realistically i think syd discovered what byron was doing selling mithras what could come of that but serious evil merrily gave in and lit a cigarette i think if mithraism had still been spreading inside the sas he wouldve known about it hed have been watching and he had contacts probably with the last chaplain whether he knew what byrons doing now before he took the chaplains job i dont know but when he was at credenhill he mustve had a powerful sense of something horribly familiar amplified and senses the old team back together but not in a good way eh bad nights huw racked with guilt frightened for the future and he doesnt know how to deal with it he thought he did in the end he turns in desperation to the chapel happen finding it easier because the chapels in the beacons the old sas training ground and even while hes there trying to arm himself what happens back home that same stormy night a man gets murdered in the true mithraic manner what kind of nights sleep would you get after learning about that there was a long flat mobilephone silence he rings you merrily said yielding a bit more information if he can only get nasal and co out of his dreams lets call them dreams he might feel sane enough to the advice huw had given him how sane was that denzil joy had been straightforward compared with this situation to do what huw said take on byron jones i suppose sooner or later he knows he has to take on byron plug jane tasted cobweb and dead flies came with the voice the soft ashy voice from the yard at the swan the mottled accent of a man from the birmingham area whod been living round hereford for a long time im cool cornel said and this is all your work is it im impressed mate kenny mostyn the famous kenny mostyn of hardkit had he followed them jane didnt see how he could have which meant hed probably been nearby all along and cornel couldnt have known that or he wouldnt have laid down his sleeping bag and yet cornel didnt sound in any way dismayed he sounded if anything pleased up for it cocaine good old charlie cornel said seen whats left of your idol kenny kenny sniggered hed switched off his flashlight put it down somewhere it was only the lamp now on the halfsmashed altar dust cornel said hes dust and that makes me feel gutted does it cornel didnt reply no indication of either of them moving then there was another scornful noise in kennys throat know what cornel yow are a wanker and you are gonna in the pause you could hear cornels rapid breath could imagine his long body quivering gonna regret that kenny gonna regret a lot of things before too long found the petrol cornel huh torch the place was that it on your way out fires good cornel said fire destroys dna another pause then kennys voice had changed its tone somehow whats that in your hand mate this cornels gleeful indrawn breath was overlaid by a crisp ratcheting sound what it is to be exact kenny is a glock gen safe action safe action i like that dont you safe cornels voice all gleaming with excitement like a kid with a new xbox but jane knew what a glock was one of those brand names you didnt forget oh for gods sake she was frozen with the reality of it this was what hed had in his hand what hed had in his rucksack with the wirecutters and the lump hammer kenny wasnt fazed whered that come from cornel got it in london weeks ago two and a half cash with four clips yow was robbed had a go on it yet saving it cornel said for somebody who told me to come back when my balls had dropped kenny laughed it didnt sound faked cornel didnt join in you just laugh while you can kenny cause your brains are going on the ceiling hows that sound mate childish on your knees i think jane stiffened kennys voice came back merely quizzical on me knees to yow see if this was a shotgun i could blow your head clean off at this range but a head shot with a handguns riskier so if you stay on your feet ill have to go for the body and that could take a bit longer and a lot of pain make sense oh god jane was hugging herself tightly he was kidding right best for you if you kneel down and close your eyes eh mate what did you do what could you do when he was quite plainly preparing to go through with it what did you do which of these was the leastbad guy which of them wouldnt rape you what was the right thing to do very quietly jane stood up her hair brushing the curved metal where wall became roof the air was fogged the light meagre from the single smelly lamp on the altar and the torch between cornels feet directing a beam too narrow to reach her kenny mostyn stood in the gulley his back to her a shortish dapperlooking guy he wore a leather jacket and a watch cap and his jeans were tucked into leather boots while cornel standing on the concrete bench with his legs apart and both hands swaddling the grey pistol cornel just looked demonic in a ravaged kind of way with his sagging fleshy mouth his hair spiked with sweat like a big puppet some mindless voodoo doll being worked by someone else it seemed entirely likely that hed forgotten jane was here she slid down lifted up the lump of concrete fingertips finding two smooth depressions and stood up again as kenny spoke yow been snorting again cornel doesnt exactly slow me up just dont do anything rash eh hey youre really scared little whoop from cornel youre scared shitless arent you mr mostyn now tell me you dont deserve it taking my money never serving up the goods just leading me on sending pictures to my boss feeding all kinds of poison up the line to london how many other guys you do that to never done that to nobody cornel youre a liar i ripped you off yeah cause i was owed that money fairs fair and no way was you going further than raven not after i found out where you were from dont get you kenny cornel was bobbing the pistol shaking make it quick sods law just one of them things look just another casualty of the recession i was likely just one of a hundred small businessmen they pulled the plug on that week who what are you saying nothing landesmans dont know about lies and false promises yeah well help you you stick with us mr mostyn well see you right until the helps needed then yow dont see the knife go in just feel it come out and theres your friendly financial adviser wiping the blade on his pinstripes and asking if youve thought about bankruptcy so dont yow go talking to me about getting led on with false flamin promises pulled the plug jane remembered the phrase from the article on savitch in borderlife how the bank was close to pulling the plug when savitch stepped in to save hardkit so all this was just a kind of scapegoat situation cornel paying for what some loans manager had done to kenny mostyn just a malepride thing a petty vengeance trip turned toxic the stinking air was suddenly thick with a sour alien insanity jane brought the lump of concrete up to her chest it was round and smooth on one side but heavy like a cannonball and her arms were aching already you piece of shit theyre never gonna get me for this likes of you lowlife scum made good it could be anybody spoiled for choice mostyn cornels hands throbbing around the gun kenny shrugged im only human cornel ent the holy man here just the help you can go back to london tell them what i did why i did it and no harm done just a few red faces and they might even remember my name this time ive lost my fucking job ive lost everything you think im going to start again go in as some little highstreet fucking bank clerk that what you think on your knees you little piece of shit now on your fucking knees the whole place suddenly seemed brighter as if cornel was generating his own electricity shining his slack lips parted to reveal those gritted teeth all his resentment and bitterness pouring down those rigid outstretched arms and the stink from the lamp was putrid as kenny mostyn almost in slow motion went down on one knee on the stained floor of the gulley no choice now panting so hard that she was afraid they could hear her jane sucked in her stomach and lifted the ball of concrete hands underneath thrust it up over her head watching cornel bringing up the gun his long bony hands together as if in prayer around it as if for just a moment as if he was relenting and jane held back swaying under the weight of the concrete then realized that although she was deep in shadow the concrete between her hands was gleaming palely in the lamplight and cornel looked up and saw it looking for a moment puzzled confused as kenny mostyns knee lifted from the floor and kennys arms shot out fingers clawing the air as if to throw himself forward like he was finding himself again cornel backed up and brought the barrel of the gun down in direct line with kennys halfbowed head jane pushed herself forward and her pathetic little arms gave way and she had to let go of the concrete night of the last supper the clouds had cleared and the moon lay cold as rock salt over an alley of conifers barry stood inside the wire looking at the three of them shaking his head how your life turns on its head not much more than a kid and youre out in the field with a handful of crack professionals all with special skills linguistics engineering advanced firstaid bomb disposal none of them much more than kids or thats how it looks to me now at the age of fiftyeight fiftyeight eh gomer said so what point you tryin to make yere boy forget it barry said doing his recce lol thought standing among closepacked conifers on the edge of the compound with its buildings and footpaths taking his time lol was very agitated now but barry wouldnt be hurried four big sheds one concrete no windows so id guess equipment in there three caravans say two for staff accommodation and the other one looks like a canteen two tents in that sloping field up towards the woods might be people in there cant rule it out small toilet block theyd started talking in whispers now lol noticed the air among the conifers was sharp and damp and acrid the surface of a big pond offcentre was shining dully like tinplate under the noncommittal moon no cockfight here barry said thats for sure by the time the call had come through from danny barry was changed into his running kit had his old freelander waiting outside the swan leaving marion in charge tell me again he said to danny we come out onto the credenhill road and we done mabbe two hundred yards and mostyn suddenly stops and we gotter pass him see so we turns round and creeps back on sidelights and hes found this ole van in the bushes side of the road and then he gets back in and hes off along the lane like a bullet then up this track no compromises on this track it was steep and unmade without a fourbyfour youd be in trouble halfway up that sign black on white the compound training centre trespassers unwelcome the moonlight was so bright on it this time that lol made out a small amendment half scrubbedout it actually said trespassers unwelcome trespassers here seem to have had their uses lol said hed also told barry on the way here about the smashed cctv camera and the cut wire how the police had thought it was him barry had said he was a stupid bleeder for even getting out of his truck gomer he hissed now stay in the trees looks like an ole jcb down there boy back o the big shed yeah well leave it alone for now in the absence of poultry the best thing is probably to get the hell out hes got a bloody cockfight somewhere gomer said sure to we was told wed hear something would we not and frankly i cant see byron permitting it he dont do entertainment on any level might not start till later boy this ent bingo and hes in yere mostyn he works here bleedin hell you never give up do you gomer but it was clear they were going in lol wondered if it would feel any different entering the compound by what passed for an actual entrance going in mobhanded unblooded he checked his mobile to see if there was anything from jane and found a short text from merrily this is getting weird please dont go anywhere it was on the way home anyway almost still wearing the atheists coat merrily stood close to the grave of jane winder whose potted history was spotlit by the moon and died at brinsop court in this parish october in the year of her age poor jane a stranger from off no age at all by night the stone was a monolith in front of the trees on the dark pond which was labelled moat on the map and all the mysterious humps in the moonscratched fields below credenhill and you held on to it to steady yourself against what seemed like an irreversible madness brinsop church was locked for the night of course merrily had thought about calling the local team minister dick willis but she wouldnt have got away this time without an explanation she stood there an arm around jane winders cold shoulder and took in the long view to the right where it was as though the whole wide area overshadowed by credenhill had been stripped back by the full moon nothing but a skim of soil and rock and clay over what remained of the romans the men that have been reappear a poets imaginative exercise probably nothing more than that nothing about a brutalized religion reinvoked from the soil but the poem had been there in the book left out by syd a rabbit hopped across the graveyard and sat by the church porch sniffing the night no bible no bergen no cross merrily slipped away out of the churchyard and over the stile to the field where the dragons well lay in sodden grass its round stone like a small cider wheel a modern metal drain cover was embedded in the stone ewes and big lambs were watching her from the hedge round eyes like lamps could be innocence could be cynicism if you were looking for an adversary it could be the dragon but was more likely in this place to be george merrily lit a cigarette advice syd in her darkest moments she thought that if exorcism hadnt found her she might not have stuck this job how feeble was that if the only way you could convince yourself that you were more than just another badly paid professional carer was by reenacting medieval rituals and seeing what happened the psychic son et lumiere and the bangs and whistles that real mystics discounted as foreplay but that wasnt you syd you didnt want any of it came out of the army looked back in horror leaps i cant make hed said to her smoking in his church aspects i cant face any more merrily said cant face any more that was what you meant she sat down on the wellhead watched the smoke rising from her fingers towards the moon the bible in the bergen syd this is what i think a reminder of which side you were on now well sure but going up credenhill with that on your back its like christ carrying his cross a constant reminder every step you take the tug of the pack the weight of the book brassbound bulky uncomfortable every step you take up that hill you feel it who you are what youre about the weight of responsibility she felt syd moving up credenhill like thomas traherne in the blazing stained glass bump bump of the bible on the spine total consciousness why if he wanted to confront the shadow of mithras had he gone up credenhill rather than come here perhaps he didnt know hadnt worked it out whatever something had found him death had found him idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy merrily stood up folded her arms looked down at them swaying a little then looking up at the moon in its halo of pagan complacency she felt profoundly empty inside like a suckedout seashell the night before good friday the night of the last supper always tainted with the sour odour of failure and betrayal bending to pick up her bag from the wellcover she thought for a moment that it wasnt there that the well water was exposed and the full moon a perfect pale disc was reflected in it merrily straightened up gazed down for some time and then nodded remembering she slipped a hand down one of the back pockets of her jeans and found splinters crumbs of faith always a rational explanation slowly she bent and retrieved the moon migraine lights the piece of concrete fell short inevitably even desperation hadnt produced the necessary strength jane watched it landing on the edge of the bench rolling into the gulley at the same time as the torch rolled off and died and the only light was from the roman lamp on the altar the air thick and fetid with hot animal fat one small lamp had done that but jane was boneachingly cold looking down at cornel lying in the gulley with his knees drawn up foetal kenny mostyn was standing slightly away from cornel quite calm with his arms by his side but loosened up springy watching as cornel began to roll away and his hand came out and even jane could tell what he was trying to reach and knew he wouldnt make it kennys knee rose up and his foot cracked down on the clawed hand and cornel screamed hideously rolling helplessly onto his back as kenny kicked something away we dont need this do we mate were men i was just what squatting down tell your uncle kenny just trying to scare you thats all thats all it was course it was kenny said softly cornel was sobbing jane hated anybody sobbing a sob was not something you could fake and she could feel his fear kenny listen it really was just a joke like one of your tests one of your exercises where youre thinking youre gonna die and at the last second sure kenny crouched down next to cornel youre all right mate i understand jane saw kennys face for the first time actually not for the first time she realized shed seen him several times in hereford maybe among the saturday scrum in high town or sitting outside one of the pubs where they had tables short roundfaced guy with a moustache and the hint of a beard which made a dark circle around his mouth he was looking up towards the glosspainted metal ceiling but saying nothing no expression on the face and his eyes were white like a blind mans eyes he seemed to be stroking cornels hair calming him down then abruptly he turned his head away looking up not at her perhaps at the smears of movement which she could see as though through old speckled glass jane shook her head and the glass brightened and then fragmented and then coalesced and broke apart and coalesced again like migraine lights and there were human forms wet naked men glowing greasily like in some rugby teams communal bath a fatty stew of nudging squirming whiteeyed men around her touching her skin and she like shrank into herself in disgust all her senses full of the steam and the stink of sweat and the disconnected cries from a long way down in her mind and then one man stepped out of it and became kenny mostyn he was holding up a short blade which he briefly inspected before nonchalantly folding it and putting it away in an almost military fashion not once looking down but jane did she saw cornel move cornel was lying bent like a burst pipe and it was as if he was laughing shaking with laughter just another scary exercise a test for a hard man what happens is anything you want his body jerked once in spasm that big chin jutting out like a shelf of rock over a waterfall jane felt the pressure of a scream in her throat but no sound came out she just stood there watching from the gallery watching all the blood belching out of the hole in cornels long neck filling up the gulley kenny mostyn was sitting down now on the concrete bench opposite wiping his forehead with the back of a hand blankfaced as the blood ran past his boots spreading almost the width of the gulley but never quite reaching the other face on which cornels glassy eyes were focused a face without a head or a body a straight nose a petulant twist to the mouth and a hat like a caterpillar the face sculpted into the shard of concrete that jane had grabbed from the rubble after cornel had attacked the altarpiece with his lump hammer she thought a smile formed for a moment on the face in the concrete as her scream passed into echo and all she could hear was the thin wet sound of cornel dying the wafer and the moon the scream had been muffled choked off but it was still reaching for lol like an imploring hand and for just a moment hed thought it was jane it sent him to the nissen hut the padlock had been broken but the big doors were firm a wall of wood new oak that would break your shoulder he turned in desperation to danny who was alongside him hands exploring the panels bolted it is from inside what do we do all right barry whispered options we could bang on the door shout police open up now but thatd warn em danny thomas said we wanner do that it would yeah and when they seen us if theres a whole bunch of em in there true barry turned to gomer pointed across the compound to the biggest shed that old jcb you reckon oh aye twin moons floating in gomers bottle glasses sure to less hes broke you can hotwire it dont need no hotwire gomer had dragged out a jangle of keys on a ring digger that age one size fits all try it go with him danny eh if it dont look promising get out before you make too much noise and well try something else barry moved away from the doors and lol followed him to the original hole in the barbed wire its ends springing free like brambles barry ran an uncertain hand across his jaw bit too much like the old days laurence but this is not the old days its not warfare its not terrorism and im not your gaffer bearing in mind there could be very serious repercussions you dont have to do what i say none of you lol threw up his hands you want me to make decisions the songwriter barry i dont give a shit about repercussions theres something here makes my blood go cold all right lets quickly go over the situation one last time whats the worst we know happens that might be happening in there they kill a bull with a knife in theory how many people involved in that no idea he looked back at the nissen hut underground athena had said to simulate a cave certainly no windows it was a possibility if this was regiment business barry said wed have smoke bombs masks and automatic bleedin hardware from heckler and koch and one of us might even know what to do with it there was a metallic clang from the jcb then silence barry gazed across the compound light as a dull day down there jeez he said look at us laurence even youd be too old to qualify for selection from behind the big shed they heard the slow clatter of an old cold engine being coaxed back into active service and as for him the moon lay in the palm of merrilys hand its symbolism fully apparent the night before good friday was the night of the last supper this is my body merrily looked down at the tiny full moon two of them in fact both consecrated mustve fallen off the communion plate last sunday morning and shed found them when shed come in at night for the meditation slipped them into her back pocket and forgotten about them one still intact she guessed because it had lodged near a seam must have fallen out of her pocket when shed sat down on the stone over the well the other was already in pieces she looked towards the church porch directly across from the well and recalled the sorrowful shadow over the door on the inside the weary defeated jesus drained and desiccated in the act of dying fading into the wall and into history and soon the way things were going out of history and into myth and legend sooner than anyone would have imagined least of all mother julian who in some way had experienced the reality an anchoress a solitary not part of a religious community they spent their lives in prayer and contemplation in a particular place which was felt to be blessed by their presence there the way the atmosphere of an area could be darkened by the shadows of violence merrily held up the intact communion wafer until it covered the moon so that it looked like the fan of whitegold rays were spraying from the wafer like when a place gets into disaster mode expecting the worst all the time the worst just seems to go on happening unless you step in with an act of sacrifice jane whod been known to venerate the moon as mother goddess how seriously merrily was still unsure but it was a very different concept from julians mother god who in an odd way was more like syd spicers god the sas commander in the field on firstname terms with his team your best mate none of that sir crap no salutes in the same way back in the days when god was seen as a touchy tyrant with a pile of plagues and thunderbolts at his elbow julian had sensed only a source of infinite kindness and patience and politeness without which shed insisted it would be impossible for this flawed world to exist merrily closed her fingers on the wafer it felt warm she had the surreal thought that here in a place whose sanctity predated both christianity and mithraism there could be some act of fusion between the wafer and the moon it was cold now her trainers crunching on frost as she went back over the stile and across the field to the car where she took off annies coat and laid it on the back seat she stashed syds books lols map and the compass from the glove compartment in her bag checked her manicure case for nail scissors and went back to the churchyard and now it was very cold in the swivelling seat of the old jcb gomer lit up a ciggy and then was still looking across at barry like an old toy dog with glass eyes barry took a breath held it for several seconds they listened there was no sound from inside the hut remember the steps lol said and afterwards gomer leave your lights on fullbeam but dont get out danny see he dont get out barry moved back ok off you go lol clocked dannys worried eyes over the beard gave him a tight nod and slammed the cab door as the big shovel wobbled the cig came spinning out of the window the engine noise changed into a minorkey growl back off till its done barry told him therell be flying splinters but the hinges were weaker than the doors the shovel nearly as wide as the doors just punched them off the side walls and they collapsed into the void job done lol crouching an arm thrown across his face turned for guidance to barry but barry had already gone lol saw him flattened against the wall at the entrance to the nissen hut as the jcb roared and trembled massively in the entrance like some wounded charging animal barry made a backwards turning motion with his fingers and gomer switched off the engine but left the lights on danny had his window down leaning out yelling body barry said dead or alive dunno blood everywhere barry shouted into the hut out now please everybody slowly a patch of silence and then one small voice gomer jesus lols feet threw him forward stumbling for the doorway whispering jesus jesus jesus barry grabbed his shoulder spun him round and away its jane lol stumbled round the diggers caterpillar tracks to dannys door under the open window danny it best for jane boy if we dont get killed if this thing goes down them steps gomer was saying and theres anybody in the way lol saw barry emerge on the other side of the digger staying out of the lights his back to the inside wall of the hut a single sharp crack and its rapid echo and the headlight on gomers side had gone out and barrys urgent hiss came out of darkness geddown everybody down lol slid onto hands and knees between the digger and the remains of one of the doors couldnt just do nothing he began creeping slowly forward ahead of him a meagre ochre glow like a nursery night light wrapped in dusty muslin a moment of waxy silence and then a long torn cry and that had to be jane and lol was back on his feet squeezing past the jcb clambering up the broken wooden door then he stopped a man about his own height was facing him knees slightly bent arms extended like short girders in front of his face a spatter of impressions coming at lol questions answered almost as soon as they were formed like whats that between his hands why are the hands wearing red gloves he was halfway along the big wooden door now and the door was hanging half over the steps seesawing legs apart battling for balance he was going up and down and the mans extended arms were tracking his movements and the mans blank eyes inside a red mask found his for an instant and barry was screaming at him down lie the fuck down and then something hit lol and he did go down and while he was falling the arms of the man his face glistening scarlet swung round away from him and lol registered barrys silhouette in rapid motion and a twitch from the mans hands then a small gasjet flash and the sound of a single massive handclap the shots echo died lol turned sideways his cheek against the wood he saw barrys face twisting back barry sinking to his knees a red halo misting around his head oh oh for gods sake this was danny thomass voice from inside the jcb all fractured as barrys heavy body toppled back across the shovels blade part seven good friday they did not lose themselves as did the other sects in contemplative mysticism for them the good dwelt in action franz cumont the mysteries of mithra the perfect soldier of mithras nonattached passionless disciplined inured to hardship sleeping for whole months on the frozen snow and hard earth ambitious cruel and ruthless but possessed of immense personal courage esme wynne tyson mithras the fellow in the cap nothing can be what it was but through the drifting mist of loss you hope to find a home lol robinson tanworthinarden no fuss uncle ted would say call it off but then uncle ted had been against it from the start the whole idea of dumping evensong and replacing it with this swami stuff uncle ted was probably also suspicious of mother julian a woman with a mans name and torrid crucifixion fantasies but hed said nothing about that anyway it was going on although a standin had been arranged for todays early services merrily striving for normality was up while the early sun was still struggling in twisted ropes of cloud and the village was as silent as an empty film set standing in her dressing gown at the scullery window with revelations of divine love open on the desk and ethel curled between her feet watching a fox slide off home the way lol had half an hour ago while it was still dark another neurotic damselfly episode dont have long to decide before something makes the decision for you and that may not be the one you hope for not now athena the julian meditation would begin at two and jane would be there and lol where merrily could see them and she would do her best better than she had last night in the moonwashed churchyard at brinsop while less than a mile away jane her daughter eighteen was watching men being killed she gripped the window sill until her fingers hurt jane had gone finally to her attic about four hours ago and if eirion was up there too instead of in the guest room that would be no bad thing when they had finally got home theyd found him asleep in his car on the square and for the first time jane had wept catharsis well it was a start even as a child jane had never been a weeper merrily watched the fox a familiar visitor creeping away between the church wall and the shed and no she wasnt naive she wasnt expecting a warm radiance rising in the nave as they all welcomed easter after tomorrow nights vigil beatific smiles villagers embracing one another that was lark rise to candleford this was ledwardine on the border jane had already been offered professional counselling and merrily had said it wouldnt be a sign of weakness flower these people and jane stonefaced had cut her off you are kidding right the new jacket jane had worn for the first time on her day out with charles cornel had been put out for the wash and was destined for the oxfam shop this was all going to take time lots of it but compared with any one of several things that might have happened last night to close your whole life down time weeks months years didnt matter at all midmorning annie howe came to the vicarage door alone her grey trench coat streaked with red mud and wrinkled as if shed slept in it although her eyes didnt look as if shed slept at all some things i need to go over again annie said with jane im sorry about this she doesnt make things up merrily said irrationally she just sometimes sees them from a different place i wont keep her long this is not official so much that annie howe had done and said since yesterday evening that was not official blindingly uncharacteristically not official one day there might be an explanation unconnected with the full moon is frannie bliss merrily waited kettle in hand a sunbeam from the highest window was pale and coffinshaped the chief constables on his way over have his picture taken going into the hospital hold a press conference two results in one night well worth interrupting his holiday weekend for so frannie his voice is very slurred hes lost two teeth his nose is broken and they think there may be brainstem damage oh god whats that mean doesnt mean hell be a cabbage but functions like balance could be impaired speech eyesight coordination it will all improve with time they say but bliss isnt noted for his patience he annie howes smile was swift and crooked he says that if the chief shows up at his bedside hell strangle the ah twat with the nearest drip tube or i may have misoh annie glanced at the door jane had come in hair unbrushed tied back she had a deep scratch all down one cheek at the refectory table her sugary tea going cold she described again what had happened when the managing director of hardkit had cut a young mans throat all my fault jane said that twice gently for her annie howe said all you did was throw something which distracted cornel before he could he might not have might not have shot mostyn i think he just wanted to see him crawl jane nobody carries a loaded firearm you werent there jane said merrily flinched because jane had been there and lol had been there and so had gomer parry wielding a digger like heavy artillery at the age of whatever age gomer was while she had been faffing about in a churchyard cutting up a communion wafer with nail scissors trying to alter the spiritual balance just one slippage of a gear one shift in the pattern of events one stalling of momentum in that hellhole last night and she could be burying jane raking out the last cold ash in lols wood stove she was worthless a sham failing to see what she should have seen being someone who people didnt want to worry because she was too busy unscrambling the thought processes of a man who was dead and hadnt wanted her to know about it anyway she wanted a cigarette he kept asking me to come out jane said mostyn he said it was ok cornel had just tripped and fallen and hurt his head and they needed to call an ambulance and what did you say annie asked i didnt say anything i knew he was just trying to find out where i was i went down on hands and knees again i thought even if he finds out where i am he cant come in after me its too narrow but he can he can climb up and look down on me and just shoot me i was just lying on the floor and covering my head with my hands for all the use that wouldve been what happened next there was this you know the noise of a big engine outside the doors like a jcb that was what you actually thought i know what a jcb sounds like and then both doors just came in with this massive crash and thats when i stood up and i saw gomer straight away and lol and jane smiled feebly it was like the best moment of my entire life for about two seconds the smile turning wintry before it was the worst when did you first see mr bloom barry i heard him first he was calling to everybody telling them to keep down and then i saw lol i was like going insane because kenny mostyn i saw him standing up with the gun levelled and i could see he was pointing the gun at lol and i just lost it i started climbing over the top of the concrete bench and the next thing i saw was barry just falling back and half his face was all right in your first statement you said you saw another man where lol robinson had been standing had he been there all the time i dont know lol was like standing on one of the doors that gomer had smashed in and this guy just he just came out of nowhere and rammed lol out of the way all in dark clothes and this balaclava with just a slit for the eyes what did mostyn do ive told you all this once tell me again nothing he did nothing he had the gun by his side just standing with his legs apart kind of relaxed and the gun by his side as if he knew the man saw him as an ally rather than an adversary yeah merrily could see it all in her head the balaclava to hide the giveaway white hair and the cold intent in his blue eyes how sure were they that this was byron jones annie sipped her tea casual unofficial what happened next i didnt see exactly i was looking for lol the next thing i saw kenny didnt have the gun any more the other guy did id been looking straight into the jcb lights so when i turned round i couldnt see properly no one else had seen it merrily knew that not lol nor gomer nor danny barry had told them all to get down before annie said youre sure there wasnt more than one gun pretty sure what happened next jane is something we need to be absolutely sure about because only you every time i close my eyes im still seeing it he was standing behind kenny then it was like pieces of kennys head came flying out and his knees were like buckled and he just you know like they say someone was dead before he hit the ground thats how it was how many shots two and then this other guy slipped the gun in his jacket pocket and walked out he stopped for a moment and bent over barry and then he turned away and he was gone he was just like no fuss you know he just did what he did and walked out like the way im telling it it must sound like it took ages but it was just barely seconds he was so sure of what he was doing like he didnt have to think no struggle for the gun or anything like that im sorry to keep going over these points but its impor i keep telling you jane said eyes wide kenny mostyn wasnt expecting it there was no struggle it was like an execution they left jane in the kitchen annie howe stood at the door in the hall next to holman hunts light of the world they ah theyre still trying to save barry blooms right eye theyre not hopeful made a mess of one side of his face but the bullet didnt enter his brain at that range he was i suppose very lucky lucky merrily said dully the worst could have happened and it hadnt not quite i annie took her hand off the doorknob im not sure why jane feels in some way responsible i dont know her particularly well but it seems slightly odd we can still arrange some professional counselling sometimes it helps to unload it all on a stranger ill ask her again but im not optimistic but then again annie said i suspect you might have an idea why she blames herself is there something i should know if i tell you youll wish i hadnt ill chance it she seems to feel she was the instrument which brought all this together if she hadnt become obsessed with tying savitch into cockfighting which led ah yes annie howe raised a hand just so you know in a storeroom behind one of mostyns shops we found a consignment of what you might call cockfight giftsets leather cases containing a selection of polished spurs brand new originally prized apparently by cockers in the travelling community now finding a new market it seems so that links mostyn to it theres also the established fact that victoria buckland the woman charged in connection with the marinescu murders used to work for mostyn when he was running canoeing and mountaineering courses for young people bucklands believed to have been organizing periodic cockfights at the plascarreg hilton for a couple of years itll all come out at some stage and savitch savitch is now attached like a siamese twin to his london solicitor he denies all knowledge of mithraism cockfighting badgerbaiting or any other illegal country pursuits appalled to discover the truth about mostyn who was contracted purely as an instructor and a supplier of equipment horrified that some of his own clients were into these foul practices hanging it on the dead dont they always so jane jane thinks that if she hadnt pursued cornel with a view to nailing savitch they would never have wound up in the mithraeum and yet cornel went tooled up hed lost his job hed been humiliated he was at the end of his rope he went prepared to kill somebody and mostyns the most likely candidate from janes version of what was said it seems likely that cornel was hoping mostyn would appear he certainly seems to have believed hed get away with it yes but what about jane jane wouldve seen everything you might want to think in retrospect annie said that the heavy object jane threw down might in the end have saved her life now what were you going to tell me jane had said that instinctively she hadnt liked the face she hadnt even known then whose face it was supposed to represent shed said that raising up the rounded shard of concrete she must have had her fingers in its supercilious eyes below the remains of its cap jane had picked up an image of mithras and taken him with her away from cornel the kind of stupid detail that lodged in your mind and inflated itself into a crazy significance annie maybe you could tell me something first why were you asking jane if there was a struggle for the gun between mostyn and the man you think was byron why didnt you want it to be an execution its not that simple annie thought for a few moments all right but not here slasher she climbed into annies audi on the edge of the square the shops had opened into gold bars of welcome sunlight and even more welcome easter tourists lol was walking up church street from the river with jane and eirion merrily felt momentarily disconnected as if this might be a mercydream softening the truth dead lol lying across from dead barry on a mortuary trolley jane awakening stiff and raw to the memory of a night in the rape suite athena white was right it must not go on much longer do you hear me annie parked the audi at the bottom of old barn lane half on the grass verge her mood was hard to read so youre saying savitch is in the clear merrily said you studied law tell me what hes done wrong what about sollers bull annie howe stared uninterested at conical cole hill straight ahead and looking almost volcanic wreathed in smokering clouds the last thing certain prominent people want is for sollers to go down id have to number my father amongst them whats it got to do with charlie rang this morning confiding that lord walford that respected exchairman of the police authority was concerned about my astonishing behaviour towards his soninlaw never mind that sollers is notoriously unfaithful to walfords daughter hes one of us i really cant see what your problem is anne my father says its open and shut with the emphasis on shut shut as in merrily twisted in her seat annie this is the murder of mansel bull who also surely was very much one of us its shut as in case closed as good as remember hanging it on the dead two knife killings two slasher killings within a few rural miles how could there not be a connection mostyns an sasfantasist who runs hardcore adventure courses for men who want more risk in their lives has obscure religious beliefs and likes to hang out with heman celebs like smiffy gill his love of violence is implicit walking timebomb annie howe glared angrily at the dash what if he has an alibi merrily said what if theres someone who knows he couldnt have been at oldcastle at the time he was with jones who told us that jones did jones who shot mostyn dead and is still out there somewhere we even have a possible motive seems mansel bull persistently refused to allow mostyn and his clients to use his land for rough shooting prompting a number of angry exchanges mostyn seemed very frustrated about that where did that one come from sollers bull youre not serious who phoned someone over my head to remind them why didnt he mention it to bliss well of course he mentioned it doesnt bliss remember you see are we looking for anyone else why would we what about the london clients i told you how long it would take to track them down how costly and why would we need to london bankers and financiers worshipping some ancient roman god of war oh please this is i know what it is im sorry i really am no fun am i famous for it severe pofaced straitlaced entirely without imagination and destined to walk on eggshells for the rest of my indifferent career because because of my father merrily couldnt summon any kind of smile so mostyn killed mansel bull mostyn killed everybody except himself mostyn is derek bird and raoul moat and the hungerford man and the dunblane man and just as dead as all of them but byron knows the truth wherever he is his bungalows empty he hasnt been officially seen since he walked out of gaol street were searching what are your feelings about this whole mess what would you imagine annie howe said sick to my stomach and determined to preserve my increasingly contemptible career for as long as it takes to nail sollers bull and i was never here and we never had this conversation christ always died on the cross at three pm british summer time just over an hour to set things up for the julian meditation the rev martin longbeach whod been hauled in to take over the routine services had left around noon refusing lunch at the vicarage not the time hed said patting merrily on the arm then they closed the gift shop in the vestry and pulled the moveable pews into a circle below the rood screen for however many other parishioners had decided to tough it out with mother julian the beeswax candle on the altar flared under the zippo and merrily felt its heat and that gentle sense of handmaiden she knelt for a moment last night shed felt on two occasions that another woman was with her in brinsop churchyard stepping lightly between the gravestones but for the horror of what had followed those memories of brinsop might have retained a slightly baffling glow and a smudge of guilt it had seemed a bit silly at first using lols map which hed left in the car and the compass to determine the rough positions of the four most convincing leys passing through the church but once you identified them you could almost see them unravelling across the mooncreamed fields channels for prayer pagan prayer doubtless when if the leys had been created back in the bronze age or earlier and yet merrily had felt that mother julian would have approved things were different in the middle ages the christian church had no problems with magic shed heard janes voice youre playing with the big forces here quartering the communion wafer with her nail scissors shed placed a segment on what shed perceived as each of the leys around the edge of the churchyard the prayers had been for serenity merrily supposed restoration of balance and the god had been julians god without whose warmth and gentility the human race would never have survived mother god and the energy had come unequivocally from the full moon mother goddess a female thing up yours mithras shed walked away feeling the terrifying rightness of it thinking that when things were calmer shed have to tell jane what shed done felt obliged and there was something else for jane when shed rung neil cooper as promised to tell him about the possibility of mithraic remains at brinsop he already knew the police had asked for someone to come along when they excavated the temple and surrounds to see what was there merrily had also told neil about jane and university why jane was reluctant to go and thereby miss the excavation of colemans meadow neil said hed talk to the guys hired for the dig to see if they could use somebody to make the tea and stuff probably not a gap year but maybe a gap six months on peanuts pay earlier today jane had been palely determined i will go to university ill work like hell get the grades and go as far away from here as i can im no good for this place im a bloody liability like that shed come round resurrection of christ resurrection of ledwardine resurrection of jane at key moments in the julian meditation merrily would hold in her head an image of the crucifixion stain on the wall of brinsop church if it all fell flat and shed know then last night had been the first signs of a dangerous eccentricity and it might be time to think about getting out of the job the vestry door was ajar the way it was never left any more the smell of mud and sweat came to her merrily froze the voice at her shoulder was not a voice you wanted to hear alone in the dimness a few minutes of your time please mrs watson the toxic dilemma the energysaving bulbs in the vestry sputtered in nervous dawnlike tints as he shut the door lock it he said he wore a black woollen hat hiking gear a pack too lightweight to be a bergen just another longdistance walker although the sweat suggested hed been running and the mud spatters suggested it hadnt been along established footpaths across the room from which there was no easy escape merrily didnt move on one side of her a table with prayer books on the other a carousel of beautiful ledwardine postcards above her a window that didnt open he said just do it please byron keeping her eyes on him her voice low dont take this the wrong way but id really rather not be in a locked room with you he smiled revealing all the black lines in his teeth want your help thats all i really dont think so perhaps she should have been afraid but she was just annoyed about everything he didnt seem to notice do you know what power of attorney means i do actually studied law for a year before life took over he reached into an inside pocket lifting out a long buff envelope i want to give you power of attorney over what disposal of my property which is not inconsiderable these days all the land all the buildings the bungalow all paid for also a small apartment in hereford surprising how much money you can make in a short time isnt it i wouldnt know im a vicar he didnt smile if i appeared irritated with you back at the cop shop it was only because i could see you catching on picking up on too many things joining too many ends but then your religion and mine do have a lot in common not really byron ritual murder might be a point of contention he didnt seem to hear of course youre also part of the problem women priests and guys like that nancy who was filling in for you today but i did come away admiring you the way you put your finger on the worm in the apple now he extracted the contents of the envelope i had this done some while back ive always been tidy that way had a bloke in mind to expedite things but we fell out go on read it merrily moved to pick up the paper never taking her gaze off him and backed off with it this general power of attorney is made this day of by colin jones of the compound brinsop herefordshire i appoint merrily watkins of the vicarage ledwardine herefordshire to be my attorney in accordance with section of the powers of attorney act in witness whereof i have hereunto set my hand the day and year first before written signed as a deed and delivered by the said colin jones in the presence of this authorizes you to act in my name sell all the property and see that the proceeds are distributed fiftyfifty to the people i shall name to you she said ludicrously you got my name right i always knew your name legal stuff you dont make mistakes im going away mrs w and wish to dispose of my property meaningfully i shot a man as you know yes be pictures of the compound in all the rags tv the net truth is it was as good as over when they killed farmer bull bloody kenny what a mistake he was because he wasnt a soldier because he had no discipline kenny was the worm in the apple hanging out with that clown from the octane show appearing on promotional videos fame and fortune that was never what this was about but kenny didnt kill farmer bull or he let it happen he was doing stuff on his own taking men through the degrees stuff i didnt know about at first when you take a civilian through the degrees you think itll change them nah not in the right way it changed you she was thinking some men win at snooker and some at poker too he sat on the edge of the table i was responsible you accept that then you take action mithras doesnt forgive couldnt exactly fire mostyn when he owned half the company better there was an accident not here somewhere remote beacons maybe just biding my time another mistake unless you take immediate action he pushed the form towards her his fingers touched hers briefly she looked up into his lined face part of him was watching her impassive beyond stimulation she felt that another part of him was already going away something receding i still dont understand why me dont have many choices i believe you wont doubledeal and you know the people concerned it needs another signature a witness someone here you can trust preferably not your boyfriend whose life he might have saved he just might byron there are several people i can trust none of whom im prepared to expose to a man who i have every reason to think may have a gun with him he grinned turned his back on her when he turned around again it lay across the palm of his big leathery hand the glock he placed it carefully on the table pushed it towards merrily i may ask for it back before i leave she didnt touch it they both knew she could pick it up point it at him and call the police always assuming it was loaded and somehow she thought it would be byron placed the pistol in the centre of the table took a stack of prayer books from the pile and arranged them around the glock on four sides finally placing one on top you got a phone on you yes phone for a witness merrily pulled her mobile from her jeans then put it down on the table can i ask you a question long as youre not playing for time so your congregation turns up i wouldnt expose a congregation to this we have about forty minutes go on when you tried to pass your religion off as just a series of exercises a discipline was that just for lockley and howe or do you believe that youve just reminded me why i found you so annoying he stood up its a secular age it doesnt matter what you believe its how you sell it you have to use acceptable terminology nobody likes a crank certainly not the men i deal with i dont think youre that cynical whos your proposed witness gomer parry sensible choice couldve wrecked my digger last night but he didnt he would never wreck a digger you know him of him make your call keep it casual and he comes alone if an armed response unit arrives ill just bite the barrel you dont want that in here god and therell be no money for fiona she stared at him fiona spicer make your call and ill be listening for nuances merrily put in the number and waited it was surreal be easier if she could feel an accessible evil the night stench in the tower room the squirming male miasma assailing jane in the mithraeum which jane had talked about only once when they were alone staring blankly into the fireplace disconnected as if she was repeating someone elses story jane whose knowledge of mithraism had been virtually nonexistent then gomer parry plant hire oh sorry gomer its me you got a few minutes to spare over at the church sure to vicar thank you ill be in the vestry simple as that when the line cleared byron was nodding merrily put the phone on the table next to the stack of prayer books you really think fionas going to accept anything from you he blinked just once she can give it to her daughter or a charity of her choosing i liked syd you could only quarrel on that level of intensity with someone who was a brother and fiona what was your quarrel with her he looked at merrily for a long time his face blank then he transferred his gaze to the wall behind her she tensed in horror mithras always looks away but then he turned back to her his blue eyes steady i take full responsibility for everything ive done no papering over cracks no sentiment here no apology i dont do that was that why you left liz because you realized the elements you were dealing with were unsuited to a domestic situation ill confirm that much i had respect for my wife thats why you were so very publicly screwing your way around hereford and when mostyn killed the banker cornel did he do that on his own you know what im asking dont you i understand he turned his head away when he did it do you think he was entirely responsible then for his own youre back to the same question im not a cop these things matter to me confronting the impossibility of her own job the toxic dilemma shed tried to evoke for the students in the chapel to what extent you want to demonize this is up to you byron shook his head nah no he wasnt entirely responsible no hed surrendered his hows barry hell lose an eye they think but hell live thats what it said on the radio so i believe that was regrettable byron looked mildly affected he was a good soldier shot unarmed by a man who wasnt fit to clean his boots im taking responsibility hell be the second beneficiary fiona barry see to that would you might be enough for a down payment on a big old pub if there happened to be one on the market youve thought it all out havent you no sentiment no apology we take action then we walk away how will you live thats my business all right merrily shook herself tell me one more thing when syd died on credenhill you were there werent you he thought for just a moment yes what was that about no comment you mustve been worried when you heard he was coming back as chaplain i never worry she heard the squeak of the church doors there was no time there had to be time as far as i could see byron there were two ways of looking at this at syd coming back and one would be an opportunity the chaplains the only direct feed into the spiritual life of the regiment if there was anything left of mithras in syd if he was to any extent in denial you might still see an old ambition realized that john the baptist side of you he shrugged did you ask to meet him on credenhill just two recreational runners paths crossing or did he ask you does it matter not really all im feeling very strongly is that if you wanted to know where his innermost allegiances lay there was only one thing you could say to him only one thing you could tell him as a test youd tell him she put both hands on the table leaned forward smelling the sweat and the mud and nothing else when and where and and how youd had sex with his wife right his eyes closed briefly in his weathered sandstone face and she half expected him to smash the pile of prayer books to the ground a tapping on the door vicar one minute gomer she looked into byrons eyes hissed you knew exactly what kind of interior eruption that would cause this savage inner conflict between the soldier who wanted to beat you to a pulp and throw you down the fucking steps and the christian who and now well never know i think we do let mr parry in byron said merrily turned away from him nodded now she could smell it revelations when she got back to the vicarage nobody was home but ethel the phone was ringing shed have to be back in church in less than half an hour shed agreed to give byron jones ten minutes to walk away like just another easter hiker before she called the police she picked up the phone it was dick willis minister in charge of the credenhill cluster i do rather wish youd given me a hint of this merrily there was no anger in his voice might evenve been able to help you dick it all moved too and was still moving gomer had known as soon as he saw the name on the document shed told him it was all right byron had stood in the farthest corner of the room looking as unthreatening as a man like byron could ever look no fear in gomer only concern shed firmly squeezed his hand and said it was ok ok dont suppose theyve got him yet dick willis said not as far as i know frightening dick said merrily look im sitting here on a chancel pew waiting to take a service and i i think id rather go into it with a clean conscience especially on good friday when i told you that colin jones hadnt been in brinsop church during a service that was a blatant and unforgivable lie he came once memorably though i wasnt there when was this the ten minutes were up she should be ringing annie howe and if she was late for the service gomer parry whod signed on the dotted line and then walked out with her and a murderer and rapist would start raising hell about a year ago dick willis said i was approached by colin jones and asked if he and some other army colleagues might borrow st georges for an evening service he offered what i can only describe as a remarkably generous donation towards the maintenance of the church remarkably generous what kind of service he didnt explain in detail he just called it a service of thanksgiving which could mean anything as you know i presumed some of the chaps had come through a fairly dicey situation abroad and it was something they couldnt talk about i put it to the churchwarden and also ran it past the bishops office no objections sas you know mmm they also said theyd be bringing their own minister a chap called if i remember correctly adrian barclay turned up id never seen him before said he was from london and then it was made clear that i was not required in any capacity then the congregation arrived in their cars all men about twenty of them how long were they in there couple of hours when the churchwarden thought hed better check that everything was all right he found the door locked from the inside we never found out what that service was about and you know some of the chaps in that congregation most of them didnt look like sas men at all you can tell a regiment man somehow seldom huge muscular chaps but theres a look somehow but you kept quiet for the erm for the money merrily you know how things are what i did do afterwards was to check on the reverend barclay rang the church he said he was from which church was it st stephen walbrook in london the minister there said theyd never had an adrian barclay there but when i described him tall shavenheaded chap in his early forties he fitted the description of a curate whod lasted six months before he was asked to leave wouldnt explain why curious wouldnt you say but you didnt ask any questions locally it didnt seem appropriate dick willis said locally merrily phoned gaol street asked for annie howe not available she spoke to dc vaynor and explained briefly she said shed last seen colin jones walking from the square into the alley which led to a stile which led to a footpath into the remains of the old powell orchard what happened now would be an exercise for byron a discipline dc vaynor told her not on any account to go anywhere but she told him she had to be in church in twentyfive minutes and could not be disturbed not for anything she changed quickly into a black skirt black cashmere jumper pectoral cross then sat down and googled st stephen walbrook never been but shed heard of it there was a colour photo of an angular city church with a campanile built by sir christopher wren it said to replace one destroyed in the great fire of london the first recorded church on the site near the river walbrook now underground had dated back to the seventh century according to wikipedia the banks of the river walbrook had yielded spectacular roman remains the best known of which was an impressively wellpreserved monument now moved to temple court from its original site and open for public viewing the london mithraeum its original site apparently had been close to the foundations of the bank of england merrily switched off the computer as if it was about to explode she couldnt think about any of this until after the meditation or easter the vestry was locked now but she didnt know whether the pistol remained at the centre of the pile of prayer books she looked up at a movement in the window saw lol coming past towards the back door in an actual jacket flitting in and out of one anothers energy fields she felt warmth relief guilt a touch of shame folding the power of attorney document and sliding it inside her copy of revelations of divine love
