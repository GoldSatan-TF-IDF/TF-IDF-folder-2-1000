a wasted day when its turn came the private secretary somewhat apologetically laid the letter in front of the wisest man in wall street from mrs austin probation officer court of general sessions he explained wants a letter about spear hes been convicted of theft comes up for sentence tuesday spear repeated arnold thorndike young fellow stenographer used to do your letters last summer going in and out on the train the great man nodded i remember what about him the habitual gloom of the private secretary was lightened by a grin went on the loose had with him about five hundred dollars belonging to the firm hes with isaacs sons now shoe people on sixth avenue met a woman and woke up without the money the next morning he offered to make good but isaacs called in a policeman when they looked into it they found the boy had been drunk they tried to withdraw the charge but hed been committed now the probation officer is trying to get the judge to suspend sentence a letter from you sir would it was evident the mind of the great man was elsewhere young men who drunk or sober spent the firms money on women who disappeared before sunrise did not appeal to him another letter submitted that morning had come from his art agent in europe in florence he had discovered the correggio he had been sent to find it was undoubtedly genuine and he asked to be instructed by cable the price was forty thousand dollars with one eye closed and the other keenly regarding the inkstand mr thorndike decided to pay the price and with the facility of long practice dismissed the correggio and snapped his mind back to the present spear had a letter from us when he left didnt he he asked what he has developed into since he left us he shrugged his shoulders the secretary withdrew the letter and slipped another in its place homer firth the landscape man he chanted wants permission to use blue flint on the new road with turf gutters and to plant silver firs each side says it will run to about five thousand dollars a mile no protested the great man firmly blue flint makes a country place look like a cemetery mine looks too much like a cemetery now landscape gardeners he exclaimed impatiently their only idea is to insult nature the place was better the day i bought it when it was running wild you could pick flowers all the way to the gates pleased that it should have recurred to him the great man smiled why spear he exclaimed always took in a bunch of them for his mother dont you remember we used to see him before breakfast wandering around the grounds picking flowers mr thorndike nodded briskly i like his taking flowers to his mother he said it was to his mother suggested the secretary gloomily well he picked the flowers anyway laughed mr thorndike he didnt pick our pockets and he had the run of the house in those days as far as we know he dictated he was satisfactory dont say more than that the secretary scribbled a mark with his pencil and the landscape man tell him commanded thorndike i want a wood road suitable to a farm and to let the trees grow where god planted them as his car slid downtown on tuesday morning the mind of arnold thorndike was occupied with such details of daily routine as the purchase of a railroad the japanese loan the new wing to his art gallery and an attack that morning in his own newspaper upon his pet trust but his busy mind was not too occupied to return the salutes of the traffic policemen who cleared the way for him or by some genius of memory to recall the fact that it was on this morning young spear was to be sentenced for theft it was a charming morning the spring was at full tide and the air was sweet and clean mr thorndike considered whimsically that to send a man to jail with the memory of such a morning clinging to him was adding a year to his sentence he regretted he had not given the probation officer a stronger letter he remembered the young man now and favorably a shy silent youth deft in work and at other times conscious and embarrassed but that on the part of a stenographer in the presence of the wisest man in wall street was not unnatural on occasions mr thorndike had put even royalty frayed impecunious royalty on the lookout for a loan at its ease the hood of the car was down and the taste of the air warmed by the sun was grateful it was at this time a year before that young spear picked the spring flowers to take to his mother a year from now where would young spear be it was characteristic of the great man to act quickly so quickly that his friends declared he was a slave to impulse it was these same impulses leading so invariably to success that made his enemies call him the wisest man he leaned forward and touched the chauffeurs shoulder stop at the court of general sessions he commanded what he proposed to do would take but a few minutes a word a personal word from him to the district attorney or the judge would be enough he recalled that a sunday special had once calculated that the working time of arnold thorndike brought him in two hundred dollars a minute at that rate keeping spear out of prison would cost a thousand dollars out of the sunshine mr thorndike stepped into the gloom of an echoing rotunda shut in on every side hung by balconies lit many stories overhead by a dirty skylight the place was damp the air acrid with the smell of stale tobacco juice and foul with the presence of many unwashed humans a policeman chewing stolidly nodded toward an elevator shaft and other policemen nodded him further on to the office of the district attorney there arnold thorndike breathed more freely he was again among his own people he could not help but appreciate the dramatic qualities of the situation that the richest man in wall street should appear in person to plead for a humble and weaker brother he knew he could not escape recognition his face was too well known but he trusted for the sake of spear the reporters would make no display of his visit with a deprecatory laugh he explained why he had come but the outburst of approbation he had anticipated did not follow the district attorney ran his finger briskly down a printed card henry spear he exclaimed thats your man part three judge fallon andrews is in that court he walked to the door of his private office andrews he called he introduced an alert broadshouldered young man of years of much indiscretion and with a charming and inconsequent manner mr thorndike is interested in henry spear coming up for sentence in part three this morning wants to speak for him take him over with you the district attorney shook hands quickly and retreated to his private office mr andrews took out a cigarette and as he crossed the floor lit it come with me he commanded somewhat puzzled slightly annoyed but enjoying withal the novelty of the environment and the curtness of his reception mr thorndike followed he decided that in his ignorance he had wasted his own time and that of the prosecuting attorney he should at once have sent in his card to the judge as he understood it mr andrews was now conducting him to that dignitary and in a moment he would be free to return to his own affairs which were the affairs of two continents but mr andrews led him to an office bare and small and offered him a chair and handed him a morning newspaper there were people waiting in the room strange people only like those mr thorndike had seen on ferryboats they leaned forward toward young mr andrews fawning their eyes wide with apprehension mr thorndike refused the newspaper i thought i was going to see the judge he suggested court doesnt open for a few minutes yet said the assistant district attorney judge is always late anyway mr thorndike suppressed an exclamation he wanted to protest but his clear mind showed him that there was nothing against which with reason he could protest he could not complain because these people were not apparently aware of the sacrifice he was making he had come among them to perform a kindly act he recognized that he must not stultify it by a show of irritation he had precipitated himself into a game of which he did not know the rules that was all next time he would know better next time he would send a clerk but he was not without a sense of humor and the situation as it now was forced upon him struck him as amusing he laughed goodnaturedly and reached for the desk telephone may i use this he asked he spoke to the wall street office he explained he would be a few minutes late he directed what should be done if the market opened in a certain way he gave rapid orders on many different matters asked to have read to him a cablegram he expected from petersburg and one from vienna they answer each other was his final instruction it looks like peace mr andrews with genial patience had remained silent now he turned upon his visitors a levantine burly unshaven and soiled towered truculently above him young mr andrews with his swivel chair tilted back his hands clasped behind his head his cigarette hanging from his lips regarded the man dispassionately you gotta hell of a nerve to come to see me he commented cheerfully to mr thorndike the form of greeting was novel so greatly did it differ from the procedure of his own office that he listened with interest was it you demanded young andrews in a puzzled tone or your brother who tried to knife me mr thorndike unaccustomed to cross the pavement to his office unless escorted by bank messengers and plainclothes men felt the room growing rapidly smaller the figure of the truculent greek loomed to heroic proportions the hand of the banker went vaguely to his chin and from there fell to his pearl pin which he hastily covered get out said young andrews and dont show your face here the door slammed upon the flying greek young andrews swung his swivel chair so that over his shoulder he could see mr thorndike i dont like his face he explained a kindly eyed sad woman with a basket on her knee smiled upon andrews with the familiarity of an old acquaintance is that woman going to get a divorce from my son she asked now that hes in trouble now that hes in sing sing corrected mr andrews i hope so she deserves it that son of yours mrs bernard he declared emphatically is no good the brutality shocked mr thorndike for the woman he felt a thrill of sympathy but at once saw that it was superfluous from the secure and lofty heights of motherhood mrs bernard smiled down upon the assistant district attorney as upon a naughty child she did not even deign a protest she continued merely to smile the smile reminded thorndike of the smile on the face of a mother in a painting by murillo he had lately presented to the chapel in the college he had given to his native town that son of yours repeated young andrews is a leech hes robbed you robbed his wife best thing i ever did for you was to send him up the river the mother smiled upon him beseechingly could you give me a pass she said young andrews flung up his hands and appealed to thorndike isnt that just like a mother he protested that son of hers has broken her heart tramped on her cheated her hasnt left her a cent and she comes to me for a pass so she can kiss him through the bars and ill bet shes got a cake for him in that basket the mother laughed happily she knew now she would get the pass mothers explained mr andrews from the depth of his wisdom are all like that your mother my mother if you went to jail your mother would be just like that mr thorndike bowed his head politely he had never considered going to jail or whether if he did his mother would bring him cake in a basket apparently there were many aspects and accidents of life not included in his experience young andrews sprang to his feet and with the force of a hose flushing a gutter swept his soiled visitors into the hall come on he called to the wisest man the court is open in the corridors were many people and with his eyes on the broad shoulders of the assistant district attorney thorndike pushed his way through them the people who blocked his progress were of the class unknown to him their looks were anxious furtive miserable they stood in little groups listening eagerly to a sharpfaced lawyer or in sullen despair eying each other at a door a tipstaff laid his hand roughly on the arm of mr thorndike thats all right joe called young mr andrews hes with me they entered the court and passed down an aisle to a railed enclosure in which were high oak chairs again in his effort to follow mr thorndike was halted but the first tipstaff came to his rescue all right he signalled hes with mr andrews mr andrews pointed to one of the oak chairs you sit there he commanded its reserved for members of the bar but its all right youre with me distinctly annoyed slightly bewildered the banker sank between the arms of a chair he felt he had lost his individuality andrews had become his sponsor because of andrews he was tolerated because andrews had a pull he was permitted to sit as an equal among policecourt lawyers no longer was he arnold thorndike he was merely the man with mr andrews then even andrews abandoned him the judgell be here in a minute now said the assistant district attorney and went inside a railed enclosure in front of the judges bench there he greeted another assistant district attorney whose years were those of even greater indiscretion than the years of mr andrews seated on the rail with their hands in their pockets and their backs turned to mr thorndike they laughed and talked together the subject of their discourse was one mike donlin as he appeared in vaudeville to mr thorndike it was evident that young andrews had entirely forgotten him he arose and touched his sleeve with infinite sarcasm mr thorndike began my engagements are not pressing but a court attendant beat with his palm upon the rail sit down whispered andrews the judge is coming mr thorndike sat down the court attendant droned loudly words mr thorndike could not distinguish there was a rustle of silk and from a door behind him the judge stalked past he was a young man the type of the tammany politician on his shrewd alert irishamerican features was an expression of unnatural gloom with a smile mr thorndike observed that it was as little suited to the countenance of the young judge as was the robe to his shoulders mr thorndike was still smiling when young andrews leaned over the rail stand up he hissed mr thorndike stood up after the court attendant had uttered more unintelligible words every one sat down and the financier again moved hurriedly to the rail i would like to speak to him now before he begins he whispered i cant wait mr andrews stared in amazement the banker had not believed the young man could look so serious speak to him now exclaimed the district attorney youve got to wait till your man comes up if you speak to the judge now the voice of andrews faded away in horror not knowing in what way he had offended but convinced that it was only by the grace of andrews he had escaped a dungeon mr thorndike retreated to his armchair the clock on the wall showed him that already he had given to young spear one hour and a quarter the idea was preposterous no one better than himself knew what his time was really worth in half an hour there was a board meeting later he was to hold a post mortem on a railroad at every moment questions were being asked by telegraph by cable questions that involved the credit of individuals of firms of even the country and the one man who could answer them was risking untold sums only that he might say a good word for an idle apprentice inside the railed enclosure a lawyer was reading a typewritten speech he assured his honor that he must have more time to prepare his case it was one of immense importance the name of a most respectable business house was involved and a sum of no less than nine hundred dollars nine hundred dollars the contrast struck mr thorndikes sense of humor full in the centre unknowingly he laughed and found himself as conspicuous as though he had appeared suddenly in his nightclothes the tipstaffs beat upon the rail the lawyer he had interrupted uttered an indignant exclamation andrews came hurriedly toward him and the young judge slowly turned his head those persons he said who cannot respect the dignity of this court will leave it as he spoke with his eyes fixed on those of mr thorndike the latter saw that the young judge had suddenly recognized him but the fact of his identity did not cause the frown to relax or the rebuke to halt unuttered in even icy tones the judge continued and it is well they should remember that the law is no respecter of persons and that the dignity of this court will be enforced no matter who the offender may happen to be andrews slipped into the chair beside mr thorndike and grinned sympathetically sorry he whispered should have warned you we wont be long now he added encouragingly as soon as this fellow finishes his argument the judgell take up the sentences your man seems to have other friends isaacs sons are here and the typewriter firm who taught him but what you say will help most it wont be more than a couple of hours now a couple of hours mr thorndike raged inwardly a couple of hours in this place where he had been publicly humiliated he smiled a thin sharklike smile those who made it their business to study his expressions on seeing it would have fled young andrews not being acquainted with the moods of the great man added cheerfully by one oclock anyway mr thorndike began grimly to pull on his gloves for all he cared now young spear could go hang andrews nudged his elbow see that old lady in the front row he whispered thats mrs spear what did i tell you mothers are all alike shes not taken her eyes off you since court opened she knows youre her one best bet impatiently mr thorndike raised his head he saw a little whitehaired woman who stared at him in her eyes was the same look he had seen in the eyes of men who at times of panic fled to him beseeching entreating forcing upon him what was left of the wreck of their fortunes if only he would save their honor and here come the prisoners andrews whispered see spear third man from the last a long line guarded in front and rear shuffled into the courtroom and as ordered ranged themselves against the wall among them were old men and young boys well dressed cleverlooking rascals collarless tramps fierceeyed aliens smoothshaven thinlipped broadwayards and spear spear his head hanging with lips white and cheeks ashen and his eyes heavy with shame mr thorndike had risen and in farewell was holding out his hand to andrews he turned and across the courtroom the eyes of the financier and the stenographer met at the sight of the great man spear flushed crimson and then his look of despair slowly disappeared and into his eyes there came incredulously hope and gratitude he turned his head suddenly to the wall mr thorndike stood irresolute and then sank back into his chair the first man in the line was already at the railing and the questions put to him by the judge were being repeated to him by the other assistant district attorney and a court attendant his muttered answers were in turn repeated to the judge says hes married naturalized citizen lutheran church diecutter by profession the probation officer her hands filled with papers bustled forward and whispered mrs austin says continued the district attorney shes looked into this case and asks to have the man turned over to her he has a wife and three children has supported them for five years is the wife in court the judge said a thin washedout pretty woman stood up and clasped her hands in front of her has this man been a good husband to you madam asked the young judge the woman broke into vehement assurances no man could have been a better husband would she take him back indeed she would take him back she held out her hands as though she would physically drag her husband from the pillory the judge bowed toward the probation officer and she beckoned the prisoner to her other men followed and in the fortune of each mr thorndike found himself to his surprise taking a personal interest it was as good as a play it reminded him of the sicilians he had seen in london in their little sordid tragedies only these actors were appearing in their proper persons in real dramas of a life he did not know but which appealed to something that had been long untouched long in disuse it was an uncomfortable sensation that left him restless because as he appreciated it needed expression an outlet he found this partially in praising through andrews the young judge who had publicly rebuked him mr thorndike found him astute sane his queries intelligent his comments just and this probation officer she too was capable was she not smiling at his interest in what to him was an old story the younger man nodded i like her looks whispered the great man like her clear eyes and clean skin she strikes me as able full of energy and yet womanly these men when they come under her charge he insisted eagerly need money to start again dont they he spoke anxiously he believed he had found the clew to his restlessness it was a desire to help to be of use to these failures who had fallen and who were being lifted to their feet andrews looked at him curiously anything you give her he answered would be well invested if you will tell me her name and address whispered the banker he was much given to charity but it had been perfunctory it was extended on the advice of his secretary in helping here he felt a genial glow of personal pleasure it was much more satisfactory than giving an old master to his private chapel in the rear of the courtroom there was a scuffle that caused every one to turn and look a man who had tried to force his way past the tipstaffs was being violently ejected and as he disappeared he waved a paper toward mr thorndike the banker recognized him as his chief clerk andrews rose anxiously that man wanted to get to you ill see what it is maybe its important mr thorndike pulled him back maybe it is he said dryly but i cant see him now im busy slowly the long line of derelicts of birds of prey of sorry weak failures passed before the seat of judgment mr thorndike had moved into a chair nearer to the rail and from time to time made a note upon the back of an envelope he had forgotten the time or had chosen to disregard it so great was his interest that he had forgotten the particular derelict he had come to serve until spear stood almost at his elbow thorndike turned eagerly to the judge and saw that he was listening to a rotund gray little man with beady birdlike eyes who as he talked bowed and gesticulated behind him stood a younger man a more modern edition of the other he also bowed and behind gold eyeglasses smiled ingratiatingly the judge nodded and leaning forward for a few moments fixed his eyes upon the prisoner you are a very fortunate young man he said he laid his hand upon a pile of letters when you were your own worst enemy your friends came to help you these letters speak for you your employers whom you robbed have pleaded with me in your favor it is urged in your behalf that at the time you committed the crime of which you are found guilty you were intoxicated in the eyes of the law that is no excuse some men can drink and keep their senses it appears you can not when you drink you are a menace to yourself and as is shown by this crime to the community therefore you must not drink in view of the good character to which your friends have testified and on the condition that you do not touch liquor i will not sentence you to jail but will place you in charge of the probation officer the judge leaned back in his chair and beckoned to mr andrews it was finished spear was free and from different parts of the courtroom people were moving toward the door their numbers showed that the friends of the young man had been many mr thorndike felt a certain twinge of disappointment even though the result relieved and pleased him he wished in bringing it about he had had some part he begrudged to isaacs sons the credit of having given spear his liberty his morning had been wasted he had neglected his own interests and in no way assisted those of spear he was moving out of the railed enclosure when andrews called him by name his honor he said impressively wishes to speak to you the judge leaned over his desk and shook mr thorndike by the hand then he made a speech the speech was about publicspirited citizens who to the neglect of their own interests came to assist the ends of justice and fellowcreatures in misfortune he purposely spoke in a loud voice and every one stopped to listen the law mr thorndike is not vindictive he said it wishes only to be just nor can it be swayed by wealth or political or social influences but when there is good in a man i personally want to know it and when gentlemen like yourself of your standing in this city come here to speak a good word for a man we would stultify the purpose of justice if we did not listen i thank you for coming and i wish more of our citizens were as unselfish and publicspirited it was all quite absurd and most embarrassing but inwardly mr thorndike glowed with pleasure it was a long time since any one had had the audacity to tell him he had done well from the friends of spear there was a ripple of applause which no tipstaff took it upon himself to suppress and to the accompaniment of this mr thorndike walked to the corridor he was pleased with himself and with his fellowmen he shook hands with isaacs sons and congratulated them upon their public spirit and the typewriter firm upon their public spirit and then he saw spear standing apart regarding him doubtfully spear did not offer his hand but mr thorndike took it and shook it and said i want to meet your mother and when mrs spear tried to stop sobbing long enough to tell him how happy she was and how grateful he instead told her what a fine son she had and that he remembered when spear used to carry flowers to town for her and she remembered it too and thanked him for the flowers and he told spear when isaacs sons went bankrupt which at the rate they were giving away their money to the hebrew hospital would be very soon spear must come back to him and isaacs sons were delighted at the great mans pleasantry and afterward repeated it many times calling upon each other to bear witness and spear felt as though some one had given him a new backbone and andrews who was guiding thorndike out of the building was thinking to himself what a great confidence man had been lost when thorndike became a banker the chief clerk and two bank messengers were waiting by the automobile with written calls for help from the office they pounced upon the banker and almost lifted him into the car theres still time panted the chief clerk there is not answered mr thorndike his tone was rebellious defiant it carried all the authority of a spoiled child of fortune ive wasted most of this day he declared and i intend to waste the rest of it andrews he called jump in and ill give you a lunch at sherrys the vigilant protector of the public dashed back into the building wait till i get my hat he called as the two truants rolled up the avenue the spring sunshine warmed them the sense of duties neglected added zest to their holiday and young mr andrews laughed aloud mr thorndike raised his eyebrows inquiringly i was wondering said andrews how much it cost you to keep spear out of jail i dont care said the great man guiltily it was worth it
