jack higgins the white house connection prologue new york manhattan with an east wind driving rain mixed with a little sleet along park avenue was as bleak and uninviting as most great cities after midnight especially in march there was little traffic the occasional limousine the odd cab hardly surprising at that time of the morning and with such uninviting weather in a stretch of mixed offices and residences a woman waited in an archway standing in the shadows a widebrimmed rain hat on her head and wearing a trenchcoat the collar turned up an umbrella was looped to her left wrist she carried no purse or shoulder bag she felt for the gun in the righthand pocket of her trenchcoat took it out and checked it expertly by feel it was an unusual weapon a colt semiautomatic eight shot relatively small but deadly especially with the silencer on the end some people might have thought it a womans gun but not when used with hollowpoint cartridges she replaced it in her pocket and looked out slightly to her right on the other side of park avenue was a splendid townhouse it was owned by senator michael cohan who was attending a fundraiser at the pierre a function due to finish at midnight which was why she waited here in the shadows with the intention all things being equal of leaving him dead on the pavement she heard the sound of voices a drunken shout and two young men came round the corner on the other side and started along the sidewalk they were dressed in identical woollen hats reefer coats and jeans and they were drinking from cans one of them tall and bearded stepped into the flooded gutter and kicked water grinning but as the rain increased the other one wrapped his jacket tighter spotting the entrance to a covered alley he swallowed the rest of his beer and dropped the can into the gutter in here man he ran for the entrance damn the woman said softly the alley was next to cohans house there was nothing to be done they had disappeared into the shadows but she could hear them clearly their laughter loud she waited impatiently for them to move on and then a young woman turned the same corner the men had come from and moved along the sidewalk she was small and except for her umbrella unsuitably dressed for such weather in high heels and a black suit with a short skirt she heard the raucous laughter hesitated then started past the alley a voice called hey where are you going baby and the bearded man stepped out his friend following the girl started to hurry and the bearded man dashed after her and grabbed her arm she dropped her umbrella and struggled and he slapped her across the face fight as much as you want sweetheart i like it his friend grabbed her other arm come on lets get her inside the girl cried out in terror and the bearded one slapped her again now you be good they dragged her into the alley the older woman hesitated and then she heard a scream damn she said for the second time stepped out into the rain and crossed over it was dark in the alley with only a little diffused light from the street lamp outside the girl tried to struggle against the man holding her from behind but the bearded man had a knife in his right hand and touched it to her cheek drawing blood she cried out in pain and he said i told you to be good he reached for the hem of her skirt and sliced upwards with the sharp blade parting it there you go freddy be my guest a calm voice said i dont think so freddys face as he looked beyond his friend registered astonishment jesus he said the bearded man turned and found the woman standing in the alley entrance she was carrying the rain hat in her right hand her hair was silvery white highlighted by the back light from the street lamp she looked to be in her sixties but it was hard to tell anything about her face in the dark what the hell is this the one holding the girl said just let her go i cant tell you what she wants but i know what shes going to get the bearded man said to his friend the same as this bitch you feel like some company tonight grandma he took a step forward and the woman shot him in the heart firing through the rain hat the sound muted he was thrown against the wall bounced off and fell on his back the girl was so terrified that she didnt utter a word it was the man holding her who reacted jesus he moaned oh god and then he took a knife from his pocket and sprang the blade ill cut her throat he said to the older woman i swear it the woman stood there the colt in her right hand down against her thigh now her voice when she spoke was still calm and controlled you never learn you people do you her hand swung up and she shot him between the eyes he fell backwards the girl leaned against the wall breathing heavily blood on her face the woman removed her light woollen scarf and passed it across and the girl held it to her face the woman leaned over checked the bearded man first and then the other well neither of these gentlemen will be bothering anyone again the girl exploded the bastards she kicked the bearded man if you hadnt come along she shuddered i hope they rot in hell its a strong possibility the woman said do you live near here about twenty blocks i was having dinner at a place around the corner had a fight with my date and walked out hoping to find a cab you never can find one when its raining let me look at your face she pulled the girl to the entrance id say youll need two or three stitches st marys hospital is two blocks that way she pointed go to the emergency room tell them you had an accident you slipped cut your cheek tore your skirt will they believe me it doesnt matter its your business the woman shrugged unless you want to go to the police good god no the girl replied a kind of agony there thats the last thing i want the woman stepped out picked up the fallen umbrella and gave it to her then go my dear and dont look back it didnt happen none of it she stepped back and picked up the girls purse where it had fallen dont forget this the girl took it and i wont forget you the woman smiled on the whole id rather you did the girl managed a small smile i see what you mean she turned and hurried off clutching the umbrella the woman watched her go examined the bullet hole in her hat put it on then opened her own umbrella and walked away in the opposite direction two blocks north she found the lincoln parked at the kerb the man behind the wheel was out and waiting for her as she approached a large black man wearing a grey chauffeurs suit you okay he asked im here arent i she got into the front passenger seat he closed the door went round and got behind the wheel she strapped herself in and tapped his shoulder wheres that flask of yours hedley the bushmills whiskey he took a silver flask from the glove compartment unscrewed the cap and passed it to her she swallowed once twice then handed it back wonderful she took out a silver case selected a cigarette and lit it with the car lighter then blew out a long stream of smoke all the bad habits are so pleasurable you shouldnt be doing that its not good for you does it matter dont say that he was upset did you get the bastard cohan no something got in the way lets head back to the plaza and ill tell you she was finished by the time they were halfway there and he was horrified my god what you trying to do clean up the whole world now i see you mean i should have stood by and waited while those two animals raped the girl and probably cut her throat okay okay he sighed and nodded what about senator cohan well fly back to london tomorrow hes due there in a few days showing his face on what he pretends is presidential business ill get him then and then what where does it end hedley grunted it all seems unreal he pulled up at the plaza and she smiled mischievously like a child im a great trial to you hedley i know that but what would i do without you see you in the morning he went round and opened the door for her and watched her go up the steps and what would i do without you he asked softly then got behind the wheel and drove away the night doorman was waiting at the top lady helen he said its wonderful to see you i heard you were in and you george she kissed him on the cheek hows that new daughter of yours great just great im going back to london in the morning ill see you again soon night lady helen she went in and a man in a raincoat who had been waiting for a cab said hey who was that woman lady helen lang shes been coming here for years lady huh funny she doesnt sound english thats cause shes from boston married an english lord ages ago people say shes worth millions really well she seems quite something you can say that again nicest person youll ever meet in the beginning london new york chapter one b orn in boston in to one of boston s wealthiest families helen darcys mother had died giving birth to her and she was raised as an only child fortunately her father truly loved her and she loved him just as much in return in spite of his enormous business interests in steel shipbuilding and oil he took the time to lavish every attention on her and she was worth it enormously intelligent she went to the best private schools and later vassar where she found she had a special flair for foreign languages to her father only the best was good enough and himself a rhodes scholar as a young man he sent her to england to finish her graduate education at st hughs college at oxford university many of her fathers business associates in london put themselves out to entertain her and she became popular in london society she was twentyfour when she met sir roger lang a baronet and onetime lieutenant colonel in the scots guards now chairman of a merchant bank with close associations with her father she adored him at once and the attraction was mutual there was one flaw however although he was unmarried there was a fifteen years age difference between them and at the time it simply seemed too much for her she returned to america confused and uncertain about the future for business held no attraction for her and shed had enough of academia there were plenty of young men of course if only for the wrong reason her fathers enormous wealth but no one suited her because in the background there was always roger lang with whom she stayed in touch once a week by telephone finally one weekend at their beach house on cape cod she said to her father across the breakfast table daddy dont be mad at me but im thinking of moving back to england and getting married he leaned back and smiled does roger lang know about this dammit you knew ever since you came back from oxford i was wondering when youd come to your senses she poured tea a habit shed acquired in england the answer is he doesnt know then i suggest you fly to london and tell him and he returned to his new york times and so a new life began for helen darcy now lady helen lang divided between the house in south audley street and the country estate by the sea in north norfolk called compton place there was only one fly in the ointment in spite of every effort to have a child she was bedevilled by miscarriages year after year so that by the time her son peter was born when she was thirtythree it seemed a major miracle peter proved to be another great joy in her life and she took the kind of interest in his education that her father had taken in hers her husband agreed he could go to an american prep school for a few years but afterwards as the future sir peter he had to finish his education at eton and the sandhurst military academy it was the family tradition which was fine with peter for he had only ever wanted to be one thing a soldier like all the langs before him after sandhurst came the scots guards his fathers old regiment and a few years later a transfer to the sas for he had inherited his mothers ability with languages he saw service in bosnia and in the gulf war where he was awarded the military cross for an unspecified black operation behind iraqi lines and in ireland of course the one place which never went away handinhand with his ability for languages was a flair for dialects he spoke not with some stage irish accent but as if he were from dublin or belfast or south armagh which made him invaluable for undercover work in the continuing battle with the provisional ira because of the life he led women figured little the odd girlfriend now and then was all he had time for the fear was real the burden immense but helen bore it as a soldiers wife and mother should until that dreadful sunday in march when her husband answered the phone at south audley street then replaced the receiver slowly and turned his face ashen hes gone he said simply peters gone and he slumped into a chair and cried his eyes out while she held his hand and stared blankly into space if there was one person who understood her grief that rainy day in the churchyard of the village church of st mary and all the saints at compton place it was lady helen langs chauffeur hedley jackson who stood behind her and sir roger immaculate in his grey uniform as he held a large umbrella above them he was six feet four and originally from harlem at the age of eighteen hed joined the marine corps and gone to vietnam emerging at the other end with a silver star and two purple hearts posted to the american embassy guard in london hed met a girl from brixton who was housekeeper to the langs at south audley street they had married hedley had left the service and been appointed the langs chauffeur and they had lived in the spacious basement flat and had a child a son it was an ideal life for them and then tragedy struck jackson s wife and son were involved in a multicar pileup in the fog on the north circular road and were killed instantly lady helen had held his hand at the crematorium and when he had disappeared from south audley street she had hunted him down through one bar after another in brixton until she found him sodden with drink and nearly suicidal had taken him to compton place and slowly patiently brought him back to life to say that he was devoted to her now was an understatement and his heart bled for her particularly since sir rogers words to her peters gone had hidden a horrific truth the ira car bomb which had killed him had been of such enormous strength that not a single trace of his body remained and standing there in the rain all they could commemorate was his name engraved in the family mausoleum major peter lang mc scots guards special air service regiment rest in peace helen held her husbands hand he had aged ten years in the past few days a man once spry and vigorous now seemed as if hed never been young rest in peace she thought but thats what it was supposed to have been for peace in ireland and those bastards destroyed him no trace its as if hes never been she thought frowning unable to weep that cant be right theres no justice none at all in a world gone mad the priest intoned i am the resurrection and the life saith the lord helen shook her head no not that not that i dont believe any more not when evil walks the earth unpunished she turned leaving the astonished mourners taking her husband with her and walked away hedley followed the umbrella held over them her father unable to attend the funeral because of illness died a few months later and left her a millionaire many times over the management team that controlled the various parts of the corporation were entirely trustworthy and headed by her cousin with whom shed always been close so it was all in the family she devoted herself to her husband a broken man who himself died a year after his son as for helen she gave a certain part of her activities to charitable work and spent a great deal of time at compton place although the one thousand acres that went with the house were leased out for largescale farming to a certain extent compton place was her salvation because of its fascinating location a mile from the coast of the north sea that part of norfolk was still one of the most rural areas of england full of winding narrow lanes and places with names like cley nextthesea stiffkey and blakeney little villages found unexpectedly and then lost never to be found again it was all so timeless from the first time roger had taken her there she had been enchanted by the salt marshes with the sea mist drifting in the shingle and sand dunes and the great wet beaches when the tide was out from her days as a child growing up in cape cod she had loved the sea and birds and there were birds in plenty in her part of norfolk brent geese from siberia curlews redshanks and every kind of seagull she loved walking or cycling along the dykes none of them less than six feet high that passed through the great banks of reeds it gave her renewed energy every time she breathed in the salt sea air or felt the rain on her face the house had originally been built in tudor times but was mainly georgian with a few later additions the large kitchen was a postwar project lovingly created in country style the dining room hall library and the huge drawing room were panelled in oak there were only six bedrooms now for others had been developed into bathrooms or dressing rooms at various stages with the estate leased to various farmers she had retained only six acres around the house mainly woodland leaving two large lawns and another for croquet a retired farmer came up from the village from time to time to keep things in order and when they were in residence hedley would get the tractor out and mow the grass himself there was a daily housekeeper named mrs smedley and another woman from the village helped her with the cleaning when necessary all this sufficed it was a calm and orderly existence that helped her return to life and the villagers helped too the laws of the british aristocracy are strange as roger langs wife she was officially lady lang only the daughters of the higher levels of the nobility were allowed to use their christian names but the villagers in that part of norfolk were a strange stubborn race to them she was lady helen and that was that it was an interesting fact that the same attitude pertained in london society any help anyone needed she gave she attended church every sunday morning and hedley sat in the rear pew always correctly attired in his chauffeurs uniform she was not above visiting the village pub of an evening for a drink or two and there too hedley always accompanied her and though you might not think it was totally accepted by those taciturn people ever since an extraordinary event some years past an incredibly high tide combined with torrential rain had caused the water to rise in the narrow canal that passed through the village from the old disused mill soon it was overflowing into the street and threatening to engulf the village all attempts to force open the lock gate which was blocking the water proved futile and it was hedley who plunged chest deep into the water with a crowbar diving under the surface again and again until he managed to dislodge the ancient locking pins and the gate burst open at the pub he had never been allowed to pay for a drink again so although it had lost its savour life could have been worse and then lady helen received an unexpected phone call one that in its consequences would prove just as catastrophic as that other call two years earlier the call that had announced the death of her son helen is that you the voice was weak yet strangely familiar yes who is this tony emsworth she remembered the name well a junior officer under her husband many years ago later an undersecretary of state at the foreign office she hadnt seen him for some time he had to be seventy now come to think of it he hadnt been at either peters funeral or her husbands shed thought that strange at the time why tony she said where are you my cottage im living in a little village called stukeley now in kent only forty miles from london hows martha helen asked died two years ago the thing is helen i must see you its a matter of life and death you could say he was racked by coughing my death actually lung cancer i havent got long to go tony im so sorry he tried to joke so am i there was an urgency in his voice now helen my love you must come and see me i need to unburden myself of something something you must hear he was coughing again she waited until hed stopped fine tony fine try not to upset yourself ill drive down to london this afternoon stay overnight in town and be with you as soon as i can in the morning is that all right wonderful ill see you then he put down the phone she had taken the call in the library she stood there frowning slightly agitated then opened a silver box took out a cigarette and lit it with a lighter roger had once given her made from a german shell tony emsworth the weak voice the coughing had given her a bad shake she remembered him as a dashing guards captain a ladies man a bruising rider to hounds to be reduced to what she had just heard was not pleasant intimations of mortality she thought death just round the corner and there had been enough of that in her life but there was another secret reason something even hedley knew nothing about the odd pain in the chest and arm had given her pause for thought shed had a private visit to london recently a consultation with one of the best doctors in harley street tests and scans at the london clinic it reminded her of a remark scott fitzgerald had made about his health i visited a great mans office and emerged with a grave sentence something like that her sentence had not been too grave heart trouble of course angina no need to worry my dear the professor had said youll live for years just take the pills and take it easy no more riding to hounds or anything like that and no more of these she said softly and stubbed out the cigarette with a wry smile remembering that shed been saying that for months and went in search of hedley stukeley was pleasant enough cottages on either side of a narrow street a pub a general store and emsworths place rose cottage on the other side of the church lady helen had phoned before leaving london to give him the time and he was expecting them opening the door to greet them tall and frail the flesh washed away the face skulllike she kissed his cheek tony you look terrible dont i just he managed a grin should i wait in the merc hedley asked nice to see you again hedley emsworth said would it be possible for you to handle the kitchen i let my daily go an hour ago shes left sandwiches cakes and so on if you could make the tea my pleasure hedley told him and followed them in a log fire was burning in the large open fireplace in the sitting room beams supported the low ceiling and there was comfortable furniture everywhere and indian carpets scattered over the stoneflagged floor emsworth sat in a wingbacked chair and put his walking stick on the floor a cardboard file was on the coffee table beside him theres a photo over there of your old man and me when i was a subaltern he said helen lang went to the sideboard and examined the photo in its silver frame you look very handsome both of you she returned and sat opposite him he said i didnt attend peters funeral missed out on rogers too i had noticed too ashamed to show my face ye see there was something here something unmentionable that already touched her deep inside and her skin crawled hedley came in with tea things on a tray and put them down beside her on a low table leave the food she told him later i think be a good chap emsworth said theres a whiskey decanter on the sideboard pour me a large one and one for lady helen will i need it i think so she nodded hedley poured the drinks andserved them ill be in the kitchen if you need me thank you i think i might hedley looked grim but retired to the kitchen he stood there thinking about it then noticed the two doors to the serving hatch and eased them ajar it was underhanded yes but all that concerned him was her welfare he sat down on a stool and listened for years i lived a lie as far as my friends were concerned emsworth said even martha didnt know the truth you all thought i was foreign office well it wasnt true i worked for the secret intelligence service for years oh not in the field i was the kind of office man who sent brave men out to do the dirty work and who frequently died doing it one of them was major peter lang there was that crawling feeling again i see she said carefully let me explain my office was responsible for black operations in ireland the people we were after were not only ira but loyalist paramilitaries who because of threats and intimidation of witnesses escaped legal justice and what was your solution we had undercover groups sas in the main who disposed of them murdered you mean no i cant accept that word weve been at war with these people for too many years she didnt pour the tea but reached for the whiskey and sipped some am i to understand that my son did such work yes he was one of our best operatives peters ability to turn on a range of irish accents was invaluable he could sound like a building site worker from derry if he wanted to he was part of a group of five four men plus a woman officer and they all came to an untimely end within the same week three men and the woman shot and peter blown up there was a pause as emsworth swallowed the whiskey then he got up and lurched to the sideboard and poured another with a shaking hand actually no thats just what you were told he swallowed the whiskey spilling some down his chin she drank the rest of her whiskey took out her silver case selected a cigarette and lit it tell me emsworth reached the chair again and sank down he nodded to the file its all in there everything you need to know im breaking the official secrets act but why should i care i could be dead tomorrow tell me she said her voice hard i want to hear it from you he took a deep breath if you must as you know there are many splinter groups in irish politics both catholic and protestant one of the worst is a nationalist outfit called the sons of erin years ago it was run by a man called frank barry a very bad article indeed and almost unique he was a protestant republican he was eventually killed but he had a nephew named jack barry who had an american mother hed been born in new york then gone to vietnam in when he was eighteen on a shortterm commission there was some kind of scandal apparently he shot a lot of vietcong prisoners so they turfed him out quietly and then he joined the ira thats about it he took over where his uncle left off hes a murdering psychopath whos been doing his own thing for years now oh and another bizarre thing jacks greatuncle was lord barry he had a place on the down coast in ulster called spanish head its part of the national trust now his father died when he was a child and frank barry was killed just before his old uncle died which leaves jack with the title emsworth nodded but hes never attempted to claim it he could be proscribed as a traitor to the crown i wonder i think executions on tower hill went out some years ago but tony please get to the point he closed his eyes for a moment then sighed and continued there was a man called doolin who used to drive for barry he ended up in the maze prison and we put an informer in his cell our man had an ample supply of cocaine and eventually had doolin telling his life story from birth my god she was horrified its the name of the game my dear doolin had not been with barry during the time in question but his story was that barry was on a high as he drove him north to stramore on pills and whiskey he told doolin hed just taken out an entire undercover british group thanks to the new york branch of the sons of erin and with a little help from someone he called the connection doolin asked who this connection was and barry said no one knew but that he was an american and then he started acting all coy and talking about the detectives whod operated out of dublin castle for mick collins in the old days so the implication was that this connection was someone very high up and on the inside but where how for years british intelligence has had a link with the white house especially because of the developing peace process information has been passed to what were supposed to be friends on a needtoknow basis including information on my sons group yes i thought that was going too far but those more important than i people such as simon carter deputy director of the security services ruled against me and then doolin was found hanged in his cell she went and poured another whiskey and turned it gets more like the borgias every minute and as youve avoided explaining your remark about peter not being blown up i think im going to need this she swallowed half the whiskey get on with it tony yes well the sons of erin they passed on information obtained from the connection they all had contacts in dublin and london he was in agony and showed it its in the files everythings in there all the players photos the lot i copied the top secret file and tell me about peter they snatched him coming out of a pub in south armagh barry and his men they tortured him and when he wouldnt talk beat him to death they were building a new bypass road nearby down to the irish republic it had one of those massive concrete mixers that works all night they put his body through it she sat there staring silent then suddenly swallowed the rest of the whiskey he carried on they blew up his car with the heavy charge to make it look as if hed gone that way i mean they needed us to know hed gone but couldnt send us a postcard saying how he was a little drunk now she cried out and put a hand to her mouth as she stood and ran for the door she made it to the toilet in the hall and vomited into the basin again and again when she finally wiped her face and came out hedley was there you heard im afraid so are you okay ive been better tea hedley hot and strong she went back into the sitting room and sat down what happened why was nothing done they decided to keep it black which was why you werent told the truth we had operatives check republican circles in new york and washington we discovered there was indeed a new york dining club called the sons of erin the names of the members are all in the file along with their photos theyre prominent businessmen ones even a us senator it all fits there had already been examples of privileged information from london to washington ending up in ira hands but why was nothing done emsworth shrugged politics the president the prime minister no one wanted to rock the boat let me tell you something about intelligence work you think the cia and the fbi keep the president informed about everything hell no so its just the same in the uk mi and mi have their own dark secrets and they not only hate each other but also scotland yards antiterrorist unit and military intelligence for proof of that youll find two interesting entries in the file one american the other brit and what do they refer to theres a man called blake johnson at the white house around fifty a vietnam veteran lawyer exfbi hes director of the general affairs department at the white house because its downstairs its known as the basement its one of the most closely guarded secrets of the administration passed from one president to another its totally separate from the fbi the cia the secret service answers only to the president the whispers are so faint people dont believe it exists but it does oh yes and the british prime minister has his own version its there in the file brigadier charles ferguson runs it charles ferguson but ive known him for yean well i dont know what you thought he was but his outfit is known in the trade as the prime ministers private army its given the ira a bad time for years ferguson has a sizeable setup at the ministry of defence and is responsible only to the pm which is why the other intelligence outfits loathe him his nght hand is an exira enforcer named sean dillon his left a detective chief inspector named hannah bernstein granddaughter of a rabbi if you can believe it quite a bunch huh but what has this to do with anything simply that the secret intelligence service didnt want ferguson and company involved because ferguson might have told the prime minister and ferguson has a private contact with blake johnson which meant the president would have been informed and sis couldnt have that so what happened sis started to send the white house mild and useless information and disinformation there was no way of implicating the members of the sons of erin and then the file was lost he reached for the folder and held it up except for my copy i dont know why i took it at the time selfdisgust i suppose now i think you should have it he started to cough she passed him a napkin he spat into it and she saw blood should i get the doctor hes calling in later not that itll make any difference he gave her a ghastly smile thats it then now you know id better lie down he rose picked up the stick and walked slowly into the hall im sorry helen desperately sorry its not your fault tony he heaved himself up the stairs and she watched him go hedley appeared behind her holding the file i figured youd want this i surely do she took it from him lets move on hedley theres only death here back in the mercedes as they drove through the narrow lanes she read through the file every detail every photo strangely enough she dwelt on sean dillon longer than anyone the fair hair the selfcontainment the look of a man who had found life a bad joke she closed the file and leaned back you okay lady helen hedley asked oh fine you can read the file yourself when were back at south audley street she felt a flutter in her chest opened her purse shook two pills into her hand and swallowed them whiskey please hedley she said he passed back the silver flask whats going on are you okay just some pills the doctor gave me she leaned back and closed her eyes no big deal just get me to south audley street but hedley didnt believe her for a moment and drove on his face troubled chapter two at south audley street she sat in the study and worked her way through the file again studying the text the photos the composition of the sons of erin was interesting there was senator michael cohan aged fifty a family fortune behind him derived from supermarkets and shopping malls martin brady fiftytwo an important official in the teamsters union patrick kelly fortyeight a construction millionaire and thomas cassidy fortyfive who had made a fortune from irish theme pubs all irishamericans but there was one surprise a wellknown london gangster named tim pat ryan she passed the file to hedley in the kitchen got a pot of tea returned to the study and started on her computer a recent acquisition and something with which shed become surprisingly expert thanks to help from an unexpected source shed asked for advice from the london office of her corporation and their computer department had jumped to attention and recommended the best shed mastered the basics quickly but soon wanted more and had consulted the corporation again the result was the arrival in south audley street of a strange young man in a very hightech electric wheelchair shed seen him from the drawingroom window but when she went into the hall hedley already had the door open the young man on the sidewalk had hair to his shoulders bright blue eyes and hollow cheeks he also had scar tissue all over his face the kind you got from bad burns lady helen he said cheerfully as she appeared behind hedley my names roper im told youd like your computer to sit up and do a few tricks he gave hedley a twisted smile turn me around theres a good chap and pull me up the two steps thats the one thing these gadgets cant manage in the hall hedley turned him and she said the study when they reached it he looked at her computer setup and nodded ah pk excellent he glanced up at hedley im not allowed to eat lunch but id love a pot of tea to wash my pills down sergeant major hedley smiled slowly do i say sir well i did make captain in the royal engineers bomb disposal he held up his hands they saw more scar tissue hedley nodded and went out helen said ira roper nodded i handled all those bombs so slickly and then a small one caught me by surprise in a car in belfast he shook his head very careless still it did lead me to a further career fatherhood being out he eased his wheelchair to the computer bank i do love these things they can do anything if you know what to ask them he turned and looked up at her is that what you want lady helen for them to do anything oh i think so good well give me a cigarette and lets see what you know then well see what i can teach you which he did every dirty trick in the computer book by the time hed finished she was capable of hacking into the ministry of defence itself and she continued to be an apt pupil until the morning she got yet another phone call that was three she thought these things always seemed to travel in threes the phone call that said roper was in the hospital with kidney failure theyd managed to save him but hed gone to a clinic in switzerland and shed never heard from him again now typing from memory she started trawling through files entering names as she went some were readily available others such as ferguson dillon hannah bernstein and blake johnson were not on the other hand when she cut into scotland yards most wanted list there was jack barry complete with a numbered black and white photo they got you once you bastard she mused maybe we can do it again hedley came in from the kitchen with the file and put it on the desk the new barbarians not really she said very old stuff except that in other days we did something about it can i get you anything no go to bed hedley ill be okay he went reluctantly she poured another whiskey it seemed to be keeping her going she opened the bottom drawer in the desk in search of a notepad and found the colt peter had brought back from bosnia along with the box of fifty hollowpoint cartridges and the silencer it had been a highly illegal present but peter had known she liked shooting both handgun ind shotgun and often practised in the improvised shooting range in the barn at compton place she reached down and almost absentmindedly picked it up then opened the box of cartridges loaded the gun and screwed the silencer on the end for a while she held it in her hand then put it on the desk and started on the file again ferguson fascinated her to have known him for so many years and yet not to have known him at all and the bernstein woman so calm to look at in her hornrimmed spectacles yet a woman who had killed four times the file said had even killed another woman a protestant terrorist who had deserved to die and then there was sean dillon born in ulster raised by his father in london an actor by profession who had attended the royal academy of dramatic art when dillon was nineteen his father had gone on a visit to belfast and been killed accidentally in a firefight with british paratroopers dillon had gone home and joined the ira the kind of thing a nineteenyearold would do she said softly he took to the theatre of the street dillon had become the most feared enforcer the ira ever had he had killed many times the man of a thousand faces intelligence sources had named him with typical originality his saving grace had been that he would have no truck with the bombing and the slaughter of the innocent hed never been arrested until the day he had ended up in a serb prison for flying in medicine for children although stinger missiles had also apparently been involved it was ferguson who had saved him from a firing squad had blackmailed dillon into working for him she went back to the sons of erin and finally came to tim pat ryan his record was foul drugs prostitution protection suspected of supplying arms and explosives to ira active service units in london but nothing proved he had a pub in wapping called the sailor by the river on china wharf she took a london street guide from a shelf leafed through it and located china wharf on the relevant map she lit a cigarette and sat back he was an animal ryan just like barry and the others guilty at least by association and the thought of what had happened to her son wouldnt go away she stubbed out her cigarette went to the couch and lay down the great psychologist carl jung spoke of a thing called synchronicity the suggestion that certain happenings are so profound that they go beyond mere coincidence and argue a deeper meaning and possibly a hidden agenda such a thing was happening at that very moment at charles fergusons flat in cavendish square the brigadier sat beside the fireplace in his elegant drawing room chief inspector hannah bernstein was opposite a file open on her knees dillon was helping himself to a bushmills at the sideboard he wore a black leather bomber jacket a white scarf at his neck feel free with my whiskey ferguson told him and dont i always dillon grinned i wouldnt want to disappoint you brigadier hannah bernstein closed the file thats it then sir no ira active service units operating in london at the present time i accept that with reluctance he told her and of course our political masters want us to play it all down anyway he sighed i sometimes long for the old days before this damn peace process made things so difficult hannah frowned and he smiled yes my dear i know that offends that fine morality of yours anyway i accept your findings and will so report to the prime minister no active service units in london dillon poured another bushmills not as far as we know you dont agree just because we cant see them doesnt mean theyre not there on the loyalist side we have the paramilitaries like the uvf and then the lvf whove been responsible for all those attacks and assassinations we know that murders hannah said a point of view they see themselves as gallant freedom fighters just like the stern gang in jerusalem in fortyeight dillon reminded her and then on the republican side we have the inla and jack barrys sons of erin that bastard again ferguson nodded id give my pension to put my hands on him splinter groups on both sides god knows how many dillon told them and not much we can do about it at the moment hannah bernstein said as the brigadier says the powers that be say hands off dillon went to the terrace window and peered out it was raining hard well in spite of all that there are bastards out there waiting to create bloody mayhem tim pat ryan for example how many times have we turned that one over hannah reminded him hes got the best lawyers in london wed have difficulty getting a result even if we caught him with a block of semtex in his hand oh sure dillon said but hes definitely supplied active service units with material in the past we know that and cant prove it ferguson said youd like to play executioner again wouldnt you dillon shrugged he wouldnt be missed scotland yard would break out the champagne you can forget it ferguson stood up i feel like an early night off you go children my drivers waiting for you in the daimler chief inspector good night to you when they opened the door it was raining hard dillon took an umbrella from the hall stand opened it and took her down to the daimler she got in the rear and put the window down a little i worry about you when things get quiet youre at your most dangerous be off with you before i begin to think you care he grinned ill see you at the office in the morning he kept the umbrella and walked rapidly away he had a small house in stable mews only five minutes away and as he walked in the front door he felt strangely restless the place was small very victorian oriental rugs polished woodblock floors a fireplace with an oil painting by atkinson grimshaw the great victorian artist above it for dillon was not without money mostly nefariously obtained over the years he poured another bushmills stood with it in his hand gazing up at the grimshaw thinking of tim pat ryan he had too much nervous energy to sleep and he checked his watch eleventhirty he walked to the sideboard took the stopper out of the decanter and poured the glass of whiskey back he went to the shelves of books in an alcove took three out and opened a flap behind removing a walther ppk with a silencer already fitted he replaced the books checked the weapon and put it into the waistband of his jeans snug against the small of his back he took the umbrella when he left the house for the rain was relentless and lifted the garage door where an old mini cooper in british racing green waited the perfect town car so small and yet capable of over a hundred with the foot down he got in drove to the end of the mews and paused to light a cigarette right you bastard lets see how youre doing and he drove away at the same moment helen lang dozing on the couch came awake aware of tim pat ryans face the last photo she had looked at in the file she sat up face damp with sweat aware that in the dream he had been hurting her laughing sarcastically she stood up went to the desk and stared down at the open file and tim pat ryan looked back at her she picked up the colt and weighed it in her hand there was an inevitability to things now she stood in the hall pulled on a trenchcoat and rain hat opened the shoulder bag that hung on the hall stand found some cash then put the colt in her pocket took down her umbrella and let herself out she hurried along south audley street the umbrella protecting her from the driving rain intending to go to the dorchester nearby there were always cabs there but as it happened one came along on the other side of the road she waved him down and darted across wapping high street she said as she climbed inside you can drop me by the george and she sat back tense and excited hedley had retired with no intention of sleeping had simply sat in an armchair in the basement flat in the darkness for some reason afraid for her he had heard her footsteps in the hall was up and waiting at the foot of the stairs as the front door opened and closed he grabbed his jacket went up and had the door open he saw her hurrying along the pavement the umbrella bobbing the wave of the hand for the cab hed left the mercedes at the kerb and was at it in an instant and switched it on as the cab passed on the other side of the road he went after it dillon reached the tower of london st katherines way and moved into wapping high street he passed the george hotel turning into a maze of side streets and finally parked on a deadend turning he got out locked the door and walked rapidly between the tall decaying warehouses finally turning on to china wharf there were few ships now only the occasional barge long disused cranes looming into the sky the sailor was at the end beyond the old quay he checked his watch midnight long past closing time when he paused in the shadows the kitchen door at one side opened light flooding out tim pat ryan and a woman see you tomorrow rosie he kissed her cheek and she walked away rapidly passing dillon safe in the shadows he moved to the nearest window and peered in ryan was sitting at the bar with a glass of beer reading a newspaper totally alone dillon eased open the kitchen door and entered the saloon was very oldfashioned and ornate with a mahogany bar and gilded angels on either side of a great mirror for the sailor dated from victorian times when sailing ships had moved up the thames by the dozen each day to tie up and unload at the quay there were rows of bottles on glass shelves beer pumps with ivory handles ryan was proud of it and kept it in applepie order he loved it like this at night all alone reading the standard in the quiet there was a slight eerie creaking of a door hinge a draught of air that lifted the paper he turned and dillon entered the bar god save the good work dillon said cheerfully theres hope for the world yet you can actually read ryans face was like stone what do you want dillon god save you kindly was the answer to that dillon said and you an irishman and not knowing youve no right to be here im clean never in a thousand years ryan stood and opened his jacket try me im not carrying i know youre too clever for that youve no right to be here youre not even scotland yard granted but im something more your own worst nightmare get out now before you throw me out i dont think so dillon lifted the bar flap went behind reached for a bottle of bushmills and a glass and filled it i wont drink with a piece of dung like you but ill have one for myself its cold outside without a flicker of emotion ryan said i could call the police what for im not carrying myself dillon smiled as he lied you see old son this is a new agenda what with the northern ireland secretary sinn fein and the loyalists with their heads together in belfast working away at the peace process i mean who needs guns any more my boss wouldnt like it what do you want ryan asked what is this youve been on my back for years just making my rounds dillon said just to let you know im still on your case the semtex you supplied the birmingham and london units how many bombings was it used for three four housewives in that shopping mall in birmingham we know it was you we just cant prove it yet you can talk how many did you kill for the cause for nearly twenty years dillon until you turned traitor but i never sold drugs or used young girls for prostitution dillon said theres a difference he swallowed the rest of the bushmills and put the glass down its cold outside and dark and ill always be there in the shadows to vary an old ira saying my day will come he turned and walked to the kitchen door and ryan exploded fuck you dillon fuck you im tim pat ryan im the man you cant treat me like this but the kitchen door was already closing softly ryan beside himself with rage now hurled back the flap opened the oldfashioned cash register fumbled at the back of the drawer and found the smith amp wesson pistol he always kept there fully loaded turned and headed for the kitchen lady helen lang had paid off the cab outside the george hotel in wapping high street remembering the street map she crossed the road and turned into a narrow lane hedley caught behind two cars at a red light saw her go he swore softly took off on the green and moved into the same lane but there was no sign of her even when he turned his lights on fully it was a maze of decaying warehouses and narrow criss crossing streets what in the hell was she playing at in a place like this frantic with worry he started to cruise slowly lady helen her umbrella high against the teeming rain found china wharf with no trouble there was a light at the pub window and an oldfashioned gas lamp bracketed to the wall above the painted sign that said the sailor it threw a diffused light to the edge of the wharf the river black beyond lights on the far side she hesitated uncertain now a large range rover was parked close to the pub entrance ryans probably she stood in the umbrellas shelter and the kitchen door opened and dillon came out she recognized him at once from the file and surprised she drew back she watched him walk across the wharf and light a cigarette then the kitchen door opened again and tim pat ryan also unmistakable rushed out dillon you bastard he called and in the light she saw the smith amp wesson heres for you dillon laughed you couldnt hit a barn door you never could someone always had to do it for you his hand found the butt of the walther and he drew it crouching as ryan fired wildly dillon put a foot forward to steady himself but there was a puddle of spilled oil there and he slipped falling headlong the walther skidding away ryan laughed triumphantly ive got you now and he fired again dillon rolled frantically and went over the edge of the wharf plunging into the dark waters below it was bitterly cold and he surfaced to find ryan peering down so there you are he raised his smith amp wesson and then dillon heard a voice call mr ryan ryan turned dillon heard a muted cough that he recognized as the sound of a silenced pistol then ryan came backwards over the edge of the wharf hit the water beside dillon and surfaced with a hole between his eyes dillon pushed him away and grabbed for a ring bolt there was a footfall above but no one looked over when the voice spoke again it was with an irish accent are you all right mr dillon as ever was maam and who in gods name might you be your guardian angel take care my friend he heard her walk away as he swam to a wooden ladder and climbed up as his head rose above the edge of the wharf he caught a brief glimpse of her disappearing into the shadows a dark shape under an umbrella that was gone in a moment he pulled himself over and stood up streaming water his walther lay where it had fallen and ryans weapon was close by he pushed the walther into his waistband and picked up the smith amp wesson went to the edge of the wharf looked down at ryans halfsubmerged body then hurled the gun far out into the river and you can chew on that you bastard he said and hurried back to the mini cooper he had a mobile phone in the glove compartment got it out and dialled cavendish square ferguson sounded irate who is this its me dillon told him good god do you know what time it is im in bed cant it wait until the morning not really an old friend just passed on ferguson s voice changed permanently very much so youd better come round then i need to go home first what on earth for because ive been swimming in the thames thats why and dillon switched off and drove away ferguson thought about it and then phoned hannah bernstein she answered at once are you in bed no reading actually one of those nights cant sleep phone through for one of the emergency cars and get round here it would appear our sean has been involved in some sort of mischief oh dear bad the graveyard variety or so it would seem ill see you soon he put down the phone got out of bed and pulled on a robe then he phoned through to kim his ghurka manservant woke him up and ordered tea hedley had almost given up when he saw her at the end of the sidewalk in front of him and as he coasted towards her three youths came round the corner wearing bomber jackets and jeans young animals of the kind to be found anywhere in the world from new york to london hedley heard the ugly laughter and then they were on to her one of them yanking her purse away his anger was instant he braked at the kerb and jumped out leave it one of them pushed helen against the wall and they all turned the one with the purse said hey nigger get out of here this is none of your business they moved in on him and it all came back nam the delta every dirty trick hed ever learned he grabbed the wrist of the one holding the purse twisted the arm straight and delivered a hammer blow that snapped the bone his right elbow went back into the face of the one behind breaking the nose and his left foot scraped down the leg of the third dislodging the kneecap they were on the sidewalk crying in pain he picked up the purse and took her arm can we go now my god hedley you dont take prisoners never could see the point what are you doing here i heard you leave so i followed then i lost you when you went on foot he held the door for her she slipped in and he got in behind the wheel sounding a little breathless she opened her purse took out a bottle and shook a couple of pills into her palm the flask hedley lady helen you shouldnt the flask her voice was insistent and he passed the flask over reluctantly she drank washing the pills down a warm glow spreading through her well go back to south audley street now and pack compton place in the morning as he pulled away he said anxiously are you okay never better you see i just executed tim pat ryan he swerved slightly then regained control youve got to be kidding me not at all let me tell you about it kim opened the door to let dillon in and when the irishman went into the drawing room he found hannah bernstein wearing a track suit opposite ferguson who wore a robe over his pyjamas god bless all here dillon said enough of the stage irishman dillon just tell us the worst ferguson said wearily dillon did in a few brief sentences then went and helped himself to the bushmills for gods sake what am i to do with you ferguson demanded you know the present political situation hands off no trouble and yet out of some strange perversity you went looking for it i only intended to lean on the bastard for once it was hannah bernstein who spoke up its no great loss sir ryan was like something from under a stone yes i admit to a certain satisfaction the brigadier told her but how does that fine special branch mind intend to handle it by leaving it alone sir someone will find ryan down there by the wharf soon enough that leaves scotland yard and a murder squad investigation lets face it a piece of filth like ryan had more enemies than you could count its not our problem sir i agree ferguson said dillon shook his head jesus tis the hard woman you are whatever happened to that nice jewish girl i fell in love with comes of working with you she turned to ferguson to business sir our business this woman with the irish accent may have done us a favour but id like to know who she is with your permission ill trawl all intelligence sources on the computer at the ministry of defence and see what i can see be my guest chief inspector there may be a loyalist link here i dont think so dillon said most loyalists have the ulster accent like my own hers was different no matter ferguson stood you can stay in one of the spare bedrooms chief inspector i dont want to turn you out again in the rain at this time in the morning thank you sir he turned you of course can walk home dillon i mean you irish are used to the rain arent you god save your honour tis the grand man you are ill take my shoes off at your door tie them round my neck and walk barefoot to stable mews to save the leather ferguson laughed out loud just go you rogue go and dillon went out in the study at south audley street lady helen sat at the desk examining the file and hedley came in with tea on a tray he put the tray down and poured tea into a cup she added milk english style and sipped it lovely she leaned over the file strange tim pat ryan was the last on the list but the first to go lady helen this cant go on oh yes it damn well can whats my money buy me thats worth anything hedley those bastards all of them were directly responsible for the butchery of my son as a result my husband died an early and unnecessary death and ill tell you another thing old friend i dont have much time the pills ive been taking i have a damaged heart he was deeply shocked and sat down i didnt realize you do now so are you with me or against me you could phone dr ingram and tell him ive gone mad you could call scotland yard and theyd arrest me for murder its up to you isnt it he stood up youve been good to me more than anyone else in my life he sighed i still dont like it but one things for sure you need someone you can count on and ill be there for you just like you were there for me bless you hedley get some sleep and well leave for compton place in the morning he left the room and she sat there wondering how dillon was getting on then she went and lay on the couch and pulled a comforter over herself london washington ulster chapter three at the ministry of defence hannah bernsteins efforts at trawling the computer proved useless she even tried dublin and british army headquarters at lisburn in northern ireland but nothing so the matter was shelved ryans death was a sevenday wonder the newspapers spoke of rivalry between gangs in the east end and other parts of london no one at scotland yard was shedding tears underworld contacts proved useless the case was shelved left open of course but shelved at compton place helen ate well took long walks and got plenty of fresh air she also practised at the pistol shooting range in the old barn a reluctant hedley giving her the benefit of his expertise she had never realized how good he was until one afternoon after supervising her he picked up a browning one of many handguns her husband had accumulated over the years and loaded it there were seven cardboard targets at the far end of the barn each a facsimile of a charging chinese soldier a legacy of the old colonels time in the korean war i want you to watch he was about thirty feet away his hand swung he fired rapidly and shot each target through the head she was amazed and showed it as the sound died away incredible but im a trained soldier now you youre good but handguns are unreliable unless you get close how close he slammed a fresh clip into the butt of the browning and handed it to her come with me he led her to the large centre target right put it against his heart and pull the trigger she did as he ordered now you get it that close i was about twelve feet away from ryan sure but you could have missed and he might have got you all right but id still like to return to the table and try again from there be my guest the mobile phone on the table rang he opened it and passed it to her and she said helen lang after a while she nodded my thanks im so sorry she closed the phone and looked at hedley tony emsworth just died thats a shame when is the funeral wednesday are we going of course she was calm but there was pain in her eyes ive had enough hedley i think ill go back inside and she walked away it was a fine sunny morning for the funeral at stukeley as it was no more than an hours drive from london the church was full and helen lang sitting on one side of the aisle was almost amused to find ferguson hannah bernstein and dillon on the other on her way out she paused to shake hands with tony emsworths nephew and his wife who had organized things so nice of you to come lady helen they chorused weve arranged a reception at the country hoteljust outside the village do come which she did the hotel lounge was crowded she accepted a glass of indifferent champagne and then charles ferguson saw her and barrelled through the crowd my dear helen he kissed her on both cheeks my god you still look fifty and thats on a bad day how do you do it you were always a charmer charles a glib charmer but a charmer she turned to hannah at his shoulder beware of this one my dear i remember when he had an affair with the uruguayan ambassadors wife and her husband challenged him to a duel now helen thats very naughty this gorgeous creature is my assistant detective chief inspector hannah bernstein and this irish rogue is one sean dillon who knew tony quite well lady helen lang dillon wore an easyfitting armani suit of navy blue helen lang took to him at once as they shook hands at that moment someone called to ferguson who turned and moved away dillon and hannah went with him ferguson said hello to the man whod called him and dillon pulled him around lady lang who is she oh i soldiered with her husband in korea her son major peter lang was scots guards and sas one of our best undercover agents in youknowwhere someone in the ira got on to him the other year and blew him up car bomb hannah bernstein was talking to someone and ferguson was hailed again suddenly it was all too much for helen lang and slightly breathless she went out on to the terrace in the february sunshine dillon saw her go there was something about her something he couldnt define so he went after her she was at the terrace balustrade tossing a couple of pills back when dillon arrived can i get you a glass of champagne frankly id rather have whiskey well im your man will irish do why not he was back in a few moments with two glasses she put hers down got out her silver case and held it out do you indulge jesus but youre a wonderful woman his old zippo flared and he gave her a light do you mind if i say something mr dillon she said youre wearing a guards tie ah well i like to keep old ferguson happy she took a chance i should mention that i know about you mr dillon my old friend tony emsworth told me everything and for very special reasons your son lady helen dillon nodded im surprised youd speak to me i believe war should still have rules and from what tony told me you were an honourable man however ruthless and may i say misguided i stand corrected he bowed his head in mock humility she said you rogue you can get me that champagne now only make sure they open a decent bottle at your command he joined ferguson at the bar lady helen he said quite a woman and then some the barman poured the champagne into two glasses theres something about her something special cant put my finger on it dont try dillon ferguson told him shes far too good for you it was a week later that they flew from gatwick to new york in one of her companys gulfstreams and stayed at the plaza by that time she knew the file backwards every facet of every individual in it and had also used every facility available in the companys computer she had the colt with her in all her years flying in the gulfstreams she had never been checked by security once she knew everything for example that martin brady the teamsters union official attended a union gym near the new york docks three times a week and usually left around ten in the evening hedley took her to a place a block away then she walked brady had a red mercedes a distinctive automobile she waited in an alley next to where he had parked it and slipped out only to shoot him in the back of the neck as he leaned over to unlock the mercedes that had been hedfeys suggestion hed heard that the mob preferred such executions with a small calibre pistol usually a but a would do and this would make the police think they had a mobversusunion problem thomas cassidy with a fortune in irish theme pubs was easy hed recently opened a new place in the bronx and parked in an alley at the rear she checked it out two nights running and got him on the third at one in the morning once again as he unlocked his car according to the new york times there had been a protection racket operating in the area and the police thought cassidy a victim shed known about all that and his complaints to the police from the computer patrick kelly the boss of the construction firm was even easier he had a house in ossining with countryside all around his habit was to rise at six in the morning and run five miles she checked out his usual route then caught him on the third morning running with the hood of his track suit up against heavy rain she stood under a tree as he approached shot him twice in the heart then removed the gold rolex watch from his wrist and the chain from around his neck again at hedleys suggestion a simple mugging was all so everything worked perfectly she hadnt needed the pills as much and hedley in spite of his doubts had proved a rock am i truly wicked she would ask herself really evil and then recalled reading that in judaism jehovah was not personally responsible for many actions he employed angels an angel of death for example is that me she asked herself but needing justice she could not be sorry so she continued until that rainy night in manhattan when she waited for senator michael cohan to come home from the pierre and was sidetracked at the same time that helen lang was returning to the plaza consoling herself with the thought that she would get cohan in london other events were taking place there that would prove to have a profound influence not only on her but on others she already knew a few hours after lady helen went to bed hannah bernstein entered charles fergusons office at the ministry of defence dillon behind her sorry to bother you sir but weve got a hot one really he smiled tell me she nodded to dillon who said theres an old mate of mine tommy mcguire irishamerican been into arms dealing for years he was caught with a defective brake light in kilburn last night and a rather keen young woman probationer insisted on checking the boot of his car surprise surprise hannah bernstein said fifty pounds of semtex and two aks how delicious ferguson replied with his record which im sure he has that should draw ten years except for one thing hannah told him he says he wants a deal really he says he can give us jack barry dillon told him ferguson went very still frowning where is mcguire wandsworth hannah said naming one of london s bleaker prisons then lets go and see what he has to say and charles ferguson stood up wandsworth prison was one of the toughest in the country what was known as a hard nick ferguson saw the governor and served him with the kind of warrant that made that good man sit up no one was to see mcguire except those designated by ferguson not even scotland yards antiterrorist section and certainly not anybody from military intelligence in northern ireland or the royal ulster constabulary any deviation from such a ruling could have sent the governor himself to prison for breaching the official secrets act ferguson hannah bernstein and dillon waited in an interview room and a prison officer delivered mcguire and withdrew on ferguson s nod mcguire almost had a fit when he saw dillon jesus sean its you as ever was dillon offered him a cigarette and said to the others tommy and i go back a long way beirut sicily paris ira of course ferguson said not really tommy was never one for direct action but if there was a pound or two in it he could get you anything automatic weapons semtex rocket launchers got away with a lot because of his yank passport and the fact that he always acted as an agent for foreign arms firms german french he gave mcguire a light still fronting for old jobert out of marseilles but then you would he has the union corse protecting him he turned to hannah worse than the mafia that lot i know who they are dillon she looked at mcguire with total contempt two aks and fifty pounds of semtex were found in your car last night samples i presume who were you going to see no youve got it wrong mcguire told her i mean i didnt know they were there i was told there would be a car waiting for me at heathrow when i got in the key under the mat it must have been a setup ferguson said coldly well leave now okay okay mcguire said you were right about the stuff in the car being samples they were from jobert to tim pat ryan when i flew in i phoned to arrange the meet and discovered he was dead indeed he is ferguson said but there was some mention of jack barry mcguire hesitated barry used tim pat ryan as a front man in london it was ryan who fixed things up i can give you jack barry i swear it just listen get on with it then hannah said so you know jack barry no ive never met him then why are you wasting our time let me dillon said and offered mcguire another cigarette youve never met jack barry thats good because i have and hed cut your balls off for fun if you crossed him let me speculate jack inherited the sons of erin from dear old frank barry alas no longer with us the sons of erin would kill the pope which isnt surprising as our jack is one of the few protestants in the ira however hes had a fallingout with dublin sinn fein and the peace process probably thinks theyre a bunch of old women so i hear so let me speculate again his source of arms from dublin has dried up however theres family money in his background hes rich in his own right so hes dealing direct with jobert semtex guns whatever and youre the middle man ryan was in london but alas no more thats right mcguire said eagerly im supposed to meet barry in belfast in three days really ferguson said where exactly im to book in at the europa hotel and wait hell send for me when hes ready send for you where hannah bernstein asked how the hell would i know ive already told you ive never even met the guy the room went very still ferguson said is that really true of course it is ferguson stood up serve the warrant on the prison governor chief inspector deliver the prisoner to the holland park safe house she pressed the bell and the prison officer entered take him back to his cell and get him ready to leave mcguire said have we got a deal but the prison officer was already hauling him out dillon said are you thinking what i am you old bugger you must admit it would be a wonderful sting the brigadier said when is mcguire not mcguire this could lead us directly to barry and oh how id love to lay hands on that one there is one thing sir hannah bernstein said mcguire is an american and its too easy to spot a phoney american accent who are we going to get to play him we need someone who can pass as american and who can handle himself ferguson said thats a good point in fact it would seem to me theres an american dimension to all this i mean the president wouldnt be too happy to find out in the middle of peace negotiations for ireland that there was an american citizen trying to sell arms to one of the worst terrorists in the business dillon devious as usual was ahead of him are you suggesting that i speak to blake johnson it was hannah who said well thats what the basement is for sir who knows dillon said blake might feel like a holiday in ireland who better to play an american than an american especially one who can shoot a fly at twenty paces sometimes you really do get it right dillon ferguson smiled now lets get out of this dreadful place blake johnson was still a handsome man at fifty and looked younger a marine at nineteen hed left vietnam with a silver star a vietnamese cross of valor and two purple hearts a law degree at the university of georgia had taken him into the fbi when president jake cazalet had been a senator and subject to rightwing threats blake had managed to get to him when a police escort had lost him shot two men trying to assassinate him and taken a bullet himself it had led to a special relationship with the man who became president and an appointment as director of the general affairs department at the white house a cloak for the presidents private investigation squad the basement already during the present administration johnson had proved his worth had engaged in a number of black operations some of which had involved ferguson and dillon it was hot that afternoon when blake arrived at the oval office and found the president signing papers with his chief of staff henry thornton blake liked thornton which was a good thing because thornton basically ran the place it was his job to make sure the white house ran smoothly that the presidents programmes were advancing through congress that the presidents image was protected the pay was no big deal but it was the ultimate prestige job besides thornton had enough money from running the family law firm in new york before joining the president in washington thornton was one of the few men who knew the true purpose of the basement he looked up and smiled hey blake you look thoughtful as well i might blake said cazalet sat back bad lets say tricky ive had an interesting conversation with charles ferguson okay blake lets hear the worst when blake was finished the president was frowning and so was thornton cazalet said are you seriously suggesting you go to belfast impersonate this mcguire and try to take barry on his own turf blake smiled i havent had a vacation for a while mr president and it would be nice to see dillon again dear god blake no one admires dillon more than i do the service you and he did for me rescuing my daughter from those terrorists ill never forget that but this youre going into the war zone thornton said think about it blake youd be going into harms way and is it really necessary blake said gentlemen weve worked our rocks off for peace in northern ireland sinn fein have tried the loyalists have talked but again and again its these terrorist splinter groups on both sides who keep things going this man jack barry is a bad one i must remind you mr president that he is also an american citizen a serving officer in vietnam who was eased out for offences that can only be described as murder hes been a butcher for years and hes our responsibility as much as theirs i say take him out jake cazalet was smiling he looked up at thornton who was smiling too you obviously feel strongly about this blake i sure as hell do mr president then try and come back in one piece it would seriously inconvenience me to lose you oh id hate to do that mr president in london in his office at the ministry of defence ferguson put down the red secure phone and touched the intercom button come in a moment later dillon and hannah bernstein entered ive spoken to blake johnson hell be at the europa hotel the day after tomorrow booked in as tommy mcguire you two will join him what kind of backup will we have sir hannah asked youre the backup chief inspector i dont want the ruc in this or army intelligence from lisburn even the cleaning women are nationalists there leaks all over the place you dillon and blake johnson must handle it you only need one pair of handcuffs for barry it was dillon who said consider it done brigadier can you guarantee that as the coffin lid closing chapter four as frequently happened in belfast a cold north wind drove rain across the city stirring the waters of belfast lough rattling the windows of dillons room at the europa the most bombed hotel in the world he looked out over the railway station remembering the extent to which this city had figured in his life his fathers death all those years ago the bombings the violence now the powers that be were trying to end all that he reached for the phone and called hannah bernstein in her room its me are you decent no just out of the shower ill be straight round dont be stupid dillon what do you want i phoned the airport theres an hours delay on the london plane i think ill go down to the bar do you fancy some lunch sandwiches would do ill see you there it was shortly after noon the library bar quiet he ordered tea barrys tea ireland s favourite and sat in the corner reading the belfast telegraph hannah joined him twenty minutes later looking trim in a brown trouser suit her red hair tied back he nodded his approval very nice you look as if youre here to report on the fashion show tea she said sean dillon drinking tea and the bar open that i should live to see the day he grinned and waved to the barman ham sandwiches for me this being ireland what about you mixed salad will be fine and tea he gave the barman the order and folded the newspaper here we are again then sallying forth to help solve the irish problem and you dont think we can seven hundred years hannah any kind of a solution has been a long time coming you seem a little down he lit a cigarette oh thats just the belfast feeling the minute im back the smell of the place the feel of it takes over it will always be the war zone to me the bad old days i should go and see my fathers grave but i never do is there a reason do you think god knows my life was set the royal academy the national theatre youve heard all that and i was only nineteen yes i know the future laurence olivier and then my old man came home and got knocked off by brit paratroops accidentally sure i know all that but when youre nineteen you see things differently so you joined the ira and fought for the glorious cause a long time ago a lot of dead men ago the food arrived a young waitress served them and left hannah said and looking back its regrets time is it ah who knows by this time i could have been a leading man with the royal shakespeare company i could have been in fifteen movies he wolfed down a ham sandwich and reached for another i could have been famous didnt marlon brando say something like that at least youre infamous youll have to content yourself with that and theres no woman in my life youve spurned me relentlessly poor man no kith or kin oh more cousins in county down than you could shake a stick at and theyd run a mile if i appeared on the horizon they would wouldnt they but enough of this angst id like to know more about barry i knew his uncle frank barry better he taught me a lot in the early days until we had a falling out jack was always a bad one vietnam was his proving ground and the murder of vietcong prisoners the reason the army kicked him out all these years of the troubles hes gone from bad to worse another point as youve read in his file hes often been a gun for hire for various organizations around the world i thought that was you dillon he smiled touche the hard woman you are blake johnson entered the library bar at that moment he wore black raybans a dark blue shirt and slacks a grey tweed jacket the black hair touched by grey was tousled he gave no sign of recognition and moved to the bar poor sod he looks as if hes been travelling dillon said ive said it before and ill say it again dillon youre a bastard she stood up lets go and wait for him dillon called to the barman put that on room fiftytwo and followed her out rain rattled against the window as dillon got a halfbottle of champagne from the fridge and opened it the usual belfast weather but what can you expect in march he filled three glasses and took one himself good to see you blake and you my fine irish friend blake toasted him and turned to hannah chief inspector more fragrant than ever hey im the one who gets to make remarks like that dillon said anyway lets get down to it they all sat blake said ive read the file on barry hes a bad one but id like to hear your version sean it was his uncle i knew first frank barry he founded the sons of erin a rather vicious splinter group from the beginning he was knocked off a few years ago but thats another story jacks been running things ever since and you know him weve had our dealings over the years exchanged shots im not his favourite person lets put it that way and were certain that he hasnt met mcguire so mcguire says hannah told him and why would he lie he wants an out fine ive memorized all that stuff you sent on the computer mcguires past this french outfit he works for jobert and company and this tim pat ryan who nearly finished you off in london sean intriguing that a woman as executioner but as for barry id like to hear about him from you everything even if it is on file dillon complied and talked at length after a while blake nodded thats about it then im going to need my wits about me with this one theres one more thing you should know about the barrys first of all theyre an old protestant family protestant blake was incredulous its not so unusual dillon said there are plenty of protestant nationalists in irish history wolfe tone for example but in addition to that his greatuncle was lord barry which made frank barry the heir except that hes dead as you know are you trying to tell me jack barry is the heir apparent blake asked his father was franks younger brother but he died years ago which only leaves jack lord barry frank didnt claim the title and jack certainly hasnt it would give the queen and the privy council problems hannah told him i just bet it would blake said but jack takes it seriously dillon nodded an old family the barrys lots of history there theres a family estate and castle spanish head on the coast about thirty miles north of belfast its owned by the national trust now jack used to rhapsodize about it years ago so our jacks a complicated man anyway lets get down to it mcguire is to wait in the bar between six and seven for a message that his taxi is ready destination unknown of course i figure hell be waiting somewhere in the city with lots of ways out in case of trouble the dock area for example and youll follow thats the idea green land rover dillon passed him a piece of paper thats the number and what if you lose me its not possible hannah bernstein put a black briefcase on the table and opened it weve got a range finder in here follow you anywhere the very latest dillon told him the range finder was a black box with a screen watch this hannah said and pressed a button a section of city streets appeared the whole of northern ireland s in there very impressive blake told her even more so with this she opened a small box and took out a gold signet ring i hope it fits if not ive got another bug that you can pin anywhere you want blake tried the ring on his left hand and nodded feels good to me no weapon dillon said theres no way of fooling barrys people in that respect then youd better be right behind me oh well be there and armed to the teeth so the general idea is i lead you to barry and you jump him no police no backup this is a black one blake we snatch the bastard stick a hypo in him and get him to the airport where a lear jet will take us to farley field and afterwards our holland park safe house in london where the brigadier will have words hannah put in grand drugs they have these days dillon said hell be telling all before you know it although the chief inspector doesnt like that bit shut up dillon she said fiercely blake nodded no need to argue you two im happy to be here and the presidents happy no problem im in your hands and thats good enough for me the library bar was a popular watering hole for those in business who liked a drink before going home and was quite busy when blake went in just after six blake sat at the bar ordered a whiskey and soda and lit a cigarette tense but in control for one thing he had enormous faith in dillon it got to sixthirty he ordered another small whiskey and as the barman brought it to him a porter came in with a board saying mcguire thats me blake told him when he went down the steps to the red taxi it was raining hard he got in the back and noticed to his astonishment that the driver was a greyhaired woman good night to you sir she told him in the hard belfast accent you just sit back and ill tell you where youre going she drove away and dillon at the wheel of the land rover parked nearby hannah beside him followed the woman didnt say a word simply drove down to the docks passing through an area of desolation and decaying warehouses she pulled into a space beside an old ford transit van there you are sir out you get blake did exactly as he was told she drove away blake stood there in the rain waiting and the rear door of the transit opened and two men jumped out one was in a bomber jacket the other a bearded man wore an australian drovers coat down to his ankles both carried handguns mr mcguire the bearded one said im daley and this is bell daley and bell sounds like a cabaret act only it isnt one wrong move as they say on television and youre dead assume the position blake put his hands on the transit and spread his legs he was thoroughly checked satisfied daley said in the back and lets go the bench seats were comfortable enough daley sat opposite him and bell locked the door and got behind the wheel he drove away blake said anxiously look what is this im here in good faith and i expected to see mr barry and he cant wait to see you daley told him but itll be a while yet so have a cigarette and enjoy the trip dillon having seen the taxi turn in before had pulled into a side turning got out and approached on foot now he ran back to the land rover and got behind the wheel theyve transferred him white ford transit he told hannah and a few moments later was following it through the evening traffic the rain was relentless and as night fell it was obvious that they were moving out of town so its not belfast hannah observed so it would appear they came to a place where temporary lights had been set up because of roadworks the traffic had turned from two lanes to one damn hannah said just open the box girl well be all right she had the briefcase on her knee lifted the lid and went to work the map was clear even more so as it grew darker the transit had disappeared but that didnt matter time passed and they were still going north hannah said where in the hell are we going god knows dillon told her but i do have the glimmering of an idea such as were heading north and the antrim coast is close what about spanish head but thats crazy you told us it was owned by the national trust yes but these places dont open to the public till easter you cant be serious just keep your eye on that screen and well see there were a couple of windows in the transit they were proceeding along a coast road and for the moment the rain had stopped and the sky was stormy with a halfmoon they finally turned into a side road and paused at the gate a notice said spanish head national trust there was a cottage on the other side a light at the window bell sounded the horn and a door opened and an old man appeared he hesitated and bell called punch the bloody button harker and let us in the gate was obviously electronic the old man opened a box by the door fiddled inside the gate swung back and bell drove through blake saw a castle above steep cliffs towers battlements all very spectacular it was only as they got closer that blake saw that it was only a large country house built in nineteenthcentury gothic style the transit came to a halt bell got out came round and opened the door blake followed daley out and found himself in a courtyard this way mr mcguire daley told him bell opened a massive oak front door and led the way in there was a huge entrance hall a flagged floor an open fireplace and flags draped from poles the irish republican tricolour the union flag and surprisingly an old flag of the confederate states of america this way daley led the way up the sweeping stairs and blake followed bell bringing up the rear they passed along a wide corridor portraits everywhere and daley finally opened a great mahogany door they passed into a library there were more portraits a log fire in a great fireplace booklined walls and french windows standing open a man stood there looking out a glass of wine in his hand he was tall with good shoulders wearing a black sweater and jeans when he turned the face was handsome enough dark brooding and yet cruel mr mcguire jack barry the voice was still american and blake said my pleasure he tried to sound a little weak and shaken i was kind of worried oh stuff all this pretence mr johnson i know very well who you are blake johnson president jake cazalets personal minder you run the basement isnt that what you call it here have a glass of sancerre he took a bottle from an ice bucket filled a glass and offered it there you go i have it on good authenticity that the real mcguire is in the hands of brigadier charles ferguson and sean dillon and that my other dealer in london tim pat ryan is very dead indeed blake savoured the wine eightysix maybe eight seven barry said so you know my old friend sean dillon friend a slight exaggeration however lets get down to facts i have excellent sources but there are things you could tell me including details about that old bastard charles fergusons operations well i guess you can kiss my ass blake told him barry poured another glass of sancerre i thought you might take that attitude he nodded to daley i think the soak hole might do here bobby its cold out there and starting to rain again try him for an hour and see where it gets us it was raining hard as daley and bell took blake down through the grounds towards the cliffs and sheet lightning flickered over the water the waves raging below they started down a track bell leading the way a lamp in his hand halfway down he paused this is it white spray erupted with a hollow roar daley pushed blake forward in you go theres a ledge ten feet down youll be okay as its a cold night ill let you keep your clothes on blake hesitated then started down there were steps of a kind then a platform the spray cascaded up and he caught his breath god but it was cold daley said to bell watch him ill be back he started up to the castle i was right then dillon said as he and hannah approached the castle spanish head it is he coasted up to the gate and paused the engine still ticking over hannah got out and tried to open the gate without success no joy it must be electronic give me a moment there was a small stile to one side intended for pedestrians as she climbed over the door opened and an old man appeared here you cant do that this is private not any more it isnt she took her walther from her shoulder bag and put it under his chin do whatever you have to to open the gate and be quick about it he was terrified and showed it he went to the box and pressed the button and the gate opened dillon drove through pulled in to a parking spot to one side and switched off he got out and pushed the old man into the porch now lets see if ive got this right youll be the caretaker is anyone else in the cottage im a widower and your name harker john harker well i think youve been a naughty boy mr harker closed from september till easter and you allow unauthorized guests like my old friend jack barry i dont know what you mean the old man was shaking dillon produced his walther and said cheerfully maybe your memory will improve if i stick this behind your right kneecap and pull the trigger harker gave in instantly his lordships at home ill grant you that and what can i do about it an old man like me his lordship is it dillon laughed how often is he here on and off during the winter months and there are others who know estate workers from the village who will keep their mouths firmly shut i shouldnt wonder hannah said what else can we all do the old man said these are desperate times and his lordship is not a man to cross a bullet in the head is it dillon asked no need for that not with the soak hole to teach a man a lesson tim leary died in it last year and what would the soak hole be its a kind of funnel in the cliffs the sea explodes up through it his lordship puts people down there to teach them a lesson good god hannah said i shouldnt imagine hes got anything to do with it dillon told her and turned to harker to business a white ford transit van it arrived a little earlier right harker nodded it went down to belfast this afternoon came back about forty minutes ago who was in it bobby daley and sean bell two of his lordships men when it went just bell at the wheel when it came back and you were curious and went up the drive to see what was what harker was startled how did you know i know everything what happened i was some distance away but i saw bell open the vans rear door and bobby daley got out with another man and the three of them went inside and you being curious went closer stood under a tree or whatever and waited again harker was astonished and how would you be knowing that because im irish you daft bugger im from county down i have the second sight theres also the fact that youre wet through because you were standing in the rain now who does barry have up at the castle only daley and bell good man now well walk up there nice and quiet and you lead the way some suitable back path would do nicely anything you say sir lamps set in various parts of the grounds gave a certain amount of light as they walked along a narrow path through shrubbery and lush woodland the castle battlements looming beyond suddenly harker paused i think someones coming he whispered they moved into the trees and a moment later daley moved out of another path and started towards the castle thats him harker whispered thats bobby daley carried on towards the castle and dillon said wheres he been thats the thing theres only the cliffs and the soak hole down there dillon turned to hannah why would barry not make the meet in belfast why go to all the trouble of hauling blake up here it doesnt make sense only if it stinks she said i agree dillon turned to harker the soak hole it is and be discreet sean bell sheltered under a tree at the side of the track the lamp on the ground at his feet he was distinctly unhappy already wet from driving rain and couldnt even smoke since the cigarettes disintegrated in seconds there came a hollow booming sound like some dinosaur in pain as the soak hole erupted high into the air he wondered how the american was doing he wouldnt last long on a night like this there was a click as the silencer on the end of dillons walther nudged bell s right ear and dillon said the hard way mr bell is to blow your brains out so be good who the fug are ye bell gasped as dillon ran his hands over him and recovered a revolver webley long past its sellby date you must be hard up you lot and he stuffed the weapon in a pocket of his bomber jacket dillons the name oh my god tonights bad news for you i suspect youve got an american friend of mine somewhere nearby he ground the walther in again and bell cried out in pain hes in the soak hole the entrance is just down the track and why would he be in there barry knew he wasnt what he seemed we were waiting for him really well lead the way bell picked up the lamp and walked down the track stepping back as the soak hole thundered white spray high into the night watch him sean told hannah and walked to the edge of the steps leading down are you still there blake its dillon blake on the platform and hanging on to a rusting iron bolt colder than he had ever been in his life shouted back what kept you come away up dillon called a couple of minutes passed and then blake appeared climbing slowly jesus dillon that was bad i feel terrible takes me back to a tidal swamp i once spent six hours in back in vietnam what happened barry knew everything my name the president the basement he said he had excellent sources but wanted any facts i had to disclose about you and ferguson lets go up to the castle and oblige him only too happy blake said just one thing he turned to bell who was standing at the top of the steps heres for you you bastard he punched bell very hard and he went backwards headfirst with a cry a moment later the soak hole fountained can we go now dillon asked my pleasure blake led the way up to the courtyard and paused at the massive front door dillon said to harker down to the gate da sit inside and hold your tongue do that and i wont shoot you is it a bargain the old man scuttled away hannah said has anyone got a spare pistol here dillon produced the webley i think this should be in a museum but it will probably do the job then lets get on with it blake said and opened the door in the library daley put another log on the fire and barry stood by the french windows staring out as the rain drove against them a desperate night bobby i wonder how mr johnson is getting on better than you think blake said easing the door open and leading the way in they all stood in a kind of tableau and barry threw back his head and laughed dear god its you sean as ever was jack come to haunt you charles ferguson wants words even more so after what ive heard from my friend here an inside source of information it could only be at white house level you really are a naughty boy always was sean always was i presume bell has gone the way of all flesh absolutely ah well comes to us all pour mr johnson a brandy bobby a large one i expect he needs it he raised his glass to blake one old vietnam hand to another not really i killed but not in the way you did blake took the brandy from daley and looked at the paintings on the wall would that be a confederate uniform there barry looked at the portrait yes the stout gentleman on the end there was francis the first made his money in barbados in the eighteenth century sugar and slaves came back and bought a title they were all called francis thats where frank comes from until you yes jack for john the one who fought for the confederacy was killed at shiloh in letters home he said hed chosen that side because grey suited his eyes that would figure if hes anything like you blake said but lets get down to business you knew i was coming in place of mcguire what happened to him as you well know hes in a safe house in london emptying his guts hannah said the dog yes dillon told him but they usually are so you know everything it appears always did you know that always one step ahead thats what keeps me going and you wanted information about brigadier ferguson so we hear hannah said well i would wouldnt i always the old fox that one youll be seeing him soon enough dillon told him im sure youll have an interesting conversation im certain we will barry turned to the ice bucket and poured more sancerre he moved and stood at one side of the fireplace give mr johnson another brandy bobby im sure he could do with it daley went to the sideboard and reached for the brandy decanter then he pulled open a drawer and turned a gun in his hand there you go tables turned i think barry said but dillons hand was already under the back of his bomber jacket his hand swung up and there was a dull thud as he shot daley in the heart hurling him back against the sideboard still clutching the decanter as he crashed to the floor hannah cried out and dillon turned to see a section of the wood panelling beside the fireplace swing open and barry simply stepped back there was a click as dillon ran to it but the panelling was immovable damn his eyes blake said i should have known dillon told him hed never have used this place without an escape route or two its a rabbit warren well never catch him now hannah looked down at daley what about him should we call the ruc thats the last thing we need there was an indian rug on the floor and dillon rolled the body up in it help me get him on my shoulder blake did as he was told now what lets get out of here ill dispose of the evidence he can join bell in the soak hole he led the way down to the hall and blake got the massive door open rain dashed in and dillon said the grand night it is for dirty work ill see you at the gate and he strode away when blake and hannah reached the cottage there was no sign of harker although the light was still on they got into the land rover out of the rain and dillon appeared a few minutes later all done and dusted the paths of the wicked all reach a sticky end he went to the cottage door and kicked on it it opened and harker peered out we lost them dillon told him his lordship and daley took off through some secret passage theres a few of those up there anyway no need for barry to know of your part in this keep your mouth shut and youll be all right it never happened damn right ill keep my mouth shut ill open the gate for you dillon got behind the wheel of the land rover and drove out and started along the coast road now what hannah demanded you can call the lear jet to pick us up in the morning ferguson likes to hear bad news as soon as possible you know that he spoke over his shoulder to blake what about you is it back to washington no i think i should follow this through ill come to london with you and help you brave ferguson s wrath right then next stop the europa and some decent room service chapter five the lear jet flew over at midnight and they found flight lieutenants lacey and parry waiting for them ready for a seven oclock departure it was all very official the lear carried raf rondels and lacey and parry wore raf flying overalls with rank insignia nice to see you again mr johnson lacey said and turned to dillon who was last up the steps are we going into action again sean well lets put it this way i wouldnt book that holiday in marbella dillon said and went up the steps they took off and climbed to thirty thousand and turned across the irish sea hannah found the tea and coffee flasks and dillon three cups you said ferguson expects us like yesterday at the ministry of defence thats what he said how did he sound neutral dillon poured tea into his cup oh dear thats when hes at his wont the big surprise was ferguson in the daimler limousine waiting at farley field lacey took them across providing what shelter he could with a large golf umbrella get in for heavens sake and lets get on with it nice to see you blake sit beside me hannah and dillon took the jump seats and she pressed the button to close the dividing window right lets hear the worst ferguson carried on you do the talking dillon the irish are good at that youd never believe his sainted mother was from kerry dillon told blake but there you go and here i go he went through the events in belfast and at spanish head leaving nothing out ferguson listened his face grave until dillon was finished what a mess he actually knew you werent mcguire and that was only arranged within the last few days more than that brigadier he knows about the basement boasted about his inside source but who could that be has to be someone in the white house a lot of people operate out of there one way or another but the basement is supposed to be very hushhush ferguson said just like your outfit brigadier but how many people know about it blake observed computer accessing is another problem weve even had kids hack in so have we ferguson agreed and we do ourselves when we can sir hannah pointed out paris moscow even washington dillon said so youve no clues ferguson asked blake not really i had to use the travel bureau thats a polite name for the forging department i wanted a passport as tommy mcguire in case barry wanted to see it then there were travel arrangements plane tickets the room at the europa all as mcguire and all on computers hannah said but it still leaves the one incontrovertible fact that he knew who you were i dont like it ferguson showed a spark of anger dont like it at all and you can bet the president wont like it either you can say that again blake said with feeling ferguson nodded so whats to be done it was dillon who said ive been thinking about mcguire there might be more than hes told us what makes you think that hannah asked there always is with people like him youve been a copper long enough to know that he turned to ferguson let me have a go at him does that mean beating it out of him hannah demanded no just putting the fear of god in him ferguson nodded right its all yours good dillon said this is what well do the safe house at holland park was a midvictorian mansion behind high walls it looked innocuous enough but had the kind of security that made it impregnable mcguire had been amazed at the comfort his own room en suite television excellent food what he didnt know was that he was on screen even when he went to the toilet occasionally he was taken down to a drawing room that was very pleasantly furnished with an open fire and an even larger television he was served a more than decent meal there was even a bottle of chablis the guard was just as decent mr fox who didnt wear a uniform just a navy blue suit of course mcguire didnt realize that fox carried a smith amp wesson magnum in a holster under his left arm just as he didnt appreciate that the large goldframed mirror provided a perfect view for anyone in the next room which on this occasion meant ferguson blake and hannah bernstein they watched mcguire finishing his lunch fox standing against the wall there was a knock at the door fox unlocked it and dillon walked in well you seem to be doing all right tommy he said mcguire stared at him its you what do you want oh just to bringyou up to date on what happened in ulster he lit a cigarette took the halfbottle of wine from its bucket and poured it into mcguires empty glass he sampled it not bad yes we missed out on jack barry he managed to fly the coop we got rid of two of his men daley and bell do they mean anything to you never heard of them the strange thing was that barry was expecting my american friend blake the man who was impersonating you he knew everything about him knew he worked for the president claimed to have inside intelligence sources look none of this has anything to do with me mcguire said i told you everything i know about barry if you lost him thats your problem well a problem it certainly is old son but yours not mine you see i think youre a terrible liar i believe you know a lot more than youre telling thats bollocks ive told you everything i know really all right wed better let you go let me go mcguire was astonished well you did put us on to barry bad luck he slipped us but not your fault and lets face it it isnt the kind of thing we would want advertised in open court he nodded to fox bring in the chief inspector certainly sir fox went and opened the door and called and hannah entered an officiallooking document in one hand collect the prisoners things and deliver him to heathrow airport she told him and turned to mcguire thomas mcguire i have here a warrant for your deportation as an unwanted alien according to records you entered the country on an illegal flight from paris and you will be returned there i have no idea how the french authorities will treat you now look here mcguire began and dillon interrupted him good luck tommy youre going to need it what do you mean jack barry has a lot of friends all over europe and the middle east the plo the libyans people like that hes even done business with the mafia over the years whats that got to do with me he knows my friend blake johnson wasnt you so i presume hell want to know what you were playing at hes going to want your balls tommy so good luck he turned away and mcguire said for gods sake hes a sadist that one i mean he killed one guy in ireland by putting him through a cement mixer there was silence hannah said is that a fact mr mcguire he looked at her then dillon then sat down im not stirring then talk dillon told him the door opened and ferguson and blake entered all right man get on with it ferguson said give me a cigarette for gods sake dillon offered him one from his old silver case and gave him a light let it all hang out tommy youll feel much better as i told you id never met barry personally but he dealt with jobert in marseilles and i worked for jobert so i used to meet guys barry sent over from ireland on arms business there was one a man called doolin who i had dealings with in paris patrick doolin dillon broke in i know that name found hanging in his cell at the maze prison thats him mcguire said we went out on the town one night in paris ended up having supper on one of those dining boats that ply up and down the river decent food plenty to drink he got pissed out of his mind started going on about barry and what an animal he was the story had a certain fascination and they all waited doolin said he used to chauffeur for barry i think it must have been about three years ago it happened he was driving him somewhere at night and barry was drunk and on something i mean really high he told doolin hed just stiffed five british army undercover agents four men and a woman said hed put one of them through a cement mixer i think the others were shot i cant recall my god hannah said what else dillon was relentless you know he runs the sons of erin he said that the coup was thanks to the new york branch with a little help from someone he called the connection the connection ferguson asked yes someone way on the inside apparently he told doolin it was just like in the old days when mick collins had detectives at dublin castle working for him it would seem he told doolin a lot hannah said ferguson nodded keep him safe mr fox well be in touch brigadier ferguson turned to the others all right lets go sitting in his office an hour later with blake ferguson was surprised when hannah came in dillon behind her ive found something sir hannah told him three years ago an undercover squad in ulster was taken out four men and a woman the leader major peter lang was the subject of a car bomb so huge no remains were found here are the details on the other four it has to be what barry was referring to dear god peter lang my old friend roger langs boy ferguson said you met his mother lady helen lang at tony emsworths funeral the lovely lady on the terrace dillon said with that kind of proof id say were on to something so whats the next move i think i should have words with the president blake said ferguson shook his head not yet blake i know youre a free agent but please hold back just for now there are things id like to do here he turned to hannah was there any backup information any connection with barry no sir and i must tell you ive accessed both mi and mi he sat there brooding phone simon carter at once his ears only ask him what he knows about frank barry and the sons of erin and any sort of inside leak possibly from the white house certainly sir she went out ferguson stood up theres a good canteen here blake lets get a sandwich and await events they were sitting at a corner table half an hour later when hannah came in and sat down he was his usual irate self sir well almost what do you mean ferguson asked he seemed sort of shocked in a way i got the feeling he knew all about it but he couldnt have that devious bugger could lie to the almighty dillon told her i must say he came back damn quick gave me jack barrys history and thats all everything we already know and nothing about washington or the sons of erin blake turned to dillon is carter still deputy director of the security services absolutely then if he doesnt know anything ferguson said to hannah get him on your mobile she did so and passed it across simon ferguson said i must see you the terrace at westminster in thirty minutes now look here ferguson just finalizing a report for the prime minister id welcome your input and ferguson switched off and sat there thinking about it finally he said ill take you blake as the presidents representative that will impress him and you dillon because you always unbalance him if ever a man hated me its dear old carter yes well i like to have him on edge ferguson turned to hannah youre the computer genius my dear check everything that could possibly have a significance he stood up lets be on our way gentlemen the house of commons together with the house of lords is a remarkable institution and not only because of its extraordinary history as the seat of government for the united kingdom its location on the thames is unique but it is its facilities which are extraordinary twentysix restaurants and bars provide not only excellent food but some of the cheapest in london even someone with ferguson s pull had to stand in line as the queue inched forward to be checked thoroughly by the largest policemen in london they finally made the central lobby moved in through a maze of corridors and found the entrance to the terrace overlooking the thames it was the chilly end of march weather but sunny enough for them to have the awnings open there were plenty of people about members of the house of lords at one end members of the commons at the other foreign visitors and guests of every description thank god youre wearing a jacket dillon makes a change at least you look respectable dillon waved to a waiter who had glasses of champagne on a tray are you with the japanese delegation sir what else dillon passed a glass to blake another to ferguson who accepted with reluctance and took one himself they stood at the parapet and looked down at the thames how good is the security blake asked fiveknot current down there dillon said even a navy seal would have problems but not this little bastard ferguson told blake floated in here the other year when your president and the pm were meeting just to show carter the security precautions were no good turned up as a waiter and served them canapes blake exploded into laughter dillon said carter was not best pleased well he wouldnt be would he blake said and at that moment carter appeared he made a face when he saw dillon for gods sake ferguson do we have to have this little swine here god save your honour dillon told him tis a kindness for you to see me a grand man like yourself dillon is here because i need him so thats that this is blake johnson president jake cazalets personal security man yes i know of mr johnson carter shook hands reluctantly to business ferguson said chief inspector bernstein asked you for information relevant to frank barry and the sons of erin i told her everything i know shes probably checked it out for herself on our computer i know you do that and so do you so you know nothing about an american connection with barry possibly in the white house if i had id have told you ferguson turned to blake you do the honours tell him everything when blake was finished carter was remarkably calm much of this could be nonsense why believe mcguire why accept what the wretched doolin said on the other hand when blake was in barrys hands barry said he had excellent sources dillon pointed out and he must have because he was expecting me he knew i wasnt mcguire blake put in carter seemed to have nothing to say and ferguson waved to the waiter with the champagne another gentlemen even you might do with one carter if you say so one final point the undercover group wiped out by jack barry three years ago major peter lang and company you made no mention of that to chief inspector bernstein because she didnt ask me the facts are there on the computer for all to see however there has never been any suggestion that barry and the sons of erin had anything to do with that affair trawl all you like ferguson there is no such file now is there anything else im a busy man not really ill tell the prime minister youve been as cooperative as usual carter frowned you mean to involve the pm in this matter you of all people know my unique position in that respect the prime ministers private army isnt that what you call my department damn you carter exploded and turned on his heel there you go then dillon grinned what next ive already fixed a meet with the prime minister this afternoon ferguson said ill take you in with me so that he can share your input blake you dillon will stay in the car as usual dillon smiled at blake nothing changes and i know my place back at the ministry of defence they found hannah bernstein still at the computer anything to report ferguson asked i did come across one interesting thing sir according to various sources the security services have been less than generous over the past two yean with sensitive information having to do with irish operations as regards our american friends the word was that such material did seem to end up in the hands of sinn fein on a regular basis so whats been happening ferguson asked oh the general flow hasnt stopped but it would seem that the quality of the material has left a great deal to be desired frankly its been the kind of stuff you could get from the political page of the better newspapers a few titbits thrown in occasionally dillon cut in but no more details of undercover operations so it would appear but if this was an official sis attitude blake said wouldnt you have known about it im the last person theyd tell ferguson said theyve always hated my privileged position with the prime minister placed every obstacle in my way offered as little cooperation as theyve been able to get away with i know the feeling blake said i have my own problems with the cia and the fbi so what were saying is that carter and his people knew about what happened three years ago dillon said maybe not straight away but at some stage id say so ferguson nodded and turned to hannah put your fine cambridge mind on it chief inspector we have two facts that are certain sir something made them start treating our american friends with enough suspicion to offer innocuous material and disinformation id say at an earlier stage they probably heard about what happened but decided it was simply beyond proof and the second fact that there isnt a file at least not now if the deputy director says so i believe him do you blake asked ferguson oh yes it fits they play their own games you see with the peace process so important they would decide they didnt want to give the prime minister a problem because that would have involved the president and given him a problem it would have also brought me in and involved you the bastards blake said yes but they werent losing anything if they were sending your people useless information ferguson said we dealt with the nazis during the second world war in the same way conned the abwehr rotten all the same it makes you wonder whos running the country dillon said hannah nodded so what do you intend to see the prime minister ive no choice just as blake has no choice president cazalet will expect a report on the barry affair and i cant see blake telling him less than the whole truth exactly blake agreed and the question of the sis involvement sir hannah asked but there isnt one no file no knowledge of anything untoward astonishment at mcguires story and delicate hints that its all rubbish so thats it hannah said not at all ill see the prime minister bring him up to date and from now on handle this whole business my way and god help simon carter dillon said the daimler was admitted through the security gates at downing street ferguson said i dont think well be long sure and im used to waiting when we come to this place dillon grinned at blake im useful when they need a hired gun but an embarrassment to the great man in there all the same id read the times if i were you its very instructive ferguson said and got out followed by blake the policeman saluted the door swung open and an aide smiled a welcome brigadier mr johnson the prime minister expects you he took them upstairs past the portraits of all the previous prime ministers then along a corridor knocked briefly at the study door and opened it the prime minister was sitting behind his desk stood up and came round to shake hands with ferguson brigadier prime minister when you came to office we discussed the peculiar circumstances of my position with you do you recall my mentioning that the president had a similar outfit working for him the basement yes prime minister this is blake johnson who runs it the pm shook hands with blake be seated gentlemen you did indicate this was a matter of grave importance very much so ferguson said then tell me when ferguson was finished the prime minister sat there frowning an incredible story what happens next mr johnson will have to report to his president i would suggest he does that when he gets back to my office i agree as it happens i have to speak to the president on matters concerning the peace process in ireland later this evening ill discuss this affair with him and make it clear i have complete faith in you and mr johnson and what about the position of the deputy director of the security services what position the prime ministers face was calm they know nothing simon carter was definite on that score no file was his phrase good this would appear to be exactly the kind of thing my predecessors expected you to handle brigadier so handle it you have my word prime minister he and blake stood the door opened as if by magic and they were escorted out as it happened blake was unsuccessful in trying to speak to the president he was finally routed to the chief of staffs secretary who told him that the president was in boston making a speech afterwards he was going down to his house on nantucket for a threeday break next blake spoke to his secretary alice quarmby and because he was using the codex four line he was able to speak openly i was worried about you she said you should be that bastard barry slipped the net but he almost got me this sons of erin outfit he runs he spoke of a new york branch check it out and see what you can find right away i need to get back fast so see if theres anything military leaving the uk later today ill call you back in ferguson s office they had a final discussion it was hannah who stated the obvious theres nothing more we can do over here yes its up to you old son dillon said new york branch of the sons of erin he laughed sounds like one of those irish theme pubs blake frowned you know something thats not a bad idea which still leaves you with the mystery of the white house hannah told him like one of those agatha christie murder mysteries the thing about those mystery novels my dear ferguson said was that they were always very simple the butler did it dillon said no but there were usually no more than a dozen people staying at the country house for the weekend and it had to be one of them the phone rang he listened then nodded hang on he looked at blake your secretary checked with air transport and we have an raf gulfstream flying to the states this evening they could drop in at farley field and pick you up there just the ticket blake told him ferguson said confirmed and put the phone down thats it then dillon grinned its all up to you now old son well be waiting with bated breath washington nantucket new york chapter six in his office at the white house blake greeted alice with enthusiasm hed managed to sleep on the plane and had had one of those difficult breakfasts that took no notice of time differences but he badly needed to shower and change which he did the moment he got to the office he so frequently had to sleep there overnight that he kept a change of clothes ready when he got to his desk shaved shampooed and resplendent in a blue flannel suit alice handed him coffee with approval thats taken ten years off you look at my intray ive done my best tell me what happened blake ran the basement in a most peculiar way he had only one member of staff which was alice every time there was work to do he pulled in members of a secret list friends from fbi days usually retired or invalided out experts of every kind from university professors to old comrades from vietnam whatever or whoever was necessary he operated things like a marxist cell system nobody knew what anyone else was doing except alice who was outraged now by his story it beggars belief that there is a spy in the white house why not weve had them everywhere else the pentagon the cia the fbi okay i take your point she poured him another coffee too much is on computers these days thats the real problem and in spite of every precaution its too easy to get at yes lifes a bitch blake said speaking of which did you get anywhere with the sons of erin not much jack barrys in the cia and fbi files but thats the only mention of the sons of erin blake sat there frowning but he definitely mentioned them he laughed suddenly ive just remembered something dillon said that the sons of erin sounded like an irish theme pub she laughed its a thought okay so lets take a different route pubs restaurants dining clubs see what you can do i hear and obey o master she went out and blake got down to the paperwork it was no more than an hour later that she returned my god it was so easy once i looked in the right place she had a piece of paper in her hand the sons of erin its listed under irish dining clubs operates out of a bar and restaurant called murphys its in the bronx blake looked at the address then checked his watch i can just make the shuttle to new york phone get me a seat get me a car and book me a suite on the government something befitting my dignity she was laughing uproariously as she went out murphys was on haley street it was just after three when blakes car drew up outside it hadnt the usual irish theme pub look to it all green and gold harps this was older more solid wait here george blake said to his driver got out and walked to the door inside it was dark and very oldfashioned with dining booths and lots of mahogany panelling a couple of people were finishing a late meal in one of the booths but the lunchtime trade was through the barman was old seventyfive at least his sleeves rolled up reading spectacles on the end of his nose as he checked the sports page of the new york times hi there blake said ill have a bushmills whiskey and water well youve got taste at least the old man reached for a bottle blake said with a name like dooley i should have it was a friend told me to look in here a guy called barry the old man pushed the drink across i dont recall him have one yourself the old man took a large one and downed it quickly he told me he used to be in a dining club here called the sons of erin jesus that was just a handful of guys four or five of them nothing special about it except for the senator the senator sure senator michael cohan real nice guy hey thats very interesting who were the others oh lets see now patrick kelly he ran a lot of construction work near here tom cassidy he had a string of irish pubs who else he frowned have another well thank you dont mind if i do he poured the drink drank half of it and nodded brady martin brady teamsters union guy say i heard he got knocked off the other week what do you mean wasted someone made a hit when he was coming out of the union gym one night he leaned closer i heard he had mob troubles know what i mean yeah sure so tell me when do the sons of erin meet i mean which night oh it isnt some kind of regular thing just now and then they havent had a meet here in months really blake slipped a twenty over the bar guess i missed my chance then nice talking to you keep the change well thank you outside in the car he called alice on his mobile take this down he gave her the names of the members of the dining club check the new york police department computer for details of the murder of brady im on my way to the pierre now ill check back with you in an hour why dont ever get the pierre why you because im a very important man alice you know its your overwhelming ego that makes you so attractive she put down the phone he was having coffee and sandwiches in his room when she phoned back are you sitting down that bad you could say that you wanted me to check out bradys murder thats what i said well i decided to put them all through the nypd computer in case this sons of erin thing provided a link and did it you could say that theres no mention of the group as such but brady kelly and cassidy are all in there go on they were all shot to death blake brady first some kind of mob street shooting cassidy three nights later rumours about a protection racket kelly three days after a robbery while he was out for a run at his place in ossining my god blake said stunned and not a word there were newspaper reports but they were all separate nothing to link them together if you didnt know about the sons of erin youd have no reason to think they werent what they seemed to be thats true are you going to tell the police im not sure what about senator cohan hes not on the nypd computer but then again hes still alive he was on larry king live last night what for oh irish peace as usual everyones into it at the moment hes going to london to put his six cents worth in to stay hot with his irishamerican voters what do you want me to do those presidential warrants we keep in the office the blank ones with the presidents seal and signature fill one out in the name of captain harry parker fax me a copy here he gave her the room fax number who is this guy a product of zero tolerance on the streets of good old new york he runs a special homicide unit top detectives fancy computers i knew him when i was in the fbi so he owes you one it doesnt matter once i present him with that warrant hes mine ill be in touch next he phoned ferguson at the ministry of defence in london as it was eight oclock in the evening there he was rerouted to the cavendish square flat youre not going to like this he said to ferguson and gave him the bad news including the sons of erin background ferguson said someone would appear to mean business you could say that ive been thinking about ryans death in london after all he was connected with barry as well could you get details from scotland yard we know dillon thought the killer was a woman but i was wondering about the weapon that was used right away ill be back to you in half an hour he telephoned records at scotland yard then phoned dillon youd better get round here fast dillon was there in ten minutes was admitted by kim and went upstairs as ferguson s fax machine was pumping out two sheets whats happening dillon asked ferguson was reading the sheets he looked up and passed them over the report on ryan when they took him out of the river an unusual gun killed him look for yourself dillon did then nodded colt a womans gun but deadly when used with hollowpoint cartridges he handed the fax back so what ive just had blake on from new york hes found the sons of erin dillon and most of them are dead three of them shot to death within a sevenday period and all within the last couple of weeks dillon whistled the only one left as far as we know is senator michael cohan of new york jesus and hes due over here in a few days for some irish peace thing at the dorchester thats all we need an american senator knocked off in london the prime minister is certain to give us the job of looking after him so what now ill speak to blake and give him the facts in his room at the pierre blake listened intently then nodded im going over to see a top homicide specialist tonight if possible heres my room fax number send the material and ill let you know what i find out is dillon there ill put him on so whats your hunch on this one my irish friend well youve heard the old saying once is okay twice is coincidence three times is enemy action and this is four you really think its the same person a woman i know one thing someone or some group wanted the sons of erin stiffed and four out of five is good going if i were this senator michael cohan id be worried sick so would i ill stay in touch dillon put the phone down so we wait and see he said to ferguson will you tell the prime minister not yet and carter bugger carter now have a nightcap with me and be off with you in his office at one police plaza harry parker was considering going home it had been a hard day three drugrelated shootings six wearying interrogations and a mountain of paperwork he was thinking of dropping in at his favourite bar when the phone rang harry that you who is this blake johnson why you old dog i havent seen you since the delaney investigation what was that two years ago three they tell me youve left the fbi ive gone up in the world ill tell you when i see you and when would that be oh id say around fifteen minutes but i was just leaving harry what if i told you im speeding towards you on presidential business id say you were full of shit there was only silence and parker said you are arent you tell me that you are blake and then every instinct acquired over twentyfive years on the street alerted him jesus what am i getting into something fascinating i assure you just put the coffee on harry parker sat there thinking about it he was fortyeight years of age a pound black man from harlem whod gone to columbia on a scholarship and hadjoined the force immediately afterwards a policeman was all hed ever wanted to be and hed never minded night shifts and seventyhour weeks although his wife had shed left him ten years earlier had married a baptist preacher in georgia but it still left harry with his son a doctor and a daughter who was a fledgling reporter for the local cbs station a single mother whod borne him a granddaughter two years earlier he picked up the phone and called the deli across the street hey myra captain parker ive got to work late send over grilled cheese sandwiches for two fries and coffee he opened a drawer took out a pack of cigarettes hesitated then lit one he was supposed to have stopped but what the hell it was probably going to be a long night he stood at the window looking out at the rain and the phone rang captain parker a mr johnson to see you send him up a moment later there was a knock at the door but when it opened it was a boy from the deli put it on the table over there parker said and blake johnson appeared in the doorway hey that smells good ive hardly had anything to eat all day so now you want to steal mine parker waved the boy away you might as well sit down then they took chairs opposite each other in the corner the low table between them and blake took a sandwich excellent parker took the lid off one of the coffees feel free just leave me to starve youre looking disgustingly well so tell me what this is about blake took an envelope from his pocket read that he reached for another sandwich parker opened the envelope and took out the fax jesus a presidential warrant only the fax copy the real article is on its way to you by presidential messenger parker was astonished blake ive never even seen one of these things only heard of them i know youre not fbi any more but what are you cia secret service neither harry i work for the great man himself which means my department is very special very secret harry i report to the president only which explains the warrant in this matter you no longer owe allegiance to the new york police department or the mayor you owe allegiance to one person only the president of these united states do you accept that do i have a choice no this is a matter of national security im handling to which your professional expertise is essential suddenly harry parker felt great he reached for a sandwich and smiled im your man blake im your man tell me all later sitting in front of his computer sleeves rolled up he said ill feed in all this london stuff on ryan his fingers tapped the keys okay now lets start on the members of the sons of erin rain drummed against the window and parkers fingers moved nimbly number one martin brady teamsters union came out of the union gym one night and was shot in the back of the neck as he leaned over to unlock the car thats a typical mob execution and we know they had it in for him yeah blake said but for that kind of hit doesnt the mafia emulate the cia they usually use a small calibre like a parkers fingers moved over the keys youre right but in this case it was a colt with hollowpoint bullets he sat back jesus let me go back to those facts on ryan he tapped away colt would that be a coincidence blake asked hell no ill put the images in for a match and i smell there is one lets have a look at the other ones parker went back to work three days later cassidy comes out of his new restaurant in the bronx at one in the morning police intelligence said there was a protection racket operation and figured he was a victim he tapped again and shook his head this is fucking unbelievable the weapon involved was a colt one to go blake told him parker went to work patrick kelly construction millionaire in the habit of rising at six am and going for a fivemile run found shot in the heart at his country home in ossining always wore a fifteenthousanddollar gold divers watch and gold chain round his neck both missing he turned to blake listed as an armed robbery gone bad so now check the weapon used parker did as he was told waited for the result then nodded beautiful the same weapon from london to new york he turned what do you think i think the killer was very smart except for using the same weapon you notice the pattern here that cleverly offers an explanation for each killing brady the mafia cassidy a protection racket kelly a robbery as you say smart and as the killings had no apparent link maybe this business of the same gun would never have come out except for you but theres a puzzle here the fact that in london my associate said that the person who shot ryan was a woman hell no the fact that the colt used in london was the colt used in three murders in new york now that astounds me who in the hell gets through airport security these days with a weapon blake nodded slowly and then brightened maybe people who use private planes harry important people rich people who are waved through for gods sake what is this all about parker asked i cant tell you but i promise that when i can youll be the first to know well thanks very much blake stood up its the best i can do harry now ive got to see the president and he walked out in london it was well past midnight but he phoned ferguson anyway and found the brigadier in bed curiouser and curiouser brigadier ferguson fully awake sat up tell me blake did what do you think he asked when he was finished some loyalist group which had the target of taking out the sons of erin blake dear boy im an old dog long in this business and i go by instinct one gun in london and new york means one killer id stake my life on it but a woman its incredible im old enough to know that nothing is incredible in this life youll be seeing the president yes senator michael cohan is due in london in a few days point that out to the president maybe he should stay home new york london blake shrugged they both seem to be pretty dangerous places these days at the same time in a safe house on the cliffs of county down ulster jack barry was having a drink in the kitchen when his coded mobile rang it was the connection where in the hell have you been barry demanded im a busy man my friend blake johnson turned up in washington so i presume youre on the run you can say that again sean dillon and some woman chief inspector came with him i lost two men but managed to slip them good no mention of our arrangement i trust of course not barry lied excellent ill keep you posted the connection rang off barry cursed he hated not knowing who he was dealing with but then none of the sons of erin did they only knew each other he thought for a moment then used his coded mobile to call senator michael cohan theyd met in the states several times and got on well cohan loved it all the hairraising stories the action by night the glamour cohan answered at once who is this barry did i catch you at a bad time yes theres a party here ive taken refuge in my study i meant to phone you myself but ive just gotten back from mexico just got bad news apparently martin brady was murdered some street killing they say its the mob thats a coincidence tim pat ryan got it the same way the other day is that a fact the senator said mind you he was a true gangster that one what about kelly and cassidy i havent talked to them in a couple of months maybe i should a door crashed open in the background and there was drunken laughter my god here they come ill be in touch and he rang off blake had arranged an air force plane for the following morning the brief flight was uneventful the weather was squally march again but the young major in charge of transportation was all efficiency the chief of staff is with the president at nantucket sir he ordered us to send you on your way by helicopter beach landing blake asked thats it sir hell i did enough of those in nam before my time sir if youll come this way ive got sandwiches and coffee departure thirty minutes from now he held his umbrella high and blake followed him across the tarmac the old clapboard house on nantucket had been in the cazalet family for years it held every possible memory for the president childhood school vacations and twice it had been a place to grow strong again after being wounded in vietnam other bitter memories were there too his wifes slow demise from leukaemia and then the terrorist threat following his discovery of a wonderful daughter late in life the comtesse marie de brissac now in paris teaching art at the sorbonne he had always loved the beach in any kind of weather was walking there now with henry thornton and a secret service man clancy smith trailing them the presidents flatcoat retriever murchison pounding in and out of the water they all wore storm coats against the wind which was blowing hard the surf roared in it was good to be alive and washington was far away the president stopped and waved his hand twice and clancy who knew what that meant shook a marlboro from his pack lit it inside his coat and passed it across ive said it before thornton told him do that on television and youll lose votes its a free country henry it may not be healthy but it doesnt make me a bad person he leaned down and fondled murchisons ears now if i beat this wonderful dog that would be different there was a roaring in the distance clancy listened via his earpiece helicopter coming in mr president its blake johnson thats goodjake cazalet said lets find out what happened in ireland and he led the way along the beach to the distant house in the living room blake sat opposite the president and thornton leaned by the fireplace the prime minister and i had a conversation on this matter as you know but the whole thing seemed so implausible the man barry for example only too real sir and boasted about his sources which have to be in the white house the plain fact is barry knew who i was knew i worked for you knew everything it would seem but leaks from my white house i cant believe it it happens all the time mr president ask any journalist about his sources the chief of staff said theres no reason to think were immune and so much information is accessible blake said everythings on the computer these days weve got all kinds of safeguards in place but i can access the cia at langley if i need to and im sure that if they really try hard they could access the basement files even this conversation is being recorded oh god thats right that security thing you had to install right the president asked correct sir and it is linked by direct line to washington coded of course the chief of staff said with some irony supposedly picked up by the records department at the white house and filed as indicated on a computer thornton said and the curse of the system is that there are a lot of people around who can access any computer known to man and there are a lot of people employed at the white house cazalet said although this connection of barrys implies an irish dimension or some sort of ira sympathy but mr president that covers a lot of possible ground thornton said even my mother was irishborn she came from county clare as an infant it was my fathers family the thorntons who were english my grandmother on my mothers side was a dublin woman cazalet smiled and turned to blake what about you mr president johnson is english enough but i take the chief of staffs point its always been said that around forty million people in the countrys population are of irish stock if you consider people like yourself and the chief of staff who have some sort of irish past in their family history then god knows how many it touches a considerable proportion of the white house staff i should think thornton put in you can say that again needless to say ill leave no stone unturned however ive left the really bad news till last you mean it gets worse the president shook his head better get on with it blake as blake gave his account of the lives and deaths of the sons of erin the president and the chief of staff sat horrified when blake was finished cazalet said this passes belief is the prime minister in possession of all these facts not all mr president brigadier ferguson felt he should wait until id completed my investigation cazalet sat there frowning then turned to thornton a drink is very definitely indicated here make mine a scotch and water no ice you gentlemen feel free to indulge yourselves he went and opened the french window and breathed deeply in the cold air thornton gave him his scotch may i make a point please do i think were shying away from senator cohan here explain theres an implication of some mysterious connection presumably passing out choice items of information on the irish situation to the sons of erin and a strong suspicion that tim pat ryan was their connection in london so cazalet said these were bad guys mr president they must have been if they were involved with jack barry which means that senator cohan is a bad guy id already thought of that the president said could he be the connection i doubt it blake said if he were why go public by being a member of the dining club that makes sense cazalet frowned and thornton said what do we do officially nothing the president said cohanll deny any involvement and proof would be difficult can you forbid him to go to london what for if hes a target hes a target in both london or new york besides despite what he says in the papers his visit is not on my behalf its to make him look good to the voters so what happens thornton asked what do we do the president turned to blake first tell ferguson to inform the prime minister of the recent turn of events ill discuss it with the pm at an appropriate time and senator cohan whats that fine old british phrase dillon uses put the boot in thats it mr president well put the boot into senator cohan frighten him send him running watch every move with luck something might turn up at your command mr president id better get back i held the helicopter over it can wait lunch gentlemen and then you can return to a troubled world blake it was some three hours later that senator michael cohan received a phone call at his new york office its me the connection told him with some bad news senator im afraid the sons of erin have fallen upon bad times theyre all dead brady cassidy kelly ryan all dead and interestingly enough all killed by the same gun cohan was aghast this is terrible i cant believe it i heard about brady and ryan but kelly and cassidy too for gods sake whats going on youve heard of the last of the mohicans the connection laughed well youre the last of the sons of erin i wonder where the axe will fall next the president knows of your involvement by the way ill deny it ill deny everything how do you know this ive told you before anything that comes into the white house i know who are you god i wish id never gotten involved well you did and as to who i am thatll have to remain one of lifes great mysteries i could be using a voice distorter i could be your best friend i could be a woman in fact they think it was a woman who killed ryan in london damn you taken care of now listen carefully the president has authorized blake johnson to speak to you tell you something about whats going on advise you to take to the hills what shall i do im due in london in three days yes i know in my opinion i think you should go i dont think itll be any more dangerous for you there than here and while youre away ill see what i can do about our problem youre sure of course when johnson sees you just play dumb you ate together once in a while and you have no idea whats going on but whos doing all this is it the fucking protestants more likely british intelligence that means youll be safe in london how do you make that out because youre an american senator and whatever else they wont want you to buy it in london ill try and believe that good ill be in touch ill handle it henry thornton put the phone down panicky and when a man panicked he could do anything a liability now cohan with any luck that mysterious killer out there would take care of him if not maybe hed have to have help as for barry hed leave that for a while see what happened to cohan he went to the sideboard and poured a whiskey irish of course hed told the president the truth his sainted mother had been born in county clare what he hadnt mentioned was that she had had an illegitimate halfbrother by her father a volunteer with michael collins in the easter rising in dublin hed been executed by the brits and thornton had grown up with the mans name in his ears but there was much more than that doing postgraduate work at harvard in thornton had met a lovely irish catholic girl from queens university belfast named rosaleen fitzgerald shed been the absolute love of his life theyd spent one idyllic year true love way beyond sexuality and then it had happened shed gone home for the summer vacation and had been in the wrong belfast street at the wrong time a firefight between brit paratroopers and the ira that had left her dead on the sidewalk his hatred of all things british had become absolute growing up even with all the success all the money it had meant nothing and then had come the chance to strike back he sipped the whiskey fuck you he said softly ill have my day at his office in manhattan the following day cohan received blake with enthusiasm heard him out with appropriate sounds of horror and disbelief and walked him to the door with grave shakes of his head he promised to be careful in london but no he had to go it was for a very important cause and hed promised please keep me up to date he said to johnson shaking his hand and staring sincerely into his eyes blake promised that he would afterwards blake spoke briefly to the president and then phoned ferguson in london what will you do he asked ill see the prime minister place all the new facts before him and wait to hear the outcome of his chat with the president and cohan you tell me the president wont forbid him to come so he will come ill have the job of protecting him and what do you think will happen as i told you im an old dog long in this business i go by instinct and every instinct tells me he will die in london ferguson hung up london chapter seven at compton place it was raining lady helen lang was out riding heavily protected by storm coat and rain hat the wind blew in across the north sea all the way from holland churning the waves into surf that pounded on the shingle beaches she cantered through pine woods down to the sand dunes of the estuary reined in her mare and let the rain bring her to life come on dolly she patted the mares neck lets go home she didnt need to dig her heels in dolly took off like a rocket and galloped through the pine woods swerving at a touch of the rein and taking a twobar gate as if she were in the grand national helen cantered into the stable yard at the house and found wood there the chief groom at a racing stable close by he looked in by arrangement not so much for the money but mainly because like everyone else he felt protective of lady helen he held dolly as she dismounted a good run milady excellent ill give her a rub down and some oats then im very grateful she moved to the kitchen door and hedley opened it youve been galloping again what do you want me to do roll over and die she smiled dont be an old fuddyduddy ill go and shower and then you can take me to the village for a pub lunch after shed gone hedley made himself a cup of coffee he heard wood drive off went and opened the kitchen door and stood looking out at the rain it was like a dream everything that had happened since that night in wapping since she had killed ryan and then new york brady kelly cassidy he shuddered what could he do as she had once said go to scotland yard and what would he say my mistress has murdered four men who had some sort of responsibility for the butchery of her son and the assassination of four others in ulster on top of that she shot two lowlifes trying to rape a girl in manhattan no even thinking along those lines was a waste of time there was no way he could ever do anything to harm her she simply meant too much to him and there was another thing too he had killed many people in vietnam some for good reasons some for bad and he knew one thing beyond dispute if he ever had the mysterious connection in his sights he would kill the man himself without compunction showered and changed helen lang went into her study and sat before the computer she really was very expert now and soon had senator cohans travel arrangements on her screen including his date of arrival and even in a bit of luck the number of his suite at the dorchester hotel apparently he reserved the same one every time he was there she considered all the facts then went down to the kitchen where she found hedley she took her sheepskin down from behind the door all right hedley food awaits lets be off and she opened the door went out into the courtyard and walked to the mercedes parked in the open barn the pub as usual at that time of year was quiet it was very old england in the saloon bar great stone flags for a floor a low beamed ceiling there was a log fire burning in the open hearth and the long bar was made of oak with beer pumps and a range of bottles behind there were only four locals at the bar the usual gnarled old straw dogs she was greeted with enthusiasm one man even doffed his cap hedley was just as well received the barmaid was a middleaged woman called hetty armsby and the eightyfiveyearold man sitting on the end stool reading the london times was her father tom the times is it helen asked i like to keep up to date he said keep my brain active the times gives you the facts for instance all this irish business at the moment though why the yanks are involved ill never know pint for hedley and your dad and a gin and tonic for me she said to hetty and youll be wanting food shepherds pie and that bread you bake yourself helen took out a cigarette and hedley gave her a light oh i dont know tom im a yank remember well that isnt your fault lady helen and he cackled you old rogue just look at the wall hanging there was a series of framed blackandwhite pictures of aeroplanes several were of german dorniers and two were of american b bombers one in the surf off horseshoe bay the other nose down where it had crashlanded the crew standing beside it in flying gear true enough tom told her a grand bunch of lads that we got them in here while they were waiting for trucks from their base drunk out of their minds they were by the time those trucks came weve had one or two back over the years mind you a long time ago mostly passed on i reckon hetty appeared with a tray over here lady helen nice table by the fire she laid everything out lady helen and hedley sat down and ate good hedley you know its good he told her sometimes its still hard for me to fathom i was a kid in harlem scratching a living on hard times then there was nam and all those years later i live in one of the most ancient parts of england and sit in a pub like its out of a jane austen novel eating a thing called shepherds pie and you like it love it lady helen and i love these crazy people well they love you she said so thats okay they finished the meal and she ordered a pot of english breakfast tea much better for you than coffee hedley and i want your brain clear and why would that be senator cohan arrives at the dorchester the day after tomorrow he took a deep breath you really mean it dont you of course she took a small plastic bag from her pocket opened it and produced a key remember when they were fitting the new stove in the kitchen in south audley street and they were making such a racket and i stayed overnight at the dorchester she smiled im just a weak woman who enjoys luxury well thats the key to the suite hedley took it so youve often boasted of your wide range of rather dubious friends when we lost those keys for the old stables the deadlocks you produced one that opened all of them said youd got it from a friend in london i asked you if he was a locksmith you said not exactly thats true well were leaving for south audley street tomorrow one of the joys of the english aristocratic system as you well know hedley is that one gets invited to everything and im due at the dorchester ballroom the day after tomorrow he was resigned to it by now so what do you need this friend of yours to have a look at that key i know its computercoded and wont open a thing now but based on something dear roper once told me well im sure if your friend is as good as i think he is he can produce a passkey hedley sighed if you say so oh but i do dont let me down now finish your beer and well go it was the following afternoon when hedley came up from covent garden tube station it was as always one of the most crowded parts of london hedley worked his way through the crowds until he came to crown court a narrow little alley with four or five shops one of them said jacko locksmith the bell tinkled as hedley went in a curtain at the rear parted and an old whitehaired black man came through damn my eyes its you hedley that it is jacko well have a drink on it jacko produced a halfbottle of scotch from under the counter then two paper cups and poured isnt life the damnedest thing you and my bobby get posted on embassy guard here so he sends for me to come to live in london then they pull him away to that stinking gulf war and he gets wasted heres to you jacko hedley drank the whiskey always thought youd go home wheres home hell i still play great trombone and london s got better jazz clubs than new york you got a purpose to this visit hedley produced the key you familiar with these things jacko only glanced yeah sure its a hotel key what about it could you make me a passkey a general key out of it one that would open any door in the hotel my friend i never figured you for a guy who worked the hotel racket but yes i can do such a thing the hotel people think these things are foolproof but not if you know what youre doing i can do the job in about five minutes good then do it and no im not in any kind of hotel racket but this is real important then consider it done jacko opened the bottle and poured have another he went back through the curtain while hedley finished the whiskey and then appeared a few minutes later there you go the key looked just the same hedley said dubiously is this kosher if i were jewish id say on my life but im just an old trombone player from harlem hedley i dont know the hotel i dont want to know but one thing is certain this will open any door in the fucking place what do i owe you what are friends for use it in good health michael cohan took the concorde from new york to london he preferred it to the jumbo but then anyone would three and a half hours a smooth and perfect flight excellent food and free champagne the seats were smaller but the speed made up for that there was no movie but that was the last thing he was concerned about because the thoughts going around in his brain provided his own personal cinema of the mind and it wasnt funny hed tried to phone barry twice on the coded mobile but got no reply though that wasnt surprising the irishman was constantly on the move and mobile phones were not something you switched on all the time especially in barrys case when you were on the run it was a mess though the way things had worked out so stupid the whole thing his irishamerican voters had always been crucial and brady had been a firstclass fundraiser for him because of his power in the teamsters union it was he who had introduced him to kelly and cassidy there was a natural progression to receiving funds for the ira not just for noraid but for other groups with dublin links everybody was doing it most of his irishamerican voters felt strongly about the situation in ireland the ira were heroes romantic heroes he remembered the early days at murphys the drinking the singing of rebel songs it was exciting romantic and then there had been the night brady had introduced jack barry in new york on business for the organization back there in dublin a real live ira gunman barry had regaled them with his stories of gun battles with british paratroopers life on the run and had suggested how they could help it was brady with his work on the new york docks for the teamsters who was of real importance the possibilities of smuggling arms to ireland had been obvious cohan and kelly had concentrated on the fundraising and cassidy on the purchase of suitable weapons cohan remembered their first coup fifty armalite rifles smuggled in a portuguese boat to ireland they were already calling themselves the sons of erin at barrys suggestion had established the dining club at murphys with a plaque on their own booth all out in the open no reason not to and then when barry had come to new york again he had mentioned his mysterious mentor a voice on the phone the previous year when barry had been staying in splendour at the mayfair hotel on ira business when barry had asked who he was hed simply said call me the connection because thats what i am astoundingly he could provide information from british intelligence by way of washington information crucial to the struggle in ireland again because of bradys waterfront connections arrangements were able to be made to smuggle ira men on the run out of ireland to new york the smuggling of arms had also continued the really serious business had started when the connection had passed details of british intelligence operations in new york and boston including identities of operatives all part of the shadow war being fought between the british and the ira in ireland this was where brady because of his union work and cassidy with his construction business had come into their own they both had serious connections with mob interests favours were owed the right kind of accidents took place the brits lost people and couldnt make a fuss after all they shouldnt have been there in the first place although a lot of that kind of thing seemed to have tailed off in the past year and cohan had always stood well clear of any violence hed always been a link man when needed had met tim pat ryan twice when on london trips it had all worked and then the damn roof had fallen in still he was in the clear whatever blake johnson implied so he frequented murphys bar so what did that prove how in the hell had he been so stupid and yet there had been an inevitability about it from the beginning nothing to be done about it now the connection had promised to take care of it and hed taken care of everything in the past well enough so brady kelly cassidy and ryan were dead meat cohan shuddered and waved for another glass of champagne and tried to comfort himself with the thought that the other guys had been one thing but he was a united states senator united states senators didnt get shot did they ferguson was with the prime minister again at downing street on his own this time the prime minister listened carefully to ferguson s resume of the whole business of course as the president has pointed out to me in our conversation there isnt a thing anyone can do legally about senator cohan his membership of the sons of erin damns him in our eyes but on the surface he can claim as he apparently does that he frequented this murphys bar quite innocently agreed prime minister ferguson nodded but hes here now and the thing is what do we do with him try and keep him alive of course im dropping the whole thing in your lap brigadier and the deputy director and the security services you are in charge the prime minister told him firmly i now realize the security services have not been as forthcoming as they could have been in the past and i dont like that he smiled youve been in this job a long time brigadier i think i now know why one of my illustrious predecessors gave it to you in the first place so i have full authority absolutely now do excuse me im due at the house as ferguson stood and the door behind him opened the prime minister added by the way this function at the dorchester the forum for irish peace that cohan is attending tomorrow night im looking in at ten youll be there of course ferguson nodded i think you can take that for granted prime minister and he followed the aide out hannah bernstein and dillon were waiting in the daimler ferguson got in and it drove away as the security gates opened he said just as i thought its our baby carter is to have no involvement which leaves us in the deep youknowwhat if the senator comes to a sticky end dillon pointed out my dear boy it was ever thus ferguson turned to hannah bernstein when is he due in she checked her watch only took off forty minutes ago sir fine check his movements the data at the hotel his limousine that sort of stuff theres not too much we can do as this is not really official we cant alert the hotel or pull in extra security guards during his visit therell be plenty of security at the forum for irish peace tomorrow night hannah said of course ferguson frowned but im uneasy and why is that im sure youll tell us dillon said well ive never been happy since the ryan shooting and then discovering the same gun was used in new york i dont think its a conspiracy some execution squad i have a feeling theres an executioner out there the irish woman or a woman with an irish accent dillon said a needle in a haystack in london eight million irish in the uk a hell of a diaspora well i have infinite faith in you so you can start with kilburn ferguson told him and senator cohan hannah asked ill speak to him when im ready now as this rogue here is wearing a jacket and tie for once ill take you to the garrick for lunch but already events were happening which would change everything earlier that morning thornton had considered the situation of cohan in london and the longer he did the more unhappy he became what guarantee was there that the mysterious killer would strike in london none at all and yet cohan had become a liability the man really would have to go it was four oclock in the morning american time when he phoned barry the irishman was still at the safe house in county down its me thornton said listen ive got some bad news for you and he ran through the whole story theres even a possibility the shooter could be a woman is that a fact well i wish to christ i could get my hands on her shed take a long time to die so cohan is the only one left thats it and panicking the thing is his cover as a member of the sons of erin is blown the president knows through blake johnson the prime minister knows through ferguson and company hes become expendable so you want him taken out hes arriving in london later today to attend some irish peace affair at the dorchester tomorrow hes staying at that hotel it would be convenient if this unknown assassin got to him dont you think maybe he or she could use some help so you want me to do it for you and for yourself it clears the board nicely thered be only you and me left i believe the belfast flight to london only takes an hour and a half theres no need for that barry told him theres an air taxi firm not forty minutes from here based at an old world war two feeder station its been a quick way to england for me for years run by an old raf hand named docherty cunning as a fox so youll do it why not it will give me something to do its raining and im bored barry put the phone down excited and looked out of the window no need to call in the boys a oneman job this in and out he picked up the phone and rang docherty at doonreigh the place was dark and dreary in the heavy rain as he drove up there an hour later there were two old aircraft hangars their doors open in one was a cessna in the other a navajo chieftain barry parked and got out he was wearing a tweed cap a brown leather bomber jacket and jeans and carried an oldfashioned gladstone bag in one hand smoke came from the chimney of the old nissen hut the door opened and docherty appeared he was fifty and looked older his hair thin his face weathered and lined he wore raf flying overalls and flying boots come in out of the rain it was warm inside from the oldfashioned stove there was a bed in the corner some lockers a table and chairs and a desk with charts open on it so they still havent caught up with you jack thatll be the day is that tea on the stove good irish whiskey if you like you know me not while im working so i want to be in london no later than six this evening and out again no later than midnight can you do it i can do anything you know that i never ask questions i mind my own business and ive never let you down true all right five thousand thats what it costs moneys not a problem barry said as no one knows better than you fine theres a place like this in kent about an hour from london roundhay very lonely out in the country ive used it before ive already telephoned the farmer who owns it a grand for him and hell leave a car you can drive up to london false registration the lot just another crook barry said arent we all except you jack a gallant freedom fighter for the glorious cause thats you ill kick your arse docherty no you wont because you cant fly planes so youll get us there in spite of all this air traffic security when have i ever failed now lets get moving its got to be the chieftain by the way the cessna needs some spare parts he opened the navajos airstair door dropped the steps and barry followed him up docherty closed the door and locked it theres a following wind jack so itll take two hours with luck its the usual march weather lots of rain but thats good dont wet your pants when i go hedgehopping thats to avoid the radar do you want to sit with me no ill read the paper docherty strapped himself in and started the engines first port then starboard the navajo moved out into the rain coasted to the end of the strip and turned into the wind he boosted power and they surged forward lifted off and started to climb docherty was as good as his word for they hit roundhay at only five minutes over two hours and came in under low cloud and heavy rain a barn stood nearby its doors opened an old ford escort car outside docherty taxied inside and cut the engines what about you barry asked as they got out ill be okay ill take a walk up to the farm and pay my debts you mean youll give him a thousand in cash hes the kind of man you keep happy i never know when i might need him again he turned and walked away across the airstrip and barry got into the escort the keys were in the ignition but before he started the engine he removed a browning from the gladstone bag took out the clip loaded the weapon and pushed it inside his bomber jacket only then did he drive away he made good time for as evening approached traffic was coming out of london not in the car was no big deal an old ford escort but nice and anonymous he thought about things on the way the place to make the hit for example well that was obvious since cohan was staying at the dorchester getting in was easy all he needed were the right kind of clothes and he had those in plenty for some years barry had had a bolthole in london not an apartment but a boat moored on the thames close to st jamess stairs in wapping he had everything there a wardrobe and arms stashed away he had been careful never to mention it to anyone hed always remembered his old ulster grandmothers saying when she used to come over to the states to stay with them always remember jack a secret is no longer a secret if one other person knows about it shed died badly of cancer during the early days when hed first returned to ulster shed been a patient at the royal victoria hospital in belfast the worlds best on shotgun wounds because they had to be he was on the mostwanted list at the time when he said he was going to see her the boys had told him he was crazy and implored him not to but none of that mattered to barry hed gone on his own got into the hospitals back entrance and stolen a doctors white robe and plastic identity tag from the rest room hed found her room and for a while sat there holding her hand she couldnt talk much except to say im glad youre here jack its where i should be gran and then her grip had tightened take care be a good boy and she had slipped away the tears the rage had overwhelmed him then hed left and against all advice attended her funeral four days later standing in the rain a browning in his pocket wishing someone from the security forces would try to take him and why should that be the great jack barry lord barry silver star and bronze in nam vietnamese cross of valor a purple heart how many brit soldiers had he killed how many loyalists in bombings although a prod himself at the end of the day the image that would not go away was of an old woman who had fiercely loved him even now at the wheel of the escort his throat prickled and angry tears started to his eyes he was into london at five worked his way through to kilburn parked and found what he was looking for a pub called the michael collins the painting on the wall an irish tricolour and collins with a gun upraised said it all he didnt go in the bar but walked round to the courtyard at the rear opened the kitchen door and entered a small greyhaired man was seated at a table in the sitting room reading glasses on his nose going over some accounts his name was liam moran and he was a london organizer for sinn fein jesus its yourself jack his eyes bulged as ever was barry went to a sideboard opened a bottle of whiskey and poured one is there much action at the moment hell no not with the peace process the brits are playing it cool in london and so are the boys what in the hell are you doing here jack oh no harm intended just passing through on my way to germany barry lied just thought id check in and see how the general situation was moran was agitated dead calm jack i promise you peace liam barry swallowed his whiskey what a bore ill be in touch and he went out chapter eight londons kilburn district houses a mainly irish population both republican and loyalist and sometimes youd swear you were in belfast the protestant pubs with william and mary painted on the end wall were the spitting image of those in the shankhill as were the republican pubs of those in the falls road dillon dressed in a black bomber jacket scarf and jeans faded into the drinking crowd of the latter his walther stuck into his waistband at the rear that there were those who might recognize him could not be avoided but he figured he would be all right he was after all the great sean dillon the living legend of the ira and as for anything else it was rumours at most but he had the walther as insurance he learned nothing of any great interest however until he came out of the green tinker and paused in a doorway to light a cigarette beside the newspaper stand the old man huddled inside was swallowing from a half bottle his name was tod ahern he wiped his mouth with the back of a hand and stared at dillon in astonishment jesus sean its yourself and who else would it be tod was well drunk now are there big things doing i saw barry earlier are you and he here for some big plans dillon smiled gently now then tod you shouldnt talk about such things the word is hush he smiled jack would be furious if he knew youd seen him where was it by the way going to the back of the michael collins i thought he might be seeing liam moran id just picked up my stand i was wheeling it round well keep it to yourself tod dillon passed him a fivepound note have a drink on me later sitting at his table still going over his accounts liam moran was aware of a slight draught of air that lifted the papers looked up and found dillon in the doorway an unlit cigarette in his mouth god bless all here moran almost had a bowel movement sean its you as ever was dillon lit the cigarette with his old zippo im told you had a visitor earlier jack barry moran managed a ghastly smile and whos been selling you that kind of nonsense dillon sighed we can do this the easy way or the hard way liam what did he want and where is he sean this is a bad joke dillons hand found the butt of the silenced walther in his waistband his hand swung and the lobe of morans right ear disintegrated the blood spurting as he grabbed it now your right kneecap comes next ill put you on sticks maybe for ever jesus no sean moran was in agony he told me he was just checking on how hot things were in london these days said he was on his way to germany my arse he is dillon said hell have a hideyhole here in london where would that be and how would i be knowing that sean what a shame here goes the kneecap dillon took aim and moran cried out st jamess stairs up from wapping there are some houseboats his is called griselda good man yourself dillon put the walther away do you want me to come back jesus no then keep your mouth shut im sure you know someone who can fix that ear dillon went out back in his mini cooper he phoned ferguson and when the brigadier answered said i may have struck gold tell me dillon did when he was finished he said i think its too much of a coincidence hes here what do you want me to do take him out on the other hand you could call in scotland yards antiterrorist unit theyd turn it into the third world war thats the last thing we need where are you dillon told him meet me at st jamess stairs ferguson said youve got to be joking dillon when i was nineteen years old i was in the hook of korea where i shot five chinese with a browning pistol i do tend to get bored polishing the seat of my desk at the ministry of defence oh my what would bernstein say i can take political correctness so far dillon i dont particularly wish to employ her on a desperate venture in rain and darkness on the thames in an attempt to take out one of the wont specimens the ira has on offer so you think hes here for cohan dillon a few days ago he was in ulster now hes here what other reason could he have wait for me on the corner of wapping high street and chalk lane and ferguson put the phone down barry parked the escort at the end of chalk lane in a side turning and walked down towards st jamess stairs it was dark now with lights on the river more on the river side traffic moving in the darkness he turned at the end and walked along the line of an old jetty passing what looked like a couple of disused lighters there was a basin at the end some old cranes standing above it disused warehouses standing behind only one houseboat was on that side the griselda with four on the other two with a light that showed some sort of habitation there was a connection with the shore an electric cable and water pipe barry had used the boat for three years now had last been there six months before hed always expected the place to be vandalized each time hed returned but it had never happened for one thing it was remote and tucked away and then the presence of the other houseboats afforded some sort of protection he went across the gangplank found the key hidden in the cabin gutter got the steel door open and stepped inside there was a switch to the left the light came on disclosing a flight of stairs it also brought on deck lights one in the stern one on the prow he went down and at the bottom switched on a light revealing the cabin it was surprisingly spacious with portholes on each side there were bench seats a table a kitchenette at one end with an electric cooker and a basin he paused to fill the kettle then carried on into the bedroom he placed the gladstone bag on the bed took out a toilet bag and a carton of cigarettes he opened a pack lit a cigarette and checked the closet there were clothes in there in plastic zipup bags shoes new shirts in marks amp spencer bags underwear socks everything he would need the kettle was whistling he went in switched it off sat down at the table and phoned the dorchester with his mobile senator cohan he asked when the switchboard replied may i say whos calling sir george harrison american embassy a moment later cohan answered mr harrison barry laughed its me you daft bastard barry jack cohan laughed back where are you still in ulster barry lied i spoke to the connection he told me all the bad news though i suppose its good news for the undertakers cohan shuddered you always see a joke in everything as we used to say in vietnam if you cant see the joke you shouldnt have joined look on the good side youre in luxury at the dorchester your every need taken care of youre well out of new york at the moment the connection said hed take care of things can you imagine this suggestion that a woman got to ryan is that crazy well the good news is im leaving for new york myself in an hour thats why i thought id call you the connection wants me there to help clean this mess up is that a fact barry was lying smoothly now im driving down to shannon ill catch the new york plane from there lets hope you can sort things out ill keep in touch let you know where im staying whats your room number cohan gave it to him good you going out tonight no ill take it easy big night tomorrow sounds right to me stay well cohan put the phone down aware of a feeling of considerable relief he opened the bottle of complimentary champagne and poured a glass if anyone could handle this whole sorry mess it was barry barry took out an excellently tailored black suit white shirt and a striped tie he laid them down on the bed went back into the saloon reheated the kettle and made coffee in a mug when it was ready he went up the companionway and stood on the deck at the rail thinking about things how to do it was the thing access to the dorchester was no problem after all hed be dressed like a whiskey advert and he had cohans room number all he needed to do was knock on the door drop him and be on his way if he left the donotdisturb card on the door they wouldnt find him for hours possibly not until the morning feeling suddenly quite cheerful about it he went back below he took off his bomber jacket pushed the browning into his waistband and put the kettle on again he checked out the clothes took the shirt out of its plastic envelope and unfolded it the kettle whistled again and he changed his mind about more coffee he switched it off found a bottle of scotch in a cupboard poured one into a paper cup and went back on deck it was raining now silver lances in the yellow light of the deck lights and he stood under the slightly tattered awning smelling the river the damp nostalgic for something he didnt understand there was a sudden slight cough and he turned his hand sliding inside the bomber jacket to feel for the butt of the browning a man was standing at the end of the gangway with an umbrella over his head smiling down at him we havent met facetoface mr barry but the names ferguson waiting in his mini cooper at the junction of wapping high street and chalk lane dillon had an eye out for the daimler and had been totally astonished when a black cab had drawn up and ferguson had got out and paid the driver hed carried an umbrella which he didnt bother to put up hurried along the pavement and got in beside dillon filthy night you in a cab i cant believe it i suppose youll claim the fare on expenses dont be flippant dillon what do you intend i havent the slightest idea are you carrying what would you expect ferguson asked wearily and produced an old smith amp wesson automatic i also have these he took a pair of handcuffs from his pocket you are hopeful old man all right lets get on with it and ferguson got out and put up his umbrella they walked down chalk lane side by side the brigadiers umbrella protecting them when they reached the basin they paused in the doorway of one of the old warehouses one houseboat on this side four on the other ferguson whispered lights in the nearest and two of the others which is which dillon took a small pair of binoculars from his pocket nightstalkers miracle of modern science he focused them on the first houseboat and passed them to ferguson take a look ferguson did so and the houseboat emerged in every detail although in a greenish tint the name griselda clear on the prow excellent i could have done with those in the trenches on the hook whats your plan im a simple man and the lights being on i presume it is barry so dillon examined the griselda again i dont think well get anywhere by stepping on board and shouting down the companionway come out with your hands up i noticed theres a stern hatch yes well id like to point out that there could be a certain amount of noise in doing that dillon lifting the hatch i mean which could also be locked on the inside brigadier youve got to travel hopefully ill have a go and you wait here for me oh i see keeping the old man safe are we dillon didnt bother to answer simply handed him the nightstalker and faded into the darkness beside the warehouse wall ferguson focused the night sight saw dillon slide over the stern rail and move to the hatch it lifted and dillon slipped inside as ferguson lowered the nightstalker jack barry emerged from the companionway ferguson checked him out the paper cup in one hand the butt of the browning sticking out of his waistband ferguson thought of dillon down there trying to make his way through unfamiliar territory and made his decision he put the nightstalker in his pocket took out the smith amp wesson and held it against his back in his left hand he walked along the quay and paused at the gangway umbrella held high we havent met facetoface mr barry but the names ferguson ferguson started down the gangplank and his left hand emerged holding the smith amp wesson wyatt earp the great american marshal once said that what had made his reputation as a gunfighter was when a young cowboy had tried to shoot him in the back in the darkness of dodge city at fifty paces earp had turned and fired as a reflex without taking aim and shot the gun from the boys hand a total fluke jack barry did the same now pulling the silenced browning out firing from the hip catching the smith amp wesson in charles fergusons hand and blowing it away dillon easing in through the hatch above the shower room had heard ferguson took out his walther dashed through the kitchen and saloon and went out headfirst into barry as ferguson fell back to the deck dillon rammed the walther into barrys back drop it jack or ill blow your spine in two barry froze why sean its you ferguson got to his feet dillon said are you okay brigadier ferguson was holding his wrist which was bleeding just a scratch im fine barry leaned over and placed the browning on the deck then as he straightened he lifted his right elbow into dillons face turning sideways so that dillons reflex shot went into the deck dillon dropped the walther and they closed together barry staggering back as they struggled furiously when they went over the rail it was still together and it was cold the kind of shock that numbed the brain and the current was fierce dillon kicked barry away as he surfaced felt himself swept against the stern anchor chain and grabbed at it as he turned he saw barry being carried away fuck you dillon he called and was gone dillon hung on then hauled himself along the chain to the other side of the griselda and reached for a ring bolt on the wall dillon ferguson called here dillon pulled himself to a ladder he sat on the old quay streaming water and ferguson said do you think hes gone only elsewhere brigadier ill confirm hes gone when ive shot him between the eyes at very close quarters but not before what now lets go below im wet through and i could do with some dry clothes in the shower room dillon stripped and towelled in the small bedroom he helped himself to underwear and jeans and a sweater far too large then joined ferguson in the saloon he nodded to the black suit white shirt and tie nice gear brigadier i mean if you were going to circulate at a great hotel like the dorchester youd really pass dressed like that you dont think hes at the bottom of the thames no probably on the other side by now but he wont be turning up at the dorchester you see jack isnt a patriot hes a very practical man and a british prison is the last thing he needs he came he failed i know strange dillon when you told me he was here i said it had to be for cohan i couldnt think of any reason that could bring him here from ulster but why barry runs the sons of erin why would he want to eradicate the last member of the new york branch because thats exactly what cohan is hes a problem to you hes a problem to the president maybe hes a problem to the connection too ferguson was suddenly cheerful my dear boy you sometimes have a perfect facility for hitting the nail on the head lets go dillon said and the boat wherever he goes if hes still on the planet he wont come back here just turn the lights out ill have a recovery team check it out tomorrow but ferguson was wrong barry surfaced at st jamess stairs he hauled himself up a ladder and started back to the basin the lights were still on in the boat he crouched there in the darkness wet and cold after a while the lights went out below and ferguson and dillon appeared the deck lights went out they came up the gangway and walked away talking when the sound of the voices had faded he hurried across went below and stripped hurriedly he towelled found fresh clothes and dressed then he pulled on the bomber jacket which still had his mobile in one of the pockets he reached under one of the benches pulled up a plank rummaged inside and took out a smith amp wesson revolver he slipped it in a pocket and left switching off the lights he walked away through the rain not at all depressed actually laughing out loud what a bastard dillon was and it was nice to have a face to put on ferguson s name after all these years it was all a game after all he understood that so did dillon and ferguson but did the connection he reached the escort got in and drove away dillon pulled up outside ferguson s flat in cavendish square i suppose it means we dont have to worry about cohan for the rest of his stay how can you be so sure hes no samurai our jack he has no intention of committing suicide now that he knows were on to him if he was here for cohan hes on his way you say if lets wait and see and our mystery assassin your woman lets wait and see there also ferguson nodded nine oclock my office he got out and dillon leaned through the window charles you will have that wrist seen to wont you none of that british stoicism i hope ferguson smiled dont worry sean im not daft now be off with you dillon drove away the weather was terrible as barry drove out of london heavy heavy rain for some reason though he still felt incredibly cheerful as he stopped on the motorway at a little chef had an allday english breakfast and bought half a bottle of scotch in the shop he drank a quarter of it on his way down to roundhay where he found the little airstrip dark and quiet except for a light in the barn he drove in beside the chieftain and found docherty sitting on a stool reading a newspaper did it go well jack he asked dont ask just get me out of here can you do it im your man ten minutes later the chieftain lifted into the night barry sat back opened the halfbottle of whiskey again and drank then he took out his mobile and rang the connection its me barry where are you on my way from england to ireland in a small plane and lucky to be here tell me which barry did thornton said how would they know about your houseboat for gods sake i dont know all i know is that they did and im lucky to be getting the hell out of it and cohan he can take his chances as far as im concerned and barry rang off chapter nine dillonin the office at ten oclock woke blake in bed at five am in washington for gods sake sean look at the time im doing you a favour blake my story is better than the midnight movie youll come dangerously alive go down to the kitchen in your track suit drink fresh orange juice and contemplate a fivemile run like hell i will just listen when dillon was finished blake said god help us it gets worse dont tell me ill keep in touch and dillon rang off lady helen lang jogged through hyde park it was tenthirty the following morning she sat on a bench by the pond and rested she wasnt breathless she felt fine the prospect of the evening at the dorchester was strangely like going into battle she was determined on her course of action no question of that it was fitting that cohan should go the same way as the rest of the club she was realistic enough to realize that the prospect of ever facing jack barry or the connection just wasnt likely however she would have exacted a considerable amount of justice as she saw it it would comfort her next time she placed flowers on her sons monument her name was called and she looked up and saw hedley walking towards her thought id see how you were getting on that was nice of you she stood up and suddenly was struggling for breath she clutched her chest then sat down again fumbled for the plastic bottle of pills in her pocket and dropped it he picked it up and sat beside her and opened it is it bad she lied of course no no i was just a little dizzy for a moment he passed her two pills in his palm she picked them up and swallowed them down thats better this aint good lady helen she patted his knee a nice cup of tea and i can go on for ever hedley now take me across to the cafe they stood up and she took his arm in his office at the ministry of defence ferguson was going over the previous nights events with hannah bernstein and dillon what a load of male macho nonsense hannah said outraged and at your age brigadier ferguson who was wearing an elastic bandage on his gun hand said i stand corrected chief inspector god but you look grand when youre angry girl dillon told her the eyes sparkle and theres a flush to the cheeks oh go to hell she said it should have been a major antiterrorist squad operation if the place had been flooded with armed officers wed have had him one of the most wanted irish terrorists wed also have been on the front page of every tabloid newspaper and i didnt want that ferguson told her my decision at that moment the phone rang his secretary said reception has a call from ulster a jack barry ferguson pressed his audio button so that dillon and hannah could hear the conversation jack barry have them trace it they cant brigadier its a coded mobile his secretary said all right then just put him through the call was surprisingly clear is that you ferguson and who else would it be i just wanted to let you know i didnt drown in the thames and im safe home youre a lucky man i thought id got you well you didnt you shot the gun out of my hand mind you that was pretty good is dillon there naturally to our next merry meeting in hell sean barry laughed and the phone went dead hannah bernstein said what a fiend whats he playing at making stupid phone calls now we know for sure hes alive we didnt before its a game to jack the lot of it dillon told her i could also idd that some say hes as mad as a hatter that hell never do the sensible thing only the crazy thing hannah said i suppose the only good thing is that senator cohan wont die on us here you really think so ferguson shook his head there has never been a suggestion that barry killed the others the only logical reason for his presence here if cohan was a target would be because the senator had become an inconvenience no weve deposed of one danger at least temporarily the other one our mysterious second assassin is still out there he picked up the phone get me senator michael cohan at the dorchester he kept the audio button down a moment later cohan said michael cohan who is this charles ferguson i believe you know who i am yes i do and i dont wish to speak to you senator believe me i only have your best interests at heart i am a us senator on a visit on behalf of the president cohan lied if you continue to harass me ill complain to the prime ministers office and he slammed down the phone an angry man dillon said so what do we do now why we adjourn for lunch of course giuliano the manager of the dorchester piano bar greeted them with enthusiasm ferguson had been using the place for twenty years or more dillon comparatively recently but he did appear on a regular basis hannah bernstein of course was no problem like any italian male giuliano appreciated beauty combined with brains and hannah certainly had that the fact that she was also a detective chief inspector of the special branch at scotland yard was a bonus the additional fact that she had killed in the line of duty gave an extra frisson giuliano remembered the newspaper story a couple of years previously she had been passing a street on her way to grosvenor square when a woman had emerged screaming that an armed holdup was taking place as she was on american embassy duty that day bernstein had been armed and had seriously embarrassed the villains by shooting one man armed with a sawnoff shotgun dead giuliano kissed her on each cheek with style then presented his suggestions for lunch homemade cannelloni with mozzarella cheese and ham stuffing then there was gnocchi di patate al pesto potato dumplings in garlic and basil sauce they made their choice and dillon ordered krug nonvintage champagne one thing ferguson said to giuliano i understand that senator michael cohan has a table reserved for one oclock thats true giuliano said looking startled well then put him at the next table theres a good chap ferguson said giuliano smiled here we go again brigadier i should write a book all these years the cold war english public school men who were communists under the skin and then the irish he smiled at dillon forgive me my friend i know im a terrible man dillon told him giuliano said so the american gets the next table i wish you joy he went away the krug came and dillon insisted on pouring he said how did you know cohan would be here ferguson grunted the telephone dillon its a wonderful instrument you should try it sometime hannah said how do we handle it head on my dear head on ferguson raised his glass to lrfe and love and happiness well if you add peace in ulster ill drink to that dillon said and cohan appeared at the head of the steps giuliano greeted him brought him down to the next table took an order for a dry martini and went away ferguson said senator michael cohan brigadier charles ferguson cohan was outraged this is harassment of the worst kind i warned you i would complain to the prime ministers office i certainly will after this two things happened he started to get up and a waiter arrived with the dry martini it was dillon who took over i dont mind you being a politician senator we have them in ireland too although i remember one saying dont tell my mother im a senator in the dail she thinks i play piano in a whorehouse how dare you oh shut your face dillon said try not to be stupid because thats what youre being now if you want to live listen to the man ferguson said just hear me senator lets discuss the sons of erin and see if you can make any connection he emphasized the word with your own experience when he was finished cohan sat there very pale this has nothing to do with me listen you shite dillon told him jack barry was here in london last night and why to pick the meat off your bones cohan was really worried now but tried to bluster i know nothing of this the sons of erin are all dead senator now maybe somebody just doesnt like dining clubs dillon said but our theory is that jack barry came over on a hasty trip to tidy things up which meant stiffing you it was hannah who put in but that still leaves somewhere out there the individual who got rid of your friends nonsense cohan told her its all rubbish now i demand that you leave me alone he swallowed the dry martini ferguson said so you wont cooperate all right senator have it your way the prime minister and the president will be so informed however my instructions are to keep you alive if possible while youre in london so well be there tonight at the forum for irish peace doing our best to achieve that aim whether you cooperate or not go to hell cohan got up and walked out their pasta arrived hannah said what now sir why we enjoy this delicious light luncheon return this evening and try to keep the bastard in one piece you think there could be a problem ive never been more certain of anything in my life ferguson picked up a fork and turned to dillon black tie dear boy do try to look civilized with nowhere else to go cohan phoned the connection on the coded mobile phone number and poured out everything all his doubts all his fears when he was finished thornton said cant you see what theyre doing to you i had an arrangement with barry he flew over to protect you so they found out he was there and he got out by the skin of his teeth from what you say you told me id be safe in london you will be i was just making doubly sure by sending barry everything will be fine you said barry would be taking care of whoever was behind the killings theres a lot going on you dont know about just trust me its my hide if something goes wrong senator senator nothing will go wrong okay so just calm down relax enjoy the party ill be in touch thornton hung up and immediately phoned barry ive had cohan on in a hell of a state hes had ferguson and dillon on his back why didnt you tell me how badly things went because it only happened last night and i was busy getting out of england in one piece let me hear your version so barry did staying reasonably close to the truth when he was finished he said it was just one of those things how dillon found me i dont know a considerable nuisance that man the army said that for twenty years and the ira have been saying it ever since anyway what about cohan ill have to leave him to do his own thing ill think of something when he returns to the states ill be in touch and he put down his phone in the house in south audley street lady helen lang went through her wardrobe and finally selected a superb evening suit in black crepe she held the jacket against her as she stood in front of the mirror there was a knock on the door and hedley entered with a cup of tea what do you think she asked looks good to me she hung the black suit inside the wardrobe fine she sipped some of her tea ive a hair appointment at daniel galvins in fortyfive minutes you look okay to me lady helen all the world and his wife will be there tonight hedley including cohan she smiled i must look my best now go and get ready ill be with you in a quarter of an hour the forum for irish peace in the dorchester ballroom was a splendid black tie affair the prime minister had not yet arrived but several members of the cabinet had the guest list certainly included the great and the good and dillon surprised as always at the people pulled in for such a thing reached for a glass of champagne from a passing waiter he was wearing an evening suit with raw silk lapels hannah in a dull red silk suit by versace said take it easy dillon its a long night ahead you look grand girl he told her fit for a threepage spread in vogue magazine flattery really will get you nowhere i know and isnt that the terrible shame ferguson approached everything all right jesus brigadier dillon said when i was a wee boy in belfast my grandmother would take me to the lounge in the old grand central for afternoon tea the grandeur of it she loved that the head waiter wore a dinner suit just like yours sticks and stones dillon ferguson said and my patience as usual is wearing dangerously thin he frowned good god its lady helen lang and he turned from dillon as she came through the crowd they embraced so nice to see you charles she turned and saw dillon why its mr dillon isnt it dillon took her hand a great pleasure to meet you again lady helen i couldnt resist coming i live in south audley street just round the corner terribly convenient every time i feel like a cocktail i walk down to the piano bar at that moment there was a buzz over by the main door hannah appeared the prime minister brigadier ferguson said so sorry helen he nodded to dillon get lady helen another glass of champagne theres a good chap with me chief inspector they walked away lady helen said you sometimes appear to be on the dangerous edge of things mr dillon how very astute he grabbed two glasses from a passing tray and gave her one there you are he glanced around a grand bunch of people who you despise totally he raised his glass to you lady helen and me the only two people in a world gone mad she smiled as she returned his toast and for some reason he was aware of a coldness a terrible unease now why should that be forum for irish peace he shook his head seven hundred years coming and too late for some he took a deep breath god save us but im sorry ah youre thinking of my son she smiled very calm if you work for charles youll know my background but as a great writer once said the past is a foreign country mr dillon no we should never dwell on the past we must manage with what weve got a thought dillon said but not much of a comfort at that moment an ageing lady approached my dear helen so nice to see you they touched cheeks and helen lang said you two wont know each other the duchess of stevely sean dillon a considerable pleasure dillon kissed her hand oh i do like the irish the duchess said such rogues are you a rogue mr dillon helen said well he works for charles ferguson there you are then the duchess said ill love you and leave you dillon withdrew he saw ferguson talking to a cabinet minister hannah waiting discreetly close at hand she came across to him cohan just came in hes talking to the american ambassador in the corner over there its difficult to keep track in a crowd like this girl dear whatever else no one is going to do anything very dramatic to him at an affair like this you think hes going to be all right she shook her head the brigadier seems so certain hes older than you are that means hes got it right more often on the other hand how often has he been wrong id rather it didnt happen on our patch if it is going to happen she said at that moment there was a flurry of movement at the entrance and the prime minister came in with a small entourage come on hannah said and moved through the crowd to ferguson dillon at her back the three of them stood together watching the prime ministers progress as he shook the occasional hand or paused for a few words finally he reached the american ambassador cohan still with him there were smiles all round in fact it was the first time dillon had seen the senator smiling he seems happy enough now ferguson said for the moment sir hannah observed only for the moment the emcee resplendent in a scarlet coat called ladies and gentlemen the prime minister all conversation died instantly as the prime minister moved to the microphone your grace my lords ladies and gentlemen we live in exciting times peace in ireland is literally within our grasp and what i want to say to you is this he finished to considerable applause and was away in an instant gladhanding his way to the door with his people now what sir hannah asked from the look of that splendid buffet id say eating time is here ferguson told her so lets get to it what about cohan sir you two take turns dogging his footsteps although if anything was going to happen it wouldnt happen here dillon said is that your drift exactly hannah said im not so hungry so ill take first watch as you like my dear i see hes still with the american ambassador she turned and started to push her way through the crowd cohan stood with the ambassador and a number of people in the corner which was some sort of protection against the crowd he was drinking too much and sweating all down to stress of course he felt awful and the truth was he was frightened he hadnt said a word to the ambassador about his present situation after all how could he hed noticed ferguson dillon and hannah bernstein earlier and in a sense their presence made things worse he reached for another glass of champagne as a waiter hovered and jolted a rather pleasantlooking woman standing close by im terribly sorry thats quite all right helen lang told him at that moment cohan saw hannah bernstein pushing her way through the crowd and was conscious of immense irritation why in the hell wouldnt they leave him alone the ambassador put a hand on his shoulder are you okay michael youre sweating oh sure cohan said i started a cold on the flight over suddenly he realized that for the moment at least he had to get out of there ill just run up to my suite and swallow some aspirin helen lang close enough to hear turned at once and worked her way through the crowd she paused at the door to check in her purse for the passkey that hedley had given her then walked out cohan finished his champagne saw hannah standing close by at one of the bars a glass in her hand and his irritation turned to anger he started to push through the crowd reached the ballroom entrance paused briefly to check behind him aware that she also was on the move then made for the mens room and went in it was busy enough for him to have to wait he really was sweating now and found himself checking faces in the mirror he clashed water on his face took a hand towel from the attendant and dried himself there were several men going out together in a rather boisterous crowd he moved out behind them was aware of hannah bernstein glancing the other way towards the ballroom he took his chance dashed away and made it to the lounge his irritation was immediately eased it was as if hed won a victory small perhaps but a victory he reached the foyer went to the elevators and punched the button hannah gave it ten minutes and was still standing there against the wall when dillon arrived i was looking for you wheres our friend in there she nodded at the door i saw him go in but he hasnt come out dillon smiled some things are still beyond the powers of even politically correct coppers leave it to me she waited watching the crowd swollen now by late arrivals finally dillon emerged pausing only to light a cigarette not a sign thats strange he definitely went in she was aware of a sudden touch of anxiety lets see if hes in the ballroom and she led the way back helen langs passkey worked perfectly she was into cohans suite instantly and closed the door it was very luxurious an excellent bedroom and bathroom a shower room and a superb panelled sitting room the maid had drawn the curtains helen slipped through slid back the french windows and stepped on to the terrace hyde park was opposite the lights of the city beyond down below park lane was crowded with traffic she felt strangely nostalgic standing there it was raining slightly and she moved under the canopy lit a cigarette and waited cohan got out of the elevator and hurried along the corridor his heart pounding christ whats happening to me he thought i need a drink he reached his suite got the door open and moved inside he opened the doors of the chinese lacquered bar unit poured a large scotch his hands shaking he took it down then poured another what in the hell was he going to do hed never felt like this ever everything was falling apart it occurred to him then that the one person who could possibly tell him what to do was barry so he went into the bedroom got his mobile from his travelling bag returned to the sitting room and phoned him barry still at the safe house in county down said who is this cohan for gods sake whats going on what do you mean look i spoke to the connection i know all about your escapade in london last night ive had brigadier charles ferguson and this dillon guy on my back and they told me and what did they say cohan told him everything he could remember the connection said you were here to protect my back so i was dillon said you were here to knock me off who do you believe barry asked your friends or that little taig shite were in this together well sort it together when are you due back in new york tomorrow excellent barry lied with his usual smoothness there are things happening that you dont know about but all your doubts will be resolved i promise you okay okay cohan nodded til stay in touch you do that barry thought about it then phoned the connection ive just had cohan on the line from london and hes coming apart youve got to do something such as couldnt you arrange for him to be hit by a truck when he gets back to new york ill give it my consideration thornton told him and rang off cohan put the mobile phone down and picked up his glass why in the hell did i ever get mixed up in all this he whispered he put the glass to his lips the curtains opened and lady helen lang entered the colt in her right hand the silencer in place chapter ten what in the hell is this cohan demanded shocked at the appearance of this grandmotherlooking person with a gun and she looked familiar somehow nemesis senator that just about sums it up now look here he was blustering now if its money you want she laughed no thats not it remember those old movies with the highwayman demanding your money or your life in this case id prefer your life i have money cohan was horrified who are you sit down and ill tell you he subsided into one of the sofas shaking like a leaf what is this i think its what they call in those old gangster movies on television payback time but what have i done oh nothing personally im sure you have clean hands youre a typical politician but you did connive along with the rest of the sons of erin cohan had never been so terrified oh my god it is you but why why she took out her silver cigarette case onehanded got one in her mouth and lit it i had a son senator a brave and gallant young man let me tell you what his ending was because of the stupid fantasy games you and your friends got up to when she was finished cohan was ashenfaced he sat there huddled in the corner of the sofa she poured another whiskey and passed it to him its unbelievable he said but true senator your worst nightmare i shot tim pat ryan here in london went to new york and got your friends brady kelly and cassidy he swallowed the whiskey what do you want lets start with some questions the connection who is he a voice on the phone i swear it but surely you have some clue no he knows things but i dont know how he knows them he never says and jack barry where would he be somewhere in northern ireland thats all i know but you were talking to him i heard you a special phone a coded mobile it has a number but it cant be traced really she picked the mobile up whats the number he hesitated and she raised the colt he gave it to her barry was having supper when his mobile rang who is this helen lang said nobody special mr barry but i will be in touch she put the mobile in her purse moved to the desk quickly noted the number on a note pad and put that in her purse also she had switched the colt to her left hand so that she could write and cohan seizing his chance threw his glass at her and plunged through the curtains to the terrace it was stupid really he had nowhere to go there was a small fountain a fish spouting water and a step beyond the terrace wall he peered over looked at the ribbon of light moving along park lane and below the ledge spotted an iron ladder going down obviously for maintenance purposes he quickly sat astride the coping one foot feeling for the ladder just as helen lang came through the curtains the colt ready no for gods sake no he screamed and then his foot slipped and he was falling helen looked down saw a sudden stoppage of traffic horns honking the sound drifting up she turned at once went through the suite to the door opened it and went out a few moments later she was descending to the foyer she walked through to the ballroom took a glass of champagne from a tray held by one of the waiters by the door and mingled nemesis was the right word it hadnt needed her on this occasion cohan had paid an inevitable price everything came around a law of life she hadnt needed to do it herself only that it should be done it was enough she saw a great deal of movement down at the main door caught a glimpse of ferguson and dillon and then was aware of a pain in her chest she found her pill box swallowed two with a gulp of champagne and walked towards the ballroom entrance perhaps hes gone up to his suite dillon said as they finished their search of the ballroom and then there was the sound of horns from outside the ballroom a considerable disturbance hannah said to ferguson id better see what the trouble is sir the traffic had slowed noticeably and hannah immediately saw the cause of it there were people on the pavement surrounding a body and a single motorcycle cop was standing beside his machine and calling it in hannah flashed her id chief inspector bernstein special branch what happened i was just passing guv he fell from up the top nearly hit a passing couple the woman is in shock over there ive called an ambulance and backup hannah leaned down and recognized cohan at once she straightened i know this man constable hes a guest at the hotel you stay shtum no answers to any questions not to the press not to anyone this is a red alert you know what that means of course i do guv im going inside but ill be back they checked out cohans suite the three of them with a decidedly shaken duty manager hannah said not a thing no sign of a struggle i agree chief inspector ferguson said but did he fall or was he pushed he turned to dillon what do you think oh come on brigadier who believes in coincidence in our business yes i agree ferguson nodded she must be one hell of a woman im inclined to agree dillon nodded ferguson said to the duty manager keep this suite locked and secure youll have police here to do forensic tests quite soon of course brigadier ferguson turned to dillon you break the bad news to blake and obviously through him to the president ill handle the prime minister the great pity it is your knighthood going down the drain like this dillon said ferguson smiled i always knew you were on my side dillon in spite of the close proximity of the house in south audley street lady helen had arranged for hedley to wait for her in park lane in the mercedes she pushed her way out through the curious onlookers passing what was left of senator michael cohan hedley saw her coming jumped out and got the rear door open she got in he climbed behind the wheel and drove away just drive around hedley its been a heavy night she lit a cigarette what happened she told him everything so cohans gone and im actually left with a link with jack barry she held up the mobile ill try him again shall i barry grabbed at the phone when it rang who is this nemesis she said but first some hot news senator michael cohan took a fall from the seventh floor of the dorchester in park lane im using his mobile more than at any time before in his life jack barry was shaken rigid what are you telling me that senator michael cohan is lying on the pavement in park lane outside the dorchester hotel its like a bad saturday night in belfast police ambulances onlookers but then you know about this kind of thing strangely enough barry wasnt angry he actually knew a kind of fear who in the hell are you brady kelly cassidy in new york tim pat ryan in london and now senator michael cohan thats who i am she laughed that just leaves you and the connection barry took a deep breath okay so who are you loyalist freedom fighters red hand of ulster protestant scum actually it may surprise you to know that im a roman catholic mr barry religion doesnt come into it and im surprised you say protestant scum youre a protestant yourself so was wolfe tone who invented irish republicanism so was parnell who came close to achieving a united ireland she was enjoying herself now then there was oscar wilde george bernard shaw sean ocasey all prods he cut in angry now what kind of shite is this i dont need a fugging history lesson whats it about who are you the woman who is going to execute you just like i executed the others justice mr barry is what its about a rare commodity these days but i intend to have it he listened to her soft measured voice entirely the wrong kind of voice for what he was hearing his anger increased youre mad not really you butchered my son in ulster three years ago and executed his friends four of them including a woman you wouldnt remember mr barry im sure youve got so much blood on your hands its hard to remember which corpse is which she was giving him too much information but it was all right a plan was forming in her mind barry had never felt so frustrated look cohans mobile is to use to you its coded any calls are untraceable yes but i can at least speak to you okay so what is it you want its quite simple as i said you butchered my son in ulster three years ago im going to butcher you he felt a sudden touch of fear again no way youre crazy lady at least i can talk to you when i want on this very useful bone we could even arrange a meeting ill be in touch anytime you bitch you got a time and place just name it but she had already rung off lady helen said pass me the flask hedley he did so she took a swallow and passed it back excellent i feel great she got out her silver case lit a cigarette and inhaled deeply marvellous drive round for a while the palace pall mall the rain had increased again the wipers clicked backwards and forwards hedley cruised the traffic carefully i like driving in the rain she said its a safe enclosed feeling its as if the rest of the world doesnt exist do you like the rain hedley rain he laughed out loud lady helen i saw too much of it in nam patrolling in the swamps of the mekong delta leeches applying themselves to your more important bits and those monsoon rains sluicing down just hearing about it makes me shiver find a pub i feel like a drink which he did a very respectable place called the grenadier close to st jamess place theyd used it before the landlord sam hardaker was an old grenadier guards sergeant and knew hedley from his days at the embassy a real pleasure lady helen nice to see you sam i dont expect you have such a thing as a bottle of champagne one in the fridge nonvintage but bollinger promised to a grenadier guards officer at the palace but hell have to do without she and hedley sat in a corner booth sam brought the bollinger in a bucket and produced two glasses he uncorked and poured lady helen tasted it heavenly she smiled as sam filled the glasses they say that if youre tired of champagne youre tired of life i wouldnt know sam said being a beer man myself he retired and she lit another cigarette all right hedley he nodded just fine lady helen she raised a glass to us then to love and life and the pursuit of happiness he raised his glass and they touched and damnation to jack barry and the connection hedley drank some of his champagne and put the glass down you wouldnt really try to meet that bastard she lit another cigarette frowning considering the point the only way to see him hedley would be somehow to bring him to me hedley nodded okay so lets say you brought him down just like the others what then that still leaves the connection and youll never know who he is none of them did pour me another glass of champagne and lets take a philosophical viewpoint to all this she leaned back politics hedley are responsible for so many ills take the situation we are so involved with forget about the sons of erin and the connection the whole thing starts with governments having a dialogue events couldnt have proceeded without dialogue between the british and american governments the prime minister and the president and their cosy chats on the telephone so hedley said if they hadnt agreed to pool information there wouldnt have been all that juicy stuff from the intelligence services for the connection to poach she reached for the bottle and poured him another glass so where does ultimate responsibility lie i dont know what you mean ultimate power hedley holds the final responsibility in this case if the white house was involved ultimate power lies with the president himself she glanced at her watch oh its late lets go hedley handed her into the mercedes went round and got behind the wheel as he drove away he said for gods sake what are you saying ive secured an invitation to chad luthers party at his long island estate next week the president is the guest of honour i understand hedley swerved my god you wouldnt she frowned and then laughed oh good heavens hedley do you think i mean to assassinate him oh dear oh dear what must you think of me she shook her head i havent gone over the edge hedley no i meant that i could always discuss it with him discuss it you mean lay the whole thing on the table everything youve done the killings hell hed have you arrested you dont see it do you she lit a cigarette its his white house so its his mess he doesnt want it out in the open any more than i do this whole white house connection business would be an enormous scandal it could imperil his presidency it would certainly damage the peace process in ireland that hes worked so hard for he has to unmask the connection she gazed at hedley or who knows what might leak to the press hedley was aghast you mean youd blackmail the president youd be willing to go that far he shook his head youve got the bad guys lady helen let it go just let it be i cant she said im on borrowed time hedley much more so than you realize and this is too important so long island it is if youre not happy with that then dont come hey i dont deserve that i know you dont youve been solid as a rock my truest friend i dont need a snow job thats all im saying so youll come he sighed where else would i go he changed gears youre not still going to carry that colt in your purse are you of course i am she said who knows she smiled i might meet the connection blake listened to what dillon had to say when the irishman was finished blake said takes me back to my fbi days and the mostwanted list the kind of killers who are obsessive so you think the same person got cohan as got the others of course i do i believe in coincidence as much as you do so that means the woman dillon said i suppose it does how does that fit in with fbi or cia statistics i mean we know of women involved in terrorist movements in the past the baadermeinhof gang in germany the ira the palestinians but its still a minority classification so if we accept the idea it means that a single woman is responsible for the total demise of the sons of erin shes killed five people sean my friend blake said have you got a better suggestion actually no but i think it would be useful if you put some more work in with your police friend captain parker such as i havent the slightest idea but cops are cops they smell things other people dont if he sniffs around whats left of the good senator there might be some useful information okay leave it with me blake rang off sat there thinking about it and phoned the president youve heard about cohan i could hardly avoid it cazalet said its all over cnn can i see you come straight up the president sat at his desk in the oval office in shirt sleeves signing papers passed to him by the chief of staff thornton also in shirt sleeves looked up and grinned lopsidedly you look glum blake and no wonder cazalet leaned back well finish these later so what now blake god knows blake told him you do think he was pushed thornton asked of course he was pushed or else he panicked and jumped blake was exasperated come on gentlemen you know the background you know the score do you really believe this was an accident cohan simply leaning too far out over his balcony cazalet said so lets simplify it theres somebody out there whos killed the five american members of this sons of erin closed it down id say thornton put in so whats left cazalet asked jack barry hiding out in ulster and the connection here in washington thornton said but is this of any importance in view of whats happened lets put it this way blake said the connections power didnt derive solely from the classified information which came his way that information was only of use because he had people to act on it and theyre all dead cazalet said not barry hes still alive and kicking and more dangerous than any of them with the connection still in place and barry out there as his gun hand weve still got a big problem what do you suggest the president said i thought id check cohans new york background my friend captain parker might be able to come up with something blake looked at cazalet and i think its time for a fullbore investigation right here in the white house mr president good i agree cazalet told him you check on cohan he turned to thornton and you see what you can come up with here henry if theres a white house leak then i think thats a matter for my chief of staff ill get right on to it mr president thornton said and he and blake walked out together as they moved along the corridor blake said what do you intend god knows we need to keep the lid on this its political dynamite you do your thing blake ill start doing background checks on everyone in this place ill put the secret service on it will you tell them why good god no not at the moment well just do a discreet check if nothing shows up well think again stay in touch blake moved on and thornton watched him go smiling no fear in him at all it was strange how excited he felt blake reported the interview to ferguson and ferguson spoke briefly to the prime minister on the phone it really does seem to be getting out of hand brigadier i obviously take full responsibility for what happened last night ferguson told him i dont need that brigadier the prime minister said not your fault not my fault but lets get it sorted and he put the phone down ferguson at his desk said to hannah bernstein and dillon east he isnt asking for a scapegoat what now sir hannah asked it was dillon who provided the answer its all up to blake id say yes i think you could be right ferguson said thornton phoned through to barry cazalet thornton and blake johnson just had a little talk in the oval office should i get excited barry asked just tell me thornton did when he was finished barry said ah thats tame stuff what is there for them to find out about cohan in new york was he into girls did he use mens toilets too much come on i agree its a negative exercise i dont think we have anything to worry about we barry said they know exactly where i am they dont know a damn thing about you and it will stay that way as far as im concerned so dont go getting any ideas in your head barry remember even if they get to you it wont help them get to me bastard barry told him and thornton rang off barry lit a cigarette and moved to the window the rain drove against it one thing he hadnt told the connection of course was the matter of cohans mobile and the fact that the mystery woman was linked to him it was a bizarre kind of psychological umbilical cord he turned and looked at his own mobile on the table strange how he almost wanted it to ring to hear her voice she was at that precise moment driving back to norfolk sitting in the rear seat of her mercedes for once the only light the one from the dashboard and the headlights cutting into the dark she felt very calm very comfortable it was that safe enclosed feeling again music was playing softly just loud enough to hear shed told hedley to put the tape on one of her husbands favourites al bowlly the most popular british crooner of his day more popular in england in the nineteen thirties than bing crosby killed in the blitz i like this one she said moonlight on the highway rather appropriate but not your cup of tea hedley said you know my tastes lady helen im strictly an ella fitzgerald and count basie man a strange man al bowlly she lit a cigarette apparently he was from south africa but some people said from the middle east in england he took ten years off his age became a big band singer women adored him he dined at the savoy with the aristocracy was friends with the most notorious gangsters in london some guy hedley said he believed in his personal destiny especially during the blitz in london in nineteen forty when the nazis tried to bomb us out of the war one evening he was walking up a london street when a bomb fell the blast went the other way he was unharmed hell that happened to me more than once in nam bowlly interpreted it as a sort of sign from heaven he believed it meant he was invincible and what happened oh a few weeks later there was an air raid warning everybody at the apartment block was supposed to go down to the cellars he stayed in bed nothing to fear you see and they found him dead in bed the blast from a falling bomb had blown his door off its hinges which hit bowlly exactly hedley drove in silence for a while and finally said look what was the point of that story fate i suppose and how it cant be avoided you think youve avoided death in one place and he finds you in another sure i can see that but i dont see how it affects you oh i do hedley she leaned back the story illustrates the inevitability of things like you taking on the president of the united states i cant buy that lady helen i surely cant remember the sign another president had on his desk the buck stops here well he was right she peered out at the dark oh look where we are i need tea and a sandwich lets stop they were at an oldfashioned truck stand at the side of the road one theyd stopped at before the flap up against the rain it was almost two in the morning two roadliner trucks parked nearby the drivers eating in their cabs hedley ordered steak sandwiches on white toast and tea hot and strong she joined him watching the woman who ran the place frying the steaks smells good hedley it always does lady helen she bit into the sandwich juice running down her cheek and the woman leaned over and offered a paper napkin there you go love rain poured off the canopy she finished the sandwich and drank the strong bitter tea and when she was finished said lets go she sat in the passenger seat beside him you think im crazy hedley it was a statement i think youre going too far lady helen she lit another cigarette most people take the other way in life let things go all good manners and politeness i remember once sitting in the corner of a london restaurant with a man whod been my accountant next to us were four women all smoking one of them in a wheelchair my friend whispered that he couldnt take the smoke would have to leave the woman in the wheelchair said loudly that it was a pity some people couldnt learn a little tolerance what happened i put him in a taxi then went back and told the woman in the wheelchair that at least she was alive whereas my friend with lung cancer had three weeks to live she frowned why am i telling you this probably because it was the first time i really stood up in a public sense to be counted i couldnt stand by just like you couldnt stand by over the sons of erin okay i see that only the president he shook his head you dont see anything hedley youre a lovely man but like most people you see only what you think you do you look at me and think im the woman ive always been its not true im a woman in a hurry hedley because i have no time to lose hey dont say things like that its the truth hedley im going to die not tonight and not tomorrow but soon too soon and ive got things to do and by god im going to do them im going to long island to face the president and ive got barry on the end of that coded mobile any time i want him all i have to do is reel him in she took out her pill bottle and shook two into her palm so pass that whiskey flask and put your foot down we could be home by three but the weather became even worse the rain torrential and when they drove down the hill overlooking the village it was a scene of chaos the water overflowing a foot deep in the street and men struggling at the lock gate hedley pulled in at the pub old tom armsby was putting sandbags at the door and hetty was helping him she looked up as the mercedes stopped and lady helen opened the door looks bad it is bad and all down to the parish council the mean bastards wouldnt find the money to fix that lock gate after the last time when hedley saved us much more of this and every cottage in the village will be flooded lady helen turned to hedley theyre ordinary folk most of them pensioners it would ruin them i know he got out into the rain took off his chauffeurs tunic and rolled up his sleeves standing there in a pool of water whats that phrase where you have a sense that youve been here before deja vu its french yes it would be he turned and went towards the men struggling at the lock gate and she got out and waded after him there was a young man in the turbulent waters below he was obviously halfdead but he tried to go under again and was thrown back up retching get him out of here hedley ordered the boy was plucked from the water and dragged up the bank wheres a crowbar someone held one out hedley took it and without hesitation plunged in he surfaced took a deep breath went down and felt for the iron clasps on the gate that had been temporarily repaired after the previous occasion he forced the crowbar in worked at it then had to surface gasping for breath he went down again twice three times always more difficult and then the clasp gave the gates started to open and then the force of the water drove them wide hedley surfaced to a ragged cheer for already the flood waters were subsiding willing hands pulled him from the water he got to his feet and stood there in the rain and hetty armsby ran over with a blanket and put it round him oh you wonderful bastard come on into the pub and the rest of you as well to hell with the law tonight everyone moved forward and lady helen joined hedley dont let it go to your head i wouldnt be as blasphemous as to say you walk on water but they just might change the name of the church to st hedley the following morning at compton place the weather was still dreadful an east wind driving in the rain waves breaking across the long flat sands of horseshoe bay helen wrapped up in storm coat and hood cantered her mare through pine woods that broke the worst excesses of the storm paused in the shelter of the wall of an old ruined chapel and lit a cigarette with difficulty in her cupped hands she looked out at the churning sea and remembered a visit to friends in long island some years before not in the fashionable summer but late winter just like this shed been shown chad luthers mansion a palace of a place lawns running into the waters of the sound no one in residence so she didnt enjoy a conducted tour chad had invited her many times mainly because he liked money and she had more than he did she had never accepted for a simple reason she didnt like him vulgar vain conceited she pulled herself up and said softly come on my dear who are you to make such judgements somebody must love him though god alone knows who which still left long island in her mind she shook the reins and galloped away hedley had driven down to the village to see the state of the game it was still raining hard and the water in the slot was high but there were no problems he called at the village shop filled out a grocery order and drove back to the house there was no sign of lady helen he left the groceries in the kitchen went out into the yard and heard the sound of pistol fire coming from the barn when he went in she was standing shooting at the targets with the colt he said so i take it we are still going to long island and the colt will still be in your purse day after tomorrow she said and reloaded ill use one of the company gulfstreams we can land at westhampton airport in long island very convenient i still wish you werent taking the gun though as i told you i want to be ready for anything for whatever opportunity arises you dont need to come if you arent happy oh but i do need to come he picked up a browning from the selection of weapons on the table and fired very rapidly at the targets shooting four of them through the head showing off again hedley no he said just checking im on form so i can make sure youre on form after all what if you meet the connection so youll come youre with me oh ill come all right someones got to watch out for you he took the colt from her checked it and handed it back okay take your stance and remember what i told you new york washington chapter eleven blake sat in parkers office the following morning drank coffee and ate a ham sandwich he was quite alone outside the end of march weather was as lousy as it could be powdery flakes of wet snow drifted against the window the door opened and parker came in in shirt sleeves they said you were here hey feel free with my coffee break i just flew in from washington the weather was so bad they couldnt serve breakfast serves you right for joining the jet set parker sat down picked up the phone and ordered another sandwich and more coffee he shook his head you are in deep shit my friend i beg your pardon come on cohan all the newspapers indicated an unfortunate accident but you and i know better at that moment his assistant an older woman police sergeant came in without knocking and put more coffee and sandwiches on the desk have mine ive already ordered more i figured mr white house here would clean you out she went blake said what a treasure and what a healthy appetite too much for you with your weight to consider he took another sandwich and parker said screw you blake he took a sandwich himself so whats the score simple the sons of erin all gone to the great diners club in the sky cohan ryan kelly brady cassidy thats five blake opened one of the coffee containers come on you bastard all those years on the street how many murders have you investigated a hundred and fortyseven i kept count so whats your verdict you dont accept this sectarian nonsense do you crap parker finished his sandwich the pattern is clear the motive is revenge revenge for something the sons of erin were responsible for id say so blake sat there thinking about it i agree but it still doesnt get us very far ive been thinking about cohan why wasnt he attacked in new york like the others you dont happen to have any attempted burglaries on his house do you that sort of thing lets have a look the last sandwich in his left hand parker went to his computer sat down and tapped the keys no no such reports he paused just a minute thats interesting what is last week there were a couple of murders in an alley next to cohans house typical street bad guys shot dead autopsy showed lots of alcohol and traces of cocaine both of them were in police hands many times street dealers one of them ran whores the screen kept changing blake trying to suppress a rising excitement said what kind of gun was it parker tapped then leaned back dear god a colt he turned let me crossreference he attacked the keys in a kind of frenzy and finally stopped there you go blake you thought you had four members of the sons of erin shot by the same weapon ive got you two more blake was stunned but why these guys parker sat there thinking about it look the obvious link is cohans house thats in an exclusive area these guys were lowlifes probably just passing through you mean in the wrong place at the wrong time how in the hell would i know im clutching at straws man maybe someone was waiting for cohan and these two turned up blake nodded yeah oh man so what are you going to do im going to take a look at the scene of the crime he stood up thanks harry im sure ill be back and he left lady helen went for a walk holding a golfing umbrella against the rain she stopped in the pine trees looked out at the turbulent sea took out the mobile and phoned barry ah there you are she said what do you want nothing special i just thought id make a connection its a terrible day here raining like hell barry felt surprisingly calm that link again where are you ah progress its the first time youve asked ill tantalize you the east coast of england yorkshire norfolk that would be telling he was surprised at how reasonable she sounded look what do you want you mr barry thats what i want dead of course she rang off barry went to the cupboard got a bottle of paddy whiskey and poured one it scalded the back of his mouth when he lit another cigarette his hand was shaking she wasnt going to go away that was obvious so he phoned the connection look i didnt tell you everything about the cohan business thornton said well youd better do it now which barry did when he was finished thornton said tell me again what she said about her son barry thought for a moment she said i butchered her son in ulster three years ago and executed his friends four others including a woman does that strike a chord with you for gods sake ive been at war for years you want to know how many people ive killed okay okay just leave it with me there may be a link here ill check it out blake had his car drop him in front of cohans house on park avenue but on the other side of the street he sat there reading the sceneofcrime reports it was all pretty straightforward it had been after midnight heavy rain clearing the streets he tried to imagine the scene as he looked across at cohans place dark wet not much of a struggle because the pathologists report indicated instant death in both cases and then he frowned there was an anomaly here he turned to the pathology report and examined it quickly victim one blood group o victim two blood group a the only trouble was that there were traces of another blood group on victim twos shirt this time b so there was a third party involvement some sort of a struggle could that have been the killer blake frowned for some reason he didnt buy that the way the two guys had been shot had been so instantly effective so ruthless why would there have been a struggle he frowned again unless there had been another person four persons not three he decided to try and get the perspective from the pavement a different viewpoint go back to police headquarters and wait for me there he told his driver ill get a cab just hand me the umbrella the driver did as he was told and drove away as blake opened the umbrella so it was night and she was waiting for cohan to return home from some function or other where would you wait this side of the street not the other because from here you got a clear view from here a halfway decent shot was possible he turned and looked behind plenty of doorways to stand in concealed by the shadows so what happened what went wrong to hell with it blake thought took out a pack of marlboros and lit one this wasnt a time to give up smoking he inhaled deeply and that damn march rain dripped from the umbrella the two victims were in the alley probably sheltering from the rain they shouldnt have been there not at such a time and in such an area so im the killer blake thought and im waiting here for cohan so what went wrong he looked across at cohans house and at that moment a young couple came around the corner further along park avenue huddled under an umbrella blake watched them go move past the alley walk to the next corner and disappear thats it he said softly just as i thought someone walked into something the wrong place at the wrong time so the individual with the b blood group had left the scene god knows in what condition and to where blake crossed the street and paused at the alley so say someone was running which way would they go right or left what the hell he would go to the left first for no better reason than thats the way the young couple had gone he lit another cigarette and walked steadily along the sidewalk in the rain turned the corner and carried on for another block passing offices the occasional boutique all of which would have been closed after midnight but not that place he said softly looking across the intersection they never close the sign said st marys hospital it was private and a large painted board offered a range of services including ambulance accident and emergency so here we are blake said its the early hours of the morning its raining and youre bleeding now where would you go he moved into a doorway got his mobile phone out and called harry parker harry i need you have you got something lets say my nose is twitching and if im right i need a police presence so where are you blake told him fine ill see you soon when parker and blake went into the emergency room of st marys they found it surprisingly luxurious fitted carpets comfortable chairs calming music the duty nurse at reception wore a uniform which could have been designed by armani and probably had been gentlemen she was slightly wary can i help you harry flashed his gold badge captain parker n ypd i need some information its tied to a murder investigation then id better get our chief administrator mr schofield you do that honey harry said schofield wore a blue chalkstriped suit and looked tanned and fit they sat in his rather sumptuous office and blake told him all he needed to know that there had been a double shooting not too far away and that there was a possibility of a third person injured to some degree or another sounds important schofield said yes well my friend here is fbi thats how important it is harry parker told him so what do you want from me blake reached for a memo pad and scribbled a date the early morning of that day did you get anyone coming into the er sometime after midnight bleeding theres a question of patient confidentiality here gentlemen and theres the question of a presidential warrant here blake produced the document and presented it schofield said jesus okay lets take a look at the desk he looked through the admissions book then nodded there was a patient noted here name of jean wiley booked in at onefifteen am on the indicated date her face was cut the night intern handled it dr bryant the lady receptionist said dr bryant is on duty today mr schofield i saw him going down to the cafeteria fine parker said just point the way mr schofield bryant was around thirty slightly overweight with glasses dark curling hair and a beard he was sitting at a corner table eating french bread and soup he looked up schofield my man what are you trying to sell me these gentlemen would like a word with you he turned to them dr bryant graduated top of his class from harvard medical school were lucky to have him do bear that in mind wont you oh clarence bryant said stop stroking me now what is this so parker introduced himself and blake got rid of schofield and told him parker said to bryant you know something about this i know you do okay im thinking about it blake said ill get you some coffee tea man tea i spent three years at guys hospital in london got a taste for it english breakfast blake got the tea and returned to find bryant crumpling an empty cigarette pack blake took out his marlboros i thought you doctors were against tobacco are you denying me my rights so lets get to those really lousy early morning shifts and someone called jean wiley coming in off the street what was that problem her face had been cut not too badly but by a knife unmistakably did you ask for details parker said of course she said shed slipped and cut her face in the kitchen balls would you say blake asked no bollocks they would say in london her face had been cut by a knife i did some excellent embroidery work she gave us her insurance information and left okay parker said if she gave her insurance details theyll have it on the computer we can get her blood group that way no need for that bryant said i remember it they looked at him and he seemed to blush slightly ive seen her around a few times in the same coffee shop for lunch nicks place around the corner shes well shes attractive he shrugged and grinned anyway shes a b parker checked his watch lunch just coming up bryant hesitated and repeated what schofield had said earlier hey theres such a thing as the doctorpatient relationship here theres also such a thing as a double killing up the street just before she came in here this is important doc the nypd doesnt put police captains out on shit cases and neither does the fbi shes not much more than a kid youre not saying she killed anybody no im not blake said but to use a fine old police phrase in pursuance of our inquiries we need to cross her off the list okay bryant said wearily ill show you who she is but take it easy on her huh this is the new police department parker told him were trained for sensitivity now lets get going nicks place was small tucked away in a side street three guys behind the counter rattling away at each other in greek as they handled short orders and one of them made fresh sandwiches it was warm and muggy and because of the rain the windows were partially steamed up bryant peered inside i cant see any sight of her okay so lets stand over here and wait parker said ive got patients bryant said as they stepped into a shop doorway and then he stiffened hey there she is crossing the road the small dark girl in the blue raincoat black umbrella jean wiley put the umbrella down and went into nicks place nice legs bryant observed yes well remember your concern over the doctorpatient relationship parker told him thank you very much dr bryant you can go now if you need me you know where to find me bryant walked away pulling up his collar blake and parker moved to the window of nicks place and peered in the girl had taken coffee and a sandwich on a tray and moved to the back of the room to a booth it was still early and there were few customers how do we play this harry parker asked good guybad guy shouldnt really be necessary lets say youre a nice big avuncular cop doing your duty with deep regret and im mr nice guy fed but remember one thing old buddy blake said im in charge im the one who decides what happens to her the more i find out about this business the more im happy to know it isnt my responsibility parker said in we go jean wiley was eating a chicken sandwich with salad and reading a paperback novel at the same time blake noticed it was jane austens emma she glanced up a slight frown on her face may we join you parker said id have thought there was plenty of room elsewhere i think youd better say yes blake told her gently parker flashed his gold badge n ypd captain harry parker my friend here mr johnson is with the fbi we think you might be able to help us blake said it relates to a double shooting last week her face said it all it seemed to crumple went very pale oh my god she aged right there in front of them i need the bathroom sure you do harry parker said only dont go trying the back door i know who you are so id have to send a squad car and im sure your boss wouldnt like that she gave a dry sob as she got up knocking over her coffee cup she ran to the back of the coffee shop and one of the men came from behind the counter a cloth in his hand all belligerence hey what gives shes a nice kid you cant come in and interfere with my customers i can close you down if i want harrys gold badge appeared again police business the young lady witnessed a crime blake said we just need a few questions answered the mans attitude changed completely hey im nick this is my place you want some coffee great parker told him thats what i like cooperation the girl returned in a few minutes still pale but composed there was a hint of steel there this was no bimbo blake was certain of it she sat down and sipped some of the coffee nick had brought right what do you want a few details jean wiley am i right parker said twentyfour so thats a neat scar on your left cheek itll fade with time but it could make you look interestingly different she was angry her eyes dark blake said what do you do im an associate at weingarten moore just round the comer i got my law degree from columbia two years ago so i know my rights gentlemen hey why are we being nice here parker appealed to blake and turned to the girl you want to tell us how your blood got on to the shirt of a murdered man that really jolted her she turned to blake startled inquiring and he said look why fool around last week two lowlifes were shot dead in an alley a few blocks from here sometime after midnight the thing is one guy was blood group a and the other o said parker except there were traces of blood group b on his shirt blake said which obviously got there when he cut your cheek parker told her probably as he held you and you struggled im right arent i those two grabbed you as you walked past her face was wild now her voice low bastards dirty rotten bastards she took a deep breath and sipped some coffee her hand shaking its a nice story captain but i know my rights and im saying nothing hell a dna check would say everything blake saw it all now saw it as it must have been it all came together dillon at wapping in the thames staring up at tim pat ryan and certain death and saved by the woman the unknown executioner who had taken out the sons of erin one by one they intended to rape you perhaps murder you blake said softly you struggled you were threatened with a knife your face was cut and then a woman walked out of all that darkness and rain and shot them dead parker turned to him frowning what is this but it was the girl who was most affected total shock on her face how did you know that there was total stillness between them blake said sometimes these things are like a jigsaw you keep getting nowhere and then all the pieces fall into place and there it is the complete picture even parker was gentle now tell us about her honey i cant she said id rather die than see anything happen to that woman she was shaking blake turned and called to nick can we have a brandy here you carry that good and fresh coffee some of that black turkish stuff she got her purse open fumbled out a pack of cigarettes and dropped them damn she said im supposed to have stopped you me and everyone else i know blake got out his marl boros lit one and passed it to her just like now voyager she laughed nervously yeah hes really a very romantic guy parker took the brandy from nick and passed it to her get that down she did as she was told coughed once then reached for the coffee best fix in the world parker added and its legal and heres something else thats legal blake told her something they probably only whispered about in your law courses he passed her the presidential warrant she read it quickly and looked up at him in awe my god which means that you could tell captain parker here that you killed those two guys and he couldnt do a thing about it she glanced at parker hes right honey he said she nodded and it was as if she was looking back into the past youve no idea what its like you men when youre a woman in a really bad situation its the worst thing in the world she shuddered so dirty so foul its like the end of everything and then a guardian angel descends blake suggested tell us about it i was on a date that went wrong a guy who lied didnt tell me he was married we were having supper at this italian place a few blocks away late supper after a show he got drunk let slip the fact that he had a little woman at home and a couple of kids i ended up walking out and you couldnt find a cab parker said it was after midnight but more than that it was raining like hell and when can you get a cab in manhattan when its raining so you started walking blake said in all my finery i had a small umbrella but i still got soaked i was so angry just storming along in a kind of rage and then i passed this alley and there were voices shouting and then i was grabbed hustled inside one guy held me the other cut my cheek with one of those spring blade knives she shuddered deeply they kept saying what they were going to do the language was foul and then she appeared blake asked it was as if they werent there as if she was talking to herself it was unbelievable her voice was so gentle she told them to let me go i could see her standing there in the entrance to the alley one of them was holding me from behind and the other shouted at her all threats i cant recall the exact words and he made a move i think and her hand came up with a hat on it and she shot him through the hat a big explosion parker asked no sort of a muted sound a silencer he nodded and the other he tried to use me as a shield he had a knife but she shot him in the head over my shoulder parker turned to blake ill tell you one thing she must be good to risk a shot like that and then theres the silencer you were right blake a pro in a way i hadnt realized blake said tell me about her that was the strange thing she was a real lady could have been late sixties she wore a rain hat a trenchcoat carried an umbrella her hair what i could see of it was white her face dont ask me to go through the photos it would be a waste of time i didnt see enough of her to make a positive identification and i wouldnt thats okay blake said i wouldnt ask you to theres a lot to this that youll never know matters of national security this is not a case that ever comes to court the two guys she shot are just two more on a list of new york street killings never solved so i wont be pulled in or anything absolutely not he turned to parker please confirm that the police captain said hes in charge im only here to help in any way i can im as much at the mercy of that presidential warrant as you are i guarantee that your identity will be mentioned to no one blake said i will tell only the facts of this affair even to the president but you have my solemn oath that your name will never be mentioned how about him she nodded to parker tell her harry blake said dont know what youre talking about honey harry parker told her never seen you before the two men got up with luck i wont need to speak to you again miss wiley he turned and hesitated just one thing what did she sound like oh a lady a real lady like i said you know the kind of person almost english are you saying she could be english parker said oh no just blueblooded american that kind of accent you mean you could have bumped into her going round the designer rooms at bergdorf goodman parker asked or harrods in london she shrugged she was an upperclass lady what more can i say good parker nodded dont forget to get the restaurant to book you a cab next time and he led the way out they stood there in the rain blake said what do you think its the damnedest thing i ever heard of blake youve got some angelic elderly lady out there like the presidents mother knocking off two lowlife rapists like shes an ageing dirty harry just like she did tim pat ryan in london and brady kelly and cassidy in new york and probably cohan in london i told you blake every policemans instinct tells me this whole thing is very personal i agree i think theres more there to do with the sons of erin than you realize but that isnt my problem its yours according to your presidential warrant our lunch with the wiley girl never happened he glanced at his watch got to go ive got a meeting with the commissioner and you know whats so frustrating i cant tell him what great work ive done on this case he went off like a strong wind hailing a cab blake watched him go then turned and walked away he caught the shuttle back to washington thought about things then called alice quarmby and told her to set up a meeting with the president did you get anywhere she was guarded as usual its a highly unusual story alice he said but ill tell you later as luck would have it he was alone the next seat vacant he lay back tilted his seat closed his eyes and started right at the beginning allowing one event to flow into another trying to make sense of it all the only trouble was that he became so relaxed he fell asleep and was only aroused by the touch of a hand on his shoulder as they landed at washington alice had coffee waiting hot and strong and he sat behind his desk sipped it and looked at the intray looks like a lot to me alice i can handle most of it just needs a signature what happened he told her everything that had taken place everything jean wiley had said though he didnt disclose her name i think captain parker is right she said when he was finished its something personal were missing something to do with those sons of erin bastards why alice bad language at your age dont be funny she looked at her watch if youre interested youve got six minutes to get up to see the president try the pool first thanks very much he pushed his chair back and jumped up ill do you a favour sometime alice and he hurried out chapter twelve jake cazalet was in the white house swimming pool flailing up and down one length after another watched by two marine sergeants immaculate in white track suits who acted as lifeguards he swam to the side and looked up at blake anything productive you could say that mr president okay we cant talk now ill shower and change and see you upstairs but i dont have long got a pile of work to do when blake went into the oval office henry thornton was arranging a stack of papers on the desk how did it go well lets say i learned a lot but not enough thornton raised a hand dont tell me lets wait for the great man himself i always prefer to share bad news with others it detracts from any feeling of personal responsibility are you getting anywhere with your background checks blake asked not so far thornton said the president breezed in his hair still damp and tousled okay blake lets hear the worst when blake was finished both his listeners looked serious thornton said well theres one thing mr president at least we know this mystery woman dillon mentioned exists more than that it would appear shes been responsible for all the killings and that really is incredible cazalet said but why some sort of vendetta blake told him its the only explanation and this girl whose name you wont give us thornton said she wasnt able to help in any other way as ive told you she described the woman for what its worth and what a description thornton said sixties whitehaired blueblood accent we seem to be talking high society here come on blake this girl cant she come up with more cazalet raised a hand no what blake got is all there is i accept that just as i accept blakes integrity in holding to his word both to that young woman and to captain parker for backing him to the hilt in this matter fine mr president thornton said but where does it leave us no further forward have you got anywhere with your own investigation thornton said im afraid not cazalet nodded frowning i suggest you speak to brigadier ferguson blake bring him up to date is there anything else you can do ive been wondering whether any of the premises near the alley where the two shootings took place might have anything on their security videos for the time in question that would show the woman perhaps a long shot okay pursue that and as i say bring ferguson up to date cazalet nodded perhaps it might even be an idea to have dillon over but how would that help mr president thornton asked well he did catch sight of the mystery woman in wapping after the tim pat ryan shooting a glimpse only blake pointed out yes but the same glimpse on a security video could match up what else have we got not very much mr president so to other matters this party of chad luthers day after tomorrow in quogue he turned to thornton any special problems henry none mr president he turned to blake good old chad is our biggest fundraiser and hell have all the world and his wife there will you use air force one sir blake asked no ill go down in one of the gulfstreams the president nodded pursue your inquiries but i want you to join up with the security arrangements too and come to long island take the helicopter forgive me mr president but ill have sean dillon here by then bring him with you by all means id appreciate seeing him again cazalet smiled but now i really must get on good old henry here will be breathing fire and smoke before i know where i am thornton laughed appreciatively and blake withdrew back in his office he spoke to harry parker and raised the question of security videos parker said thats a good point thinking about things after you left it occurred to me too ill check thats that then blake said i saw the president told him everything about our talk with the girl he said he appreciated your help harry hey dont fuck with me its the truth harry ill keep you posted harry parker sat there at his desk frowning thinking about what blake had said then his phone rang again and a womans voice said captain parker who is this i have the president for you parker sat there in total astonishment gripping the phone and the president said harry parker jake cazalet parker managed to mumble mr president just wanted to thank you for your efforts blake johnson has filled me in i know the fact of a presidential warrant must have given you a problem it goes against the grain of all your service experience but im personally immensely grateful for the help youve given without hesitation in a most serious and confidential matter mr president i am yours to command blake handles a very special unit on my behalf captain and frankly there are more demands on its services all the time i know it would be asking a lot to ask a longserving nypd captain to make a move at this time in his career but i wonder if youd be interested parker managed to stay calm i said yours to command mr president and i meant that excellent not right away but youll be hearing from blake in the future the phone clicked off harry parker sat staring at his own and then replaced it he got up went to the window and looked out at new york in the rain a whole new life beckoned at a time when other guys were thinking about retirement he went back to his desk opened the second drawer and took out a highly illegal romeo y julietta cuban cigar bit off the end lit it and sat down well now he was grinning all over his face well now it was evening in london when blake spoke to ferguson he gave the brigadier a total resume of what had happened the interview with the wiley girl what the president had said ferguson listened then said so as regards hunting down our mystery woman were left with the slim chance that some park avenue security video might feature her im waiting to hear the president feels it might be worth having dillon here hes the only one whos ever glimpsed this woman perhaps he could match it to a glimpse on video i doubt it but ill have him on his way on the next available flight i appreciate that sir good stay in touch ferguson put the phone down thought about it then rang transportation at the ministry of defence brigadier ferguson here whats the quickest flight to washington concorde in the morning sir well her majestys government will just have to spring for it i suppose book dillon on it if its full throw someone off next he phoned stable mews there was no reply he tried dillons mobile and did better the irishmans voice was clear against a background of voices and music and who is this disturbing my early evening dillon demanded me you silly bastard where are you mulligans ferguson hesitated then gave in well the oysters are appealing even if you arent dillon ill be there in twenty minutes dillon sat in the upstairs bar of mulligans irish restaurant in cork street not too far from the ritz hotel and devoured a dozen oysters and a bottle of cristal champagne to help things along ferguson came up the stain and pushed through the crowd so there you are he picked up the cristal bottle what happened to the krug a young irish girl appeared is there a problem she asked dillon in irish a decent girl from cork who understands me dillon told him and smiled at the girl as he replied in irish dont be put off my love he looks like the kind of english lord whod put his boot to you but his sainted mother was from cork give him a dozen oysters and a pint of guinness she gave him a smile and vanished to the kitchen ferguson said i didnt understand a word but youre going to feed me of course now whats up you at dawn then its heathrow for the concorde to washington dillon still smiled but the grey eyes didnt tell me forty minutes later the brigadier swallowed his last oyster an expression of ecstasy on his face superb only an irish bar could do oysters like this so dillon what do you think about blake and where we are god knows i knew we were dealing with a woman because id seen her now this girls story confirms what any kind of sense always indicated that it wasnt some organization after the sons of erin but some individual seeking revenge but for what perhaps youll come up with something over there ferguson said i always believe in travelling hopefully dillon poured him a glass of cristal mind you one thing does intrigue me what would that be we know all these facts about the whole sons of erin business and yet the secret intelligence service knows nothing just the usual stuff on barry but nothing more a great big blank it smells to me of one of those itdidnthappen jobs as far as simon carter and company are concerned you could be right i always am dillon said in his office in the basement blake sat thinking finally he pressed a buzzer for alice she came in and sat down you look as if youve got a problem the leak the white house leak there has to be more we can do on it so you dont have much faith in the chief of staffs efforts its not that i just feel were missing something look alice say youre the connection the sons of erin are all gone youre left with one person to talk to jack barry so so remember when we tracked down that pentagon spy a couple of years ago patterson comprehension dawned you mean synod exactly why not set the synod computer to tracking some calls insert the name jack barry see what crops up were tracking northern ireland no i would suspect coded mobiles at that end so thats no good stick with barry and see what comes up the white house first then washington millions of calls blake thats what synod covers but it will tell us where any calls to someone called barry originate from lets try it alice what have we got to lose in washington thornton phoned barry i have more intelligence for you blake johnson managed to track down a young woman in new york with quite a story well tell me which thornton did when he was finished barry said the old bitch just let me get my hands on her dont get so worked up you dont even know who she is neither do you and neither does johnson nor the president nor your old pal dillon in london by the way dillon is due here soon to see if he can recognize the woman from security videos i keep wondering how you know all this ive told you before i have my sources you let me worry about my end just you worry about your own all right so what about the woman leave it with me maybe i can come up with something that evening thornton started to trawl his computer he had the ability to access most things probably anything when he had the time to start with he went into cia records of protestant loyalist paramilitary groups in northern ireland he ran jack barry through as well as every ira and sinn fein activist from gerry adams to martin mcguinness jack barry had spent a lot of time in the middle east was known to have visited the states under three false names during the same period this still left what had happened to the sons of erin from tim pat ryan to senator cohan there was no way of denying a deliberate campaign to wipe them out why would that be he nodded to himself vengeance but for what reason what could they have been responsible for he thought about it and the one thing that made sense was what the woman had said to barry you butchered my son in ulster three years ago executed his friends four of them including a woman he went back three years earlier on the computer looking for information to the white house from brit intelligence and then he remembered his first big coup the undercover group in ulster in those halcyon days the brits had been encouraged by their own government to give the fullest information to the white house the information had streamed in and was only one of many things he had passed on to barry he returned to the computer tapped the keys and brought it all back jason a lieutenant in the marine commandos shot in londonderry archer a lieutenant in the military police a car bomb in omagh there was a woman lieutenant also royal military police shot in the street in belfast a young acting captain of infantry chosen apparently because his mother was from ulster which left one thornton sat there thinking about it then tried the fifth member of the group and its commander major peter lang scots guards and sas killed in south armagh by a car bomb of such devastating power that no body had ever been discovered he sat there thinking about it and knew he was on to something reached for the phone and rang barrys coded mobile barry asleep came awake churlishly who is this tell me thornton said the undercover group of brit officers you took out three years ago what is this the woman said you butchered her son and executed four more including a woman ive just remembered myself i sent you the information in the good old days when the brits trusted us barry sat up i remember now and the commander a major peter lang according to the records he was killed by a car bomb so big that even his bits and pieces were never recovered barry reached for a cigarette he didnt die in a car bomb we blew his car up with a big charge to confuse the opposition what did you do what do you want to know for you never asked for details then its important tell me he was very english upperclass a hard bastard got him coming out of a pub one of the lads had served in the scots guards and recognized him what did you do put the screws on him its all coming back he had a great south armagh accent i mean it all stank to high heaven so you tortured him something like that barry snapped whats so special with this guy and why did you blow up his car and pretend barry laughed the boys left him in such a mess we put him through this big concrete mixer we found on a motorway bypass they were building in the area the thought of it was so nauseating that even thornton had to catch his breath whats so important barry asked i might be on to something ill phone you back thornton rang off he went back to peter lang scots guards sas military cross for unspecified reasons the father sir roger lang a colonel in the scots guards then came the information that took his breath away the mother was lady helen lang an american citizen born in boston the rest of the details flowed across the computer screen her companies her immense wealth her addresses in london and norfolk there was even an end piece on her chauffeur a vietnam vet thornton sat there staring at the screen then went to a cupboard found a bottle of southern comfort and poured a large one he went to the window savouring the drink and looked out at what had turned into an evening of rain and sleet one thing was certain he had found the mystery woman barry had got out of bed at the safe house in county down found a robe and made tea in the kitchen he was working his way through the previous days belfast telegraph when the phone went again just shut up and listen thornton said you killed major peter lang of the scots guards and sas his father was sir roger lang scots guards and his wife and this is the good bit was lady helen lang i think shes the woman whos spoken to you the one who said you butchered her son it all fits the timing the identity of the other four barry exploded the bitch shes dead meat what i did to her son is nothing to what she gets okay dont go through the roof what will you do where does she hang out london and norfolk thornton gave him the addresses barry said ill check out where shes going to be ive friends in london wholl handle that and my private flying system ill go over with some of the boys and take care of her thats good to know clear the decks thats what i like you can depend on it leave it to me thornton put the phone down and sat there thinking about it for some reason he still felt uneasy now why should that be the following morning the concorde lifted off at heathrow for washington and dillon accepted a glass of champagne and sat there thinking about it himself in a strange way he felt a connection with the mystery woman it was still an incredibly intriguing situation why all those deaths what was the reason they were no further forward really all the wiley girl had done was confirm the existence of the woman confirmed her ability to kill but why why why that was what really fascinated him and there was no answer it was the following morning round about the time dillon was reaching washington that thornton trawling on helen langs whereabouts was stunned to note that she was booked to land at westhampton airport at long island in her private gulfstream the following afternoon he sat there thinking about it the question was why and the obvious answer was chad luthers party he accessed the right side of the computer again looked for luthers guest list and there she was he thought about it then phoned barry again lady helen lang shes attending a big fat cat party tomorrow night on long island so dont look for her at home i can wait barry said dont worry shes history lady helen at the south audley street house went into the kitchen and put the kettle on as hedley took the bags upstairs he appeared as the kettle boiled and she made tea anything you want me to do not really well leave from gatwick in the morning land in long island in the afternoon and carry on to chad luthers place are we staying over id have thought i might need to leave in a hurry hedley refused to be drawn whatever you say lady helen and he turned and went out ferguson at his desk rang through to hannah bernstein and called her into his office how are you getting on with your fresh computer investigation im still looking sir the thing i cant understand is that we know a great deal about the sons of erin and what they got up to but we dont have any information on the specific act that would explain a personal vendetta on the part of this woman so you agree with johnson and parker about that oh yes sir you spend years on the street sir you investigate one rotten crime after another and you get a nose for it a coppers nose exactly sir unlike in an agatha christie novel when i visit the scene of the crime and take a look at who is involved in most cases i can pick out who it is almost straightaway ferguson smiled im with you on that chief inspector so what does it leave us what does that fine cambridgeeducated mind tell you that central to all this is jack barry but all the computer tells us is his background of offences no mention of his connection with the sons of erin or indeed any mention of the sons of erin and that doesnt make sense sir and your conclusion its not there because somebody didnt want it there the secret intelligence service im afraid so ferguson smiled you know you really are very good my dear its time special branch elevated you to detective superintendent i must speak to the commissioner at scotland yard im not too worried about elevation brigadier theres a black hole that needs filling what do we do what would you suggest i think you should see the deputy director of the security services sir and as our american colleagues would say i think you should kick ass oh dear simon carter wouldnt like that but i think youre absolutely right phone him and tell him to meet us at the grey fox in st jamess in exactly one hour us sir i wouldnt dream of depriving you of the pleasure of putting one of those manolo blahnik high heels in him chief inspector hannah smiled a pleasure sir the grey fox was one of several upperclass pubs in the vicinity of st jamess palace it was twothirty most of the lunch trade running out the place almost empty ferguson and hannah took a secluded booth gin and tonic chief inspector mineral water sir what a pity personally ill have a large one the barmaid brought their drinks and almost immediately simon carter came in his raincoat was wet and he shook his umbrella obviously not in the best of moods now what in the hell is this ferguson the chief inspector here actually threatened me the deputy director of the security services only when you said you were too busy to come sir hannah told him he took his coat off called for a whiskey and soda and sat down i mean threatening me with prime ministerial privilege not on ferguson my dear carter you dont like me and if i thought about you at all i probably wouldnt like you but were into serious business here so listen to the chief inspector he drank his gin and tonic waved for another and sat back she went through everything the tim pat ryan shooting the extermination of the sons of erin jack barry jean wileys statement it left carter stunned ive never heard such nonsense he said weakly ferguson shrugged good that clears the decks he turned to hannah what time was our appointment with the prime minister she lied cheerfully five oclock sir though he cant give you long hes due at the house this evening ferguson started to rise and carter said no just a moment ferguson subsided what for it was hannah bernstein the copper as always who said are you able to assist us in our inquiries sir oh dont give me all that police procedural nonsense he called for another scotch and turned to ferguson i havent said a word about this ill always deny it naturally and i want your chief inspectors word that this stays with the three of us if she cant guarantee that out she goes ferguson glanced at hannah who nodded my word on it brigadier good lets get to it ferguson said weve never got on my organization and yours ferguson too damned independent he shook his head prime ministers private army never liked that people should be accountable and you do what you damn well like and you dont sir hannah said gently carter sipped his scotch there are things we never told you ferguson because we didnt trust you just like there are things youve never told us ferguson nodded to hannah who said you know the facts sir im a police officer im trained to look for answers and what i see here is that one individual has taken care of all the victims here and there has to be a reason for it something very bad happened and i think you know what it was and i think you had it erased from the computer memory and expunged the records damn you carter told her barry ferguson said it has to be him behind all this tell us now carter took a deep breath all right when the peace process began we were told to be nice to our american cousins pass them any useful information about what was happening in ireland i know ferguson said then we began to realize that stuff wed passed to the white house was ending up in ira hands the culmination was a shocking atrocity which we found later was committed by jack barry and his gang an entire undercover group some of our best officers was taken out who were they a team of five headed by a major peter lang a former scots guard and s a s man there were three other men and a woman yes i recall the facts of peter langs death ferguson said his parents were great friends of mine he was in a car bomb of such proportions that no trace of his body was ever found not true we found out through an informer later that peter lang was tortured murdered and then put through a cement mixer used in building the local motorway my god hannah said we also heard via this informer of the sons of erin and jack barry and this connection thing and how did you handle it the peace process was at a delicate stage we didnt want to unbalance it so you didnt tell the prime minister if we had youd have known ferguson as well as blake johnson and the basement and the president and god knows who else we decided there was a better way to handle it let me speculate sir hannah said you went the road of disinformation mixed in with the usual not very important rubbish available in any of the better newspapers something like that carter said lamely well there you go ferguson stood up thanks for your help i havent given you any carter struggled with his raincoat and picked up his umbrella is that it then i think so carter went out hannah said what do you think sir ferguson said let me ask you a question chief inspector say you lost a beloved son in ulster blown away as if hed never existed so that the shock finished offyour husband and say you then found out the truth which was that your son had been tortured murdered and put through a cement mixer but how would you know that sir i havent the slightest idea this is all speculation but the drive the energy necessary to kill all those men would need a hugely positive reason and i think that of the five undercover agents what happened to peter lang was the most terrible but the vigilante would need to know sir exacdy but note one thing a threeyear delay that argues to me that by whatever means the real truth has only come out recendy hannah said what are you suggesting brigadier why its simple the woman who killed tim pat ryan who killed brady kelly cassidy and the lessthanillustrious senator cohan is my old and dear friend lady helen lang long island norfolk chapter thirteen in blakes office in the basement dillon drank tea and ate a cheese sandwich alice quarmby had provided youre looking good my irish friend blake told him oh the concorde is no handicap i like travelling like the rich sean you are rich we all know that you dont understand dillon said what i like about the concorde is that someone else is paying for it anyway what did you want me for harry parker is checking the security videos on the other side of the street from cohans house and the alley where the wiley killings took place we thought there was a chance the woman might be on them and if so you might be the one to recognize her i might recognize her from wapping but that doesnt mean id know who she is i know but what else do we have to go on alice quarmby looked in ive got harry parker on the line can you speak of course blake picked up the phone harry how goes it all bad blake i checked out the security videos there were only three cameras that viewed the area all of them have been recorded over no help there at all too bad blake said well thanks harry if you can think of anything else please let me know ill speak to you soon blake hung up dillon said another dead end im afraid so so ive had a free flight on the concorde for no good reason looks like it sorry sean at least we can entertain you while youre here a very important supporter of the presidents one chad luther is giving the mother of all parties on long island this evening you know fitzgeralds novel the great gatsby luther loves it he has a mansion like gatsby lawns down to the sea if youre anybody at all youre on the guest list let me guess dillon said and if youre nobody at all youre on the guest list if you have a ring through your nose and play the guitar indifferently youre on the guest list you are as usual uncomfortably close to the truth my friend and it gives the secret service a serious headache blake picked up a file of papers ive had to go through the guest list myself looking for what arabs in white sheets dont laugh the president is flying down in one of the gulfstreams theres a helicopter shuttle service for security people that includes you and me im honoured there was a knock at the door and alice looked in fresh coffee tea no were fine what about what we talked about before were still trawling she went out dillon said trawling johnson hesitated for a moment and then said oh hell im sure hannah knows all about it its a special computer program called synod thousands of conversations pass through millions of words insert a name for example and instead of going through it all painstakingly the computer tags it for you then you go back and listen to the relevant conversation jesus dillon said and it works remember patterson thats how we caught him so whats the name youre inserting jack barry youre after the connection thats it science and technology dillon said people like you and me are going to be obsolete the phone rang and blake picked it up brigadier how are you he frowned of course hes right here he held the phone out ferguson for you brigadier dillon said ive got some rather astonishing news for you listen well a few minutes later dillon put the phone down slowly blake said bad news hes just told me who he thinks the mystery woman is blake sat up tell me for christs sake which dillon did afterwards he shook his head ive met that woman a great lady but the facts are plain i mean this horror story from ulster did take place so it would appear dillon slammed a clenched fist on the desk damn jack barry damn him to hell lady helen lang blake frowned just a minute he picked up the guest list for luthers party and leafed through it i thought so here she is a guest at chad luthers party tonight so dillon said well we were going anyway blake frowned and tell the president blake was strangely reluctant what do i do if the brigadiers right shes killed several people and ive just remembered something dillon said that function cohan attended at the dorchester that night he took the big fall the forum for irish peace what about it helen lang was there i had a chat with her a wonderful woman blake i knew her son had died in ulster but not the manner of his going it would seem likely that she does it would explain a great deal dillon got up lit a cigarette and paced across the room there was always something about her from that first day at the funeral dont get me wrong i liked her from the first but i always felt uneasy blake nodded id better have a word with the president he picked up the phone and rang upstairs to the oval office blake johnson for the president he nodded i see he put the phone down hes already left for long island he thought for a moment weve got time ill tell him then id rather this be in person the door opened and alice appeared and she was excited synods come up trumps but my god you arent going to like it its thrown up conversations to jack barry as recently as the last few days youd better come down to the audio room they sat in the small enclosed room the huge spools of tape turning and listened to the final conversation between the connection and barry lady helen lang shes attending a big fat cat party tomorrow night on long island so dont look for her at home i can wait barry said dont worry shes history the computer whirred and switched off alice said who would have believed it dillon said you mean you know who it is oh yes blake said id know that voice anywhere he turned to dillon thats the presidents chief of staff thats henry thornton dillon took a moment to digest it then said its going to knock the president for six when he knows what that bastards been up to you can say that again blake turned to alice check his background see if you can find a reason he glanced at his watch ive got a few things to check myself then book dillon and me on the helicopter to long island in two hours ill get right on it she went out dillon said a hard one blake a hard one im an angry man my irish friend i despise treachery and ferguson blake thought about it and nodded i trust you sean and i trust ferguson but this is for his ears only not the prime ministers its up to the president to deal with that at his office at the ministry of defence ferguson listened his face grave its really in blakes hands and the presidents he said im glad youre there im horrified at the identity of the traitor of course id like to take the bastard outside and shoot him myself on the other hand ill be frank sean weve known each other for some time he paused lady helen lang is a dear friend you dont need to go on brigadier ill do what i can thank you sean the gulfstream landed at westhampton and lady helen and hedley were escorted through with a minimum of fuss she had changed on the plane and wore an evening outfit in black silk a closefitting dress and jacket hedley was in a grey uniform it was just after five cocktails at six she said is the limousine ready of course tell captain frank i want a slot out of here back to the uk no later than ten youre sure about that absolutely see to it now hedley went off leaving her in the private arrival lounge and she got the mobile out and phoned barry when he answered she said hello mr barry its me yes and i know who you are bitch i even know where you are on long island my goodness you are well informed its all catching up lady helen lang i know your london address your house in norfolk what i did to your son is nothing to what im going to do to you why mr barry youre quite worked up its not good for your heart she said and rang off chad luther had started life in charlesville texas the third of six children of a farmer who was a failure from the day he was born five of the children had died and the father had sunk into drink and apathy chad caught in the draft had spent two yean in vietnam and had discovered he was a survivor hed returned home to find his father dead and his mother dying and had inherited the four hundred and twentyeight acres of farmland bare and useless as they were until someone discovered oil next door the companies had descended and chad had held out for ten million it was the start of an empire the ten was now eight hundred in oil construction and leisure parks and luther was in the company of the great and the good including the president his house on quogue was his special pride a magnificent mansion there were lawns down to the sea an inlet with a pier for his yacht and various motor boats all life was there as the velvet darkness descended lights blazed from the windows music drifted out everyone who was anyone was there and as dillon had noted wryly even if you werent anyone you were there anyway luther resplendent in a blue velvet evening jacket and ruffled shirt greeted the president and henry thornton a real pleasure mr president glad to be here chad weve prepared an apartment on the ground floor luther led the way the president and thornton following clancy smith bringing up the rear the sitting room was pleasant with a log fire wood panelled walls french windows open to the sea the president moved out to the terrace the water was close very nice i look forward to seeing you later at dinner mr president a pleasure luther went out and jake cazalet said to his chief of staff the things i do for america the helicopter landed at westhampton where a limousine waited for blake and dillon at the same time helen lang was arriving at the mansion in a lincoln driven by hedley she got out straightened her skirt and stood there her purse in one hand will i do as always he was wearing a plastic disc which had been sent to them to identify him ill see you later she went up the steps to the open door and faced a pair of secret service men invitation madam she unsnapped her purse to get it out and felt her blood run cold as her fingers brushed the pistol god how stupid could she have been how had she expected to get the gun by the security people any moment now they were going to inspect her purse and then what was she going to do she froze her hand in her purse for what seemed an eternity but must have only been a couple of seconds when chad luther burst through the crowd dont be silly this woman doesnt need to show her invitation my darling girl he kissed her on the right cheek you look marvellous as usual ive put you on the top table with me and the president for dinner you always were a sweetie chad its easy with someone like you now come on come on theres someone id like you to meet the secret servicemen started to object but before they could say anything luther had swept her inside she smiled took a glass of champagne from a waiter and moved into the crowd dillon and blake arrived a little later walked through the crowd and discovered the president besieged theres no way youre going to get to him just yet dillon said theres time there was a table plan to the dining room by the door and dillon checked it out what a shame were not eating well thats life blake said ive got arrangements to make keep an eye on our principal players he went off dillon lit a cigarette and reached for a glass of champagne then he walked through the crowd and out into the garden it was cold and a little raw a few people walking about he stood at the balustrade and helen lang came up the steps she smiled why its you mr dillon we do have a habit of bumping into each other can i get you anything a cigarette would be nice he got his old silver case out and gave her one there you and what brings you here mr dillon he took a chance then oh maybe the same thing as you lady helen we have something in common i think a certain white house connection he gave her a light from his old zippo her expression didnt change she simply said how interesting its over he said urgently i dont know what you intend but its all over before he could continue she smiled the kind of smile that turned over the heart in him nonsense my friend nothing is over until i decide it is she smiled again my poor mr dillon you kill at the drop of a hat and yet youre such a good man and she turned and walked away chad luther managed to pull cazalet away from the crowd surrounding him the president needs a breather before dinner ladies and gentlemen please good for you chad cazalet said as they walked away clancy smith following luther took them back to the sitting room bathroom through there mr president and if you need a drink i think youll find everything you need in here he opened a panel in the wall and disclosed a superb mirrored bar chad as always youre the perfect host ill leave you now luther went out and clancy smith moved into the study and did a quick inspection he checked the bathroom then opened the french windows to the terrace he closed them again clancy youre like a hound dog you never stop sniffing cazalet said thats what im paid for mr president there are secret servicemen in the garden ill be right outside he went into the corridor and closed the door cazalet went to the bar and debated whether to indulge he took a bottle of scotch from a shelf then changed his mind and replaced it better not after all it was going to be a long night instead he took out a pack of marlboros and selected one damn it a man was entitled to one vice he lit the cigarette and went and opened the french windows there was a half moon and the rain had stopped that part of the house was very close to the water there was a lawn pine trees and a bay almost encircled by two prongs of land by the water was a boathouse and a wooden jetty a rather magnificent speedboat moored beside it he could see the odd couple walking about it was really very lovely he took a deep breath and a calm and pleasant voice said i wonder if you could oblige me with a light he turned and helen lang moved out of the shrubbery at the bottom of the steps she had walked through the garden strangely sad as if at the final end of things another of her breathless attacks had led her to sit down on a convenient bench shed taken two of her pills and stayed there for a while until she felt better it was cazalet she thought about it had to be now before the evening got too late for a moment she hesitated unexpectedly uncertain cazalet was a good man a hero from a rich and powerful family who could have avoided vietnam and yet had chosen to serve and been decorated a number of times who had become a solid progressive president untainted by the arrogance of power who had for many years supported a wife dying by inches from leukaemia a good man but peter had been a good man too and time was so very short she got up followed the path back to the house was aware of french windows opening looked up and saw cazalet on the terrace she hesitated then opened her purse her fingers brushing the colt as she produced her silver cigarette case i wonder if you could oblige me with a light why of course he came down the steps his lighter flared she held his wrist thats unusual an old lee enfield cartridge a souvenir from vietnam but how did you know its a lee enfield my husband was a colonel in the british army he had a similar one you wont remember me weve only touched hands once at a function in boston im lady helen lang he smiled warmly but of course my father and yours did business together back in boston in the old days you married an english baronet as i recall sir roger lang is he here with you oh no he died two years ago our only son was killed serving in northern ireland and my husband was old and frail the shock was too great for him im truly sorry yes i believe that for some reason he took her hand and she opened her mouth to speak and then there came a knocking at the study door excuse me he said and went up the steps on the terrace he hesitated and glanced back but she had faded away as if she had never been there dillon and blake were standing in a corner of the crowded ballroom when blakes mobile rang it was alice quarmby i checked thornton s background boss like you asked boy did i come up with a lulu listen to this she went on for several minutes as blakes face betrayed no expression finally he said thanks alice youre an angel anything important dillon asked you could say that thornton s our man all right and now i know why ill explain later right now wed better find the president he doesnt seem to be here theres luther over there hell know where he is blake said but when they got there they found luther in conversation with henry thornton the two men were laughing each holding a glass of champagne as dillon and blake approached hey you two youre not drinking luther told them duty calls chad blake said lightly this is a colleague of mine from london mr dillon the president asked to see him when he arrived hes taking a rest right now the chief of staff held out his hand mr dillon a real pleasure your reputation precedes you sir thats nice to know thornton put down his glass and said to luther i know where the sitting room is so ill take them down this way gentlemen he pushed through the crowd and led the way to the back corridor where clancy smith sat on a chair beside the door everything okay clancy applepie order mr thornton the chief of staff knocked opened the door and led the way in cazalet was still on the terrace as they crossed to the open french windows anything wrong mr president thornton asked no i was just talking to a very unusual woman but i seem to have lost her and then he smiled why mr dillon he clasped his hand warmly a pleasure to see you not this time mr president i think you really would rather kill the messenger than listen to what blake and i have to say that bad cazalet leaned against the balustrade then id better have a cigarette on it he took out a marlboro and dillon gave him a light from his zippo okay gentlemen lets hear the worst and below concealed in the shrubbery helen lang listened blake said you know all about the sons of erin mr president just as we do we always felt the killings to be the work of one person we also felt there had to be a strong reason cazalet nodded acts of revenge for some kind of terrible act yes well now we know just how terrible he turned to dillon sean for years information from british intelligence was passed on by our white house connection to the sons of erin and jack barry because of such information three years ago the members of a british army undercover unit were all killed by jack barry and his boys the commander was a major peter lang he was tortured murdered and disposed of in a cement mixer a truly appalling crime blake said let me get this straight cazalet said major peter lang thats right but ive just been talking to a lady helen lang out here she told me her son was killed in ireland yes sir dillon said shes his mother and shes the person responsible for the destruction of the sons of erin blake said the president looked stunned and thornton jumped in come on thats past belief one woman an old lady i cant believe it im afraid theres little doubt blake told him yes she did rather well when you think of it dillon said only jack barry and the connection are left now thornton said what happens now i mean if this story is true why isnt this woman under arrest the president said blake i said theres little doubt im also afraid theres no hard proof mr president for obvious reasons it would be better to handle this thing quietly and there is something else sir what would that be well inextricably involved with the whole mess is the question of the connection himself the traitor in the white house the chief of staff said yes but nobody knows who it is oh we do dillon said we knew your investigation wasnt getting anywhere mr thornton so blake mounted his own blake took a small tape recorder from his pocket i had the synod computer monitor telephone calls from the white house first then washington to anyone named jack barry the computer picks the name out then we can retrieve the call and it worked said cazalet we have recordings of a number of calls mr president but just one will do he put the tape recorder on the balustrade and switched it on the voice came through clearly lady helen lang shes attending a big fat cat party in long island so dont look for her at home i can wait barry said dont worry shes history blake switched off the recorder and cazalet turned in horror to his chief of staff my god henry thats your voice thornton seemed to sag and leaned back against the balustrade head down he stayed that way breathing deeply and yet when he looked up his eyes were glittering why henry why jake cazalet demanded let me answer that lets see if i can get it right blake said to thornton your mother had an illegitimate halfbrother born in dublin he was a volunteer with michael collins in the easter rising in nineteen sixteen executed by the brits shot down without mercy thornton replied hunted down like a dog seven bullets in him my mother never forgot and i never forgot and when you were a postgrad at harvard there was a girl named rosaleen fitzgerald from northern ireland killed in a firefight in belfast blake said you loved her murdered thornton told him by british soldiers the bastards dillon jumped in and years later there you were chief of staff at the white house and all that juicy information started to roll in from british intelligence and it was your chance for revenge he said up the rebels and ireland must be free how did you get mixed up with the sons of erin and jack barry blake asked oh that was cohan i was invited to a sinn fein fundraiser in new york just as a guest he was drunk rambled on about the diners club and how they all helped the glorious cause and barry he was in new york on business to do with arms for the ira brady the teamsters union guy knew him and introduced him to the group thats when they started calling themselves the sons of erin cohan boasted about it a reallife gunman and how did you connect with barry he was in new york during the early days of the peace process under his own name all legitimate staying at the mayfair his presence was mentioned in the new york times it was simple i offered him information nice and anonymous just a voice on the phone and then retribution struck thornton actually smiled isnt that the craziest thing you ever heard i mean a woman like her who would believe it cazalet turned to blake this is one hell of a mess what are we going to do at that moment thornton put a hand on the balustrade and vaulted over he landed on his hands and knees and was up and running unaware that helen lang stood in the shelter of the shrubbery nearby and had heard everything youve got nowhere to go henry cazalet shouted and followed blake and dillon down the steps clancy smith alarmed by the shouting flung open the study door and hurried through mr president stay close clancy cazalet called this way and he ran after dillon and blake clancy immediately called in a general alert to the rest of the secret servicemen on duty and went after them helen lang waited until they were well ahead then followed cautiously there were many guests in the garden those whod come out with a glass in their hand to sample the view in the evening and the sea beyond one of them was hedley concerned about lady helen hed taken off his chauffeurs cap and worked his way round to the garden at the rear of the house checked there by secret servicemen his identification badge had sufficed and of course there were the other guests in the garden it was simple chance that hed seen lady helen by the terrace had also seen the president outside the french windows and had watched her go up the steps to speak to cazalet he had no idea what was happening up there when thornton blake and dillon appeared and he saw lady helen fade into the bushes there was only the sound of the voices and then thornton jumped over the balustrade the president and the others went after him of lady helen there was no sign hedley followed in the direction she must have gone thornton weaved his way through the shrubbery dropped to one knee and paused he felt at his waist for the pistol hed stuck there earlier hed planned to use it on helen lang that evening but now it would have other uses there was a certain panic now the secret servicemen alerted by clancy trawled the garden alarming the guests already disturbed by the shouts they had heard helen was close on his heels she had followed him from that first moment when he had vaulted the balustrade and ducked into the shrubbery so that the others didnt know where hed gone what she didnt realize was that hedley was close behind her the sounds of pursuit faded and she saw thornton come out of the shrubbery in front of her and run crouching down to the water he reached the wooden jetty by the boathouse his running steps booming he stopped at the speedboat and started to cast off the moorings as helen arrived mr thornton she called thornton paused then turned a smith amp wesson in his hand the image the woman standing in the diffused light was enough its you you bitch yes mr thornton im afraid it is everything comes around i believe you know what happened to my son this is what you might call payback time well fuck you thornton arced and aimed his smith amp wesson helen lang reached in her bag to find the colt hedley close on her heels slid in the darkness over the stern rail of the speedboat moved in behind thornton and slipped on the wet deck thornton turned raised his weapon to fire and helen shot him in the back of the head thornton went down on his knees and then fell forward hedley stood up wait for me in the parking area i can handle this just go she turned and ran hedley had examined the description of chad luthers estate supplied by his corporations london office and knew that there was a reef at the entrance of the bay that was only negotiable at high tide now it was low he shoved thornton s body over on to the stern deck went into the wheelhouse and turned on the engine when it was going well he jumped to the jetty cast off and let the speedboat go when it hit the reef at the entrance of the bay the force was so great that the speedboat bounced into the air and fireballed there were cries of alarm from guests in the garden shouts as secret servicemen called to each other hedley stood in the bushes as the president arrived with blake and dillon oh my god cazalet called staring out at the fire hedley faded into the shrubbery and started back and a moment later was aware of a sudden cry a womans voice helens voice let me go i need to look in your purse maam it was clancy smith holding her by the right wrist in the diffused light of a garden lamp hedley moved in grabbed clancy by the arm and pulled him away you leave her be boy clancy said secret service presidential bodyguard im doing my job not with this lady youre not and clancy a gulf war veteran knew trouble when he saw it he pulled a beretta from his shoulder holster very fast indeed to hedley it was like grass blowing in the wind his left arm moved with incredible speed knocking the silenced beretta to one side it discharged with a muted cough clancy had never known such strength hedley twisted the arm you were special forces right hey fuck you you couldnt fuck your grandmother boy now me i had three tours in nam in the marines i made sergeant major the gulf war was a joyride now drop it clancy smith was a brave man but the strength was terrible the beretta fell and hedley turned him around felt for the handcuffs clancy carried forced up the wrists and cuffed him clancy fell on his face hedley said dont take it personally ive killed more people than you could ever imagine he turned to helen lets go maam they hurried away along the path clancy scrambled to his feet awkwardly a moment later two of his colleagues found him hedley handed her into the limousine got behind the wheel and drove away you okay she was catching her breath fine hedley back to the airport phone ahead tell them to be ready for instant departure to london he reached for the phone you saw the president yes a good man hedley and a lucky one he said nothing just made the call and replaced the phone so what was all the fuss back there who was that guy that was the connection making a very bad end he was one henry thornton chief of staff at the white house good god he shook his head thats unbelievable theres one more thing i should tell you they know hedley about me the president blake johnson dillon ferguson its all over he was horrified but what are you going to do well go back to compton place and review the situation she lit a cigarette drive on hedley drive on she pulled out the coded mobile phoned barry and found him still in bed its me again she said just keeping you up to date he sat up reached for a cigarette and managed to stay surprisingly calm good news or bad news all bad im afraid your connection turned out to be a man called thornton the white house chief of staff he enjoyed playing uptherebels because he had an uncle shot by the british after the easter rising plus a girlfriend killed in a firefight in belfast by british troops wrong place wrong time and how would you be knowing all this oh he was run to earth by sean dillon and blake johnson there was a confrontation at the party the president was attending i happened to be in the garden at the right moment i overheard everything and thornton i shot him in the back of the head afterwards he was blown to pieces in a rather large explosion does that sound familiar there was a long silence well now barry said i guess that just leaves you and me where would you be now still in long island im flying out almost at once to gatwick then home to norfolk compton place i know about that so i can look forward to a visit you can depend on it ill come flying in im so glad she put the mobile away and hedley said youre just asking for it lady helen and others could be coming looking for you like brigadier ferguson i couldnt care less hedley as long as barry finds me first just pass the flask he did so reluctantly she shook a couple of pills into her palm and washed them down with whiskey good now get me to the airport on the terrace with the president blake and dillon clancy told them what had happened okay blake said he was big and black and he said he served in vietnam thats it clancy said dillon turned to the president it has to be hedley jackson the final proof id say blake said to clancy you and the boys go looking theres more than five hundred people here clancy said just do it clancy went out cazalet said what happened to thornton a convenient accident wasnt it if you say so mr president dillon told him except that you dont believe in accidents never did mr president dillon smiled softly and certainly not with this lady chapter fourteen not long after helen lang had called barry dillon spoke to ferguson at cavendish square i always seem to be phoning you at ridiculous hours in the morning to give you bad news tell me which dillon did what a mess ferguson said the chief of staff whod have believed it doesnt matter now dillon said callously cooked to a turn and im not sorry he was responsible for many deaths and in the case of peter lang an atrocity of the first order heinrich himmler would have been proud of him where is helen lang now blakes checking ill keep you posted she certainly isnt here ferguson put the phone down thought about it then called hannah bernstein she answered astonishingly brightly but then that was fourteen years of police work bernstein its me ferguson said and what a tale i have to tell long island has turned out to be the modern equivalent of a greek tragedy sony chief inspector but im going to have to ask you to make an early start of course sir there is one thing the commissioner phoned me late last night from scotland yard trouble sir only for some you are now a detective superintendent special branch oh dear hannah said the boys wont like that in the canteen let me be brutal ferguson told her forget your cambridge ma in psychology to my knowledge youve killed four times in the line of duty something im not proud of sir if i may stir your hasidic conscience superintendent sword of the lord and gideon those people were all worth killing you took a bullet yourself and im damn proud to have had you work for me anyway kim can get scrambled eggs going and well wait together to hear further bad news from dillon ill fill you in when you get here blake came into the study where dillon was talking to the president by the fire cazalet turned any news on lady helen lang mr president yes she flew over here from gatwick in one of her firms gulfstreams and landed at westhampton and by the time id chased all this up shed taken off again just before ten destination gatwick blake hesitated what do you want done mr president about lady helen cazalet frowned the tough experienced politician in charge if this comes out the whole peace process can come toppling over lets be practical about this mess thornton s death can be dismissed as an unfortunate accident a man tried to attack me thornton chased him and they both died brady kelly and cassidy already have explanations for their deaths tim pat ryan in london a gangster dillon said and every other gangster in london wanted his crown exactly as for cohan cazalet shrugged im not going to shed tears over that bastard so hed had too much to drink and fell from the terrace of his suite blake said you mean it never happened mr president blake it stinks not only for the white house but for downing street were all for peace and yet a thing like this sinks the ship blake said and theres always jack barry dillon lit a cigarette the last man standing now if he went down it would be as if the whole thing really had never happened blake put in there was a pause before cazalet said that still leaves lady helen she killed six men that we know of i see dillon said you mean she must pay for sending out of this vale of tears a bunch of absolute bastards directly responsible for many deaths and the appalling circumstances of her sons death she broke the law and about as badly as it could be broken cazalet pointed out ive killed many more in my time and sometimes for worse reasons dillon told him come to think of it you earned a few medals in nam mr president and blake too what was the body count damn you dillon cazalet said right but it still leaves us with the problem what do we do about her shes out of your jurisdiction now blake reminded him but shes still partly my responsibility cazalet hesitated okay get me brigadier ferguson a moment later ferguson was taking his call mr president dillon tells me you know the worst the thing you dont know is that lady helen lang has left long island in a gulfstream for gatwick this is a mess brigadier let me tell you of my conversation just now with dillon and blake johnson so it never happened mr president ferguson said his voice clear over the speaker all right i think i can work with that over here but what about lady helen im hoping you can think of something for that you can speak to the prime minister if you want ill talk to him later but what we need is a solution from you tell you what ill send dillon and blake posthaste to london ive got a plane here they can use leave it with me ferguson told him god knows what but ill come up with something cazalet turned to blake and dillon you heard in view of what weve said i think we can keep the lid on what happened here ill stay in touch blake told him minute by minute preferably the president smiled on your way gentlemen the gulfstream rose to fifty thousand feet and turned out over the atlantic lady helen lang an old foreign office hand phoned the ministry of defence and asked for brigadier charles ferguson most immediate she also remembered a code number from her husbands day it all worked surprisingly well and she was patched through to ferguson at cavendish square who is it hannah bernstein asked lady helen lang helen smiled ah i know you that very nice lady policeman hannah pressed the audio button and waved frantically to ferguson are you there charles ferguson said this is not good my love charles insufferable as you are ive always liked you but for once just listen theyve all paid the price the chief of staff was a bonus i didnt know he was the connection he tried to shoot me and i shot him not that it matters he was blown to pieces in the end in a rather large explosion your mr dillon was very kind told me it was all over tried to help such a nice man in between killing people my dear charles thats what youve been doing for years helen tell me one thing how did you know oh that was poor tony emsworth riddled with guilt and dying of cancer he had an illegal copy of the file from the sis that told the whole story gave it to me just before he died everyone was in it you mr dillon that nice police lady barry the sons of erin i see ferguson said so what now back to compton place ive guests to receive mr jack barry and friends he couldnt resist the invitation ive spoken to him again hes promised to come flying in to see me i shouldnt think that means by scheduled airline ferguson was stunned you cant do this helen oh yes i can hes the last one the one who really did butcher my son if you want to join us charles youre very welcome but if its the last thing i do on earth i want to face him ferguson felt a chill why do you say that my heart charles its not good amazing how whiskey and pills keep you going anyway if i cant get him im sure your mr dillon will for gods sake helen for my own sake charles she switched off and hannah said what do you think sir well what do you think i should do there isnt one fact including the shooting of tim pat ryan which would allow us to arrest her even on suspicion so ill be at gatwick to greet her well see then at doonreigh docherty was having breakfast when his phone rang barry said ive got a big payday i want to fly to the north norfolk coast a village called compton a house called compton place an inandout how many four maybe five this afternoon docherty hesitated i dont know theres military traffic in north norfolk listen you shite theres ten thousand pounds cash in a supermarket bag for you in this make up your mind just give me time jack docherty said let me check the charts ill be back how long an hour barry slammed the phone down and instead of reaching for a drink poured a cup of tea he lit a cigarette and stood at the window staring out at the rain but he wasnt angry he was actually excited what a woman the presidents plane lifted off at westhampton as always dillon was surprised at the luxury the enormous club chairs the maplewood tables the flight attendant was air force a sergeant paul he brought coffee for blake a bushmills for dillon and then the portable phone for you mr dillon a brigadier ferguson early breakfast brigadier shut up and listen ferguson told him ive had her on the phone and she found out about the whole thing from tony emsworth before he died he had an illegal file had all of us in it including you the whole rotten details of her sons death kept under wraps by the secret intelligence service told me she shot thornton before the explosion shes told barry shes going to compton place shes pulling him in dillon nodded yes she would do that hes the last you see thornton was a bonus is she serious shes told me shes got a bad heart ferguson said pills and whiskey keeping her going she said shes hanging in there dillon a marvellous woman like her taking on that swine hey take it easy you know what she said if i cant get him im sure your mr dillon will really dillon said ice cold god knows what ill do at gatwick i can tell you now dillon said nothing because she wont be there put the chief inspector on all right superintendent now dillon said to hannah you finally made it if i said good for you youd say i was being patronizing get on with it dillon i checked with the weather people at westhampton before we left weather for the uk was poor big front fog gatwick not too good thats why i just told the boss she wont be there but then i dont think she intended to i think shell land elsewhere right ill check on that you do well speak later docherty on the phone to barry said okay i can do it the chieftain again just like the guy we used last time ive a connection in north norfolk called clarke ran a flying school at a place called shankley down an old world war two feeder station the flying school went kaput hes been doing illegal flights to holland in a cessna i dont give a stuff if he flies to mars is it on yes ive spoken to him shankley down is an hour at the most to compton place good youre on ill be there in two hours barry slammed the phone down picked it up again and dialled a number a voice said quinn here barry ive got a hot one on private flight into norfolk and out again for gods sake jack norfolk what are you doing lying there like a gorilla in your own shite because the great days are gone a twohour flight to a very deserted airfield and two hours back and in between we do what we do best quinn was excited now how many you me dolan mullen mcgee are you with me by christ i am meet me at dochertys place in doonreigh in two hours if the boys cant make it well do it together armalites and handguns well be therejack all of us i swear up with the sons oferin he rang off and barry said morosely right up and this time he did pour a whiskey instead of a cup of tea on the gulfstream helen lang listened to the second pilots account of weather conditions in the uk so not good she said oh we can scrape into gatwick lady helen rather a lot of fog creeping across the country but we can make it what about east midlands airport is it clearer there he nodded it would certainly be better than gatwick it had been her intended destination all along but she smiled then lets land there im going to norfolk anyway it would be quite convenient whatever you say radio ahead and order a limousine we wont need a driver hedley can take care of things the pilot departed hedley said you had it all worked out of course she took out a cigarette light please he gave her one she sat back ive only one regret im not giving you a choice havent had a choice since the day i met you he smiled let me get you a cup of tea at doonreigh barry arrived to find quinn and the others already there they were crowded into dochertys office checking armalites and handguns and docherty looked distinctly unhappy there was a stir of excitement as barry appeared much backslapping and laughter whats it about jack quinn demanded barry as always knew exactly how to handle the situation what he was faced with was a group of men who would not have disgraced the mafia but as with so many terrorists in ireland on both sides of the coin they needed to believe they were gallant freedom fighters comrades weve fought shouldertoshoulder for an ideal of irish freedom and many of us have fallen by the wayside and often its been due to treachery and dishonesty you never knew this but i had a branch of the sons of erin in new york a member in london four of them shot dead they were silent now the person responsible was a woman its that woman were visiting in norfolk retribution thats what its about we take care of her and fly straight back anyone wants out say so it was quinn who spoke were with you jack you know that barry slapped him on the shoulder good man yourself now lets get to it and he led the way out the front advanced across england like a plague fog drifting everywhere at gatwick ferguson and hannah waited in a special security lounge ferguson looked out of the window its gone rather silent hannah said ill check she went out returned a few minutes later and made a face all traffic cancelled at the moment sir damnation is anywhere open oh yes manchester and east midlands check them out see if shes diverted hannah left and a moment later the phone rang the switchboard operator said call for you brigadier helen lang sounded good dear charles sorry i missed you filthy weather i just landed at east midlands lucky to get in on our way to norfolk scattered fog but not too bad hedley is such a good driver this is madness helen look dillon and blake johnson are hard after you leave it to us helen god bless you charles she rang off hedley said what happens now that depends on mr barry he wont get anywhere near norfolk not in weather like this i wouldnt depend on that hedley hes a man of infinite resources and guilt she shook out a couple of pills the flask please he passed it across youll kill yourself as long as i kill barry first ill be happy it was late afternoon as the chieftain crossed the english coast over morecambe it was raining hard fog swirling but docherty kept below the overcast barry sat beside him are we going to make it it isnt good but i think so we can always turn back you do and youre a dead man when we land barrys smile was terrible you see this meeting im going to is the most important in my life docherty was terrified jesus jack itll be fine just give me a chance and he concentrated on the flying sergeant paul came in with the portable phone brigadier ferguson mr dillon dillon said here i am bad weather fog shes landed at east midlands on her way to norfolk by road so listen she told me barry said hed be flying in now that would mean by some highly illegal means presumably direct to norfolk you mean you think she could be on her own at compton place when he arrived something like that you could always ring the chief constable of norfolk and dont be stupid dillon for once forget that irish propensity for gallows humour and be serious well she needs backup dillon said shes got good old hedley with a great record in nam but that was years ago if barry arrives he wont come alone ive known him long enough to know that dillon north norfolk is one of the last truly rural parts of england it would take us hours to get there by road and shes determined to do this thing i mean what can we do first of all you check whether we can land at farley field then you call in flight lieutenants lacey and parry and tell them were going to war what in the hell do you mean i know something of the north norfolk coast its got broad beaches especially when the tides out they can take me in and drop me by parachute weve done it before leave it to lacey to work out for gods sake dillon hes got nothing to do with it ill have blake order our pilot to divert to farley ill call you back blake said farley come on blake you remember farley the raf proving ground outside london the department has a regular lear jet operating out of there piloted by flight lieutenants lacey and parry weve had some interesting moments together now we have another problem and that would be lady helen lang wants the last man standing in this whole rotten mess jack barry so shes drawn him out he cant resist so hes told her he would fly in she could be in a bad situation at compton place its miles from anywhere in the depths of the english countryside so we land at farley they have an armourer there full facilities just listen and learn he phoned ferguson again tell lacey to find me a suitable beach near compton place as i said ill drop in by parachute at least shell have backup just have the necessary equipment and weaponry ready blake reached over excuse me make that for two dillon laughed and said to ferguson hey ive got this crazy middleaged american whos decided to come along for the drop hes a kind of war reporter for the president youre mad the both of you ferguson said of course we are so get on with it and dillon rang off the chieftain landed on the old decaying bomber runway at shankley down and rolled to a halt by the decrepit hangars and the nissen hut with the chimney smoking there was a cessna parked on the apron an old ford transit beside it a man standing there in a flying jacket they all got out docherty said hey clarke you look good wheres my money clarke said docherty produced a fat envelope two grand in cash clarke fingered it and barry punched him in the shoulder okay clarke looked at the irishman and his friends and discretion as always was the better part sure fine anything you want keys in the transit barry patted his face good boy well be back he nodded to his men they got in the transit quinn at the wheel and drove away the gulfstream landed at farley rolled to a halt and dillon and blake got out ferguson and hannah were standing there lacey and parry behind them everything organized dillon asked lets go in and discuss it ferguson told him inside they had a room to themselves there was a trestle table with parachutes two ak assault rifles and two brownings with silencers dillon said i see you remember my preference he turned to lacey whats the score let me show you on the chart sir lacey led the way to the table ordnance survey map large scale compton place so close to the sea it makes no difference here is horseshoe bay very wide when the tides out and its turning tonight we could wait until its really out but no way if we leave now how long forty minutes i should say were coming with you ferguson said we can drop you then theres an raf feeder station at bramley twenty minutes flying time away well come on by road terribly good of you dillon looked at the chart again and turned to blake thats it then horseshoe bay he and blake put themselves in the hands of the armourer an ageing sergeant major who went over the equipment with professional competence they took only one parachute no reserve an ak each a browning plus magazines dillon said look blake vietnam was a long time ago stuff you dillon okay blake told him hey im with you they dressed in jump suits shoulder holsters for the brownings and checked the aks ferguson and hannah came in lacey says still sporadic fog but worse for you at horseshoe bay not too bad at bramley for our landing well good for you brigadier dillon grinned at blake lets do it why not blake said picked up his parachute and walked out norfolk ulster chapter fifteen in the transit the mood was euphoric barry sitting behind quinn at the wheel brought them up to date the woman were visiting is called lady helen lang originally american but dont be fooled by appearances shes killed several times theres one wild card she has a very big black chauffeur called hedley just another nigger dolan said and patted his armalite ill take care of him youve already made a mistake that could cost you your life barry told him as you all know im an old vietnam hand and so is hedley jackson marines special forces medals this man could be bad news so hes a bad nigger dolan sniggered your funeral old son barry produced a largescale ordnance survey map and passed it back to them in the rear of the transit youll find compton place there right on the edge of the sea theres a village called compton but its five miles away one of those nono places you find in the countryside with a dying population of about fifty no problem mullen a large evillooking specimen with a shaved head said this is a walkover jack why bring us all along you could do it yourself because shes invited me i killed her son three years ago a brit officer working undercover thats why she stiffed tim pat ryan in london and my friends in new york now she wants me its a bit like one of those old westerns on television where the hero says meet me on the street at dawn she must be puddled mullen said five dead men all killed with the same gun that says she knows her business she even stiffed two lowlifes on park avenue one night who were trying to rape some girl well blow her away quinn said her and the black i sure as hell hope we do barry said i dont want her on my case for the rest of my life and thats where shell be if she isnt wasted there was a kind of regret in his voice as he said that a regret he couldnt explain even to himself and quinn said an easy one jack well be on our way back before you know it lets hope so barry said study that map just make sure you know where were going it was late afternoon with fog and rain falling and the mercedes passed through compton followed the winding roads through that ancient countryside hedley pulled into the courtyard and switched off lady helen was already out of the car and unlocking the kitchen door hedley carried the bags in now what im going to change then well get ready ready for what lady helen jack barry she raised a hand oh hell come hedley he wont be able to resist on the other hand charles ferguson mr dillon blake johnson could arrive first and i hope they do she looked out at the fog dont be silly hedley if they have to drive from gatwick in this pea souper it will take hours ill see you in fifteen minutes in her bedroom she undressed took a onepiece jump suit from the wardrobe and put it on she found some elasticsided ankle boots then opened her purse and took out the co she unloaded it screwed the silencer on the end then inserted the magazine again she opened a drawer took out four magazines and put two in each pocket she was breathing heavily now found her pill bottle shook two into her hand hesitated then shook out two more she went into the bathroom filled a glass with water and swallowed them down what the hell she murmured what does an overdose matter at this stage its all the same in the end she went downstairs and found hedley in the kitchen making tea he was wearing a track suit he handed her a cup ready for war hedley its been a long time i suppose some things you dont forget she smiled youve been a good friend its easy where youre concerned he swallowed his tea hell i even drink this stuff instead of coffee to please you he put the cup down still if youre intent on seeing this thing through i suggest we adjourn to the barn there she didnt use the colt although she had it in a small holster at her waist hedley gave her a mm browning pistol with a silencer on the muzzle and slammed in a twentyround magazine which protruded from the butt i really feel im going to war with this she said believe me you are legs apart both hands she worked her way across the target figures shredding them oh my word now what hedley he said its simple we wait to see who gets here first the transit pulled in by a pine wood overlooking the estate at compton place the fog swirled touched by the wind giving occasional glimpses of the countryside below and there was the house and grounds and the sea beyond and then the fog descended again leave the transit here barry told them keys under the mat well go on foot were with you jack quinn said thats good to know you can take point as we used to say in vietnam it started to rain as they went down the hill and approached the outbuildings hedley on top of steps leading to the upper floor of the barn had an ak with a silencer and a night sight he focused on quinn and pressed the trigger by chance quinn turned at the precise moment to speak to barry and the bullet missed his heart and hit the stock of his armalite he staggered back christ jesus down barry called and they all obeyed him he crawled to quinn you okay i think so i recognized the sound a silenced ak i heard enough of those in vietnam he spoke to the others in low tones shes there and shes waiting take care now fan out and move forward the lear jet went down and down passed through fog at one thousand feet then broke clear horseshoe bay below surf creaming in a touch of early evening grey flight lieutenant lacey said over the intercom its not good halftide at the moment better to abort dillon and blake in parachutes jump suits shoulder holsters aks suspended across their chests glanced at ferguson and bernstein the brigadier said your call gentlemen what the hell dillon reached for the lever and dropped the airstair door who wants to live for ever he grinned at blake hell youre an older guy you can go first youre so kind blake said and as lacey made a pass at eight hundred dived out headfirst and dillon went after him the sky was turbulent fog swirling to the horizon the evening light fading dillon aware of blake in front of him went down the airstair door and allowed himself to fall turning over in the lears slipstream he pulled the ring of his rip cord looked up and saw the plane climb steeply below him blake landed on the sand just in front of the surf dillon further behind plunged into six feet of very salty water surfaced and ploughed forward with difficulty because of the parachute trailing behind he punched the quick release clip let the harness slip away and waded to the beach blake came to meet him you okay dillon nodded lets do it they went up the beach paused in the pine trees then started towards the house they stood together looking down and there was a sudden explosion and smoke drifted up id say that was a smoke grenade dillon said lets go and they charged down the hill barry stayed back some instinct telling him to quinn led the others down towards the barn and hedley focused on mullen and shot him through the head then he tossed a smoke grenade the others flung themselves down and sprayed the first floor of the barn with fire hedley lay there at the top of the steps head down a round creasing his right shoulder lady helen crouched behind him are you all right slightly damaged dont worry barry said get on with it quinn quinn stood up lets get to it he urged and they all stood and followed him lady helen behind hedley raised the browning and fired it repeatedly blowing quinn away they retreated she reached down for hedley come on inside dolan and mcgee crawled back barry said right lads into the barn theyve nowhere to go christ jack its a bad scene dolan said walk in the door and get your head blown off barry took out a beretta well you fucking well get in or ill blow your head off myself go on up those steps dolan terrified started up and blake arriving in the courtyard at the same moment sprayed him with his ak sending him headfirst to the cobbles below blake crouched and barry moved closer to mcgee dont worry well manage dillon appeared on the other side of the courtyard and fired his ak you there jack barry called so its you sean you always arrive too late blake fired in the general direction of barrys voice and there was return fire he felt a redhot poker in his left arm and fell back dillon fired in reply three rounds catching mcgee in the face there was silence now only the rain and the fog barry crawled forward eased open the bottom door and passed inside he saw her up there on the barn platform pulling hedley back to safety hay drifting down im here he called she turned dropping hedley barry had his gun hand raised as she pulled out the colt without hesitation his beretta jammed he worked the slider desperately and she took deliberate aim and then something strange happened she seemed to struggle for breath staggered back and fell to her knees barry ejected one magazine rammed another in and took aim and dillon burst in through the barn door no dillon cried and fired and his bullet creased barrys face sending him lurching back with a cry barry recovered and fired back repeatedly sending dillon down then vanished through the back door there was silence dillon stood and went up the stairs hedley lay there blood on his shoulder lady helen beside him face grey dillon kneeled beside her what is it my heart mr dillon ive been on borrowed time for a while did we get them dillon hesitated the truth now from the looks of it his gang but not barry what a shame she closed her eyes a moment later an raf land rover drove into the courtyard with charles ferguson and hannah bernstein dillon worked his way from one body to another quinn shot several times was only just alive dillon said jesus quinn i havent seen you in years dillon all down your mates finished and jack oh the devil always looks after his own hes away out of it as usual bastard where would he be going quinn managed a ghastly smile itll cost you a cigarette dillon got his silver case out the cigarettes inside were still dry in spite of his ducking he gave quinn one and a light from his zippo quinn said we flew from doonreigh in a chieftain with docherty remember him from the old days surely landed on an old airstrip not far from here shankley down run by a man called clarke docherty was to wait his voice was tired a bastard jack he always thought of number one flying back to ulster and to hell with the rest of us he was wandering now back to spanish head always his bolthole he was going fast dillon said hang on quinn i could still get him remember that special thing about me i can fly anything with wings this shankley down was there another plane there quinn nodded small plane but two engines the kind where you walk over the wing to get in cessna dillon said get him dillon fuck the bastard the cigarette fell from quinns fingers and his head lolled to one side dillon went to ferguson who was speaking into his mobile he switched off ive sent for a disposal unit i shouldnt think theyll make it in this weather in less than four hours what about him he nodded to quinn and dillon said dead all four dead anyone i should know oh youll be delighted four to cross off your mostwanted list hannah bernstein had got the medical kit from the raf land rover she had wrapped a field service bandage round blakes arm hedley was holding another to his shoulder as he crouched beside lady helen dillon dropped to one knee and she smiled so he got away mr dillon what a pity dillon took her hand never so cold never so calm he only thinks he has ill get him for you my love i swear it he stood up and helped her to her feet take her inside he said to ferguson they stood there hedley and blake ferguson and lady helen hannah with an arm around her blake was obviously in considerable pain and hedley didnt look good terrible mess all this charles lady helen said it wont look good in the papers it wont be in the papers ferguson said my disposal unit will take this trash back to london where they will be processed in a certain crematorium theyll be several pounds of grey ash each by the morning and they can dump it in the thames as far as im concerned and you have the power to do that charles he took her from hannah and put an arm around her i can do anything dillon said ill leave you to it ill be away ill take the land rover ferguson said what is this quinn told me they flew into a place called shankley down in a chieftain piloted by an old acquaintance of mine called docherty i should imagine jacks taking off about now if he hasnt already but what can you do the place is run by a man called clarke and theres a cessna there im going to chase jack barry to the hob of hell oh the is a bit slower than a chieftain but i think i can take care of that you see i know his ultimate destination and it was blake who saw it spanish head got it in one but it would be crazy for him to go there he is crazy but where can you land sean i know the place well from the old days great beaches off the head with the tide out in weather like this ferguson said youre mad i always was brigadier hannah bernstein said in the circumstances id better go with him sir like hell you will dillon told her let me tell you something dillon to leave here in the land rover you need the keys and i have them secondly you have no authority to proceed without a police presence which as a detective superintendent of special branch i will provide northern ireland being part of the united kingdom jesus but youre a hard woman id have thought youd have realized that before now ferguson said all i can say is stay in touch when barry arrived at shankley down docherty and clarke were standing inside one of the two hangars smoking the transit braked to a halt and barry got out face bleeding where dillons bullet had creased him right lets be moving he said what about the others docherty asked they wont be coming barry said all dead clarke said just a minute what are we into here barry took out his beretta and shot him between the eyes then he leaned over him searched in his bomber jacket and found the envelope with the two thousand pounds when he looked up dochertys face was haggard jack it went wrong load of shite now lets get moving and he pushed docherty towards the chieftain a moment later they roared down the runway and took off into the fading light it was forty minutes later that dillon and hannah arrived in the land rover dillon driving they pulled up beside clarkes body and got out he certainly passed this way dillon told her call ferguson on your mobile and tell him youve got another candidate for his disposal unit he went into the second hangar mounted the wing of the cessna climbed over to the lefthand seat and checked the instruments she joined him a few moments later and followed him in everything okay the tanks are full if thats what you mean look hes on his way and the chieftain is a lot faster than we are dochertys place at doonreigh is about forty miles from spanish head and quinn thought thats where the bastard will go ill catch up with him by making that beach landing below the cliffs i spoke about is the tide out or in well check on the way he switched on if youre not happy leave me to it go to hell dillon she closed the cabin door and buckled her seat belt and reached for the spare headphones just turn that dial to five he said thats uk weather then trawl through it for ulster he put his own headphones on started first the port engine then starboard and taxied out into the rain moving to the end of the runway she spoke to him over the mike how long an hour and a half with a tailwind two if its the other way why according to the weather report the tide is turning on that coast in just over an hour from now fog clearing half moon sounds interesting he smiled at her boosted power and roared down the runway the chieftain turned in to land at doonreigh darkness falling and taxied up to the hangars and nissen hut barry had been into docheitys bar box and had demolished half a bottle of paddy whiskey on the way sitting on his own in the cabin he hadnt taped his face with anything from the medical box had simply swabbed it with raw whiskey when the chieftain rolled to a halt he unlocked the airstair door and went down the steps the fog had cleared but it was raining hard back on the old sod he said docherty getting out behind him said ten thousand pounds cash in a supermarket bag you promised jack and me forgetting isnt that the terrible thing barry pulled out his beretta and shot him twice in the heart a few moments later he was driving away as darkness descended the sky cleared and there was the light of the moon as dillon flew over the irish sea hannah said will we make it sean ah keep the faith girl there was strange intimacy between them he was low now no more than fifteen hundred and there was the coast the cliffs of northern ireland black in the moonlight and dillon checked the chart book on his knee and turned slightly to port thats it dead ahead now he descended to six hundred only one problem the tides coming in fast down there he crossed the cliffs the castle below is that it she asked spanish head as ever was he turned out to sea again banked and dropped his undercarriage here we go try praying it might help whitecaps were pounding into the surf and there wasnt much beach left there dillon levelled no more than fifty feet above the water then dropped her in the wheels bit into wet sand no more than two feet below the water the cessna careered forward then nosed up to the strip of beach left it was very quiet when he switched off and removed the headphones from that position the sea looked relatively calm in the moonlight dillon smiled nice view dont do that to me again hannah bernstein said not ever can we get out its a thought any minute now and youll get your feet wet so lets go they crossed the beach and found a path that climbed up between two cliffs when they reached the top the castle was quite close what now hannah asked id have thought that was obvious dillon said well make for the lodge and he led the way old john harker was in the kitchen at the lodge waiting for the kettle to boil when there was a sudden draught on his cheek he turned and found the door open and dillon there hannah at his shoulder remember me dillon said my god harker said has his lordship turned up ten minutes ago how did you know i know everything now this is how it is get your lantern and take us up through the garden ill decide what to do when we reach the castle whatever you say harker hesitated is this the end of him if i have anything to do with it thank god for that harker took an electric lantern from a peg that secret passage from the panel in the library it comes out in the front hall lets get to it then barry in the study off the main entrance hall helped himself to a large whiskey then went upstairs to the library he stood drinking the whiskey and glanced up at the portraits of his ancestors all francis but not himself he looked at the one in confederate uniform he seemed to be smiling in a kind of amusement bastard barry said arrogant bastard but a good soldier he toasted the portrait and behind him the door opened and dillon and hannah entered dillon was unarmed but she carried a walther in her left hand sean is the devil on your side only some of the time barry smiled god knows how you got here just like you only i landed on the beach and how did you leave things at compton place all dead your lot blake and hedley jackson a little damaged thats all and lady helen dillon shrugged and barry said with a strange kind of urgency shes all right isnt she her heart isnt good she had an attack christ jesus barry said she had me dead to rights my gun jammed and she sort of fell down hannah bernstein said i am detective superintendent hannah bernstein of special branch of scotland yard and i must warn you that barry flung his glass at her ducked as she fired and was through the panel and away lets go dillon said and ran across to the door and she followed they reached the entrance hall and the front door stood open harker on the porch the lantern in his hand he ran past me took the path down through the trees towards the cliffs dillon went off on the run hannah following and harker went after them barry ran head down through the trees the beretta in his left hand not really knowing where he was going any more the sky was overcast there was a rumble of thunder on the horizon and lightning flickered helen lang he couldnt get her out of his head and why was that he came to the track leading down to the soak hole dillon followed hannah behind him and old harker with the lantern the sheet lightning flickered the water raged below on the beach the cessna engulfed barry stumbled on and then he was at the soak hole white spray exploding in a hollow roar he paused at the steps down turned and levelled the beretta as dillon arrived on the run dillon swept barrys arm to one side and met him breasttobreast a long time coming you dog dillon cried grabbed his right wrist and twisted it up like a steel bar barry screamed as the bone cracked and dillon ran him headfirst down the steps and let go there was a last desperate cry then the soak hole fountained again old harker held the lantern high god help us but what kind of a man are ye i sometimes wonder myself dillon turned to hannah access ferguson on your mobile tell him to arrange for lacey and parry to pick us up in the lear jet of course she put a hand on his arm are you all right dillon never better the soak hole fountained again he was a bad bastard jack and the seas taken him so theres an end to it and he turned and followed harker up the track the following afternoon he sat with hannah and ferguson outside a private room at the london clinic hedley came out smart in his chauffeurs uniform and wearing a sling how is she ferguson asked not good shes asked for mr dillon dillon got up paused then went into the room she was propped up in bed there was a drip into her left arm various other wires attached to electronic equipment a nurse was sitting close by dillon moved to the bed lady helen she opened her eyes you got him i hear so charles told me thats right so the end of the sons of erin all of them even the connection and you know what she closed her eyes and opened them again it hasnt brought peter back he took her hand i know she smiled again mr dillon you think youre such a bad man and you know what i think youre one of the most moral men ive ever known hang on to that thought her eyes closed her hand slipped away and one of the machines made a strange noise the nurse took over and dillon walked out ferguson and hannah stood up the brigadier said shes gone but not forgotten dillon said never forgotten he put a hand on hedleys shoulder lets take a walk in the garden i could do with a cigarette epilogue they drove up from london to compton place a week later ferguson hannah and dillon in the daimler the weather was terrible heavy driving rain what did the prime minister have to say at the end of the day dillon asked extremely sorry about lady helen of course arent we all but content with the outcome i mean it could have been bloody awful instead of which it didnt happen sir is that what were saying hannah bernstein in black coat and trouser suit sounded cold forbidding now look superintendent sometimes we have to think of the good of the cause thats what the ira say dillon told him drummed into me from the age of nineteen he put the window down and lit a cigarette sorry my love he said to hannah she put a hand on his knee feel free sean he said so the prime minister and the president heave a heavy sigh of relief and thank god for the foot soldiers you appointed me public executioner again only this time hannah and blake had to play their part its the name of the game dillon ferguson said dillon turned to hannah do you ever wonder what its all about because i do they were entering the village now the parking lot of st mary and all the saints was almost full and there were cars parked along the village street my goodness but they are giving her a sendoff ferguson said well they would ive learned enough about her to know she was greatly loved dillon checked his watch forty minutes to the service i dont know about you but i need a drink pull in at the pub if you dont want to join me ill see you at the church no i think a drink might be appropriate ferguson glanced at hannah if you agree superintendent of course sir the daimler dropped them at the pub entrance and drove away they moved inside and found it already full not only with villagers in their best suits and dresses but many visitors hetty armsby in a black suit served the bar helped by two village girls old armsby sat on the end stool also in black suit neck scrawny in a stiff collar good lord ferguson said two earls a duchess and damn me if thats not the commanding officer of the scots guards over there and the commanding general of the household brigade id better say hello good old british class system dillon said turning to hannah im going to force my way to the bar wait for me here he made it and said to hetty would you happen to have any champagne in your fridge there there might be a halfbottle she frowned champagne at a funeral he lit a cigarette i want to drink a toast to probably the greatest lady ive ever known her smile was instant and impulsively she reached over and kissed him on the cheek and there were tears in her eyes she was the best right enough she produced the champagne two glasses he said a familiar voice said make that three dillon turned and there was blake johnson his left arm in a sling my god dillon said where in the hell did you spring from theres still an american air base up here at crockley it was a lastminute decision of the presidents sent me over to carry his personal wreath he took one of the glasses of champagne and dillon carried the other two blake kissed hannah on the cheek superintendent as always a pleasure nice to see you and very gracious but thats not why were here to helen lang a great lady she raised her glass and they all touched before drinking from behind charles ferguson said and so say all of us the church of st mary and all the saints was so crowded that they had to queue to get in the door there was a man in his forties with a woman of the same age hedley jackson beside them hedley whispered something the couple glanced across and the men held back brigadier ferguson im george harrison lady helens nephew of course youre taking over as chief executive of all the family business interests harrison was actually crying she was a great woman just great she used to come over to boston when i was a kid we all loved her these are colleagues of mine superintendent bernstein sean dillon and blake johnson from the white house harrison stared the white house im here as the presidents personal representative blake said hes sent a wreath my god i dont know what to say harrison got his handkerchief out i guess id better get back to my wife dillon was not a religious man he remembered the roman catholic church in county down in ulster as a boy incense candles and the holy water the uncle hed had who was a priest and too good for this world but standing at the back of that old english church the service meant very little to him the hymns the organ music the eulogy on helen langs life by the clergyman seemed to make no sense strange like dillon she was a catholic but the lang family was not yet at the end what difference did it make he was happy to get out stood at the side of the path in the rain and lit a cigarette for the moment hed lost the others and hedley appeared with a large black umbrella another cliche hedley dillon told him a funeral and the rain pouring down you sound angry mr dillon i just feel she deserved better you got that bastard for her the one good thing they stood to one side as the bearers emerged from the church with the coffin and moved towards the part of the churchyard where the lang family mausoleum was a hell of a woman hedley said you know what she did for me tell me the lawyer phoned this week one million pounds in her will and her house in south audley street dillon tried to find the right words she loved you hedley she wanted to take care of you its only money mr dillon there were tears in hedleys eyes only money and what good is that when you come down to it dillon patted his shoulder as the coffin moved on and they followed with the crowd and when he turned ferguson bernstein and blake were with them the coffin went into the mausoleum the vicar spoke the bronze doors closed the rain was relentless already a new plaque was here beneath the one that said major peter lang mc scots guards special air service regiment rest in peace it said helen lang greatly loved died hedley said to dillon i suggested that as there was no one else here i knew she wouldnt want anything fancy remarkable ferguson said a wreath from both the british prime minister and the president of the united states you dont see that every day the crowd started to disperse they walked down to the church parking lot there was an american air force limousine there a uniformed sergeant at the wheel straight back blake dillon asked ive got work to do my fine irish friend you know how it is oh i do goodbye brigadier blake shook hands kissed hannah got in the rear of the limousine and was driven away people dispersed the cars drove away ferguson said thats it then they walked to the daimler the driver opened the rear door and they got in dillon taking a jump seat opposite hannah and ferguson he pulled the glass panel behind him closed do you ever feel tired my love he asked hannah really tired i know sean i know the daimler moved away so now what dillon asked there are still problems dillon ferguson told him the middle east africa bosnia he shrugged only the irish dimension has changed with the peace process working brigadier if you believe that youll believe anything dillon leaned back folded his arms and closed his eyes
