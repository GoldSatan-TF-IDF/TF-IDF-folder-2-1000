marion lennox the doctors proposal a book in the castle at dolphin bay series chapter one how did you knock on the front door of a medieval castle and what was such a castle doing in a remote australian fishing community dr kirsty mcmahon was worried and tired and it was starting to rain the castle doors looked as if theyd take a battering ram to open them and using the incongruous intercomthing produced nothing her tentative knock sounded ridiculous she knocked harder and gave a hopeful shout but there was no response enough shed been stupid to come susie was complaining of cramp she and her twin would find a hotel in dolphin bay and broach the castle walls in the morning if she could get susie back here then she paused as a sudden flurry of barking sounded on the other side of the gates was someone coming the vast timber doors opened an inch and then wider a lanky brown dog of indiscriminate parentage nosed its way out a hand gripped its collar a mans hand she took a step back this place seemed straight out of a gothic novel the castle was set high on the cliffs above the sea with purplehazed mountains ringing the rear in the mist of early evening kirsty was almost expecting to be met by a pack of ancient hunting dogs anchored to armoured warriors with battleaxes boris if you jump up on anyone youll be toast she blinked the owner of the voice didnt sound like an axetoting warrior the voice soundednice the doors swung wider and she decided the adjective nice wasnt strong enough her warrior was gorgeous six feet two midthirties maybe aran sweater faded jeans and battered boots deep brown crinkly hair ruffled just the way she liked it in her men her men robert the thought almost made her smile and she had no difficulty at all turning her attention back to her warrior what else he had a craggy face strongly boned and weathered his eyes smiled at the edges even when he wasnt smiling his body wasexcellent oh for heavens sake she was standing outside a ridiculous australian castle thinking lustful thoughts about a strange mans body all her life shed fought to stay in control and now when everything was teetering the last thing she needed was the complication of a male back home she was dating nice safe robert whod stay being nice and safe for as long as she wanted she was in control she was married to medicine but her warrior was definitely gorgeous umhello she tried the stranger was hauling his dog back giving her a chance to catch her breath behind the man and dog she could see the castle forecourt this then was why thered been no response shed knocked on what was essentially the fortress gates and behind the gates the castle was a lacy confection of gleaming white stone turrets and battlements kirsty was practically gaping it was so ridiculously seventeenthcenturymeetsnow that it was fantastic it was also set so far back from the gates that if the intercom wasnt working it must have been sheer luck that anyone had heard her call she needed to stop gaping what can i do for you the man asked and she attempted to sound coherent sort of my sister and i have come to see angthe earl im sorry but his lordship isnt receiving visitors it was a brisk denial made in a hurry as he pushed the gates closed again she stuck her foot forward mistake these gates werent built so that a fivefeetfour doctor of not very impressive stature could block them with one toe she yelped her warrior swore and the gate swung wide again did i hurt you yes you shouldnt have put your foot there you were closing the gate in my face he sighed they both inspected her foot for a moment waiting for it to do something interesting but she was wearing solid trainers and shed hauled her foot out fast maybe shed suffered nothing worse than a minor bruise im sorry the man said and as his voice softened she thought again just how gorgeous he was his voice was deep and resonant with the lazy drawl of an australian accent well what had she expected in australia but he did seem to becaring and his caring tone tugged something inside her that hadnt been tugged for a long long time she must be more tired than shed thought she decided surprising herself with the depth of her reaction caring she was the one who was doing the caring his lordship isnt up to seeing visitors he was saying still in the gentle reasonable tone that did weird things to her insides and he doesnt see tourists at any time were not tourists we she motioned to the car where susie was peering out anxiously from the passenger seat my sister and i youre american good call she told him but were still not tourists but you still cant see his lordship once more the gates started to close were family she said quickly and the gates stilled the mans face stilled what did you say were a part of anguss family she told him weve come all the way from america to see him there was a deathly silence she had been wrong she thought when shed decided this mans eyes smiled all the time they werent smiling now he suddenly looked cold disdainful and very very angry youre too early he told her and he hauled his dog back behind him as if she was something that might be infectious i thought the vultures would be arriving soon and here you are but angus is still alive he didnt even look to see where her foot was the gate slammed shut against her ten minutes and a thermos of tea later they were still none the wiser kirsty had returned to the car and filled susie in on the details well at least were at the right place kirsty told her sister but i dont know who the sentry is a son i was sure angus didnt have sons susie wriggled deeper into the passenger seat trying to get comfortable no mean feat at eight months pregnant kirstys twin had been sitting still for too long but she hadnt wanted to get out when theyd arrived it had been too much trouble everything was too much trouble for susie kirsty thought grimly and instead of making it better these last few weeks had made it worse clinical depression was crippling more it was terrifying so what do we do susie asked but she asked as if it didnt matter too much what kirsty replied over to kirsty as always obediently kirsty thought about it what could they do retreat to town and try and gain access again in the morning telephone they should have telephoned in the first place but she hadnt been sure theyd reach here she glanced across at susie exhaustion was washing over her twins face and she knew she had no choice this had turned into a disastrous expedition she thought bleakly but back home in new york it had seemed reasonable even sensible for susie the last few months had been appalling and kirsty had fought every way shed known to haul her twin out of a clinical depression that was becoming almost suicidal two years ago susie had married rory douglas rory was a scottish australian whod decided two minutes after meeting susie that americaand susiewas home it had been a blissfully happy marriage six months ago kirstys twin had been glowing with early pregnancy and she and her rory had been joyfully preparing to live happily ever after but then had come the car crash rory had been killed instantly susie had been dreadfully physically injured but her mental state was worse psychiatrists hadnt helped nothing had helped why not visit australia kirsty had suggested at last flailing for answers you know so little about rorys background i know his parents are dead and he didnt get on with his brother but at least we can visit where he was born dolphin bay are there really dolphins all we know is that its on the coast somewhere south of sydney it sounds exciting i can take leave from the hospital lets go on a factfinding tour so youll be able to tell your baby where his daddy came from it had seemed a sensible idea sure susie was pregnant and the injuries to her back meant she was still using a wheelchair most of the time but kirsty was a doctor she could care for her because susie had been married to an australian she was covered for health costs in australia at seven months pregnant she had only just been able to make the journey before airline restrictions stopped travel but kirsty had decided even if they got stuck it would be no disaster if the baby was to be born in australia susie would have her own little australian itd be great but susie had been apathetic from the start and nothing had gone right their plane had no sooner touched down in sydney than susie had shown signs of early labour what had followed had been four weeks in sydney on a medical knife edge with susies depression deepening with the enforced idleness but at least the baby had stayed in situ now susie was eight months pregnant and if she did go into labour it wasnt a major drama enough with doing nothing kirsty had decreed in desperation theyd finally headed for their destination travelling in careful easy stages so they could see the sights as they went but all kirsty had achieved had been more apathy from susie and now they stared at the imposing fortress and susies expression of bewilderment echoed what was in kirstys own heart why didnt rory tell me his uncle was an earl susie whispered and to live in a place like this i never would have come if id known this it had been a shock kirsty acknowledged theyd arrived in dolphin bay that afternoon tried the local post office for information and had been stunned by their reception angus douglas thatll be his lordship youre wanting the earl angus douglas is an earl kirsty had demanded and the postmistress had smiled propped her broad elbows on the counter and prepared to chat ooh yes dolphin bays answer to royalty is our angus hes the earl of loganaich he tells us but the loganaich part of him is long gone loganaich kirsty had said not understanding and the lady had needed no more encouragement to expand apparently his familys castle burned to the ground back in scotland she told them lord angus says it was a nasty draughty place and no great loss hes not all that sentimental his lordship except when it comes to wearing kilts ooh you should see him in a kilt anyway lord angus and his brothers left scotland when they were not much more than teenagers and two of themthe two eldestcame here tell us about them kirsty said faintly and the lady proceeded to do just that lord angus married a nurse during the war she said pointing to a community noticeboard a yellowing newspaper clipping showed an elderly lady at what seemed to be some sort of village fête thats deirdre god rest her soul a lovely lovely lady she sniffed and it was obvious to kirsty why the fading newspaper was still on the board this was personal loss did they have children she asked and was met by a shake of the head that was almost fierce they had no kiddies but they were happy the postmistress groped for a handkerchief and blew her nose deirdre only died two years ago and it broke his lordships heart it broke all our hearts and now his lordships alone in his old age doc tells me hes not good docs doing all he can do but theres only so much one doctor can do did you sayhis lordshiphad brothers kirsty asked cautiously abandoning the tangent of an overworked doctor for the moment and got a grimace for reply the brother we knew was a biterratic the postmistress told them and he married a girl who was worse they had two boys rory and kenneth the boys were born here but the family left soon after the boys came here on school holidays just for a bit of stability deirdre and angus loved them to bits but from what i hear kenneth was too like his dad ever to be peaceable kenneth fought with rory all the time finally rory went to america to get away from him then a few months ago we heard he died in a car crash his lordship was devastated kenneth still visits but hes not liked locally we wont be calling him lord kenneth when angus dies thats for sure her mouth tightened in a grim line titles are all very well when youre loved like lord angus is but kenneth ugh butangus is still an earl susie whispered dazed by this surfeit of information and the postmistress looked sympathetically at susie in her wheelchair and grimaced seems ridiculous doesnt it he doesnt like being called it he says just angus is good enough for him but we like to call him lord angus among ourselvesor lord douglas when were being formal what he and deirdre did for our town i cant begin to tell you wait till you see his house loganaich castle we call it just joking but the name fits you need to find it ill draw you a map rorys uncle angus an earl loganaich castle susie had come close to going home thenand now sitting in the car outside the extraordinary mass of gleaming stone that was the new loganaich castle she turned to her twin and her eyes were as bleak as kirsty had ever seen them kirsty what are we doing here lets go back to america we were dumb to come weve come so far and you know we cant go back to america now no airline will take you until after the babys born lets find a bed for the night and come back in the morning lets go back to sydney in the morning susie no you cant lose every link with rory i already have and you heard the postmistress rory had lost any link to his uncle rory spoke of angus and his aunt with affection the postmistress said angus was devastated to learn rory was dead you have to see him no susie please the gates are opening again susie said in a voice that said she didnt care someones coming out we need to move kirsty turned to see there was a dusty land rover emerging from the forecourt out onto the cobbled driveway leading to the road kirsty had driven as close as possible so susie could watch her as shed knocked and the cobblestones were only a carwidth wide their car was blocking the drivewaymeaning the land rover had to stop and wait for them to move the gates were swinging closed again now behind the land rover this was apparently a castle with every modern convenience electronic sensors must be overriding manual operations there was still no access ok theyd go kirsty started the engine and then glanced one last time at the land rover the man whod slammed the gate on her was at the wheel his lanky brown dog was sitting beside him the dogs dumb goofyalmost grinningface was at odds with the mans expression of grim impatience his fingers were drumming on the steeringwheel as he waited for her to move she hesitated the fingers drummed the man looked angry as well as impatient he wasnt alone in his anger kirsty glanced across at her sister she wouldnt get susie back here tomorrow she thought susies expression was one of hopelessness where was the laughing bubbly susie of a year ago kirsty wanted her back fiercely desperately kirsty mourned her twin her anger doubled quadrupled exploded she killed the engine what susie started but kirsty was already out of the car her car was half off the cobblestones and there was a puddle right beside the drivers door shed climbed out carefully last time but this time she forgot about the puddle she squelched in mud to her ankle she hardly noticed how dared he drum his fingers at her in truth her anger was caused by far more than merely drumming fingers but the fingers had a matching face a target for the pentup grief and frustration and fear of the last few months too much emotion had to find a vent somewhere the drumming fingers were it she marched up to the land rover right to the drivers side she hauled open the door of the vehicle so hard she almost yanked it off its hinges right she told him get out i want some answers and i want them now he should have been home two hours ago dr jake cameron had spent the entire day sorting out trouble and he had more trouble in front of him before he could go home that night as well as the medicine crowding at him from all sides there was also the fact that his girls were waiting the twins were fantastic but hed stretched their good nature to the limit mrs boyce would have to put them to bed again tonight shed be upset at not getting home to mr boyce and he winced at the idea that hed miss yet another bedtime who needed a bedtime story most the twins or himself the answer was obvious we could all use a good fairytale he told boris as he watched the flaming ball of anger stomp along the cobblestones toward him do godmothers do a line in beam me up scotty no godmother arrived and he couldnt leave the womans car was blocking his path and he was forced to stay motionless while she hauled open his door and let him have it with both barrels she wanted answers what do you mean you want answers he asked coldly sliding his long frame out from the vehicle so he could face her anger head on shed said she was anguss family but hed never seen her before who was she he would have noticed if he had seen her he decided she was five feet three or four slim with an open face clear brown eyes and glossy auburn curls that tangled almost to her collar late twenties he thought she had to beand she was lovely she was dressed in faded hiphugging jeans and an oversized waterproof jacket but her clothes did nothing to dispel his impression that she was lovely apart from her foot one foot had landed in a puddle it was the same foot hed squashed he remembered and he looked down and saw the mud and felt repentant then he thought of angus and he stopped feeling repentant my sister and i have travelled all the way from new york to visit mrlord douglas she snapped we need to see the earl you mean angus hed only referred to angus as his lordship to intimidate these two into leaving it hadnt worked so he may as well go back to using angus angus his friend what else could he do for the old man he wondered as he waited for the virago to speak again angus needed oxygen he needed roundtheclock nursing and if he didnt get it my sisters not well the woman snapped so what was new no ones well he said bitterly and theres only me to deal with it i need to do three more house calls before dinner can you move your car please youre a doctor she asked blankly and he sighed yes im dr jake cameron anguss doctor you dont look like a doctor would you like me to wear a white coat and stethoscope here an hour ago i was shifting cows blocking the track to my next patient this is not exactly whitecoat country i thought you might have been a nephew you are indeed a close family he said dryly does your sister need medical attention no but then please move your vehicle im two hours late and youre making me later she wasnt listening is there anyone else we can talk to angus is alone in that huge house hes accustomed to it he told her but if itll make you happier he wont be here much longer hes being transferred to the dolphin bay nursing home tomorrow itd be much easier to call there dont you think but if youre thinking of pushing him to change his will dont bother you bring a lawyer near him and ill call the police she gazed straight at him her eyes wide and assessing why are you being horrible im not being any more horrible than i have to be angus is weary to death of family pressure and im in a hurry so be nice to me fast tell me why we cant see the earl he sighed hed had this family up to his ears angus has severe breathing difficulties he told her hes settled for the night and if you think hes coming downstairs to indulge a couple of moneygrubbing you see theres the problem she said and her own anger was palpable youre treating us as if were something lower than pond scum we dont even know angus we never knew he was an earl or that he was living in something that looks like a cross between disneyland and camelot and as for moneygrubbing he was hardly listening he couldnt he was so late hed promised mavis hipton that hed look in on her this afternoon and he knew she needed more analgesic to make it though the night mavis suffered in stoic silence she wouldnt complain but he didnt want her suffering because of these two he glanced at his watch pointedly you said youre family he told her why do you know nothing youre not making sense my sister was married to one of anguss nephews she told him standing square in front of him making it quite clear he wasnt going anywhere until she had answers susies never met her husbands family and shed like to especially now hes dying he snapped it had only been this afternoon that hed fielded yet another phone call from kenneth and kenneth had been palpably pleased to hear that angus was failing the phone call had left jake feeling ill and nowwas this kenneths wife he didnt have time to care i need to go we didnt know angus was dying she snapped her colour mounting as far as we knew rorys uncle angus was as poor as a church mouse but hes all the family rory hadexcept a brother he didnt get on withso weve come all this way to see him of all the appalling things to say that were fortune hunters he hesitated at that for a moment he stopped being angry and forced himself to think what had she said rorys uncle angus not kenneth then rory the nephew in the states she was so indignant that he was forced to do a bit more fast thinking ok maybe he was out of line maybe his logic was skewed angus was one of his favourite patients and telling him he had to go into a nursing home had been a really tough call kenneth might be nasty and unbalanced but there was no reason to assume everyone else was maybe these two really were family he forced himself to think a bit more angus had talked affectionately of his nephew rory jake remembered the old man had been devastated to hear hed died if rory had been married then this pair really were part of anguss family caring family the idea that hit him then was so brilliant that it made him blink you really dont know angus he asked thinking so fast he felt dizzy i told you no but youd like to see him tonight yes but and maybe stay the night he told her ideas cementing he hated leaving angus he needed a fulltime nurse but angus refused point blank to have one with the state of his lungs leaving him by himself seemed criminal he should be in hospital but he refused to go there was a bed at the nursing home available tomorrow and the old man had agreed with reluctance that hed go then which left tonight if he could persuade these two to stay even if they were after the old mans money ill introduce you he told her doing such a fast backtrack that he startled her what now yes now if you promise to stay the night then ill introduce you she was staring at him like he had a kangaroo loose in the top paddock we cant stay the night why not well she looked at him in astonishment were not invited im inviting you angus needs his family now more than hes ever needed anyone tomorrow hes being moved into a nursing home but he needs help now he has pulmonary fibrosishe has severely diminished lung capacity and im worried hell collapse and not be able to call for help he eyed her without much hope but it was worth asking anyway i dont suppose either of you is a nurse she eyed him back with much the same expression as he was using like she didnt know what to make of him but she was sure his motives were questionable why i told you he sighed and glanced at his watch again hes ill he needs help if you want to see himare you prepared to help if one of you is a nurse neither of us is a nurse susie is a landscape gardener damn he said and started turning away but im a doctor a doctor there was a long pause he turned back and looked at herfrom the tip of her burnt curls to the toe of her muddy foot she was glaring at him he wasnt interested in the glare a doctor youre kidding me he said at last a people doctor a people doctor a tiny hope was building into something huge and he tried frantically to quell it you know about lung capacity we have heard of lungs in america yes she snapped losing her temper again the last ship into port brought some coloured pictures the current medical belief in manhattan is that the lungs appear to be somewhere between the neck and the groin unless weve got it wrong its different in australia whoa he tried a smile and held his hand up placatingly sorry i only meant oh its fine she told him bitterly who cares what you meant youve insulted us in every way possible but she hesitated angus is dying his smile faded hes dying he said softly maybe not tonight but soon much sooner if hes left alone hes refusing oxygen and pain relief he has heart trouble as well he wont let the district nurse near and if you really are a doctor if you dont believe me sorry he needed to do some placating here he thought fast angus is my friend he said softly im sorry if ive sounded abrupt but i hate leaving him alone if you agree to stay here tonight youll be making up for a lot making up for neglect mistake we have not neglected anyone it was practically a yell and he gazed at her in bewilderment she turned a great colour when she was angry he thought her eyes did this dagger thing that was really cute umthat meant what exactly that meant he was being dumb cut it out he told himself crossly you have hours of house calls move on ok he agreed you didnt neglect angus you didnt know about angus ill accept that thats noble of you she snapped she glanced behind to the car but the woman in the passenger seat didnt appear to be moving angus really does need help she asked medical help he really does personal as well as medical urgently well stay then she told him and it was his turn to be taken aback just like that you dont need to consult your sister susies past making decisions he frowned you said shes ill whats wrong with her shes not so ill that she cant stay here the night i assume theres bedding there are fourteen bedrooms deidreanguss wifewas always social no ones been in them for years but once a month the housekeeper airs them just in case she was only listening to what was important so theres room to stay the bedrooms are on the ground floor some of them are but she wasnt listening to buts she was moving on wheres the housekeeper she doesnt live in she comes in three times a week from dolphin bay he really is alone i told you and i heard she snapped fine go and tell him were coming who did you say you were im kirsty mcmahon she drew herself up to her full five feet four inches and rose on her toes so a bit more was added dr kirsten mcmahon my sister susan was married to rory his lordships nephew the rory who was killed he hesitated i remember kennethanother of anguss nephewstold angus some months ago that his brother had been killed in the states im sorry but just leave it she said bitterly all you need to know is that we couldnt care less about any inheritance so lets just stop with the judgement go and tell his lordship who we are and let me get my sister settled for the night she was gorgeous she was a lifesaver he left them and with boris loping beside him made his way back into the house he had keyssomething hed insisted on when angus had had his last coronaryand he knew the way well so he left borissternlyat the foot of the stairs and made his way swiftly up to the old mans apartments a doctor here the thought was unbelievable his mind was racing forward but for now he had to focus on angus angus wasnt in bed he was at the window staring out at the kitchen garden to the sea beyond he was a little man wiry and weathered by years of fishing and gardening a lifetimes love of the outdoors jake remembered him in the full regalia of his scottish heritage lord of all he surveyed and the sight of the shrunken old man in his bathrobe and carpet slippers left an ache that was far from the recommended medical detachment he tried for hed miss him so much when he died but that death would be soon he needed a coronary bypass and wouldnt have one that was a huge risk factor but it was his lungs that were killing him jake could hear his whistling gasps from the door signifying the old mans desperate lack of oxygen i thought you were going to bed jake growled trying to disguise emotion and angus looked around and tried to smile theres time and more for bed its only five oclock your suppers on the bedside table jake told him still gruff hed brought the meal up himself because if he hadnt angus wouldnt eat he and angus had been friends for a long time now and it was so hard to see a friend fade ill get to it what brings you back could you cope with a couple of visitors visitors two americans sisters one of them says she was married to rory rory anguss smile faded my rory your nephew jake hesitated kenneths older brother he must have left for overseas before i came here he paused and then as angus turned back to the window he said gently tell me about him i havent seen rory for years you had three nephews jake prodded he wanted family interesthe wanted any interestand he was prepared to make himself even later to get it this had to be his top priority to see angus give up on life was heartbreaking and maybe these two women could be his salvation id be having two brothers angus whispered so softly that jake had to strain to hear we left scotland together dougal the youngest went to america david and i came here dougal and i lost touch a long time agoyes theres another nephew somewhere but ive not met him but david married here and had rory and then kenneth they moved from dolphin bay but the lads came back for holidays were they nice kids jake murmured encouraging him rory loved this place angus said softly he and i would be fishing together for hours and deidre and i loved him like the son we could never have but kenneth kenneth jake couldnt suppress a grimace it had been a dumb question kenneth definitely couldnt have been nice kenneth was rorys younger brother angus was struggling hard to breathe maybe he shouldnt be talking but jake didnt intend to interrupt there were major issues at stake herelike a readymade family at the front door if kirsty really was a doctor if he could install her here kenneth is a troubled young man and im sure you can be seeing that angus managed youve met him he takes after his father every time rory came near there was a fuss more and more as they got older and kenneth realised rory would inherit my title as if any title matters more than family he paused and fought for a few more breaths there was an ineffable sadness in his eyes that seemingly had nothing to do with his health kenneth was so vicious toward rory that once his parents died rory decided family angst wasnt worth it he said sadly he took off to see the world hes been away these past ten years and the next thing i knew kenneth was telling me he was dead i was sosorry so maybe kirsty had been telling the truth jake thought maybe she did know nothing of angus for a moment he regretted hed made her angry but then he remembered the flare of crimson in her cheeks and the flash of fire in her brown eyes and he didnt regret it he found he was almost smiling this was looking good he thought this was looking excellent angus had been fond of rory rorys widow was at the gate and if rorys widow was anything like her sisterthey could be a breath of fresh air in this place a breath of life theyre outside waiting he said i told them to give me a minute and then follow who angus was lost in his thoughts and was suddenly confused rorys widow and her sister rorys widow he repeated so it seems kenneth didnt tell me he was married maybe kenneth didnt know angus thought about that and then nodded understanding aye maybe he wouldnt rory learned early to keep things to himself where kenneth was concerned but youd like to see them id like to see them angus agreed could you give them a bed for the night jake askeddiffidentlyand held his breath the old man considered he stared through the window down at his gardenhis vegetable patch where jake knew he was longing to be right now since his illness hed drawn in on himself he barely tolerated the housekeeper being here could he accept strangers how much had he loved rory jake held his breath some more rorys widow angus whispered at last what would she be like i dont know jake told him i only met the sister kirsty she seemstemperamental what does temperamental mean i guess it means shes cute jake admitted and angus gave a crack of laughter that turned into a cough but when he recovered there was still the glimmer of a smile remaining well well signs of life time and enough too that wife of yours has been gone too long angus i know its none of my business youre saying these women are at the gate now yes ill go and let them in if its ok with you you think they should be staying here i think they should stay angus surveyed his doctor for long moment shes cute he demanded and he seemed almost teasing not rorys wife jake said stiffly ive only met i know who youd be talking about angus said testily rorys wifes sister shes cute yes but and if shes staying the nightyoull be back in the morning yes but lets leave the buts angus said and his lined face creased into mischief ill not be flying in the face of providence cute eh well well of course they can stay chapter two ok so angus was matchmaking but that was fine by him anything to get him to agree to have them stay jake decided as he made his way down the magnificently carved staircase he walked out the front door and stopped hed left his car blocking the castle entrance with only just enough room for a pedestrian to squeeze past the verge on either side was rough corrugated by recent rains hed expected kirsty and her sister to walk along the cobblestones what had happened was obvious one of the women hadnt been able to walk halfway along the walkway was a wheelchair upturned a woman was lying in the mud kirsty was bending over her jake took one look and started to run she was kirstys sister there was no doubting it an identical twin maybe the similarities were obvious but there were major differences the girl lying in the mud was heavily pregnant her face was bleached white and a fine hairline scar ran across her forehead she lay in the mud and her eyes were bleak and hopeless jake had seen eyes like this before in terminally ill patients who were alone and who had nothing left to live for to see this expression on such a young woman was shocking oh susie im so sorry kirsty was saying she was kneeling in the mud sliding her hands under susies face to lift her clear there was a rut it was filled with water and i didnt realise how deep it was whats happening jake knelt and automatically lifted the womans wrist you fell you really are smart kirsty muttered flashing him a look of fury i tipped her out of the wheelchair susie what hurts have you wrenched your back dont move she sounded terrified one hand was supporting susies head the other was holding her sister down jakes fingers had found the pulse automatically assessing did you hurt yourself in the fall he asked and the young woman in the mud shook her head in mute misery ill live she put her hands out to push herself up but kirstys expression of terror had jake helping her hold her still what do we have here he held the womans shoulders pressuring her not to move can you stay still until i know the facts he spoke gently but with quiet authority i dont want you doing any more damage she suffered a crush fracture at t five months ago kirsty told him in a voice that faltered with fear incomplete paraplegia but sensations been returning i can walk susie said into the mud on crutches on smooth ground kirsty told jake still holding her twin still but not for long theres still leg weakness and some loss of sensation let me get my bag i can get up susie muttered and jake laid a hand on her cheek a feather touch of reassurance humour me i wont take long but i need to be sure youre not going to do any more damage by moving it took him seconds before he was back kneeling before her touching her wrist again her pulse was steadying he glanced again at kirsty if he had to say which was the whiter face his money was on kirstys such terror im going to run my fingers along your spine he told susie id imagine youd have had so many examinations in the last few months that you know exactly what you should feel and where i want you to tell me if theres anything different anything at all we need help kirsty snapped we need immobility until we can get xrays i want a stretcher lift and transport to the nearest hospital but jake met her eyes and held your sisters break was five months ago he said softly there should be almost complete bone healing by now youre not an orthopaedic surgeon no but i do know what im doing and its soft mud hooray for soft mud susie muttered and hooray for a doctor with sense ok dr whateveryournameis run your spinal check so i can get up susie kirsty said anxiously but her sister grimaced shut up kirsty and let the nice doctor do what he needs to do yes maam jake said and smiled so he did what he needed to do while kirsty sat back and alternatively glowered and leant forward as if shed help and then went back to glowering again it was like two sides of a coin he thought as he tested each vertebra in turn lightly pressing examining running his fingers under susies sweater not wanting to undress her and make her colder but finding he could examine by touch almost as easily as he could if she had been undressed they had to be identical twins he decided as he worked one twin battered and pregnant one twin immobilised by terror but susies spine was fine he decided or as fine as it could be at this stage of recovery as far as he could see there was no additional damage there was still a complication how pregnant are you eight months she told him four weeks to go theres already been a false labour kirsty muttered so you decide to go travelling he said dryly very wise mind your own business kirsty snapped be nice susie told her twin and kirsty looked surprised as if she wasnt accustomed to her sister speaking for herself youve flown from the us to australia at eight months pregnant he asked susie but susie didnt answer kirsty waited for a moment to see if her twin would answer but when she didnt she spoke again we came a month ago we thought it might help susie if she could find rorys uncle angus and talk to him about rory but susie went into prem labour and its taken a month before weve been game enough to leave sydney enough of the inquisition could we get susie warm do you think kirstys anger and distress were palpable shed have liked to direct them straight at him jake thought but he could see the warring emotions on her face and knew that the anger and the distress were selfdirected she was blaming herself but he had to concentrate on susie triage decreed that psychological distress came a poor second to possible spine damage he was helping susie into a sitting position and now he smiled at her encouraging slow i dont want any sudden movements this doctors almost as bossy as you are susie told her sister nice she turned back to jake but be bossy with kirsty she told him she needs bossiness more than me ill deal with your sister after you jake told her and glanced between the two of them there was more going on here than a healing back and pregnancy why was kirsty so terrified susie was so thin is anything else hurting my pride susie told him and some of her bravado was fading i have mud everywhere can we take her inside kirsty demanded in a voice full of strain and jake glanced at her again ok enough of the mud he stooped and lifted susie up into his arms despite her pregnancy she was so light she alarmed him even more kirsty gave a sigh of relief and started tugging the wheelchair forward but instead of placing susie into it he turned toward the gate hey kirsty said put her in here the chairs wet he said reasonably and we still have to get past the truck you cant carry her why not you should say unhand my sister sir susie told her sister and kirstys eyes widened she seemed totally unaccustomed to her sister even speaking much less making a joke my stupidity with the car blocked your path he told kirsty sending her a silent message of reassurance with his eyes relax he was telling her we need to get your sister warm the least i can do is provide alternative transport and it seemed that finally she agreed with him well if you think you can bear the weight she was trying to smile but he could still see the fear we aussie doctors are very strong he told her striving to match her lightness and at last she managed to smile he liked it when she smiled he decided she had a great smile a killer smile australian doctors are trained in weightlifting part of the trainingjust after learning where lungs are but if you want to see strong i have it on good authority that the man youre about to meet was an alltime champion cabertosser in his youth small but tough is our lord angus whats a caber susie asked bemused and he grinned who knows thats a scottish secret im not privy to such things but just between you and me i suspect its some sort of medieval instrument probably made out of boars testicles meant for stirring porridge and to the sound of susies chucklingand kirstys gasp of amazementhe led one woman and carried another up the steps of loganaich castle hed made her sister smile kirsty helped susie wash and undress tucked her between sheets in the most sumptuous bed shed ever seen and then stood back while jake examined her he examined her thoroughly as if he had all the time in the world the man whod been in such a hurry a few minutes ago was acting now as if time was not important he made susie laugh but as he did he checked everything about her her heart rate the babys heart rate the babys position her back he examined the scarring he checked sensation all over he even found a set of bathroom scales and made susie weigh herself normally an examination like this would have susie climbing walls but susie tolerated it with equanimity and she even laughed some more she never laughed these days he told the best jokes kirsty thought as she stood well out of the way and watched the skilled way he drew susie out he made gentle cracks that you werent sure were jokesor not until you looked into his eyes and saw the lurking twinkle he was just what susie needed no he was just what she needed she thought gratefully as she watched him take over for the first time in months the heavy responsibility for her sisters health had been shifted to someone else maybe they could stay here for a while she hadnt even met uncle angus yet she reminded herself their host the earl when did you last eat jake was asking susie and kirsty had to haul herself together to listen to what he was saying he had susie tucked back into bed after the weighing she was smiling up at him and the sight of her smiling sister made kirsty smile when did you last eat jake asked again as she failed to answer and kirsty blinked and responded for her um lunchtime four or five hours ago what did you eat then susie he asked her sister and kirsty blinked again hed gone straight to the heart of the matter he was some doctor i had a sandwich susie said and kirsty opened her mouth to say something but jake glanced at her again this man could speak with his eyes she shut upas silently ordered how much of the sandwich did you eat susie i i want the truth he was smiling but there was something about the way he said it that told kirsty he already knew the truth half a sandwich susie whispered and then as jakes eyes held hersand held some moreshe faltered a quarter maybe is there a reason youre not eating eating makes me feel sick kirsty was holding her breath the world was holding its breath has that been happening ever since your husband was killed theyd been tiptoeing round the edges for so long that this direct approach was almost shocking silence then yes have you talked to a professional about your problems with eating why should i talk to anyone about it susie whispered kirsty keeps on and on kirsty opened her mouth but she was hit by that quelling glance again shut up his glance said and she wasnt going to argue you dont see not eating as a problem he asked susie no is that true its not a problem the only person who thinks its a problem is kirsty and she fusses its just i dont feel like it i guess you dont feel like much youre right there susie said bitterly but people go on and on at me no need for the quelling glance this time kirsty knew when to shut up if she could shed disappear she thought he was treading on eggshells but she knew instinctively that none would be squashed you know susie i think you need time out jake said softly he glanced at the notes hed been taking as hed examined her for a start your blood pressures higher than it should be and we need to get it down im not going to hospital i didnt suggest that he said evenly but if you think you can bear to slum it here for a while susie gazed up at him from her massive eiderdown and her mound of soft down pillows astonished here youre anguss family im sure hed be delighted to hold on to you for a week or so ill talk to him about it shall i but meanwhile you need to eat and then sleep im not hungry you know im very sure you are he told her i cook the worlds best omelette i dont understand susie complained and kirsty thought ditto but youll eat my omelette ill be hurt if you dont how could her sister resist an appeal like that kirsty wondered and if there was a tiny seed of bitterness in what she was thinking who could blame her sure persuade susie to eat his omelette or shed hurt his feelings how many uneaten meals had she cooked for susie she was being ridiculous she looked up at jake to find he was watching her and the amusement was back behind those calm grey eyes drat the manwas he psychic could he read what she was thinking ill make some for your sister too he told susie and kirsty flushed ill make my own she told him if uncle angus says i can it is his castle after all isnt it it is indeed jake said gravely susie if youll excuse us ill take your sister to meet him well make your apologies you can meet him in the morning what gives you the right kirsty was almost speechless but as soon as the door was closed against susies ears she found speech was close to overwhelming her what gives you the right to invite susie for an extended stay with a man she hasnt met with an uncle whos dying are you his doctor or his keeper who are you and werent you late before im his doctor and his friend he said bluntly he was striding down the hallway so fast that she had to almost break into a run to keep up with him it seemed his time constrainthis sense of urgencywas operating again we have it in our grasp to save three lives here dr mcmahon and in the face of that who am i to quibble at being later than i already am i dont understand susie her baby and angus he told her wheeling into the next corridor this mansion was vast kirsty thought as she struggled to keep up it was astounding it was furnished like a palace actually its not a very exclusive palace jake commented louis xiv meets discountsrus it was so much what she was thinking that she gasped anguss wife had grand ideas he told her reaching the stairs and taking them three at a time but by the time the mansion was built angus said enough was enough hes rich but hes not stupid one day this place will be a glorious tourist hotelthe views alone are enough to sell it for millions he didnt stint on the building but furnishings to suit were another matter so we have a fabulous ballroom with a magnificent but very plastic chandelier plus the rest it was amazingbut it was great kirsty thought looking around her in awe there were aspidistra plants winding up every columnand there were many many columns grecian columns if she looked closely she could see the plants were plastic made in china the louis xiv chairs scattered along the wall were of a construction about three classes below chainstore what was she doing being distracted by furnishings she was still annoyed she decided to go back to being furious but before she could resurrect her indignation he let loose with his own do you mind telling me what youre doing travelling the world with a woman who is eight months pregnant a woman who has a shattered back and whos anorexic to boot what madness propelled you to bring her halfway across the world im not talking lightly when i say were working on saving three lives shes risking her life and her babys life you think i dont know that she would have died if i hadnt brought her here she said flatly and theres the truth why you can see why she fell for rory so hard she couldnt see anyone else and when he was killed she wanted to die too i think she still does is she being treated for depression she refuses she cant take antidepressants because of the baby if shed take themwhich she wouldnt she wont talk about rory she just sits i hoped that by bringing her here where people knew rory she might break her silence he reached the landing and said over his shoulder you said shes a landscape gardener thats part of the problem kirsty told him susies not fit to work she has nothing so she sits and thinks of what shes lost she still has the baby jake says its not altogether tragic thats easy to say kirsty said and he flashed her a look that she couldnt read im sorry where are we going to meet angus you said hed be asleep id said hed gone to bed theres a difference hell be waiting for us hes so ill he wouldnt come to find out whats happening hes a bit like susie jake said his voice softening he should be in a downstairs bedroom but he refuses he refuses anything that might help he just sits and waits how close is he to death she asked bluntly and saw him wince he really did care until you arrived id have said itd be a matter of weeks suddenly he was slowing his stride as if it was important that she hear what he had to say days even once hes in a nursing home i imagine hell lose any last vestige of will to live he lives for this place for this castle there was a wry grin at that no loganaich castle gives him pleasure but as amenable as he was to building it this was his wifes baby he doesnt love it his vegetable garden though is a different matter but now he hesitated now she prodded and he seemed to think for a bit before continuing now we have a landscape gardener and a doctor on hand jake said who knows what difference that could make he paused before a pair of vast oak doors set with two plastic plaques deirdre lives here was engraved on a teddybearembossed plastic plaque hanging on the lefthand door and angus lives here was hung with decorative fishing lines on the right it was too much for kirsty she started laughing jake swung the door wide and she was laughing as she met the earl of loganaich serious lung deterioration was difficult to disguise and angus showed all the symptoms he was seated at the window but he stood as they entered a frail man who groped for his walking frame before taking a faltering step toward them his breathing was shallow and rasping and his lips had a faint blue tinge if he was my patient id have him on oxygen kirsty thought and caught a flash of grim amusement from jake she wasnt going to look at him any more that was easy enough to arrangefor the moment angus was coming toward her a quizzical smile on his wrinkled face heres my visitor he said his obvious pleasure giving lie to jakes declaration that he couldnt have visitors but not his face clouded in disappointment shed held out her hand to greet him and he stared down at her bare ring finger not rorys widow jakes made a mistake hasnt he rory never married he did kirsty told him confused why hadnt rory kept in touch with his family but youre not my sister married your nephew she told him and shes not here susies here but shes ill herself jake said softly weve popped her into bed shes exhausted shes ill this old man was anxious on her sisters behalf kirsty thought with more than a little incredulity as she listened to his laboured painful breathing my sisters looking forward to meeting you very much she told him jake seems to think its ok for us to stay the night of course it is we wont bother you and well leave first thing in the morning his face fell so soon we dont want to disturb you no one wants to disturb me he snapped so harshly that he made himself cough why didnt rory tell me he was married why didnt kenneth tell me rory was married kirsty had no answers she knew rory had a brother but shed never met him as far as she knew there was a deep and abiding dislike that had been the major decision behind rorys decision to emigrate maybe susie knows more than i do she murmured you can talk to her in the morning she cast an uncertain glance at jake and then looked back at angus his lips were still tinged blue and his distress was obvious he was struggling to stand as she turned back to him he staggered slightly she caught his hand and helped him sit on the bed th th it was too much he lay back on the pillows and gasped you need oxygen she said urgently and turned to jake why isnt he on oxygen itd surely help jake sighed thank you dr mcmahon the us has heard of oxygen then has it im sorry she said backing off in an instant what was she about interfering in a doctorpatient relationship that had nothing to do with her of course its none of my business and angusyour im sorry i dont know what to call you i havent done the introductions jake said dr kirsty mcmahon this is his grace the earl of loganaich she glowered and then shot a cautious smile at angus gee that makes it easier to know what to call you angus managed a smile backand so did jake call me angus the old man managed but then he started to gasp again and jakes smile died angus you need to let me help you jake said urgently and kirsty could hear the raw anxiety in his tone this was something much deeper than a doctorpatient relationship angus wont use oxygen jake added startling her by referring to a conversation she thought hed effectively closed i know its none of your business dr mcmahon but now youve brought it up we may as well give dr mcmahon an answer dont you think angus no angus gasped and struggled for some more breath angus wont use oxygen because hes decided to die jake said still roughly just like your sister just like susie susie wants to die angus gasped rorys wife wants to die why the same reason you do i expect jake growled no point in going on then as angus started coughing again he lifted the old mans hand and gripped hard angus let us help stop being so damned stubborn kirsty took a deep breath she glanced sideways at jakeand then decided dammit she was going in boots and all you know the way youre looking without oxygen you could well die in the night kirsty said softly susies travelled half a world to meet you shed be so distressed im not im not likely to die in the night kirsty cast another cautious glance at jake but for some reason jake had turned away go ahead his body language said this may be none of her business but he wasnt stopping her jakes told you im a doctor she said and angus took a couple more painracked breaths and grunted aye too many of the creatures he means two too many jake said hed crossed to the window and was staring out at the sea until you arrived i was the only doctor within a hundred miles why he should say theres too many doctors when he wont even agree to see a specialist no point angus gasped im dying you are kirsty said almost cordially but dont you think dying tonight when susies come all this way to see you might be just a touch selfish there could have been a choking sound from the window but she wasnt sure selfish angus wheezed and leaned back on his pillows im not im not selfish if you let dr cameron give you oxygen then youd certainly live till morning you might well live for another year or more leave me be girl i wont die tonight no such luck your lips are blue thats a very bad sign what would you know i told you im a doctor im just as qualified as dr cameron he gasped a bit more but his attention was definitely caught the veil of apathy had lifted and he seemed almost indignant if my lips were blue then jake would be telling me he managed jakes told you jake muttered from his window and glanced at his watch and did his best to suppress a sigh and went back to staring out the window there was a moments silence while angus fought for a retort so my lips are blue he muttered at last so what kirsty considered back home she worked in a hospice and she was accustomed to dealing with frail and frightened people she could sense the fear in angus behind the bravado maybe he wasnt ready to die yet another glance at jakebut it seemed he was leaving this to her let us give you oxygen she said wondering how she was suddenly taking over from an australian doctor with a patient she didnt know on his territorybut jakes body language said go right ahead and let us give you some pain relief she added guessing instinctively that if he was refusing oxygen hed also be refusing morphine we can make a huge difference not only in how long youre likely to live but also in how youre feeling how can you be knowing that for sure he muttered angus i have a patient back home in america she said softly hes been on oxygen now for the last ten years its given him ten years he otherwise wouldnt have hadten years where hes had fun what fun can you have if youre tied to an oxygen cylinder plenty she said solidly cyril babysits his grandson he gardens he how can he garden angus interrupted and kirsty thought yes interest he wheels his cylinder behind him wherever he goes she told him he treats it just like a little shopping buggy ive watched him weeding his garden he used a kneepad cos his knees hurt but he doesnt even think about the tiny oxygen tube in his nostril hes not like me jake says you have pulmonary fibrosis hes just like you i havent got a grandson angus said backed into a corner and still fighting no but youll have a grandniece ornephew in a few weeks she said with asperity i do think itd be a shame not to make the effort to meet him the effect of her words was electric angus had been slumped on the bed his entire body language betokening the end now he stiffened he stared up at her disbelief warring with hope the whistling breathing stopped the colour drained from his face and kirsty thought maybe his breathing had totally stopped but just when she was getting worried just when jake took a step forward and she knew that hed had the same thought as she hadheart attack or strokeangus started breathing again and faint colour returned to his face a grandnephew he stared up disbelief warring with hope rorys baby susies certainly pregnant with rorys child kenneth would have said kennethrorys brotherdoesnt want to know susie kirsty told him trying to keep anger out of her voice hes made it clear he wants nothing to do with us so we came out here hoping that the uncle angus who rory spoke of with affection might show a little affection to rorys child in return she steadied then and thought about what to say next and decided sure this wasnt her patientthis wasnt her hospicebut she was going in anyway and you cant show affection by dying she told him bluntly so if you have an ounce of selflessness in you youll accept dr camerons oxygenand maybe a dose of morphine in addition for comfortyoull say thank you very much and youll get a good nights sleep so you can meet your new relatives mother in the morning but he wasnt going so far yet he was still absorbing part one rorys wife is pregnant it was an awed whisper yes and i need to live if im to be seeing the baby yes youre not lying why would she lie jake demanded wheeling back to the bed angus can i hook you up to this oxygen like the lady doctor suggests or can i not angus stared at him he stared at kirsty his old face crumpled yes he said yes please jake had an oxygen canister and a nasal tube hooked up in minutes he gave angus a shot of morphine and angus muttered about interfering doctors and interfering relatives from america and submitted to both within minutes his breathing had eased and his colour had improved they chatted for a littlemore time while kirsty noticed jake didnt so much as glance at his watch againand finally they watched in relief as his face lost its tension hed been fighting for so long that he was exhausted well leave you to sleep jake told him and the old man smiled and closed his eyes thank god for that jake said softly and ushered kirsty out the door a minor miracle verging on a major one you really care she said and received a flash of anger for her pains what do you think there was only the matter of susies omelette remaining i can do it kirsty muttered as jake led her down to the castles cavernous kitchen somewhat to her relief deirdres love of melodrama and kitsch hadnt permeated here there was a sensible gas range plus a neat little microwave and a coffeemaker a really good coffeemaker im staying here for ever kirsty told jake the moment she saw it she hadnt seen a decent coffee since sydney dr cameron i can take over now well be fine call me jake boris had followed them into the kitchen the man and his dog were searching the refrigerator with mutual interest if you take your sister an omelette will she eat it he demanded she stopped being flippant and winced umno how did i guess that ill take it but you have more house calls the girls will already be asleep he muttered i may as well stay your wife goes to bed early kirsty asked and he looked at her as if she was stupid which seeing she was hugging a coffeemaker might well be a reasonable assumption forget it he said you toast me omelette and he grinned down at the hopeful boris and yousit fair delineation speaking of delineationyou dont want a medical partnership do you he asked without much hope and from the depths of the refrigerator you dont even know me she said startled i know you enough to offer you a job you cant be so desperate youd offer a strange american a medical partnership im always desperate backing out from the fridge with supplies he separated eggs and started whisking the whites as if theyd offended him kirsty cast him a sideways glanceand decided his silence was wise shed be silent too she started making toast for a while the silence continued but there was obviously thinking going on under the silence kirsty was practically exploding with questions but jake exploded first where are you expecting susie to have her baby he asked at last and his voice held so much anger that she blinked hed moved on from offering partnerships then he was back to thinking she was a dodo sydney she told him weve booked her into sydney central you mean youve thought it through im not dumb youve towed a wounded damaged pregnant anorexic woman halfway round the world i told you i had no choice she was dying while i watched susies my twin and i love her and i wasnt going to let that happen so what did you hope to achieve here susie loved rory so much i thought she might just find echoes and maybe she will yet she added a trifle defiantly flipping the toast onto a plate anguss smilewhen he smiles its rorys smile he was very fond of rory jake said relenting a little maybe hed been afraid shed intended dumping susies pregnancy on him she thought and if she were a medical practitioner in such a place maybe shed be angry too thats what im hoping she said you know this castle is just the sort of crazy extravagant thing rory might have built tell me about it it saved this districts soul jake told her and she paused in midtoastbuttering pardon this is a fishing town he said flipping the omelette then moving in to remove her toast crusts with meticulous care boris moved in to take care of the waste the town was dependent on couta fish he told her when she looked mystified nearly all the boats were designed to catch barracouta but forty years ago the couta disappeared almost overnight the locals say there was some sort of seaworm that decimated them anyway the boats all had to be refitted to make them suitable for deeper sea fishing but of course no one had savings the locals were desperatehalf the town was living on welfare then along came angus earl of loganaich and his eccentric wonderful wife they took one look at the place and decided to build their castle the locals called it a crazy whim but now after knowing angus for so long id say its far more likely he knew the only way to save the town was to give the locals a couple of years steady income while they worked on their boats part time and regrouped you think thats what happened who knows but the locals wont have a word said against him no one laughs at this castle do you think thisll do she looked down at his plate hed cut two pieces of toast into perfectly formed triangles without crusts hed flipped his perfect omelette into the centre whoops he said and crossed to the back door seconds later he was back with one tiny sprig of parsley it looked wonderful the man wasnt a doctor he was a magician stay here he ordered i need to feed my patient you reckon shell eat it ium i reckon she whispered her stomach rumbled the rest is for you he told her motioning to the remaining eggs id do it for you but i really am busy sure she said but he was already gone striding toward the bedroom where susie lay not wanting to eat id eat kirsty thought dazed if jake was standing over me having cooked me a meal how could she help but eat chapter three hes gorgeous sitting on the end of her sisters bed kirsty knew exactly who she was talking about who else there was an empty plate on her bedside table susie had eaten everything two slices of toast and a twoegg omelette now she was cradling a cup of tea as if she was enjoying it he is gorgeous kirsty admitted and smiled mind you i can see that hed put on a special effort when youre around youre one glamorous widow kirsty i know im sorry rorys death was still too new too raw for her sister to even think that at some time in the future she might feel sexual attraction rekindled no but you susie said thoughtfully kirsty this is an extremely attractive male with a wife and daughter or daughters how do you know he said he had to get home to his girls darn susie finished her tea and snuggled further under the covers her toss out of the wheelchair seemed to have done her little harm kirsty thought she looked brighter than shed been for months she looked interested angus is nice angus seems lovely i thought he must be rory told me he was special it was only kenneth being so awful that stopped him bringing me over to meet him why is kenneth so awful i dont really know susie said wearily rory seemed to think hes mentally unstable he made rorys childhood miserable kenneth came over to america just before rory died he came to the front door one night and he was justweird rory didnt let him stay he took him out to dinner but he came home so shaken i thought then that rory would never want to return to australia the only good thing about australia as far as i could see was rorys uncle angus and his auntie deirdre do you suppose angus really is an earl why do you think rory didnt tell me i have no idea kirsty told her can i take your blood pressure again before you go to sleep if you must but itll be down it was too and by the time shed checked it susies eyes were already closing do you think we might stay here for a while she asked sleepily kirsty thought why not there was the little matter of her medical career back home butwell maybe she had a medical career right here she certainly had two patients both of whom needed her as long they both shall live she told herself fiercely please kirsty found herself a bed in a bedroom that was just as sumptuous as susies she set her alarm and checked her patients twice during the night but both were sound asleep and the next morning she woke to find theyd decided to live a little longer she made them tea and toast bullied them into eating it gave angus more of the morphine jake had left her and then feeling like someone caught between sleep and wakingnot sure what was real and what was a dreamshe showered in a bathroom that had not only a chandelier hanging from the ceiling but also had a vast oval portrait of queen victoria gazing sternly down on her nakedness she was just drying her toes and trying her hardest to ignore her majestys displeasure when the doorbell rang it was eight in the morning too early for casual visitors it rang again two seconds later and she thought either angus would try to go downstairs and open the door or susie would go she had no choice she wrapped her towel around her and ran jake was at the door and boris i thought you had a key she said glowering and he had the temerity to grin keys arent half so much fun she tried to slam the door but he shoved his foot through and walked in without so much as a by your leave i could have used my key but i wasnt sure what sort of déshabillé i might find you in yeah i was swanning round naked were you he asked with interest and she flushed crimson what do you think then as boris nosed her towel she backed sharply away can you keep your mutt back this towel is precarious to say the least dont mind boris he said still smiling you neednt think his intentions are dishonourable what is he she asked momentarily distracted he really was the strangestlooking mutt part bloodhound part greyhound partet huge droopy ears a whippetthin body and sad protruding eyes that took over most of his weirdlooking face hes one of a kind jake said and boris woofed in agreement so enticingly she let go of one edge of the towel to scratch his ear very quickly she decided that wasnt a good idea both males were watching her towelapparently with hope you had him bred to your requirements she asked and jake gave a rueful and maybe even a resigned smile as she regained firm hold on her dignity hes not my dog sure hes not the dog was leaning against his leg adoration oozing from every pore well not for long he explained boris belonged to one of my patients miss pritchard was the local schoolteacher long retired by the time i knew her she introduced me to boris i scratched his ear just like you just did and when she died six months ago that gesture had cost me a mention in her will i told the public trustee there was a clause in the statutes saying doctors cant inherit from their patients but the public trustee seemed to think boris was an exception no one would fight me for boris you were fond of miss pritchard as well as the dog kirsty said slowly working things out for herself and now it was jakes turn to look discomfited maybe how are our patients but the idea of his sort of country practice had her fascinated and she wasnt finished with questioning yet even dressed only in a towel she might never get this chance again and she intended to use it were you born here no how long have you been practising here four years only four why on earth did you come i like it he said defensively sorry only asking she smiled down at boris who was sniffing her painted toenails with interest how did your wife react when you turned up one day with boris in tow she asked and that was the end of the laughter his smile died so fast she might well have imagined it i need to get on he told her glancing at his watch ill see angus now would your sister like to see me as well id like you to see her she said frankly abandoning jakes past in the face of current medical need to be honest she hesitated to be honest what when i came to australia i thought i could look after her but medically its been a disaster to be a loving sister and yet be a doctor as well you cant do the grumpy bits he said softening slightly this was such a weirdly intimate setting they were standing in the great hall two madeinjapan suits of armour flanking the stairway behind them boris wagging his tail between them as if urging his master to hurry upand kirsty was standing in her bare feet with a twofoot width of towelling keeping her only just decent of course it was intimate but jake was now hardly noticing kirsty thought she should be grateful she was grateful but but what but nothing she told herself crossly move on i do the grumpy bits she said and suddenly her voice was doing weird things like she was having trouble finding a normal doctortodoctor tone well what did she expect when talking to a colleague dressed like this i tell her not eating will harm the baby i tell her she has to be more optimistic for the babys sake if not her own doesnt work huh no she said frankly and how can i blame her i remember how lovely rory was and i want to weep myself how much worse must it be for susie so no professional detachment none at all she said ruefully not one little bit thats why im really pleased to see you she took a deep breath umdo you deliver babies there was a lengthy pause maybe she should have gone and got dressed and talked about this on the way out she thought but there were a lot of decisions to be made here and she suspected that many would be made in the next halfhour would angus keep his oxygen tube in place would he still be transported to the nursing home if not who would stay to take care of him maybe it could be her but if sothat would mean that susie stayed too and if she stayed then the baby would be born here and this man would have to deliver her and were going too fast jake said and she blinked pardon has angus met susie yet no i thought lets take this one step at a time shall we he said his smile a little wry first things first ive learned my triage dr mcmahon and im figuring out priorities you know what i suggest you do first what get yourself decent he told her you have a very nice cleavage and its still just a cleavage but only just that towel is way too skimpy youre messing with my triage and making my priorities all wrong so go cover priority number one with a tshirt or similar while i find our patients then we can figure out what may or may not be more important than one scant inch of towelling dressed in record time but still flushing bright crimson kirsty remerged from her gorgeous bedroom there were voices coming from the room next to hers susies room to her astonishment they were all in there susie was sitting up in bed looking interested angus was seated in the armchair beside the bed he was obviously still having breathing difficulties but his colour was better than the night before his nasal tube was taped in place and there was a small wheeled oxygen cylinder beside him like a tame pup the notsotame pupboriswas draped over the bed looking adoringly up at susie and susie was scratching his ears jake was beside the window they were all staring out the window to the garden beyond hes not thriving angus was saying in a voice that said the end of the world was nigh i may as well go to that nursing home if spike dies do we have another patient kirsty asked mystified and they all turned to look at her thats better jake said his eyes twinkling a little as he examined her demurely clad figurebut then he shook his head or maybe i just mean safer she ignored him almost whos spike anguss pumpkin susie said and kirsty blinked pardon hes a queensland blue susie told her as if that should explain all look at that veggie patch out there have you ever seen such a veggie patch kirsty crossed cautiously to the window and peered out worrying that she had three demented patients on her hands and a demented dog but it was indeed a veggie gardenand a veggie patch to take the breath away it stretched over maybe a quarter of an acre row upon row of vegetables and fruit trees of every imaginable variety with what looked like a conservatory on the side wow she said faintly wows right susie was pushing back her bedcoversand pushing back boris i have to get out there you really think you can help angus asked and susie gave him the sort of look kirsty reserved for relatives of a patient who might well die huge sympathy and not wanting to encourage false hope ill do my best well run soil tests maybe its too damp id imagine this rainfalls unseasonal for early in autumn is it yes angus said with doubt its normally much drier then maybe we can lift the whole vinejust enough to get it off the surface dirt and maybe get a bit of sunlight underneath it can be done by thinning out the leaves that should help the plant a lot we need to be so careful dampness can cause rot this late in the growing season rot angus said in the voice of a parent hearing the word leukaemia and susie winced im sorry i dont want to scare you but we need to get out there and see but youre pregnant lass angus said looking at her with real concern his old eyes misted with emotion pregnant with rorys child and rory wouldnt thank me if i just lay here while his uncle anguss pumpkin rotted she retorted kirsty you have to help and you angus said turning and poking jake in the midriff you helped me come down to meet my new niece without so much as a jacket and wellingtons theyre packed away in the back of my wardrobe get them for me theres a good chap yes sir jake saidand grinned ten minutes later jake and kirsty were standing at the back door onlookers to the main medical question of the day which was why spike wasnt at his best the patient in question was a vast greygreen pumpkin susie was balancing on her crutches trying not to wobble as she examined him from every angle and angus had pushed his oxygen cylinder onto its side so he could use it as a seat umdo we or do we not have a miracle happening here jake asked and kirsty glared at him as if by saying it he could jinx it dont even think it just hold your breath hold your tongue and cross everything you possess susies weightbearing is better than i thought i told you yesterday shes weightbearing but unsteady and she wont practise the ground heres so soft and squishy though shes being forced to use her legs praise be he said softly andyou said susies a landscape gardener thats right so angus has a niece by marriage pregnant with rorys child who shares his passion for gardening a niece who needs accommodation for a few weeks youre going too fast she told him and he raised his brows am i tell me youre not looking out at your sister and thinking this might work its too soon to tell yesterday you had a sister who was nonresponsive and i had a patient who wanted to die i dont see him refusing oxygen now he needs the tank for a garden seat she said but grinned ok dr cameron i concede youve done very well so far most australian doctors know enough to prescribe pumpkins for advanced pulmonary failure and severe depression he said smiling in return hasnt that reached the states as standard practice yet she choked on a bubble of laughter and then looked out at susie balancing precariously over the pumpkin but not even thinking about how wobbly her legs were and thought this is great this could just work hey angus id arranged to take you to the nursing home this morning jake called and the two pumpkin inspectors turned with identical expressions of confusion nursing home angus saidand then he remembered and his face fell oh aye thats right he turned to susie as if explaining i agreed to go why are you going to a nursing home susie asked in astonishment and he shook his head defeat written all over him its time lass i cant keep on here the doc is calling on me twice a day as it is and he cant keep doing that indefinitely angus has advanced pulmonary fibrosis jake said gravely he cant manage here alone any more there was a moments silence pulmonary fibrosisdoes that mean youre dying susie demanded her already pale face blanching still further it doesnt matter angus said uneasily we all go some time not quite so soon as youre preparing to shuffle off jake said bluntly ive told you with physiotherapy and with oxygen and pain relief you could still have years especially if you agree to bypass surgery ill not be wanting years what would i do with years you could grow bigger pumpkins susie said wildly angus ive only just met you and you sound like my rory youre his uncle if you die then ive got nobody gee thanks very much kirsty thought but she had enough sense to stay silent and if she hadnt had enough sense jakes hand was suddenly on her arm his pressure a warning i know she thought annoyed but then she glanced at his face and saw the tension and thought this guy really cares did he care about her sister maybe not but he certainly cared for the old man he was a country doctor in the oldfashioned sense she thought a man who knew every aspect of his patients lives and who treated them holistically sure he could set up an oxygen supply hed also plaster a broken leg or administer an antibiotic for an infection but he looked at the whole picture and he was looking at it now angus didnt need medicine as much as he needed family and jake was fighting with everything he had to give him one would you like us to stay susie was asking angus and kirsty held her breath for susie to make such a decision seemed amazing her twin had made no decisions since rory had died even the decision of what to put on in the morning was beyond her a crippling sideeffect of depression was indecision and susie had it in spades yet here she was making an instantaneous decision all by herself which might have to be revoked we could only do that if dr cameron could deliver your baby she said tentatively and dr cameron grimaced i usually send my expectant mothers to sydney two weeks before the birth why susie asked a lone medical practitioner doesnt make for an ideal birthing situation he told her if you needed a caesarean id need an anaesthetist susies face cleared thats easy kirsty can give an anaesthetic not that ill need it mind i intend to deliver this baby normally is that the only problem she turned again to angus is it ok if we stay were stuck you see i came out to australia to find you but i was too close to my due date and now no airline will take me home so if you need someone to stay here and i need somewhere to staywe could really work on this pumpkin jakes hand was still on her arm kirsty realised and he was looking at her angus and susie had turned back to spike the pumpkin and there was time to think things through before they took this plan any further how could she think when jakes hand was on her arm she shook it off and he drew back as if he hadnt meant to get so familiar good or was it good whats going on here jake asked cautiously glancing at her arm and then turning deliberately to look at susie and angus this is happening so fast susies desperate for this i dont understand there was nothing kirsty told him he needed to see she thought she needed to make him understand the mess her sister was in rory was always really ambivalent about his background he said hed never got on with his parents and we knew his brother hated him he arrived in america wanting to make a clean break and he did that by not talking about his background the only person he ever mentioned was his uncle angus and that was only in passinghed never talk at length about him and when susie suggested maybe they come out here he was horrified it was as if hed decided that susie was his family from now on and that was that only then he died and there was nothing just a blank nothing because there was no one else to grieve over him it was almost as if rory hadnt existed and now susies found rorys uncle angus and hes lovely and he needs her and ill bet right now shell be thinking that rory would want her to stay and you cant imagine how much of a blessing that must be she broke off tears threatening to spill she wiped them away with an angry backhand swipe anyway youve done very well for an australian doctor he said with a hint of teasing and she flushed and swiped again im not crying she said i dont cry its just hayfever he said promptly caused by pumpkins can i prescribe an antihistamine im fine she said and gazed at susie some more susie had abandoned the crutches and was seated on the rock wall abutting the vegetable garden she was talking animatedly about manure angus was listening and nodding and asking questions there were a few things to be considered medical things it was up to her to consider them can we deliver susies baby here its not perfect he told her normally id say no but if were weighting up the pros and cons id say the pros definitely outweigh the added cons wouldnt you say so dr mcmahon maybe what sort of a doctor are you an american one she snapped and he grinned yeah and a cute one but dont you guys all have specialties i guess she looked at him speculatively youre a family doctor a generalist he agreed but with surgical training do you have an anaesthetist not now old joe gordon was an anaesthetista fine onebut he died on me six months ago which explains the overwork which explains the overwork so how about you i work in a hospice a big one youre a palliativecare physician umno no my basic trainings in anaesthesia she confessed i specialise in pain management hence the hospice work you want a spinal block im your man his face stilled his eyes turned blank she could see cogs start to whirr lets not get any ideas she said hastily im here to look after my sister how interested are you in pumpkins she glanced across at the bent heads and managed a smile not very she confessed they lack a little in the patient backchat department then maybe youd help me out how can i do that she was still watching her sister susie was sitting on the wall with angus the sun was on her face and she and angus were examining each pumpkin leaf in turn i need to be here with susie and with angus you said yourself that angus couldnt be left alone ditto susie so that leaves me stuck in a castle he said still smiling and she wished suddenly that he wouldnt i guess thats terrific she said with what she hoped was cheerfulness it didnt quite come out that way she looked dubiously across at her sister and realised that susie and angus were soul mates theyd spend what remained of susies pregnancy happily saving pumpkins maybe she couldumread some books maybe you could help me jake said again and she turned from watching susie and made herself concentrate how could i do that im desperate you dont look desperate he smiled i have a way of hiding my desperation with insouciance insouciance hey like ketchup but thicker his smile deepened she loved it when he smiled like that it made his eyes light up in a way that had her fascinated remember robert she told herself fiercely remember her parents rory a life committed to medicine plus remember that this man was married with kids his girls so exactly how desperate are you she tried cautiously and his smile faded a little as if he was weighing what he ought to tell her pretty desperate i can look after angus he needs a nurse here jake said slowly but i was thinking wow can i watch the smile appeared again a truly excellent smile well worth working for enough impertinence i have an idea another shut up you he was grinning thered been lines of strain around his eyes since the first time shed met him and suddenly they were lightening it made her feel good great even she found she was grinning back and she had to force herself to get back to the issue at hand tell me your idea my girls he said cautiously and she stopped feeling like smiling which was dopey how could she be jealous of the family of someone shed known for less than twentyfour hours tell me about your girls she managed i have a housekeeper thats nice she said cautiously and once again got that flash of laughter it is nice he told her but it gets nicer margie boyce is a trained nurse shes in her sixties but shes very competent she could come out here during the day and stay with angus and susie there were things here she wasnt quite understanding you can manage without her no but what about your girls thats just it he said patiently they could come too your girls could come here thats right what about your wife he sighed i dont have a wife there was a moments silence no wife no but girls you really are nosy i am she agreed and beamed her smile seemed to take him aback he dug his hands in his pockets and stared at her like he wasnt quite sure what to make of her she continued to smile waiting hospice work was a hard training ground kirsty thought reflectively shed spent the last few years working with terminally ill patients and one thing shed learned fast was not to mess around trying to find the right way to frame a question the people she worked with had little energy and less time she worked to get things as right for them as she could in the little time she had available and she didnt do it by pussyfooting around hard questions so maybe it made her nosy what did she have to lose im divorced jake said grudgingly she gave a grunt of what might be sympathy and went back to looking out at the garden that was another trick shed learned give people space so the girls are your daughters she asked at last thats right how old four both theyre twins twins are great she said and smiled he gave her a sideways look hmm she stopped smiling looking away and he dug his hands deeper into his pockets she thought that was the end of information but instead he started speaking again carefully as if explaining something distasteful laurel and i met at med school he said flatly as if he wasnt sure whether he should be saying it but now hed started he wanted to get it over with fast i became a surgeon she was a radiologist and im not even sure why we married now im guessing we were too busy with our careers to look at anyone else we were both hugely ambitiousfast movers in the career stakesand our eventual marriage seemed more an excuse for a party than anything else a party where we asked the right people but suddenly laurel was pregnant not planned she queried gently and he winced of course not planned as far as laurel was concerned it was a disaster she only agreed to continue the pregnancy on the understanding that wed use childcare from day one he hesitated and maybe i agreed with her i was an only child with no concept of babies but thenthen alice and penelope were born and became people she said gently he looked surprised as if he hadnt expected such understanding i fell for them he conceded my girls but the reality of life with twins appalled laurel she hated everything about our new life and she hated what the twins were doing to me she issued an ultimatumthat we get a livein nanny or shed leave that i return to the life we had prekids so i was forced to choose laurel or the twins but of course she knew my response even before she ever issued the ultimatum the girls are justtoo important to abandon to someone elses fulltime care so that was the end of our marriage laurel took off overseas with a neurosurgeon when the twins were six months old and she hasnt been back so much for marriage ouch that almost deserved being up there with other life lessons kirsty thought all the reasons why it was dumb to get involved so what did you do she probed gently i moved to the country he said almost defiantly my career in sydney was highpowered i knew id see little of the twins if i stayed there and i had some romantic notion that life as a country doctor would leave me heaps of time with the kids pull a few hayseeds from ears admire the cows play with my babies it hasnt worked out quite like that huh well no but the problem is that i love it the people are great alice and penelope are loved by the whole community they might not have as much of me as id hoped but they have huge compensations and you do you have compensations now were getting too personal he said stiffening as if shed suddenly propositioned him i dont do personal the only reason im telling you this is because of margie boyce as i said margies a housekeepercumnurse she also acts as my babysitter shes married to ben who was a gardener here before his arthritis got bad ben and angus are old friends what ive suggested to angus in the past is that he has margie and ben stay with him but of course he wont agree he knows margie looks after my girls so id need to find someone else and the thought of margie fussing over him when he wants to die is unbearable but now jake looked thoughtfully over to the two heads discussing pumpkins if we tell angus that a condition of susie staying here is that margie comes out to care for her during the daybringing the girls with him he may well agree she thought that through it sounded ok thatd leave me doing nothing she said slowly thatd leave you working with me he said bluntly and gave her a sheepish smile ive nobly worked it all out to stop you being bored she tried to look indignantand failed she needed to be honest she decided shed been kicking her heels in sydney for the last month waiting to see whether susie went into premature labour and by the end of that time shed been climbing walls dolphin bay was a tiny coastal village and exploration would here be limited shed be bored to snores here too i dont think i can work here she said cautiously dont i need registration and medical insurance and stuff this is classified as a remote community really remote that means the government is grateful for whoever it can get he glanced at his watch its still late afternoon yesterday in the states if you give me a list of your qualifications and a contact number for the hospital youve been working in i can get you accreditation to work right now as in right now you really want me she said awed and he grinned i really want you then he hesitated as a doctor of course she said demurely what else would you mean butto bring everyone here what will angus say to that ill give it to angus as a fait accompli jake told her you intend to work with me he wants susie to stay here but susie cant stay unless margie stays here with her margie cant stay here unless the twins come too and ben as well this place has been like a tomb jake went on his smile disappearing as he tried to make her see how seriously hed really thought this through since deirdre died angus has locked himself away and waited to die as well but he has so much to live for if only he can see it if i can throw open the doors bring in his old friend ben margie to care for him the twins to fill the castle with giggles and playdoughand susie and a new little baby to give him family again dont you think that might equal any antidepressant dr mcmahon for susie as well as angus what do you think he was anxious she thought incredulously he was watching her and there was much more than a trace of anxiety behind the smile he was waiting for her approval he didnt have to wait she thought throwing any remaining caution to the wind she was going into country practice he had her approval in spades chapter four at two that afternoon kirsty was sitting beside jake on her way to her first housecall feeling bulldozed back at the castle were susie angus ben and margie boyce alice penelope and boris maybe they were feeling equally bulldozed but they certainly seemed happy susie and angus had gone reluctantly to have an afternoon nap margie boyce was baking jakes freckled and pigtailed fouryearolds were waiting to lick bowls boris was under the kitchen table waiting for things to drop and ben was having a quiet dig in anguss parsnip patch how long did it take to work all that out kirsty demanded and jake gave a selfsatisfied smile and turned his car onto a dirt track leading away from the town i work fast when i see rewards in front of me pretty good huh pretty fantastic she whispered from the dark and gloomy castle of last night there was now life and laughter and the chaos of a family even if it lasted only a day this was worth it susie had been so bemused this morning shed laughed at least half a dozen times and that was six times more than shed laughed since rory had been killed she thought the twins were great theyd all sat at the kitchen table and eaten cold meat and salad for lunch and susie had hardly seemed to notice that she was eating the twins two chirpy imps with their daddys gorgeous brown curls and eyes that were wide with innocence and mischief hadnt permitted a moments silence and who could be desolate when they were around its excellent jake said and she grinned her agreement but theres no need to get too smug if we come home and boris has dug up the pumpkin patch boris is a dog of intelligence jake said solidly besides its a pumpkin patch now if it was lamb shanks or even strawberries id worry there was a long contented silence it wasnt just susie and angus who were benefiting from this kirsty thought her own mood had lightened about a thousand per cent and maybe some of that was to do with sitting beside jake cameron tell me about the patient youre taking me to see she said hurriedly in an attempt to distract herself from thoughts she had no right to think but she was thinking anyway for a moment she didnt think hed answer maybe he was distracted too she thought hopefully maybe he was thinking cut it out mavis hipton is a sweetheart he said softly and she knew shed been misjudging him his face said all his attention was on his patient and he was worried shes eighty and has terminal cancer uterine cancer with bone metastases like angus she refuses to go into hospital shes better off than angus though in that she has her daughter caring for her barbara is looking after her mother really well so why do you need me to see her she has breakthrough pain i cant keep it under control without making her so drowsy she cant read to her grandchildren i saw her when i left you last night i upped her morphine but i was hoping you might be able to give me a more imaginative solution to the problem i can ring a physician in sydney to get advice but without seeing her hes not much use and he hesitated and and he seems to think sleeping into death is the way to go jake said bleakly im hoping you disagree mavis may have a few months left and if i can give her some quality time with her familywell im damned if ill deprive her of it unless i have to their destination was as far from kirstys manhattan hospice as she could imagine it was a tiny weatherboard shack ramshackle around the edges but with bright gingham curtains in the window hens clucking around what was obviously a welltended garden and a toddler making mud pies on the front step the lady who greeted them was wearing jeans an oversized shirt and big workmans boots she was wiping her hands on a dishcloth as she opened the door and she tossed the cloth aside to seize jakes hands in welcome jake i didnt think youd make it back today i told you i would barbara yeah but you squeezed us in last night and we know how busy you are how did she sleep like a baby barbara told him it was great that you did come she was in so much pain and today barbaras eyes clouded its probably worse than it ought to be she wont take any more of the morphine shell take it tonight she says but not now it makes her drowsy and she says if shes going to sleep all the time then she may as well die right now jake grimaced maybe we can do better than that barbara this is dr mcmahon kirstys a pain specialist from the us i wondered if your mum would mind seeing her mums delighted to see anyone barbara said she motioned to a bigger house along the track thats where my hubby and i live she told kirsty but mum gets lonely and her ovens better than mine ive got scones in the oven right now you go in and see her and by the time you finish ill have the scones ready who needs payment when we have scones jake said lightly bending down to admire the toddlers mud pies kirstys astonishment grew jake cameron was a doctor with heart she decided real heart most of the doctors she knew cared about their patients but theyd not spare the time to stoop to admire a small childs mud pieor to give their patients daughter a swift hug as jake did as he passed barbara to enter the house barbara sounded cheerful but her eyes were strained and bleak kirsty knew from experience that there was often little sleep for the primary caregiver not much sleep and too much heartache maviss bedroom was lovely it was simply furnished with an old double bed on a plain wooden floor a worn rug and a vast patchwork eiderdown that was the centrepiece of the room but it was the window that made it from where the diminutive old lady lay mavis could see out over the veranda she could see her granddaughter making her mud pies she could see the hens scratching among the rose bushes and in the distance shed see the cows ambling lazily up toward the dairy from the clifftops further away who would choose to be ill in hospital when you could be ill here kirsty thought stunned no one but the lady herself was in trouble the look in maviss eyes suggested fear and pain relentless pain kirsty thought shed seen that look so many times acceptance that pain would be with her until the end a bottle of morphine mixture stood on the bedside table any time she wanted she could use this kirsty thought appreciating that jake had ensured mavis could ease her pain whenever she wanted and drift into painless sleep but she was obviously choosing not to sleeping into oblivion had a distinct downside when there was so much life just through this window so youre a pain specialist mavis said as she walked in and kirsty realised she must be tuned in to everything that was said in the outer rooms shed be aching to be a part of the world again hello mrs hipton she said taking the ladys proffered hand it was dry to touchwas she dehydrated im dr mcmahon she hesitated then added call me kirsty that was something shed never do back home the use of first names in her manhattan hospice was frowned on by the powers that be but here it felt right where do you fit in mavis whispered and kirsty saw it was an effort to talk dont tell me you flew in all the way from the states just to give me a consultation kirstys sister was married to rory douglas jake told her and the ladys eyes lit up with interest married to rory anguss rory my sisters visiting angus kirsty told her so i thought id make myself useful while they get to know each other so angus has family again mavis breathed well well isnt that lovely she managed a tight painfilled smile everyone should have family she whispered her sharp intelligent eyes moved from kirsty to jake and back again questioning without words even dr cameron i think twins are enough family for anyone kirsty said lightly ignoring the innuendo mrs hipton call me mavis mavis then kirsty smiled could you bear it if you and drif you and jake gave me a complete history of your pain kirsty listened for a while she didnt comment she waited while jake completed his normal examination she sat while jake talked while he checked a pressure sore on maviss back while he listened while mavis told him about her granddaughters attempt to conquer a tricycle jake was deliberately giving her space to think so she thought i think i may be able to help a little she said at last tentatively that is if you trust me ive checked dr mcmahons credentials jake told mavis before the old lady could respond shes the best she shot him a surprised but gratified look that was a compliment that must have come via her boss back home but hearing it from jake felt good when did you last have morphine she asked about four this morning why not since i didnt need it youre hurting now a lot i can bear it mavis said i thought you get used to it you get addicted to that stuff so its not effective if it gets really bad its bad now jake said gently and mavis flashed him a look of fear im not dying yet that was always the unspoken terror kirsty thought that the pain would get worse and worse and then when you needed it most the drugs wouldnt work no kirsty said softly and she lifted maviss hand and held youre not dying yet but you are in pain you know morphine is an odd drug if you take it to forget your troubles as many addicts do then yes youll become addicted itll lose effectiveness and youll need increasing doses but if you have real painas you havethen it never loses its effect i promise you mavis im thinking youre suffering a lot of unnecessary pain because youre frightened of becoming addicted and because its making you drowsy because of your fears youre not taking the morphine regularly which means youre getting a lot of pain before you take the next dose you reach the stage where the pains unbearable and then you finally take it thats right isnt it i yes she muttered and jake said nothing mavis i promise you that morphine is not addictive if we use it in the right dose for the pain youre having i promise you also that it will stay being effective for as long as you need it what we need to do is to find the right dose the dose is different for everybody because everybodys pain is different you need to start off by taking a prescribed dose of this mixture regularly every four hours slightly less than youre taking nowbut regularly i want you to promise me that youll take this dose regardless after a day or so the sleepiness will ease the dose im prescribing will leave you free to enjoy life itll be regular and itll keep the pain level tolerable if despite this you have breakthrough pain then i want you to take more but i want the background dose to stay constant i want you to call me every day and well gradually increase the background dose until the pain is completely gone completely and it will happen mavis i promise then ill change you over to a really convenient longacting tablet that you can take just twice a day that way well stay one step ahead of the pain and you should rarely need to take the mixture were aiming to get rid of the pain completelynot just aim for good enough were aiming to get you out on the veranda back into the kitchen when youre feeling well enoughnot just watching life through a window but the morphine makes me so drowsy mavis whispered i dont want that i have so little time i cant just sleep drowsiness often happens if you take a little too much occasionally kirsty told her youre waiting so long that you need a big dose to fight the pain and so youll go to sleep what we need to do is give you a little and often drowsiness is much less likely to happen then she smiled and this is only step one if morphine still makes you sleepy well ditch it and try another drug no excuses mavis we need to get rid of this pain completely will you work with me to do that mavis glanced at jake jake was smiling she looked back at kirsty youre staying for a while my sisters expecting a baby in a month im not going anywhere so our dr jake has a partner for a month i guess he does kirsty said and you have a very bossy palliativecare physician if youll have me jake doesnt mind jake doesnt mind jake said solidly from behind them kirsty looks like being a gift horse mavis and im not one for looking gift horses in the mouth me either mavis said soundly welcome to dolphin bay love id very much appreciate it if you could make me more comfortable good kirsty said cheerfully great she beamed at her patient this sort of case was the reason shed decided on her specialty shed missed her work so much and to be useful again was wonderful ill have you bouncing in no time she told mavis but meanwhile you need to answer the question that every palliativecare physician worth her salt asks every patient which is whats happening with your bowels that was fantastic jake turned the car homewards and shot kirsty a look of appraisal that was more than tinged with approval really great we dont know yet whether shell follow instructions shell follow instructions he said bluntly why wouldnt she shes been in so much trouble that she wanted to die as soon as she couldand what i was doing wasnt helping you were keeping her painfree or giving her the choice to be painfree by doping her to the eyeballs his fingers clenched round the steeringwheel so hard they showed white theres so much i dont know in this job he said grimly i barely touch the surface and theres so much more you have this information at your fingertips caring for terminally ill patients is what i do every day of my working life of course i know my stuff but id imagine my general medicine is a whole lot more limited than yours give me a good dose of chickenpox and ill run a mile he grinned at that anyone in their senses would run a mile from a good dose of chickenpox she chuckled this felt good she thought more it felt great she could work with this man she could even enjoy herself for the next month would you be prepared to give an anaesthetic for minor surgery he asked almost as if he was echoing her thoughts about them working together she nodded sure umwhat needs doing i have a middleaged farmer with a hernia whos desperate for an operation he told her francis is almost totally incapacitated by a hernia in his groin but hes scared silly of city hospitals he has it in his head that if he leaves here he wont come back so he puts up with a hernia that makes him an invalid for nothing with a competent anaesthetist i could fix it in my sleep if youre here you may as well make use of me huh thats what i intend silence contented silence jake flicked the radio on and something soft and happy drifted over the airways on kirstys left was the sea glistening sapphire broken only by a battered blue fishing boat chugging ponderously back to harbour this is heaven she whispered and jake glanced at her with a strange look as you say it really would be a fantastic place to bring up kids thats why im here she hesitated they were nearing the castle now and the car was slowing what do you intend doing now this afternoon yes dropping you at the castle collecting the boyces the twins and boris and taking them all home he said promptly but you have more work to do yes but youll be back at the castle to take care of angus and susie so therell be no need for margie to stay margie will take care of everyone back at the hospital residence you live in the hospital residence yes would you like to leave everyone at the castle for the rest of the afternoon she said impulsively thinking of the pile of food shed seen in anguss freezer come back when youve finished work for the day and ill cook you all dinner his face stilled no he said brusquely thank you she stared his tone had changed so dramatically that she was reminded of their first conversation when hed thought she and susie were here after money what have i said wrong nothing wouldnt you like to have dinner with mwith us there was a moments hesitation kirsty i may as well say this straight out he said bluntly it might sound dumb to state this so early but i dont want you getting the wrong idea i dont have relationships with women my twins need all my attention and i cant mess them around silence more silence her jaw seemed to hit her ankles lower as a statement it was as effective as a wash of cold water seemingly just as shocking you dont have relationships with women kirsty said at last carefully as if not trusting her voice she didnt trust her voice the twins and i manage very well by ourselves he told her ive made a resolution not to mess with their lives by getting involved im a dad first and foremost then im doctor to this district my sex life comes a sad last her jaw dropped a bit more count to ten she told herself fiercely one two she didnt make it you dont have relationships with women she repeated and hed be a dope if he hadnt heard the anger surging in her voice theyd arrived at the castle gates hed drawn to a halt and hit the remote that had the gates swing open but he had to stop while they opened what exactly do you mean by relationships she asked you know i dont know she snarled ive been working with you for the last hour does that define a relationship no i ive been talking to you ive been daring to impose on your personal space by making you talk back you even smiled a couple of times does that constitute a relationship you know very well what i mean he looked flustered she thought good so youre scared of coming to dinner with me and my sister and angus and the twins and the boyces and boris youre scared because thatll cause what you call a relationship youre terrified that halfway through pudding ill jump over the dining table and rip your clothes off dont be melodramatic she flung at him of course i wont be melodramatic dont you think its you whos being just the faintest bit melodramatic deciding that a casual invitation to you means im after your body and dont you think that youre being just the tiniest bit insulting you know nothing about me dr cameron for all you know i may have a husband and six kids back home in manhattan and here you are suggesting that not only am i propositioning you but im betraying mymy darling husbands trust not to mention all the little rugrats that my husband is caring for while i cart my sister halfway around the world are you married he asked startled at her notsocoherent outburst but she was already out of the car thats none of your business she snapped oh it might be if i was propositioning you but believe it or not incredible as it might seem im not propositioning you at all so you can take your dinner invitation and shove it dr cameron we do not have a relationship no relationship nix kirsty what it was practically a snarl will you still do the hernia with me tomorrow morning no apology then did he really think she was making a pass at him of all the swallow your anger she told herself frantically she was stuck here and she really wanted to do some medicine shed been bored for a month in sydney she didnt want to be bored here swallow your pride we can do your hernia if we stand at separate ends of the table and have an interpreter in the middle she muttered after all we cant talk if we dont have a relationship and youre setting the rules no relationship kirsty im sorry finally an apology she thoughtbut not a very good one so am i she snapped because we might just have had a very nice dinner tonight all of us it might just have been what everyone needed and we might just have had a decent working relationship but its not going to happen she slammed the car door hard she stomped into the castle forecourt she could hear voiceslaughtercoming from the kitchen gardens but she wasnt stopping to investigate she disappeared fast to her bedroom she slammed the door and she didnt emerge until she heard jakes car disappear down the road hed gone taking his encumbrances with him good had he been stupid jake worked for the rest of the day with a sense that hed been an idiot a huge idiot a dinner invitation extended to all his family and hangerson and hed reacted as kirsty had saidas if shed launched herself at him with the intention of ripping his clothes off so he had overreacted just a tad just a little but in a sense he knew he hadnt evening surgery was boring coughs colds requests for repeat prescriptions mrs bakersons evertroublesome knee which responded only to fifteen minutes listening to how much trouble her kids werethere was nothing there to distract him from what he was thinking about he was thinking of kirsty she was gorgeous she mightnt be thinking about relationships he thought ruefully but he definitely was he just had to look at herlisten to herwatch the gentle way she interacted with angus and with mavisand he wanted to take this further but she was married no she wasnt married shed just thrown that into the ring to make him feel even more stupid about his repudiation of her dinner invitation it hadnt been a stupid repudiation she was a lovely vibrant doctor with the world at her feet she was building her career in manhattan shed see her sister safely delivered and then the two of them would be off back to their life in the states leaving him can you look at my big toe while im here connie bakerson was asking the toenails cutting in you reckon i need an operation he examined connies big toe with all seriousness diagnosis was easy that was one of the good things about being a country doctor he got the whole picture despite her troublesome knee connie and her husband spent every spare minute indulging their passion for line dancing hed noticed the appalling stiletto cowboy boots she wore and hed expected trouble ever since but he was still thinking about kirsty if he let himself fall in love how could he there was no future in loving anyone except his twins his girls were totally dependent on him and he had little enough time for them now if he spent the next few weeks falling in love with kirsty and then she left maybe he was being dumb but he saw nothing down that road except heartache youre not very chatty connie commented and he hauled himself to attention with an effort im sorry youll be thinking of those young ladies out at the castle connie said with sudden perspicacity isnt it great that theyre here everyones talking about it one of them pregnant with our anguss greatnephew and the other a doctor what a combination she tugged her sock onto her foot and beamed wouldnt it be great if they stayed great for angus great for you why great for me well one of them being a doctor of course connie said astonished i hear shes already been out on a housecall with you and the locals are saying shes lovely of course jake thought bitterly this was a tiny community news travelled fast all the more reason not to think about kirsty if he so much as touched her the news would be all over the district in minutes hey maybe shes eligible connie said beaming some more i hear shes really pretty both of them are lookers theyre saying but the first poor lass has been battered knocked about in the car crash when her husband was killed poor girl but harriet in the post office says the doctor one is a real stunner she raised her eyebrows in enquiry so how about it doc youve been single for far too long those poor wee mites need a mother he was absolutely right in the way hed reacted to kirstys invitation jake thought grimly as he managed a smile and showed connie resolutely to the door kirsty thought he was inferring too much from one dinner invitation she didnt know this town they just had to see an eligible female and they started planning the wedding he just might nip this in the bud i hear shes married he said with something approaching malicious enjoyment with six kids six kids she said astonished no one told me that the village gossip network is letting you down but she told me herself shes taken time off to care for her sister but back home she has a poor downtrodden husband changing diaper after diaper youre having me on she told me herself he said virtuous and sure well connie pulled herself up figuring out whether to be indignant or not and deciding a little indignation was justified gallivanting over here when she has all those kiddies awful isnt it she must be real worried about her sister maybe shes just tired of diapers we wont judge her connie said resolutely we need to know more your margie was out there this morning wasnt she she was i might just pop in to see margie on the way home you do that jake said and suddenly he felt tired see if you can find any more skeletons in the closet oh and connie mmm no dancing for a week but some things im sure about jake said not many mind but this is one of them sore knee sore big toe i prescribe new boots and rest i cant rest not when there was gossip to be gleaned jake thought watching through the window as she marched up the hill to visit margie with nary a limp if ever he was going to have a relationshiphow could he have it under the eyes of everyone in this town he wasnt having a relationship end of story move on to the next patient kirsty woke the next morning to the sound of her sister whistling unable to believe her ears she crossed to the window and looked outside the change in her two patients was extraordinary susie was dressed and lying on a camping mattress theyd found yesterday theyd cleaned it so susie could lie on it while she gardened the last of the rain had cleared the day was already warm susie had a trowel in her hand and she was digging around individual carrots kirsty glanced up to anguss window and angus was perched in the windowseat overseeing operations youll do yourself damage girl he called wait until i get down to give you a hand she was being put to shame by two invalids kirsty thought angus needed help dressing and he needed his oxygen checked and he was waiting for her two people who thirtysix hours ago had wanted to die were now both aching for the day to begin was she aching for her day to begin maybe she was she was going to help jake operate this morning she remembered but excitement wasnt exactly her overriding emotion maybe there was also a tinge of fear why fear was she fearful of the way she responded jake had let her know in no uncertain terms that he wanted nothing of that response she needed to ring robert she decided robert her nice safe boyfriend back home he was an optometrist shed known for ever and their romance had been proceeding placidlyif tamelywhen shed had to leave with susie she hadnt rung robert for a week it was time to get in touch with him again maybe hed be surprised to hear from her their relationship was lacklustre at the best of times and she suspected a months absence was probably killing it for good but she needed to ground herself somewhere and robert was eternally useful right shed ring robert after shed telephoned mavis hipton to see how shed got on in the night after shed organised angus down to his garden after shed bullied susie and angus into eating breakfast but maybe the bullying wouldnt be because they werent interested in eating she thought suddenly it would be bullying because theyd be too busy to eat suddenly susie and angus were excited by life again she needed to get excited too she was going to operate with jake she was excited there was no relationship she told herself crossly nobut she was still excited chapter five dolphin bay bush nursing hospital was a neat little building made of the deep grey stone of the local cliffs it had wide verandas and a lovely rambling garden and as she pulled into the parking lot she could see half a dozen people pottering in the flowerbeds there were glimpses of the sea through the tangle of honeysuckle and bougainvillea and a flock of white galahs was screeching and fighting for places on the branches of the towering gums she should transplant this place to manhattan she thought longingly what a wonderful place to die what a wonderful place to live they all knew who she was the moment she climbed out of the car she was watched by the gardeners and by the patients sitting in the sun on the veranda and a chirpy young nurse bustled out to greet her youll be dr kirsty im babs weve been waiting for you dr kirsty babs this was as formal as it got in dolphin bay kirsty thought wryly but she grinned dr cam dr jake said to be here at ten yes but francis is in such a state that if we dont knock him out soon hell do a runner babs told her she ushered her inside and flung open the theatre doors its ok jake kirstys here jake was already in theatre gear he was systematically checking equipment but as kirsty walked in he turned and smiled and her heart did that crazy backflip she was starting to recognise and starting to resent darn why didnt she get that backflip when robert smiled this man didnt want a relationship not youve been waiting for me she managed we have the worlds scaredest patient he told her francis is sixty years old until his hernia got bad he was our local fire chief put him in front of wildfire and hell be the coolest head in the district but show him a drop of blood and hell faint hes still in his room i thought if we wheeled him along here and he caught sight of theatre gear he might end up dying of shock ill check him there then shall i she asked and he smiled again if you would is there anything else here that you need she did a fast check this should be a simple procedurea simple anaesthetic even catering for terror the little theatre looked brilliant how many beds does the hospital have she asked in surprise twenty plus ten nursinghome beds thats too many for one doctor youre telling me i have to work hard to keep them healthy jake makes his patients work in the garden babs said cheekily from the doorway he has a method of bowel control thats second to none you stay regular or you get garden duty youre kidding he gives out garden duty for everything babs continued you just sigh in this place and someone sticks a trowel in your hand dont the patients object they love it jake said attempting a glower at the nurse babs go introduce kirsty to francis i want him back here asleep in ten minutes thats if my checks are ok kirsty said attempting to find some vestige of authority they will be babs said otherwise youll be handed a trowel as well our dr jake runs a tight ship there was no need for the trowel francis was a big man but hed kept himself fit he didnt smoke and he had no underlying medical conditions to give her concern the only problem was his terror which was palpable the moment she entered the room hi im dr kirsty your anaesthetist im here to make you relax enough for jake to fix your bump then she hesitated the man was physically cringing am i so scary nno but does your wife ever get her hair set at the hairdresser does she ever sit under a dryer sure he whispered not knowing where this was going well i dont want to scare you any more than you already are but your wife has more chance of getting electrocuted under the dryer than you do of getting damaged by my anaesthetic but dr jakes telling me youre scared im notits not its not logical she said smiling and lifting his wrist ostensibly to feel his pulse but in reality to give him the comfort of touch i know like im scared of moths i cant stand them they make my hair stand on end but if i had to face them in order to fix my life you would actually i wouldnt she conceded with a rueful smile not without a lot of screaming and running and general loss of dignity what i might do thoughif i had to face themis ask a nice doctor to give me something to make me sleepy and dreamy and away with the fairies so that any moth could go bump into me and id simply wave and smile that drew a reluctant smile youre saying you could give me something like that ooh the very nicest of drugs she told him guaranteed to make you smile and wave till the cows come home till the cows come home he said dazed i thought you were from new york im learning the local lingo she said with a certain amount of pride australian country talk i can talk about mates and blokes and anything to do with a heap of dung you care to mention i think i have an ear for languages now im staying with angus its australian with a scottish accent so will you let me give you my hallucinogenic substance he seemed even more dazed terror had receded in the face of her ridiculousness itll make me go to sleep he managed but he didnt sound as if it was a dreadful idea no she told him not my dream stuff itll simply make you relax then if its ok with youand only if its ok with youwe can take the next step and give you something so you have a swift sleep while dr jake fixes your bump if you dont feel relaxed then you can back out but you do want your hernia fixed right right he whispered you really do yyes well done she told him releasing his wrist and touching the back of his weathered hand lightly with her own theres courage and theres courage my moths and your anaesthetic you want to start now y maybe then lets do step one she told him you close your eyes while babs holds your hand youll feel one tiny prick then well see if my fairy dust works we can take it from there she administered the propofol then stood and chatted some more watching as his eyes became confusedbut not terrified at all she was even making him smile next step she asked and got a sleepy fuzzy nod for her pains hooray she needed to let jake know they were due to start she heard a faint movement in the doorway and turned expecting to see an orderly but it was jake he was looking at her with blatant admiration how long had he been here she felt a blush starting at her toes and working its way up this man had the power to seriously unsettle her he was almost as unsettling as moths youre good he told her and she struggled for composurestruggled to give him her very smuggest smile i know she told him francis and i are developing a very nice relationship arent you sorry youre not into relationships yourself she shouldnt have said it the operation was done in almost total silence the atmosphere was so tense it was almost unbearable not only did he not want to take their relationship any further shed killed any friendship they might have been starting to build which was a shame she very much wanted to keep working with him she decided as she watched his fingers perform the delicate piece of surgery to relieve francis of his hernia it wasnt a particularly difficult operation but his fingers were swift and sure he was meticulous in everything he did francis would be left with minimal scarring and a superfast recovery because of it he was a seriously good surgeon she thought he was wasted in dolphin bay and then she thought no he wasnt wasted in dolphin bay a place like this was lucky to have him susie would be blessed to have him if she got into trouble at delivery if every country town could have a doctor as good as jake blood pressure jake snapped and she told him aware that shed been watching him for a moment and this was a ruse to make her look at her dials instead of looking at him she flushed there was no need to remind her to do her job he might be a good surgeon but she knew enough about anaesthesia for her attention never to stray away for more than a second or two at a time franciss anaesthetic was the lightest she could give she had him intubated but his vital signs were steady his colour was great and every indication was that this surgery would cause him minimal discomfort reverse jake snapped she raised an eyebrow say please she said mildly and babs choked jake glared what say pleasesir kirsty politeness is everything we may as well start the way we mean to go on please he said goaded and she smiled thats better she approved she turned to babs hes very autocratic for a surgeon isnt he i thought you had to be at least an orthodontist before you let go of the please can we concentrate on whats important jake snapped and she very nearly said say please again then she glanced at his face and saw the lines of strain around his eyes and thought better of it whatever was eating him she wasnt going to break through with laughter she probably wasnt going to break through at all is it over francis surfaced terrified his eyes wild and frantic jake was hauling his gloves off and kirsty leaned over took franciss hands in hers and held hard its done youve conquered your fear youre awake jakes fixed your hernia your wife is waiting to see you and all you have to show is a threeinch square dressing on your tummy six stitches when you wake up a bit more you can have a look its done it is the operation is completely finished all thats left is my fairy dust making you a bit sleepy if i were you id settle back for a nice long nap he searched her eyes hope warring with fear dreading that she might not be telling the truth but then jake was behind her gripping her shoulder presenting them as a team shes right mate youre a new man thanks to our dr kirsty shes a ripper francis whispered a real ripper not a particularly respectful ripper jake said steadily but a ripper for all that francis closed his eyes jake stepped back releasing kirsty the orderly moved in to wheel the trolley back out into the corridor jake moved into the washroom but kirsty stood still for a while longer until the sensation of fingers pressing against her shoulder was completely gone he had a list the hernia had been a test she realised by the time shed got rid of her hospital gown jake was waiting for her and he handed her a slip of paper dorothy miller veins mark glaston basal cell carcinoma scotty anderson osteochondroma whats this she asked cautiously she was in the corridor outside theatre maybe they could have gone somewhere else to talk jake must have an office she thought but maybe showing her into an office might get her alone that might constitute a relationship look im sorry he said sounding exasperated and she knew she didnt have to say it out loud for him to know what she was thinking i overreacted yesterday you did so dont rub it in tell me about the list she said coolly and there was a moments hesitation while he considered whether to take her antagonism further but he obviouslyand wiselydecided against it dorothy miller has the most appalling varicose veins he told her one burst last month and it came close to killing her shes eighty and she wont go to the city to get them fixed she says if she dies she dies but id prefer her not to mark has a basal cell carcinoma on his face thats been incompletely excised he needs a fullthickness excision and a skin graft its a simple job but marks wife is blind they have two small children and for him to leave for a night is a major drama i told him hed have to find a way and he agreed but now youre here ill do it myself now that ive proved myself competent she said dryly and he had the grace to smile as you say and the osteochondroma bony growths where they shouldnt be were a common childhood problem so it was no surprise when he said scotty is four years old the osteochondroma is on his leg i biopsied it and its fine but its growing scottys mother is a single mum with three other littlies dependent on her itd be a heck of a lot easier if we did it here so you really do need me she said cheering up and he looked a bit shamefaced umyes there was another momentary hesitation what you did with mavis ive been out there this morning and she tells me youve already phoned and adjusted the dose but already the change is miraculous and hereall these things can wait but as youre here and not busy you may as well use me she agreed she paused and then decided to push it you know you really do need to learn to chat to me though she told him im not accustomed to silence maybe we can get piped music in theatre or piped gossip thats what im used to back home his face stayed expressionless silence makes for concentration sure and you need to concentrate really hard on a hernia op its nailbiting lifeanddeath drama youre being silly you dont think its you whos being silly am i he demanded kirsty leave it but the look on his face was making her angry all over again it was like he was afraid of her as if he was wary that shed push him into something he didnt want i dont want this he added and she glowered dont dont what dont you push this any further she warned if youre about to say something about me feeling what youre feeling and its not wise or that youre instinctively realising that i want your body but you dont want me or really youd love to make mad passionate love to me but youre a closet gay there was the sound of choking and babs was goggleeyed behind them the nurse had her hand to her mouth as if shed tried to keep herself silent but failed just as well kirsty thought she was way out of line she collected herself sort of just for a moment there shed almost been enjoying herself hauling the selfcontained dr jake cameron right out of his comfort zone dont mind me she managed turning and smiling at babs im an american were known for being forward if not downright ridiculous she turned back to jake but of course ill do your list dr cameron any time anywhere but not now as im off home to our castle to check on angus and susie she took another deep breath and almost recovered dont fret that you were eavesdropping she said finally to babs what you heardvery clearlywas me not propositioning your dr jake what was it with the man all the way home she fumed trying to figure out what her hormones were doing to her why was she feeling like this jake wasnt the only one who didnt do relationships kirsty had no intention of letting herself go down that route shed learned early when kirsty and susie had been ten their mother had died unexpectedly and tragically of a subarachnoid haemorrhage theyd all been devastatedof coursebut their father had been passionately in love with his wife and hed never recovered two years after his wife had died taylor mcmahon had taken his own life leaving his little girls to a succession of fosterhomes love must be appalling to do that to you kirsty had reasoned and shed decided then and there that shed never let herself feel that way about anyone but susie when susie had met roryfor a little while kirsty had let herself start believing again in happyeverafter only then rory had died of course the whole appalling cycle had started againtrying to drag someone you loved back from the brink it wasnt going to happen to her she dated nice safe men who left her emotionally free that was the way of survival nice safe robert if jake thought shed threaten that by falling for him he had to be joking so cut it out she told herself quit it with the hormones the man is seriously threatening to your peace of mind as well as that hes seriously committed to his twins and youre not the least bit interested in playing mom even if he was interested even if youre interested which youre not a readymade family would be the pits she pulled into the castle forecourt and jakes two little girls came racing out the front door to meet her there goes that argument she thought bitterly as they tugged open her car door these two buttons were seriously cute we saw you coming from upstairs alice announcedor was it penelope they were identically dressed in miniature jeans and grubby windcheaters their shoes were caked with mud and their curls were escaping from the crimson ribbons at the ends of their pigtails angus went for a nap and susie said we had to go up and tell him that spikes measurement is a whole halfinch wider than yesterday mr boyce says spikes going to be ginormous and boris got paw marks all over anguss bed when we let him in her twin announced big with importance in the telling of such a tale margie growled and then she saw our muddy shoes she told us we were rascals and we had to hop itbut angus says he likes rascals then we saw your car so we thought we might hop it anyway so we hopped all the way down the stairs the other twin explained again grinning a hugely appealing gaptoothed grin the stairs here are beeyootiful penelope can hop three stairs at a time and i nearly can but not all the time you need practice kirsty said smiling as she climbed out of the car she looked behind the twins to where susie was balancing on crutches in the doorway her twin was smiling and kirsty had a sudden vision of how her own twin had looked when she had been this age they must have both looked like this she thought happy bubbly little girls with not a care between them susies smile was like that now she thought in surprise it was an echo of the past when as twins theyd done their own hopping before life had got in the way and theyd realised the damage love could cause but susies smile had been resurrected by this place by angus and by jake and by these two little girls dont you dare let your hormones mess with this she told herself fiercely start acting professionally with dr cameron margie says as soon as you come back we have to go home one of the twins was saying they grabbed a hand each and started tugging her toward the door but you have to see spike first we want to show you ourselves hes humungous and susie said hes getting humungouser humungouser she said faintly and from the doorway susie giggled it was a great sound kirsty thought it had been so long since susie had giggled regularly hes a wonderful pumpkin she managed trying not to sound choked up please can we stay for lunch a twin was begging well ring daddy and tell him we have to mr boyce is out minding spike and margie says hes as happy as a pig in mud and we can stay for lunch as long as you say its ok and so does daddy what do you think kirsty asked her twin when she could get a word in edgeways and susies smile broadened i think these kids are great i think this place is great kirsty told her did you have fun with jake this morning kirsty eyed her twin with caution the problem with being a twin was that you were known too well we did a very satisfactory operation thats nice susie said demurely kirsty thought yep shed been sussed but can we stay the twins said plaintively you ring jake and ask if the girls can stay for lunch she told susie you dont want to dr cameron and i have whats becoming a very cool relationship she retorted so dont get any ideas me susie asked starting forward on her crutches with an ease that kirsty found extraordinary when have i ever oh by the way robert called he said to say he was sorry he missed you this morning hes going out of town for the weekend but he might find time to ring you on monday now that she told the little girls as they tugged kirsty forward to join her sister thats what a really passionate relationship ought to be susie kirsty said warningly and that delicious chuckle sounded out again i know im sticking my nose in where its not wanted but im enjoying myself and oh kirsty it feels so good the twins and the boyces were permitted to stay jake sounded really reluctant susie reported after phoning he kept saying he didnt want the twins to be any trouble but how can they be when margie and ben are here margie is lovely and she says shed much rather babysit here than back in the village it was hard to figure out who was babysitting who kirsty thought as the afternoon wore on after lunch by common consensus they returned to the vegetable patch to superintend spikes growth spurt angus and ben perched on a garden bench in the sun and discussed the merits of different varieties of pumpkin susie lay on her mattress alternatively dozing and supervising alice and penelope making mud pies margie sat herself down on a rocker on the porch knitting and listening to her favourite radio show we look like the brady bunch kirsty thought suddenly all contentment and calm who knew what was seething underneath she grinned at herself and her twin saw the grin and demanded an explanation domesticity plus she said and susie gave a sleepy smile jake should be here its sad that he spends so little time with his girls you should help him more while youre here kirsty so he can be free im doing my best she said stiffly the doorbell rang or as kirsty had now learned the bell on the intercom connected to the gate rang were not home susie said with a yawn this is perfect we dont need anyone else they didnt but it might be jake he did have a right to be here and maybemaybe he could stay for a while kirsty thought then she gave herself a harsh mental slap for the thought but she did get up to go and open the gate professional relationship she told herself firmly as she walked out to the castle entrance but before she got there she realised shed made a mistake it wouldnt be jake he had a key and his own remote controller for the gates but she was already at the entrance she might as well see who it wasnt an insurance salesman she opened the door and it was a man who looked like rory rory she saidblanklyunable to believe her eyes but of course she had to be mistaken susies husband had been dead for six months and when she looked closer this man was different he had a slighter build different hair colour different features different but the same im kenneth douglas he told her and all was explained rorys brother was kenneth kirsty had never seen him susie had met him once just before rory had been killed and shed reported that he was a creep but he was here he was rorys brother hi she said holding out her hand in greeting im susies sister kirsty susie he said blankly rorys wife susie his face froze rorys wife is here yes she has no right angus seems to think shes very welcome kirsty told him struggling to keep her smile in place she hesitated not wanting this man to interrupt their lovely afternoon but knowing that he was anguss nephew knowing that he was rorys brother she had no grounds for denying him entrance were all in the vegetable garden she told him do you want me to take you through whos in the vegetable garden your uncle angus isnt here it was an appalled hiss hes in a nursing home he was moving there yesterday hes dying grief and fear did odd things to people kirsty knew she wasnt tempted to react to this with anger i dont think he is dying she said gently weve persuaded him that oxygen will help and its been wonderful hes back gardening the doctor said he was going into a nursing home now were here he doesnt have to leave he can stay for as long as he wants we the man said and there was no doubting that his overriding emotion was anger whos we my sister and i your sister has no right he hissed again who the hell does she think she is i thought she was too badly injured to travel i thought she was done with she wanted to slam the door in his face at that but it was too late he was through look mr douglas i want to see her he said and he was striding toward the vegetable garden so fast she practically had to run to keep up if shes messing with the old mans treatmentif she thinks theres anything here for her rorys dead and im the only one who has any say in how the old man is treated me im sorry but hed reached the side gate and he hauled it open while she struggled to think how to deflect him there was no way hed hauled open the gate and was staring through at the scene of domesticity in front of him angus and ben discussing pumpkins alice and penelope turning their skills from mud pies to mud sausagesarguing over whose was the longest margie knitting and susie rising on one elbow to see who it was susie recognising kenneths face and trying falteringly to smile a welcome susie pushing herself into a sitting position hampered by her weakness and her advanced pregnancy kenneth she whispered kirsty glanced again at rorys brother and got a shock every vestige of colour had drained from his face if she hadnt reached forward fast and supported him he would have fallen he slumped and she had to assist him to sit on the low stone wall by the gate he put his head in his hands and she could see him visibly brace stiffen look up youre pregnant he said in a voice of loathing of fury and of pure shock youre pregnant with rorys child chapter six for a moment no one spoke the twins stared openmouthed mrs boyces knitting needles stilled and angus sat back on his heels and gazed at his nephew like he was seeing a ghost kenneth there was lingering affection in his voice kirsty thought once hed loved this man as a boy youre supposed to be dead kenneth snarled and any hint of affection any trace of warmth in the sunfilled afternoon was gone im not angus said warily putting a hand on his oxygen cylinder as if assuring himself it was still available i rang that bloody doctor last week and he said you were going into a home yesterday and you were dying i said if no one cared enough to come then hed die kirsty hadnt noticed jakes arrival but he was suddenly right behind him he must have driven though the gates after kenneths arrival and she had been so caught up that she hadnt heard now kenneth rose his colour flooding back you he said and his fury seemed to be escalating by the moment redirecting itself to jake you lied kenneth take care jake said warningly theres no need for you to think people here are against you would you like to meet my twins he was trying to defuse the situation kirsty realised she looked at the fury on kenneths face and thought this had to be some sort of mental illness surely such anger couldnt be justified but kenneth was whirling again to stare at susie shes pregnant he whispered pregnant susies pregnant with rorys baby yes jake said evenly we all think thats great and shell inherit he choked and kirsty realised hed gone past logic shell inherit from rory rorys dead ken jake said evenly susie wont inherit anything from anyone the b get out of my garden it was angus he was as pale as the night theyd arrived but he had himself under control he held on to his oxygen cylinder as if he needed its support but when he spoke his voice was completely steady if you insult rorys wife youre not welcome in my home its not your home you should be dead jake angus said tiredly and jake gave an almost imperceptible nod ken lets go he said softly he took kenneths arm and when ken triedviolentlyto wrench away his hold tightened youre not welcome here mate he said softly you know you cant speak to people like this and stay welcome he propelled him around facing away from the others in the garden come with me he said softly something tells me youve been skipping medication i can help you if youll come with me come back and talk to your uncle when youre feeling calmer dont touch me he wrenched with even more fury and because he was hauling backward toward the gate jake let him go then suddenly he smashed forward again but jake must have been expecting it as ken blundered past he caught his arm twisted held he had him locked against him his arms up behind his back ken were going to the hospital mate he said softly i dont need you need help despite the violence shocking in such a peaceful setting jake was speaking as if nothing untoward had happened you know youre supposed to be on medication you told me last time carbamazepine shes pregnant its mine kirsty could you help me take ken to the hospital jake asked he smiled across at his little girls standing openmouthed and frightened guys mr douglas is ill his heads hurting and its making him say things he doesnt mean dr kirsty and i will take him away and make him feel better margie and mr boyce and susie and angus will stay and look after you is that ok they stared a bit more but they almost visibly relaxed in the face of their fathers normal tone ok penelope whisperedor was it alice thats great ken seemed to have slumped against jake suddenly passive he glanced across at kirsty you want to drive or sit in the back with our passenger i think ill drive she said faintly if its ok with you the drive back to the hospital was made in grim silence ken didnt appear to object which made kirsty wonder how often these sort of outbursts had happened in the past he seemed almost resigned at the hospital jake administered a small dose of chlorpromazine and organised a hospital bed and then he sat with ken as he drifted into sleep kirsty could have disappeared then but she didnt she needed to know about this mans anger she decided the way hed reacted to susie had been terrifying so she made herself a coffee at the nurses station and waited for jake to reappear he finally emerged looking grim when he saw her he seemed to make an effort to make his face relax i thought youd have gone home im driving your car she reminded him that would have left you stuck there are hospital cars or one of the locals would have driven me back i wanted to know about ken he hates susie why ken hates the world jake said bluntly he started making himself a coffee talking to her as if he was thinking aloud ken was born with a personality disorder that makes him think the worlds against him angus tells me that having him here as a child was a nightmarehe was so jealous of rory that he made life unbearable angus saw little of him over the last few years but lately hes been badgering me about anguss health i figure he thinks angus is going to die soon and hell inherit todays behaviour confirmed that but his behaviour is way out of normal bounds hes seriously ill what can you do about it im not sure he told her his behaviour today was so bizarre that in the old days id have had him committed not so easy today huh id imagine itd be just the same in the states as it is here he told her evidence of gross psychiatric disturbance and the sworn statements of two psychiatrists that he forms a risk what i should have done was let him slug someone today then i could have got him arrested but the nearest person was me and im not all that into being slugged for the greater good i dont blame you she hesitated what now i can hold him here overnight he told her ive probably gone further than wise in giving him a dose of chlorpromazine thatll knock him out he could probably sue as he didnt agree to it but im hoping that a solid sleep will leave him calmer ill make an urgent call to the state psychiatric database people and see if i can find someone who knows him then ill try and get him on some sort of calming medication but he doesnt have to agree to it and maybe once hes had a sleep and is back to being logical he wont want it is he functioning you mean does he make a habit of verging on violence for no reason no angus has talked about him to me hes suffered from uncontrollable rage from childhood but hes somehow kept it under limits enough for him to function hes a qualified accountant working in sydney hes had two brief failed marriages so he must seem normal most of the time but not today she saidand shivered no jake looked at her like he was looking straight through her seeing the problems on the other side maybe he saw the ramifications of susies baby more clearly than either angus or susie have seen it yet theyre so delighted to find each other that they havent seen whats obvious which is angus is an exceedingly wealthy man jake said gently although he downplays it he has a title many people would give their eye teeth for he also has entailed property back in scotland loganaich is a major seat and angus has a rent roll that would make your head spin angus told me once that hed never wanted it but its entailed in such a way he couldnt avoid inheriting he said rory felt the same angus was devastated when rory died because the next in line is kenneth she breathed oh no maybe not kenneth any more he said sombrely maybe susies baby kirstys breath sucked in as the repercussions sank home so today for the last few monthssince rorys deathkenneth must have believed that hell be the next earl of loganaich with all the wealth and privilege that entails today he saw susies pregnancy and he realised his calculations were wrong i watched his face he looked angry when he saw that angus was using oxygenthat therell be a delay before he inherits but when he realised susie was pregnant he almost passed out she wont want wealth kirsty whispered shed never want it i figured that jake said gently finally you just have to know you kirsty to know what a loving giving person susie must be dont she said distressfully you know nothing about us rory and ken were brothers and theyre so different kenneths ill youre not ill he said softly kirsty leave it jake she said harshly the hospital corridor was deserted and she felt suddenly exposed how could he say such things to her and not mean not mean anything she didnt want him to mean anything so what do we do about kenneth she asked louder than shed intended and she flushed i mean theres not a lot we can do he said his eyes still thoughtful but he wasnt thinking about kenneth she thought suddenly and her flush deepened as i said ill try and find a psychiatrist who knows him and get some advice ill try and arrange transport to one of the better psychiatric institutions we can only hope that when he wakes up hes come to terms with the new order he never thought hed inherit before she said struggling to move past her emotions not until rory died so we hold to that maybe itll be fine how can it be anything but fine thats right he said but he looked worried as he glanced at his watch i might get the boyces and the kids to stay on at the castle for the rest of the day he went on slowly itll take everyones mind off whats happened and and itll provide more security for angus and susie it will he said gravely and then he paused for a moment and kept on thinking you know the castle is very big theres lots of bedrooms youre thinking of filling them it might be fun for the boyces and the twins he told her not to mention susie and angus ill phone angus and run it past him maybe ill say itll make you free to help me if the twins stay there ill stay there too he said just until i know kenneths out of the district he hesitated and then confessed he makes me nervous me too and we should be able to keep our hands off each other for a few days she stiffened what on earth was he playing at i dont know about your hands but my hands havent got the slightest inclination to wander your way she snapped unless its to give you a good swipe across the ears of all the arrogant egotistical statements you do feel it too get lost she retorted the emotions of the afternoon venting themselves in anger take your rotten feelings and play with them somewhere else i have no idea what youre talking about and she turned and stalked out of the hospital with her nose in the air how will you get home he called after her ill walk wait a few minutes and ill drive you i wouldnt trust myself she managed without pausing you and me in a car with all that molten passion wed be a road safety risk jake cameron im not coming near you again until you have your passion safely in a glass jar in a locked cabinet and me im taking my molten whatever for a good long walk she stalked outpast the unsuspecting babs who was just coming in molten passion babs asked am i missing something we both are kirsty told her with a tired smile dr cameron and i have just admitted a patient with psychiatric disturbances but if i were you id be worrying about whos treating who as far as psychiatric disturbances go it might be a case of physician heal thyself and she left with babs staring after her she didnt know whether jake was staring after her she didnt trust herself to look back and find out it was a long walk but she needed it by the time she reached home she was only just nearing a state where she could think with anything approaching calm and that was only when she very carefully made herself think of anything other than jake cameron she walked into the forecourt and swung the gate closed behind her home she thought and then gave a wry grin two days ago could she ever have imagined herself thinking of this crazy place as home but she made her way to the bathroom and greeted queen victoria almost like a friend itd be ok kenneth might be threatening but this place was built like a fortress after all you and me will keep them safe she told queen v we dont need any jake cameron she got a disapproving look for her pains victoria had had her albert and then her mr brown was she egging kirsty on toward the involvement shed always forsworn i dont need anyone kirsty declared more than a little selfconsciously and went to find the rest of the castle inhabitants she might not need anyone but a little company would be nice if only to stop her talking to dead monarchs in the end it was harder to find someone to talk to than shed thought angus and susie and the twins were all asleep finally she tracked down margie who was peeling potatoes in the kitchen while ben supervised it seems youre stuck with us dear margie said welcoming her with a wave of a floury hand as kirsty entered i hope you dont mind but i thought id make pasties for dinner jakes talked to you dr jakes talked to his lordship and hes talked to us we all think its a fine idea dont we ben ben a wisp of a man whod practically disappeared in the fireside chair nodded emphatically kenneth is a worry to us all he said gravely angus is very upset it took his mind right off his pumpkin but weve reassured him margie assured her he and susie were in a right state but the twins decided mud pies were boring so weve made brambleberry pies instead theres a great patch right outside the gate i had everyone pick while i made the pastry and its kept everyone nicely distracted now weve all eaten so much its coming out our earstheres some in the pantry for you lass this was real medicine kirsty served herself piestill warmand decided maybe kenneth needed pie instead of tranquillisers if only it were that easy but for susie and angus it had been that easy theyd been distressed and theyd been cured by a big dose of family jakes idea of everyone staying together was an excellent plan she decided and she wondered again about the difficulties of being a country doctor jake had been upset that she knew more about palliative medicine than he did but his cures were so much more diverse hed looked at this problem and hed cured it by a case of lateral thinking but how can you all just move into the castle kirsty asked confused and margie raised her eyebrows in astonishment wouldnt you come here if you were asked theres not a person in this district who wouldnt give their right arm for such an invitation my ben here and his lordship go back a long way theyve been comparing pumpkins for ever and with bens arthritis we dont get out all that much any more when jake rang and suggested it we thought well it sounds just like a holiday now youre here ill pop back home and get our night things and water our veggie garden ben said from his cavernous chair it rained yesterday so theres no need his wife said serenely you see no trouble but jake kirsty said slowly this was so far away from the city medical practice she knew that it seemed a different world jake was worried about his patients so he moved in with them unbelievable i think our kenneth has put the wind right up our doctor margie said watching her face and guessing her thoughts mind itll be good for him to be out here for a bit as well his hospital apartments a dreary place why doesnt he find himself somewhere nicer to live practicalities dear margie told her when he first came he bought himself a lovely home a few blocks from the hospital but of course hes the only doctor and if hes called during the night then theres no one to take care of the girls ben and i come in during the day but hes an independent man he doesnt want a livein nanny so what does he do now his apartment is a part of the hospital when he gets called out at night the nursing staff take over caring for the twins minimum disruption but being by the hospital the girls need to stay quiet no whooping downstairs like they do here she pounded the pastry with a satisfied thump itll do them all good to get out of the place she cast a cautious glance at kirsty mind what the man really needs is a wife but were not expecting miracles i wouldnt expect miracles either kirsty said flatly the mans a loner he thinks youre a bit of all right ben piped up from his chasm and kirsty winced we all think kirstys a bit of all right margie said casting a severe look at her husband no matchmaking ben you know it only leads to trouble troubles whats lifes about ben said with a satisfied yawn lifes boring without it kenneths trouble margie retorted theres trouble and theres trouble ben said sagely some comes looking for you and you run a mile some you go looking for yourself id reckon our dr jake is right in the middle and he doesnt know which is which and neither do you miss he said obscurely to kirsty maybe itll be fun to stick around for a while and watch to kirstys surprise what followed were a few really restful days jake and his family moved into the castle but apart from mealtimes kirsty hardly saw jake ok she avoided him as much as she could and maybe he was avoiding her if so she wasnt asking questions kenneth seemed no trouble at all jake reported that hed sent him by ambulance him to melbourne with a request for psychiatric evaluation the authorities rang back and said that he seemed settled and rational they could see no reason to hold him and theyd released him with instructions to maintain his medication for a couple of days they expected him to return breathing fire but there was no sign of him you could go home again susie told jake over dinner on the third night but she said it reluctantly he heard the reluctance and smiled he must feel how good this was kirsty thought it was great for all of them angus and susie were almost unrecognisable from the two invalids theyd been only days ago if its ok with angus we might extend our stay for a few more days jake said softly the man still makes me nervous and your kiddies would be having an excellent time angus said in satisfaction this place sounds as it ought to full of noise and life he ladled out more of mrs boyces casserole there should be more of it if youre sure were not intruding im hardly seeing you jake angus said bluntly the kids and the girls and margie and ben are intruding all over the place and i love it but youre never here im working let our kirsty share then shes aching to kirstys helping not enough angus said bluntly let her help with clinics she did inoculations today she had kirsty thought shed visited the local primary school and administered seventy inoculations sure it had saved jake a few hours so he could be home earlier to his kids but it was hardly earthshattering medicine she could help in his clinic her provisional registration was all in order but there was a problem working in the clinic meant working side by side with jake and it made both of them nervous theyd performed all the outstanding surgery and now jake was accepting her help only when it meant they worked apart which was probably just as well she thought and looked across to where susie was teasing the twins into eating their vegetables this was working out better than shed ever dreamed if susie had a few weeks of this before her baby was born maybe the depression could be put behind her which was the important thing she returned her attention to her casserole but suddenly she was aware that she was being watched susie knew things were wrong her twin antennae had her asking questions kirsty couldnt answer and margie and ben were very astute so was jake hed heard the sudden stillness and hed heard the unuttered questions i need to go he said pushing his chair back abruptly he placed a hand on each of his daughters heads i have evening clinic will you let margie put you to bed susies reading me a story tonight alice told him kirstys reading to penelope tomorrow were going to swap i can read to both girls if you need kirsty to help you susie ventured but jake was already walking out the door im fine alone he told them and went the days dragged on when jake had said he was fine alone he meant he was fine alone it was as if since hed admitted he needed help hed backed off and changed his mind between them theyd operated on dorothy millers veins mark glastons skin cancer and scotty andersons osteochondroma but they were small operations and all they did was give kirsty a taste of what she was missing she offered to do more but the work jake offered was minor your major effort is to keep angus and susie healthy he told her fine but angus and susie were taking care of each other angus had hardly moved over the past few weeks with his oxygen levels vastly improved he was now ambulatory but he was still very shaky about as shaky as susie so he and susie organised a track around the vegetable patch where a railed wall gave them a handhold then they set themselves to see who could make it around the patch fastest as supervising medical officer kirsty was supposed to watch and pick them up if they fell overbut as races went it would be faster to watch grass grow what was wrong with her kirsty demanded of herself after a week why was she miserable she should be happy susie was happier and healthier every day so was angus there was no sign of kenneth the only reason the castle was still full of people was because everyone acknowledged how wonderful this arrangement was for angus and susie now the two little girls were tumbling with boris on the grass in the late afternoon sun the invalids were practising their walking ben had gone home to tend his own vegetable garden margie was cooking kirsty had a great book to read god was in his heaven all was right with her worldand all she could do was think about where jake was she was going nuts i think ill go out and see mavis she decided when ben returned and offered to take over race supervision jake goes there most afternoons ben told her grinning but she decided dignity was the only way to react to his teasing if im not required i wont go in she said in her very smoothest professional manner you go in girl and see her anyway margie said firmly ben you keep your nose out of what doesnt concern you you will watch susie and angus kirsty asked trying to ignore the pair of them two identical grins drat them its the tortoise versus the tortoise margie said looking over to where angus was considering taking a couple of steps without the rail and thus overtaking susie how exciting of course well supervise off you go dear and see if you can move a little faster than this odd couple dinners in an hour but if you dont get back in time its no problem ive made sausage rolls and theres plenty what was wrong with her she sat in her car and glowered at her own stupidity it was a relief to be away from the castle she needed time she needed she didnt know what she needed she slowed down and then pulled off the road to admire the scenery the views here were fabulous dolphins were surfing in the waves just beneath the cliffside road that made her glower lessen she watched in fascinated delight but then the dolphins gave up on their surfing and disappeared off to wherever dolphins went life had to go on mavis she was going to see mavis but when she reached the farm ben was proved right jakes car was already there and her glower sprang right back jake should be back at the hospital doing all his very important work that kept him away from the castle all the time she thought savagely and then she made a valiant attempt to regain some semblance of professionalism and thought maybe mavis was in trouble and if mavis was in trouble then she as consultant specialist ought to be in there with her instead of sitting out here glowering like a lovesick teenager her dumb emotions had no basis in logic she had to stay in this place for a few weeks yet so she may as well get on with acting normal right now right normal she headed up the porch steps as jake came out the front door and she had to struggle really hard not to start glowering again hi she said and he looked at her blankly like hed forgotten who she was why are you here i thought you asked me to stay in touch with mavis i did but i thought you were back at the castle well im not she said crossly hows our patient sitting up in bed with two grandchildren and a paintarembrandtbynumbers kit he told her allowing himself to smile theres paint everywhere and barbaras trying to act crabby you want to see i do she said and she even smiled backbut then she remembered who she was talking to and she stopped smiling but i wont keep you youre obviously busy not so busy that i cant enjoy your reaction to what youve done he said standing aside and letting her past youve done great dr mcmahon she flushed she had to walk right by him and she flushed some more she needed to go back to the states she thought desperately she was losing her mind but she wasnt losing her touch with her medicine she walked into maviss bedroom and stopped in astonishment the room was full of family mavis was propped up on pillows with a grandchild on either side of her the bed had been pulled out from the wall so the kids could have a chair apiece either side and theyd added a few books to get the childrena boy and a girl of about five and sevento the right height a tray had been set up over maviss knees to hold paints and brushes and canvas there was as much paint on the bedspread as there was on the canvas but no one seemed to be minding everyone looked up as kirsty walked in and everyone smiled barbara was by the window and as she came forward kirsty saw the faint glimmer of tears on her lashes but they werent tears of despair she thought the change in the sickroom since the week before was little short of miraculous pain was an absolute killer all by itself it ruined lives before death if it could be held at bay shed succeeded there was no need to ask it was written all over maviss face so you dont need me to adjust anything she said softly doing a fast blink herself maviss smile broadened oh no dear im doing very nicely it would change again kirsty thought this disease was cruel and it was terminal the bone metastases would be growing and the pain regime would have to be tweaked every day for as long as the old lady had left but for now she was enjoying life and kirsty could keep tweaking the pain regimen kirsty could keep tweaking until susie delivered her baby and she left youll train me before you go jake said softly and she knew he was thinking the same thing and it slammed into her all over againthat jake seemed somehow to share her thinking the knowledge was extraordinarily intimate more it was just plain extraordinary she saw him smile and she wondered how it was that she could meet such a man when he wasnt interested when she lived half a world away when she didnt want involvement when the whole thing was ridiculous and she wondered whether he knew she was thinking that too of course ill run through the latest pain management regimen for this sort of disease with you she said a trifle distractedly she managed to smile at mavis and turned determinedly away from jake can i interrupt the painting to do a quick check do you have any sore spots my hips bothering me a little mavis admitted but its so much better than last week that i dont like to complain the squeaky wheel gets the oil kirsty told her still trying her best to ignore jake if dumb platitudes filled the uneasy silence then hed get dumb platitudes but platitudes werent going to stop her being acutely aware of him every minute dr cameron why dont you take these two aspiring artists for a walk she said desperately then their grandma and i can have a discussion about a sore hip she could still help once jake left she relaxed not only did she assist mavis with her hip pain she spent some time talking about the future reassuring the old lady that the pain could be kept at bay for as long as it took we may have to change the cocktail over and over again she told her but we can even when i go ill leave instructions as to what to do in the future and im always on the end of the phone and dr cameron is good he was about to phone for help from a city pain specialist when i arrived and if i leave hell still do that i wish you could stay mavis said wistfully but kirsty thought there might well be six months or so left to the old ladymaybe even moreand she could make no promises the sun was losing its warmth when she left she checked her watch and realised shed dawdled too long on the way there they were expecting her back at the castle for dinner but when she went out to the veranda there was another patient lined up jake was sitting on the veranda steps with a farmer by the looks of him a man in his sixties or early seventies the man glanced up at her grinned a gaptoothed grin in a battered and notsoclean face thisll be the other doc he said in satisfaction two for the price of one barbara said docd be coming tonight and i watched the road for his car now i have the pair of you herbert lives just over the rise jake said dryly with a look that was almost apologetic herbert this is dr mcmahon herbert doesnt like clinic because he doesnt like waiting the missus makes me have a bath before i go to clinic a man could waste a whole day on a visit like that herbert said indignantly me legs a bit of a mess and the missus said shed drag me in tomorrow regardless but now ive found you he beamed if you could just fix me up he hauled up his trouser leg and revealed a gory haematoma with a long jagged gash in the centre there were angry red weals leading up the leg toward the groin it didnt take a brains trust to realise this injury had taken place some days before and had been ignored so what happened jake asked they had an audience barbara was standing watching holding a child by each hand these were farm kids kirsty thought in wry amusement a kid from manhattan might well faint but all these children showed was fascinated interest blasted heifer kicked out as i was putting her into a bail last monday herbert said sourly it was her first time in i should know better by now and keep myself out of the way but im getting slower in my old age anyway the missus saw it last night and had a pink fit and said the legd drop off if i didnt see you so im seeing you i dont suppose theres any chance you might come to the hospital jake said but he sounded amused more than annoyed and he didnt look surprised when herbert shook his head the legll have to turn black before that happens the leg may well turn black if you dont take more care of it jake said bluntly he looked up at barbara is it ok if dr mcmahon and i perform a piece of minor surgery on your veranda its mums veranda barbara said she smiled and motioned to where her mother was watching through the bedroom window as long as you dont mind an audience go right ahead this was seriously weird kirsty decided jake propped the farmer on cushions he spread newspapers under his leg and asked kirsty to administer a full shin block then he proceeded to clean the wound of accumulated debrisof which there was plentygetting rid of the dead flaps of torn skin and checking the circulation around the wound dirty wounds were best left open as much as possible they both knew that to herbert cosmetic appearances were a very minor consideration but the tear was big and jake needed to pull it together with a few stitches the kids watched a couple of hens clucked past and all the while herbert lay back and discussed the state of the poddy market with barbara those damned friesians of mine only got fifty quid last week he complained you and your old man got seventy thats because we feed em right barbara said severely youre too much of a skinflint to give them what they need and whoever buys them has to go into tlc mode whats tlc tender loving care barbara retorted something you ought to have used on your leg you dopey git there was a wealth of affection between them kirsty realised and then she thought morethere was a wealth of affection within this whole community jake cared for all these people they cared for jake and they cared for each other he was right this was the best community in which to raise kids what if susie wanted to stay here after the baby was born what was she thinking that for why would susie want to stay why would she want to go home not for family kirsty thought ruefully they had no one but each other but herehere susie had angus and the boyces and jake and a vegetable garden and people who were prepared to love her maybe susie might want to stay which left kirsty where home was where the heart was another platitude she was getting good at platitudes so what did she have back in manhattan to tug at her heart who did she have robert ha oh stop it she told herself fiercely as she watched jake dress the farmers leg youre being maudlin shed go back to the castle right now she decided jake put on a last piece of sticking plaster she administered a dose of intravenous antibiotic with care and rose to leave her work here was done surgery tomorrow morning at nine to have this checked jake was telling herbert aw doc you know i dont have time to come to surgery ill ring maudie and tell her to tip out your stock of homebrewed if youre not there he retorted as the farmer struggled to his feet as well the downside of using the veranda floor as an operating table was that patient access wasnt so great jake took one arm and kirsty the other herbert was a bit wobbly he reached into his pocket for his car keys but barbara was before him darting forward and snatching them from his hand ill call sam from the dairy to take you home barbara said milkings finished he wont mind as he opened his mouth to argue she took a couple of steps backward with the keys you and maudie can pick up your car after the doctors surgery tomorrow and if maudie doesnt tell me youve been looking after yourself youre not getting your keys back at all the farmer glowered but only for a minute his glower slowly faded and became a rueful grin dratted women he told jake you know what youre doing not getting legshackled again he cast an appraising look at kirsty though from what i hear youd better look out i will jake said and kirsty released the farmers arm as if it burned though shes a looker herbert said grinning do you mind she said faintly not a bit herbert said his grin broadening i can see what theyre talking about now there was a choking sound from barbara now dont get offended barbara begged you cant hold it against herbertor any of us for that matter this district has been matchmaking for dr jake for years we just have to set eyes on an eligible woman and were at it indulge us so maybe jake had his reasons for saying he wasnt wanting a relationship up front kirsty thought a flash of sympathy filtering though her anger im not offended she managed just bemused that you can think anything so ridiculous ridiculous is this districts specialty jake said wryly but then his cell phone rang dammit please let this not be more work she should take this chance to leave kirsty thought she should but she hesitated just a moment too long youre kidding jake was saying into the phone how can you do that its almost grounds for dismissal without a reference he heaved a doleful sigh fine then he said even more dolefully well just starve no no think nothing of it well fade to shadows of our former selves but well fade as martyrs he replaced the phone on his belt and found them all looking at him its a tragedy he said still doleful tragedy kirsty asked cautious his eyes were twinkling in that dangerous way he had that said there was no tragedy at all angus and susie are feeling better umthats a tragedy she didnt want to ask kirsty decided but his eyes were laughing openly even though his mouth was trying to be tragic he had her intrigued mrs boyce has made soup and sausage rolls for dinner he said sadly everyones been exercising they were hungry and were late she couldnt make them wait for us and im sorry to have to inform you kirsty that theyve eaten the lot his face grew even more mournful which leaves you and me with no dinner margie says we need to buy fish and chips on the way home have something here barbara said and hesitated i can stretch country hospitality at its best kirsty thought this lady was managing kids a farm and a dying mother and she still offered to feed all comers margie can give us eggs on toast jake said sighing his martyred sigh again but no he held up a hand to stop barbaras protest dr mcmahon and i are true medical heroes we know how to exist on a piece of stale bread and dripping and tea made with a used teabag fish and chips will be sheer luxury have it on the beach herbert said approvingly just like me and the missus we take a bottle of wine down there every friday night and nine times out of ten it ends up in a spot of hankypanky he suddenly realised what he was saying and gave an embarrassed snort i meanwhen we were younger it ended up in hankypanky his colour deepened as he realised they were all looking at him fascinated in the old days i mean ooh sexy kirsty thought fish and chips and hankypanky with herbert that sounds just what you both need mavis volunteered from her window behind them if i was forty years younger id join you fish and chips and hankypanky with herbert and mavis too or just fish and chips with jake on the beach where was she going into territory that was very dangerous indeed well buy fish and chips and take them home kirsty said a trifle desperately but barbara shook her head i can guess whatll happen if you do that and i bet you can too theyll all have had sausage rolls and theyll be as full as googs but you step inside the castle with fish and chips and suddenly theyll be hungry all over again theyll be gone in a flash mark my words you take her down the beach dr jake yeah dr jake herbert said and nudged jake in the ribs take her down the beach i dont need fish and chips kirsty said with an attempt at dignity but she was howled down by everyone except maybe jake but jake said nothing as plans were made around them as they were told sternly what to do you are hungry jake asked as silence finally reigned and she had to agree that she was right then he said with resignation its fish and chips on the beach by order and five minutes later she was meekly following jakes car to the dolphin bay fish and chipperyand to the beach beyond chapter seven while jake purchased fish and chips kirsty walked across the park separating the town from the beach the park was a gorgeous little trianglebeach on one side river with harbour on another and the town on the third side it was a great little town kirsty thought falling deeper in love with this strange mix of bushland and harbour and sleepy village there was a pair of kookaburras in the gums above her head their mocking chortles made her feel weird she shouldnt be here why was she here they both knew this was dangerous territory oh for heavens sake this was fish and chips on the beachfront it wasnt one of jakes scary dates it wasnothing safe or not kirsty found a table close to the shopsjust becausebut then jake strolled up bearing a fat parcel of fish and chips and a couple of bottles of lemonade he smiled as he put his load on the table and she didnt feel safe at all we should take these home she managed but jakes smile became rueful barbaras right the scavengers would have it in minutes and im starving so was she when he ripped the paper to reveal slivers of flathead tiny succulent scallops fresh oysters and enough chips to feed a small army she decided that no way was she taking this home this is my half she said putting a hand through the halfway mark hauling her fish chips scallops and oysters to her side of the paper and thus delineating shares hey he said startled i thought women were supposed to pretend they didnt eat not this woman ive been watching susie peck at her food for months now she gags at the sight of anything fried so weve been having healthy little morsels of not very much at all to have a nice carbohydrateloaded meal in front of mewhere i have to fight for every mouthfulis the stuff of dreams im happy to oblige he said but he still looked disbelieving and kirsty was aware that she was being watched all the time she ate what she said at last as the final scallop found a thoroughly satisfactory home you look like youve never seen anyone eat a chip before you must have ive never seen anyone like you watch susie then shes identical shes not identical because shes pregnant and battered shell recover but shell be a stronger person than ill ever be kirsty agreed you mean because lifes tossed her around he asked curiously you dont think you might be just as strong im not strong when i rang to check on your credentials for registration i got a glowing report he said smart caring ambitious and poised to become one of the youngestever medical directors of the hospice youve been working in strong was one of the biggest words they used you have the reputation for fighting with everything you have to see your patients get what they need to make them comfortable to the end its a hugely prestigious establishment and to have the credentials to take over at your age seems amazing he paused but then you walked away he said softly you havent been near the place for the last three months and the appointments been given to someone else theres lots of jobs she said a trifle selfconsciously its no big deal the woman i talked to said it was a big deal a really big deal in the cutthroat medical establishment for you to walk away because you cared so much for your sister is tantamount to professional suicide thats nonsense she said suddenly angry he was intruding on her personal space hereher personal doubts oh maybe its the truth in a senseto get where i was headed you need to be blinkered to everything else in the world maybe i was for a while but maybe being blinkered is dumb family comes first my exwifes still dumb he said inconsequentially and for some reason that made her angrier good for her then each to his own and every other platitude i can think of she rose and stalked over to the nearest rubbish bin depositing her empty wrappings with force umplatitudes he said cautiously and she shook her head without turning back to him dont ask im going for a walk on the beach you go on home youre dismissing me i am she told him if were seen walking on the beach together in this town i dont think we need a wedding certificate itll be seen as a done deal he grinned at that youre starting to see what im up against maybe she conceded but you werent polite ive forgotten how to be polite sure shed reached the sand and was hauling off her sandals then rolling up her jeans when she straightened she found he was beside her doing the same youre supposed to be going home the kids ate my sausage rolls they all ate our sausage rolls theres no bedtime story for sausageroll eaters what you mean is that they wont even notice that youre not there she said softening there are people queued for bedtime reading rights youve made so many people happy by lending us your family good old kenneth he said softly he doesnt know what hes started i suppose it was kenneth that pulled everyone together she said youll have to forget him soon though and let everyone go home who wants to go home he said enigmatically im for walking on the beach how about you different sides of the beach she said cautiously of course you want me to go get boris to chaperon we should if i went and got him then everyone would come back and join us which would make this a really big deal she said softly and we dont want that do we dr cameron in the end it was a really long walk shed been strained to the limit kirsty thought as they walked maybe ever since rory had died caring for susie trying to juggle her work commitments trying to figure out the best for everyone had taken all her mental energy even the time of enforced idleness in sydney while susie had been threatened with early birth had been frighteningly tensewatching susies depression increase knowing how helpless she was but this last week had been a gift for her too she decided as she walked she wasnt the least sure what sort of emotional jumble her head was in but for the restshed relaxed about susie there was now only three weeks to go the baby could be born now and be safe as well as that shed practised medicine again it was an odd sort of general practiceanaesthetics pain management and the odds and sods that jake didnt want but it had been fun giving assorted schoolkids their shots watching them screw up their faces in terror and offer their bare arms like lambs to the slaughteronly to be astounded when shed managed to give the shot with hardly a pinprick of pain shed also had fun at the castle kenneths threats had become a catalyst to make everyone seem a family and and for the first time in a very long time shed seemed part of a family most of that was because of the man beside her it was no wonder that her hormones were playing tricks on her she thought dimly and then she thought it didnt help that he was so dropdead gorgeous and he was so dropdead caring and he was so dropdeadeverything penny for your thoughts jake said and she jerked out of her reverie surprised to see theyd walked almost half a mile theyd been walking in the shallows separated by a few feet so the splashes she was making didnt hit him and vice versa im just thinking this has been fun she told him fun giving kids shots watching angus and susie have races bouncing around the castle with boris and penelope and alice theyve had fun too they paused the sun was a vast golden ball dropping low over the distant mountains slipping every moment until pop it suddenly disappeared altogether leaving only the glorious hues of sunset wed better go back they turned but he seemed as reluctant as she was silence again why didnt he talk she wondered he acted as if he was afraid of her so youre never going to have a relationship again she asked softly and the silence intensified sorry she said at last i didnt hear your answer i was trying not to hear your question im allowed to ask she said a trifle indignantly after all remember hubby and the six kidlets back home id forgotten them he said starting to smile maybe because you dont wear photos of them in a locket round your neck too many she said sagely id get a sore neck but if you did itd stop the locals talking about us jake told her that really gets to you it does he agreed every single woman in this place seems at some time or other to be bracketed with me it gets tiring id imagine it would she said faintly all those women its just he kicked spray up before him with a sudden savage swipe that had his pants and shirt covered with spray no problem kirsty thought the unseasonable cold snap as theyd arrived had lasted a whole three minutes and it was now back to latesummer gorgeous hed dry before they reached the end of the beach look the smalltown thing is dumb its why i came herebecause everyone cares for everyoneand this is just its downside so i shouldnt complain why do you care what they say she asked cautiously is it so important if someone sees you kissing someone else and sets it about that youre having a hot affairis that such a tragedy my kids its hardly going to affect your kids she said with more asperity than shed intended theyre four years old theyre hardly likely to be corrupted but if the woman gets the wrong idea youre scared that touching a woman leads to immediate presumption of marriage you know that does seem a triflepresumptuous it does he said giving her a rueful smile it sounds conceited it definitely does so if i kissed you you wouldnt think itd lead anywhere she thought about that i guess it couldnt she agreed cautiously on account of hubby and rugrats back home he motioned up to the headland there was a car park overlooking the harbour a place kirsty had discovered was a favourite with the locals they drove up there at odd times in the day just to check to the state of surf the tides whether the fishing fleet was in sight at any time of the day there were never less than half a dozen cars parked there and now kirsty could count at least ten you know kirsty said cautiously if you were to kiss me now you could use it as armour for years how so theyd slowed and now they stopped ankle deep in the surf itd be all over town by morning doctor has passionate affair with other doctor then nothing doctor goes back to new york leaving bereft country doctor behind you could hide behind your broken heart for ages gee thanks just a thought she said and grinned just offering myself in the greater good if you need armour what better than a broken heart or she paused i could tell everyone you knew about hubby and the six kids thatd work maybe itd even work better how would it work better he was staring at her as if shed grown antennae mothers would warn their daughters about you dont go near him dear hes a homewrecker youve got it all worked out just trying to be helpful why youre miserable she told him im a pain specialist fixing pain is what i do what makes you think im in pain i think youre lonely as hell she said bluntly i think your wife walking out on you has left you bewildered and hurt and scared you want to keep you and your two little girls safe from being hurt again and youre using local gossip as an excuse not to let anyone close thats nonsense is it she turned to face him then head on is it really jake its partly what you told me wed hardly met before you were telling me to back off and you know theres a solid mutual attraction fictional kidlets aside is there really a sensible reason why youre not kissing me now when you know we both want to i she raised her brows in mock enquiry and turned away taking a few more steps in the shallows was she mad solitude and fear over the last month had driven her to the edge she thought and any minute shed be declared as crazed as kenneth and then she heard jake splash behind her she paused not knowing whether she should be hopeful or not but she was hopeful kirsty yes its either kiss you or throttle you he told her sounding much more exasperated than passionate so turn around and be kissed he kissed her he was crazy this was dumb shed goaded him into it and it made all the sense in the world to walk away but she was too too kirsty it stunned him shed walked into his life and something had lit that hadnt been lit for yearsif it ever had been lit and somehow he doubted it hed thought hed been in love when hed married but he hadnt felt like this like he was balancing on a knifeedge shed accused him of being scared he thought and she was right ever since hed been left with two babies to make a future for every decision had been carefully controlled but kirsty was uncontrolled uncontrollable kirsty this was madness this was not a sensible move at all but she was right before him her eyes wide with gentle mocking enquiry a man could drown in those eyes a man could lose control completely no it wasnt the least bit sensible but she was waiting to be kissed the watchers on the clifftop were waiting for a man to kiss a woman kirsty had defied him to put on a show for their audience and suddenly he couldnt help himself and when he took her hands in his when he drew her to him and kissed her softly wonderingly on the mouth it was like the coming together of two halves of a whole she was soright hed thought hed known how a woman feltof course he didbut this was different each curve the soft warmth of her every part of her moulding against him fitting with a completeness that was as shocking as it was wonderful he knew this woman he thought numbly hed always known her but he hadnt found her until now and then he stopped thinking anything at all as his mind shuttered down and all he felt was the kiss and kirsty kirsty had goaded him into this kiss half laughing but half of her desperately wanting it was as if shed been defying herself to find that it couldnt be as wonderful as her subconscious was screaming that it could be but her subconscious had been overwhelmingly deliciously right her hands came up to cup his face deepening the kiss and she felt the rough beginning of stubble on his tough male skin it was so erotic she felt her toes start to curl shed kissed men of course shed kissed men nobody had caused her toes to curl as this man was doing right now and she could keep kissing him it was unbelievable that he was kissing her that she was holding him and he wasnt pulling away that he was deepening the kiss seemingly wanting her as much as she wanted him nothing had ever felt so right her breasts were against his chest his hands were tugging her waist drawing her into him and she was arching against him aching loving welcoming her man to her as a woman welcomed her man home after battle home to her heart this couldnt last they were playing for an audience she thought in the tiny recess of her brain still available for anything but pure hot sensation in a moment hed pull away and all the reasons why he didnt want a relationship why she didnt want a relationship would surface and life would go on as before this was time out for both of them but she wasnt going to stop it to do so would be dumb and she didnt feel dumb she felt light and hot and wonderful andloved loved maybe she was dumb after all her hands moved to pull him closer tighter to deepen the kiss as if to block out the unwanted intrusion of sanity but it had happened and maybe hed felt it or maybe hed had his own intrusive thoughts because suddenly he was pulling away his hands caught hers using them to hold her away from him just a little his eyes were quizzical laughingbut she was starting to know this man and she could see uncertainty behind the façade of laughter do you think thats given them enough no she said trying to match his laughter but she was aware that the unsteadiness of her voice must be a giveaway to the jumble of emotions within they wont be satisfied unless you rip my clothes off and take me right here you want to do that he asked the smile still managing to staybut both of them knew that what he was suggesting was entirely possible given another time another place another life he released her hands and it was all she could do not to cry such a loss maybe being known as dolphin bays town slut isnt quite what i had in mind she managed still trying for lightness though itd do wonders for your reputation fornication in public no mother in her right mind would let her daughter so much as come to you for a flu jab then maybe wed better not maybe wed better not he caught her hand again simply girl to boy swinging her around so they were side by side facing the cliff it was a simple gesture but the feel of his fingers entwined in hers moved her unutterably she glanced up at the line of cars trying to take her mind off the feel of his hand by the time they reached the car park their audience would have completely dispersed she decided the town gossip network was about to move into meltdown you think what weve just done will keep me safe from matchmaking jake murmured and the lightness had suddenly gone from his voice his fingers were gripping hers with force as well as with warmth for the next few weeks theyll bracket us together she whispered everyone knows weve been sleeping in the same castle the local gossip lines will all but selfdestruct then when i go you can be heartbroken all over again just as you were when your wife left getting over your wife has given you years of grace the town is only starting to gear up seriously to matchmake and now youve another lost love youre my lost love he said sounding startled i make a good one dont you think umsure there you go then she was working so hard on keeping it light that something inside her was threatening to break she was so close to tears there was a ring from his shirt pocket and she thought thank heaven for cell phones anything to break this moment anything to give her space she walked away a little and she could almost hear the collective sigh of disappointment from the clifftop could she stand living here as the local doctor and being watched every day maybe not not unless dont go there she told herself she shrugged and hiked up the beach and by the time jake reached her she was sitting on the sand pulling her sandals back on their time of makebelieve was over they were lovely fish and chips she told him trying to sound polite and dismissive it was a very nice walk and a very nice kiss thank you very much doctor his lips twitched just like that consultation over id be guessing you have places to go people to see emily cannon has croup there you go then ill see you back at home hardly she thought jake and his twins were sleeping in a guest suite on the first floor near angus about as far from her as it was possible to be unless you need help with croup she added trying not to sound hopeful croup hardly needs a specialist anaesthetist i still remember croup training i dont need you you couldnt get more of a dismissal than that right goodnight then dr cameron she told him goodnight dr mcmahon id shake hands but our audience seems to have disappeared she said motioning to the deserted car park itd be a waste of human contact dont you think but she didnt wait to find out whether he agreed or not she turned and stalked back to her car with all the dignity a woman could muster which wasnt very much at all chapter eight it was a long night kirsty lay awake and wondered what on earth shed done shed tossed her dignity aside and behaved like a twit shed thrown herself at the man i had fun she told herself trying desperately to lighten what had happened in her head and he had fun too we were a mature man and woman playacting for the local gossips that might be what jake was doing but it was far more than playacting for you and you know it sleep wouldnt come she rose and padded softly into susies room as shed done so often over the last week and she found her sister staring at the ceiling as well whats up she asked and susie turned and smiled at her in the moonlight nothings up stoopid thats the problem huh i was woken by rory junior practising his gridiron she said then i had to get up for a pee for the fourth time tonight and nowive just been lying here thinking that life suddenly seems hopeful again just a little bit she said hastily as if her sister might read too much into her confession but these last daysits been like slivers of light breaking through fog just glimpses but theyre getting longer thats great kirsty said warmly perched on her twins bed depression is such a ghastly illness ive been so frightened for you she lifted her sisters hand and squeezed i guess i still am youre thinking the clouds will reform susie whispered im afraid they might too its great that im having thisthis little bit of happiness but then i remember that rory isnt here to share it with me he wont see his baby then i think ive got no right to go on kirsty had left the door open angus left a nightlight onactually a night chandelierand now a shadow crossed the door susies eyes flew to see who it was and she smiled a welcome jake jake paused in the doorway boris was by his side wagging his tail in greeting hed obviously been waiting in the hall for jake to return and now his tail was sweeping his pleasure susie jakes voice was warm and caring is anything wrong then he saw kirsty and his voice changed sorry you have your personal physician in attendance already im on my way to bed come on boris come in and join us susie called kirsty thought rats but it was callous to say rats so she calmly moved up the bed a bit so jake could come in and sit down he came instead to stand looking searchingly down at susie ignoring kirsty you really are all right i really am susie told him and tomorrow angus and i have organised to see the physiotherapist you told me about that was a huge step forward kirsty acknowledged up until now susie had resisted all attempts to get her moving but jake had talked about the physiotherapist who visited town once a week hed told angus susie would benefit but she wouldnt go by herselfand then hed told susie that physiotherapy could prolong anguss life but he wouldnt go by himself either hey presto problem fixed together theyd go country doctor doing what he did best sorting out a multitude of problems with interlacing solutions up until now boris had been standing by susies bed but kirsty had made room for jake the spot was vacant and a dog could only stand temptation for so long he leapt up realised how comfortable it was and wriggled forward on his stomach until he was near enough to give susie a long slurpy kiss urk susie saidand giggled it was the best sound kirsty thought it was an amazing sound no matter what sort of emotional mess this man was making of her head she forgave him all because hed made her sister giggle it had to continue she thought desperately but would it after the babys birth hormonal changes could propel her further downward postnatal depression mingling with an existing diagnosis susies feeling guilty that shes started to have glimmers of enjoyment she told jake jumping in feet first rorys not here to share it shes feeling dreadful that shes here and hes not and shes scared the depressions going to descend again its an awful feeling jake said softly i know when my sister died that was one of the hardest things to come to terms with your sister died susie asked kirsty didnt say anything it was like he poleaxed her every time he opened his mouth car accident when she was sixteen he said briefly the first time i forgotmy friends dragged me out to a movie and it was a silly dopey movie where we all ended up drunk on laughter and life and sheer teenage silliness and i came out into the night and thought ellys never going to see that movie it was so gutwrenching that i threw up my body reacted to mental anguish by physical revolt your friends wouldnt have understood susie whispered i told them i had a stomach upset he told them maybe they believed me they probably did come to think of it as how can you know what loss feels like until youve experienced it what followed then was months of pseudostomach upsets and even now i have moments but ive learned he hesitated glancing at kirsty as if unsure that he should reveal himself so completely in her presence but ive learned that i cant not see movies or go to the beach or have my twentyfirst birthday or get married and have kids just to stop my gut wrenching because it doesnt help grief and loss twists your gut into such a knot that every now and then you just have to let go let it all out sob or vomit or kick inanimate objects or whatever you find helpsbut you have to do it if you dont you stay permanently twisted inside i guess thats what i have been susie whispered twisted inside just a little bit battered he told her smiling not so twisted as youd noticed your walking is going great rory would be so proud of you he would wouldnt he she said a trifle defiantly and then she looked from jake to kirsty and back again so tonight on the beach i need to go to bed jake said cutting her off ive only just got home three housecalls in a row and its two am tonight on the beach were you trying to forget something susie said deliberately and slowly or were you both truly moving on im not sure what you mean jake said and cast a glance at kirsty that accused her of going straight home to her sister and telling all susie caught the glance and smiled leave her alone she hasnt said a word but margies sisterinlaw was in the car park and the phones have been running hot since margie popped in before she went to bed to ask what did i think and wouldnt it be lovely her smile was tentative but it stayed fixed its only fair to warn you im simply the first to ask the question well youve asked it jake said with another doubtful look at kirsty now im going to bed goodnight you havent answered my question susie complained its none of your business that was blunt kirsty thought a bit shocked but susies smile peeped out again no but im kirstys twin i know all her nearest and dearest concerns ask your own two if you dont believe me how many secrets do alice and penelope keep from each other no but i dont know the answer to this one kirsty thought desperately and she glanced at her twin and she saw that susie knew this too and maybe that was why she was asking i have one set of twins in my life jake said and there was a trace of desperation in his voice as he responded i cant cope with two cut it out suze kirsty said and there was even more desperation in her tone let the man go to bed only asking susie responded her intelligent eyes moving from one to the other she hesitated has kirsty told you about her shadows no our mother died when we were ten susie told him our father suicided soon after since then kirstys taken on the cares of the world shes looked after meprotected me shes taken on her job at the hospice taking care of the dying and im sure thats more of the same our father suicided because he couldnt move on i ventured out again and got hit hard kirstys watched from the sidelines and shes decided she doesnt ever want to go there cut it out kirsty said with desperation and susie smiled you cant have it both ways kid youve worked on getting me better and now i amor a bit for the first time since rory died im popping my head up from under the fog and taking notice of whats going on around me the gut twisting isnt happening and im feelinglight and very very interested in whats happening to my twin thats good jake said but he was edging backwards i need to go of course you do susie told him kirsty you need to go too im staying for a bit i dont need you yes you do kirsty snapped goodnight dr cameron goodnight dr mcmahon and he was gone with the door closed safely behind him kirsty turned on her twin with a mixture of indignation anger and shock how could you susie youve scared the man witless youve scared me witless youre not scared witless susie said thoughtfully oh kirsty hes gorgeous and you kissed him we were messing around having a lend of the locals truly truly so she said fixing her twin with a look kirsty hadnt seen for a long time youre saying youre not in love with jake cameron youre delusional kirsty said ill take your blood pressure theres nothing wrong with my blood pressure susie murmured yours on the other hand ooh kirsty what are you going to tell robert nothing i dont expect you need to she said thoughtfully hes so limp hes not even likely to notice hes been dumped suze get out of it susie told her twin off you go leave me to my dreams but something tells me theyre not all dreams you cant be a twin without knowing a thing or two and i know a thing or six how was a girl supposed to sleep after that she hardly did she woke up early and decided shed make herself breakfast but when she reached the kitchen door she heard jakes voice and paused weve got to get you fat somehow he was saying an accompanying bag of bones does nothing for my medical image if you want to be a superdoctors dog you need to look a walking advertisement for vitamin pills have another rasher jake and boris she leaned back against the wall unashamedly eavesdropping we have to go home soon mate were only here in protection mode and it seems theres no threat there was a faint whimper and she could imagine boriss dopey ears sprawled over jakes knee yeah its been good but to pretend it could be like this all the time is dumb happy families are an illusion another whimper its coming he sounded exasperated you dont want your bacon noncrispy do you silence the sound of spitting bacon if she wasnt here id stay on for a bit he said softly but she is and its a dangerous road the twins and you and mewere a unit and im not letting anything threaten that or anyone she should go in the bacon smelled terrific she didnt she went upstairs to check on angus jake wasnt letting anything threaten his precious family unit she thought as she trudged upstairs she didnt intend to let him threaten her independence fine they were of like minds all she felt like doing was bursting into tears check angus forget the tears forget men or every man but angus she knocked when angus didnt answer she opened the door a crack as shed been doing since theyd arrived assuming he was still asleep he wasnt asleep he was sprawled on the floor by the window hed tripped on the mat she thought in dismay his oxygen cylinder was on its side and his nasal tube had been ripped from his face in his fall no jake she screamed in a voice that was meant to be heard in the middle of next week hed stopped breathing she couldnt find a pulse damn where was it she was feeling his carotid artery his neck was warm to the touch but she couldnt findshe couldnt find airway check airways stupid keep the panic for later her fingers were in his mouth seeking for an obstruction and finding none heart attack stroke get the breathing back and find out get oxygen a defibrillator jake angus must be dead if that scream didnt have him jerking to wakefulness dont die angus keep yourself professional ha she ripped his pyjama coat open hauling him onto his back she was kneeling over him breathing for him cupping her hands to start the rhythmic pounding of cpr how long had he been on the floor shed checked him at four am and hed been fine how long hadnt he been breathing he was still so warm maybemaybe from behind her she heard boots taking the stairs three at a time then jakes barked query what the it must be cardiac arrest have you got im going the boots retreated steps retreating stairs taken four at a time she went back to breathing went back to pounding breathe then fifteen short sharp thumps breathe come on come on susie was in the doorway now leaning heavily on her crutches how had she got up the stairs behind her was margie and the twins behind her their faces were appalled keep the littlies away she managed between breaths but every ounce of energy was going into rhythmic pumping jake was back then pushing them unceremoniously aside dumping equipment on the floor a portable defibrillator thank god please he worked around her ripping anguss pyjama jacket further sticking on patches readying checking the monitor theres pulse he told her theres still pulse but its slow as bedamned keep breathing for him kirsty he was hauling an oxygen mask from his kit as he readied kirsty moved aside in seconds jake had the mask fitted and was breathing for him pushing pure oxygen into anguss lungs kirsty didnt stop they needed an iv sodium bicarb atropine what was happening angus had ischaemic heart disease she knew that if his pulse hadnt completely gone then maybe this was a mild infarct maybe theyd get him back that was the bestcase scenario the thought that it could be a stroke with all its ramifications was unbearable her fingers were flying jake had the old mans chest moving up and down with a reassuring rhythm they just had to get him breathing for himself again maybe the sodium bicarb could be enough to prevent any longterm damage if he still had a pulse it must have just happened maybe hed woken with the smell of bacon and the sound of voices in the kitchen he must have stumbled as jake worked to set up an iv line she was thinking all the time please and then a tiny gasp so small they might have imagined it but then another another and a choking gasping cough breathing reestablished breathing reestablished dear god the old eyes fluttered open angus winced as though in pain and then seemed to focus on jake on to kirsty suesusie he murmured and kirstys eyes flew to the door but her twin preempted her susie couldnt have heard anguss whisper but sometimes what was said to kirsty was said to susie and susie was already manoeuvring herself within anguss field of vision im here angus he stared up at her bewildered trying to talk shush jake murmured but he lifted the mask back so angus could say what he obviously desperately wanted to say stay safe angus murmured at last susie rory im safe susie said gently and she laid her hand on her swollen belly guessing the core of his fear rorys baby is safe were worried about you spike he whispered hell die kirsty even let herself smile at that if he was worried about his pumpkin then surely there was hope surely there was a tomorrow for this gentle old man who she and her sister were only starting to know who she and her sister were starting to love susie will take care of your pumpkin jake said softly and by the look on his face kirsty knew he was as emotional as she was she wont let him die meanwhile susies come a long way to have this baby where you can play greatuncle so youd better make an effort for her youre going to hospital im not that was said so loudly so indignantly that kirsty wanted to laugh out loud there were still miracles in this job sometimesjust sometimesshe loved being a doctor to have this outcome oh yes you are you old coot jake was saying and there was no disguising the emotion in his voice now youre coming in for complete assessment and thats an order do you really not want to be around to support susie as she has her baby i no kirsty was administering morphine she could tell he was hurtingbadly understandably the way shed pounded his ribs was enough to make anyone hurt then youre coming to hospital spike angus whispered and closed his eyes i promise ill look after your pumpkin susie told him me and ben come on jake stooped and lifted the old man into his arms motioning to kirsty to lift the various pieces of attached medical paraphernalia kirsty will you come with me i can walk angus said weakly yeah and i can fly jake retorted but lets not do either unless we have to chapter nine two hours later kirsty drove back to the castle in a borrowed hospital car feeling as if maybe just maybe things would be ok the electrocardiogram showed minor damage as did the cardiac enzymes nothing that couldnt repair itself angus was sleeping recovering from the combined effects of painkillers and shock but his breathing was deep and almost normal hell go to sydney and get thorough cardiac assessment now jake growled i havent been able to get the stubborn old coot into this hospital before this and im going to move so fast he wont know what hit him he hesitated kirsty youd like me to go with him his face cleared if you would ill take care of susie for you of course you will she said softly and then looked away her job in a hospice at home was often heartwrenching but her heart had never been wrenched as it was now what was it with this place these peoplethis man shed fallen in love with a whole community she thought bleakly as she drove home and she didnt know what to do about it because although shed fallen for this place she knew she could never separate the two her love for dolphin bay and its people her love for jake maybe a couple of days away would be good for her she thought jake was arranging for air ambulance to transport angus that afternoon and the plan was for her to accompany him as his medical attendantbut also as his family because thats what i am like it or not she admitted to herself family somehow this whole place has wrapped itself around my heart and i dont know what to do about it do what comes next and nothing more she told herself fiercely go home reassure susie and everyone else pack an overnight bag and go to sydney stay there until youre sure angus is out of danger get away from jake right but when she drove into the castle forecourt there was more drama she couldnt have time out just yet spikes dying kirsty was barely out of the car door before susie appeared from the gate leading to the kitchen garden boris was by her side looking as concerned as kirsty kirsty spikes dying susie yelled again angus must have been trying to tell us she was balancing precariously on her crutches as she saw her twin she took hasty steps forwardtoo hastyand started to stagger kirsty reached her before she hit the ground jake phoned her sister said he said angus would be ok and you were going to sydney everyone left and then i came out to see kirsty spike susie calm down im calm but youre not calm be sensible wheres everyone else susie took a deep breath she closed her eyes obviously fighting for composure bens gone home to water his own vegetables margie says thats the first place he goes when hes upset then when jake phoned and said he wanted you to go to sydney margie said shed shop now as she doesnt want me to be alone for too long and after you go i will be so she and the twins have gone into town but when they left her voice broke on a sob hey hush kirsty put her hand on her twins trying to stem what sounded like rising hysteria its ok but its not susie sobbed i know why angus had his heart attack he must have seen when they left i went to check angus and i cleared all the leaves near the pumpkin leaving the stem exposed someones pulled it theyve hauled the roots right out of the ground ive replanted him but itll take days for his roots to reestablish themselves hes wilting while i watch the pumpkin was indeed poorly kirstys specialty was dying people not pumpkinsbut she knew a dying pumpkin when she saw one if shed been selecting pumpkins for a hospice spike might well have met her criteria he wasnt totally limp some of the leaves closer to the roots were still stiff and healthy but the leaves close to the pumpkin itself were visibly wilting susie had rigged up a sheet to give shade shed soaked the ground with water so the patch was sodden but obviously not enough water was getting through someones wrenched him out of the ground susie whispered i guess we were lucky the whole plant didnt break off but as it is spike cant get water and hell die wont it ripen anyway kirsty said doubtfullyand received the look shed used not so long ago on a junior intern whod suggested using aspirin for renal colic its too soon hell get bigger before he ripens if hes picked now hell never be any good this must have been why angus had his attack hell have looked out the window and been rushing to help who can have done such a thing susie sank onto the wet ground and lifted the main stem into her hands this will break anguss heart the damaged roots cant supply enough water to get through kirsty opened her mouth to say something and then she stopped no what she was thinking had to be dumb what susie said why is it dumb you know jake does this to me too now kirsty complained cant a girl even think by herself jake loves you as much as i love you susie retorted he just doesnt know it yet whats dumb ignore the jake comment kirsty told herself concentrate on important matters like dying pumpkins she was a palliativecare physician her specialty was taking care of the dying not lifesaving so far today shed helped save angus and now could she save a pumpkin a medical step sideways i was thinking i know you were thinking susie said exasperated but you need to stop thinking and do something or the pumpkins cactus you know palliativecare doctors dont use the word cactus she said thoughtfully her mind still racing its not a good image spike will die then susie said sounding even more exasperated and fearful shed fallen for angus in a big way kirsty thought angus was rorys uncle and he was therefore susies family if angus was susies family then angus was therefore her family and his pumpkin was heading toward beingcactus is it just water thats flowing through the stem she asked cautiously yes ordinary water therell be nutrients as well susie said from the soil but thats not as important as water kirsty knelt beside her twin and examined the pumpkin with care susies replanting had worked a little the leaves closet to the ground were still firm the wilting leaves were the furthest from the roots and they were turning more limp by the minute i cant bear it susie moaned how can we tell angus shut up suze she was examining the stem it looked tough and prickly like a hairy forearm lets not bury him yet she said softly suze if you cut off a flower and stick it in a vase itll suck up water if you cut this stem and stuck it in water would it suck it up the pumpkin will draw water in susie told her but itd never get enough and the stem would disintegrate in two or three days leaving us no better off but if we could bleed water into the stem kirsty said cautiously maybe via an iv line just until the roots recover there was a moments silence oh said susie on a note of discovery and then ohhh im not sure if itd work kirsty warned itd be better than sitting watching him die and he might get infection from the iv site theres stuff you put on pruned branches to stop infection susies despair had suddenly evaporated transforming into excitement do you have what you need to put in an intravenous line jakes lent me a hospital car its the one they take out to emergencies when they need backup theres an emergency kit in the back there has to be an iv kit then what are we waiting for youve done what on the end of the line jake sounded incredulous hed rung to tell kirsty the plane was due to take off at two and hed got a stepbystep account of their medical procedure from an excited susie but susie had been too excited to make sense shed handed the phone over to kirsty and gone back outside to continue supervision of their patient weve set up an iv line on spike kirsty said trying not to sound smug we used a tiny cannula and were running straight saline at the rate of mil per hour the leaves closest to spike are already starting to stiffen believe it or not it might just work youre kidding me youre not the only doctor who can be a generalist when the case requires it she told him giving up on the smug bit she felt smug why not admit it no there was a moments silence kirsty do you know how the pumpkin came to be pulled out kirstys smugness faded i cant imagine she said slowly maybeboris digging does it look like boris has been digging no and suddenly she knew what he was thinking what she would have thought of if susie hadnt been so traumatised only someone wishing to do enormous ill to angus would do such a thing whos there now jake was demanding me and susie go inside and lock the doors im coming home he was being paranoid kirsty thought ok kenneth might well be responsible for an uprooted pumpkin hed know how much the pumpkin meant to angus and itd be an easy way to hurt him but as for locking themselves in but then she remembered the way kenneth had looked at susie and suddenly she stopped thinking jake was paranoid susie had been inside having a drink when the phone had rung but she hadnt been able to stay in shed returned to the veggie patch boris beside her kirsty made her way back there now jake was being overcautious she told herself there was no danger she rounded the hedge and kenneth was there with susie kenneth was pointing a gun straight at her sisters head from heat to icy cold just like that the world stilled in her nice safe hospice back in nice safe manhattan kirsty had an emergency beeper she carried in her pocket linked to the security service for the main hospital shed never used it she ached for her beeper right now kenneth she said sharply to distract him trying to haul that pointing arm away from susie susie was leaning heavily on her crutches looking ill youre her kenneth said indistinctly and those two words told kirsty a lot they told her that he was illhis speech was slurred and wary they told her he was desperate and they told her that the twin thing was confusing him who are you he demanded im susie kirsty said desperately into the stillness his finger was around the trigger and she felt sick im rorys wife no he had that right at least the gun firmed levelled now at susies belly shes the one shes pregnant and ive looked it up again everythings entailed the old man dies and the kid gets everything the title the land back in scotland even most of this place im screwed he focused again on susie i came this morning to make you sorry i saw the pumpkin and i knew how much the old man loved it and i was right wasnt i the shock nearly killed him theyve carted him off with a heart attack and any minute now hell be dead and whats his will be mine ive just got to get rid of you angus isnt dying kirsty said urgently but she was ignored i thought when i killed rory that itd be easy dear god kirsty saw susies face blench and she thought her twin might fall over she took an involuntary step forward but the gun waved in her direction and she stilled again thats right he snarled you thought it was an accident didnt you you all did it was too damned easy i knew he was married and i had to move fast but that place where you lived all i had to do was fiddle with the steering you know how easy it is to slice through steering rods bash it so it looks like its been damaged in the past cut it almost through and then wait i hoped youd both die but when it was only rory i didnt care but i might have known youd be pregnant you wont get away with it this time though kirsty said trying frantically to keep her voice calm controlled you shoot susie and youll have a nationwide manhunt starting right now kenneth leave us be just go while you can im not shooting you he said you think im stupid i think youre pointing a gun at us and ill shoot you if i have to he told her id rather we were all dead than rorys kid gets the old mans wealth roryd still win that way but ive set up a better way and youre in it too regardless of who the hell you are youre not going to shoot us anything to keep the attention from susie she thought how long would it take jake to get there too long she couldnt keep him talking ive fixed it he told her almost triumphant i came here this morning and saw everyone and thought the only way to go was get her the gun waved again to susie on her own make it seem like an accident so i rigged the boat and came back the boat down the cliff he told her move susie cant climb down the cliff susie can barely walk thats where you come in then he snarled you get her down the cliff or i take her to the steep bit and push her over move both of you now what followed was a nightmare the castle was built high above the road across the road was the cliff and a worn track leading down to the beach kirsty could scramble down the cliff easily but for susie whod only just learned to balance herself on her crutches it was almost impossible almost if there hadnt been a gun pointing at them it would indeed have been impossible but hed given them no choice get down to the beach under your own steam or die first he was mad enough to do it kirsty thought he had some slivers of rational thoughtone being that it would be better if bodies were found without bulletholesbut little else he was having trouble differentiating between susie and kirsty once hed met susie and shed been like kirsty now kirsty was like susie and susie was differentscarred and pregnant his muddled mind wasnt too sure but his crazed logic told him to kill them both so the gun pointed at them both kirsty struggled to hold her twin upright as they staggered slowly down the path and she couldnt find a way out hurry kenneth screamed but they could go no faster than a snails pace and even kenneth had to concede that hurrying was impossible boris loped along beside them ready for adventure kenneth ignored him the dog was racing back up over and over again as if saying hurry hurry theres a great wet world down herebut kirsty knew there was no such thing would he kill them on the beach he had some sort of plan how long would jake take to get home how long would it take him to know their absence wasnt innocent hed know after that barked command to stay inside and lock the doors that she and susie wouldnt leave and the cars were testament to that but he wouldnt think of the beach hed never believe susie would get that far and hed waste valuable time searching the castle the grounds the bushland to the rear i cant susie whimpered and kirstys arm came round her rock solid yes you can shut up kenneth snapped kenneth youre ruining your life doing this she murmured trying to keep her voice measured fighting to make him see logic youll never get away with killing us let us go and well forget this ever happened i killed rory he told them shoving susie hard with the gun so she fell against kirsty and kirsty had to fight to keep her upright you think im going to kill my brother and then let some stupid kid take what belongs to me it belongs to angus she said one of susies crutches had fallen aside kirsty was acting as her support on one side and susies sole attention was keeping her remaining crutch in place so she wouldnt crumple where she stood kirsty was aware that susie was weeping but she was weeping silently she wasnt fighting kirsty thought in despair it was as if susie had always known that something like this would happen once rory had died why go on herself she had to fight for them both kenneths gun jabbed susie again faster how could she fight this should she drop susie and launch herself at the gun what would james bond do in a situation like this she asked herself desperately and then thought that james bond didnt have a pregnant crippled sister to protect as he coped with the bad guy if it had just been her even if it had just been her she had no idea how to escape how accurate was a gun like that how fast would she have to run james bond might have all the answers she had none all she could do was struggle to hold susie up and pray jake please jake finally they reached the beach they rounded the last rocky outcrop and kirsty saw that kenneth had been here before this must have been what hed done this morning hed come hed checked the castle hed hauled up his uncles pumpkin in fury then hed gone away and coldly found what hed needed there were two boats in the cove a motorboat was anchored a few feet from shore and a dilapidated wooden dinghy was hauled up on the sand a towrope connected the two get into the dinghy kenneth snapped now what are you going to do if it was just her she could run she thought desperately she could take her chances dodge or something not calmly do as he demanded but susie was immobile a target who could no more dodge bullets than fly just shut up and get in they made it to the boat with kirsty half pulling susie half carrying her the crutch was useless on the soft sand susie was clutching her sister and kirsty could feel her shaking and suddenly there was a part of kirsty that stopped being terrified suddenly she was just plain angry coldly calculatingly angry would he take them out to sea and shoot them you know bodies get washed up to shore she told him making her voice flat and emotionless if were washed up with bulletholes youll still be in the frame for murder youll not get bulletholes unless you ask for them he snarled he was standing in the shallows close to where the motorboat was moored get into the dinghy kirsty looked at the scenario and knew what was happening theyd get in the ancient dinghy hed get into the motor boat and hed tow them out to sea to what where was jake jake hurry susie was clutching the side of the dinghy she fell to her knees and kirsty dropped onto the sand beside her we have to get in she told her come on we can both swim well take our chances hell kill us get in kenneth yelled and kirsty started to rise were working on it boris was suddenly with them again hed been chasing a gull further down the beach but now he came flying along the sand quivering his delight get the dog out of it kenneth screamed and levelled the gun at boris if you kill the dog itll still be evidence that youve hurt us kirsty yelled and the gun lowered shove him away then i dont want him in the boat go find jake boris kirsty saidhopelessly stupid dog she needed a lassie lassie would have brought a whole army of rescue personnel by now and shed have had kenneth handcuffed to her collar and helpless lassie was away playing movie star boris was all she had boris lassie her hand fell to the sand there was a thin strand of dried seaweed lying beside her go home boris she said and she pushed the dog away via her neck via her collar a seagull descended not twenty feet away and boris was off again barking wildly as he hared down the beach the strand of seaweed was dangling from his collar it stayed put as he ran it was all she could do kirsty thought bleakly as a letter for help it lacked a certain je ne sais quoi but she had nothing else please dont let it fall out please let jake see it she could do no more two minutes later they were in the dinghy kenneth was in the motorboat hed towed the dinghy off the sand and they were heading for the open sea where are they jake reached the castle just as margie and the twins returned and they werent out of the car before he barked the question kirsty and susie where are they theyll be out in the vegetable garden margie said placidly penelope you carry the bag with the ice cream alice youre in charge of the meat daddys frightened alice said with perspicacity but jake wasnt listening he was striding through the garden gate wanting to see for himself they werent in the vegetable garden theyd been here though he stared at spike with his hightech dripstand and his iv drip despite his unease he felt his lips quirk with amusement kirsty was one amazing doctor he thought he looked at the neat bandage wrapping the needle to spikes stem and thought wow she was no palliativecare physician she brought patients back from the dead theyd be inside they must be they werent no ones home daddy penelope told him as he burst through the kitchen door we went to see if susie wanted ice cream arent they in the garden are you worried about kenneth margie asked her eyes clouding as she caught his fear she was speaking lightly so as not to concern the girls but jakes daughters were bright is the nasty man here again alice asked i dont think so jake said but his hand was already reaching for his phone he wanted the police he wanted help now heres boris alice said as boris raced through the open back door yuck hes all wet and hes got stuff stuck in his collar penelope said seaweed kenneth was crazy but not stupid once they were in the boat kirsty had had a vague idea that they could jump out and swim the day was hot and calm and even if susie couldnt swim far she could float if he simply dumped them at sea then they had a chance but kenneth had never intended that they simply be dumped he was crazy but there still seemed logic in his plan he kept his gun trained on susie she was the one who couldnt move with speed and he must have known instinctively that kirsty would never leave her he trained the gun on them until their boat was wrenched off the beach and the motorboat hit full throttle kirstys small hope died the water was so still that even if they jumped all he had to do was take pot shots at them until they were dead maybe he knew where there were sharks kirsty thought and the idea made her even colder made her heart almost stop the old wooden boat was hardly seaworthy it was taking in water but that was the least of her terrors susie was crouched in the bow and kirsty had her arms around her taking comfort as much as giving it whatll he do i dont know kirsty said and then she glanced ahead and suddenly she did know they were a milemaybe twooffshore here the smoothness of the sea was broken by a line of ragged rocks seemingly emerging from the ocean floor eight or so rocks a tiny reef like a row of vicious teeth with a couple broken off kenneth was heading straight towards it faster and faster hed put his gun down and in the full sunlight kirsty saw the flash of a knife she knew what he intended hed take them in so they were headed straight for the rocks and then hed slice the towrope kirsty thought in horror theyd continue so fast that their boat would splinter on the reef and afterwards she never got to afterwards she was hauling susie away from the bow of the boat screaming to her hauling her to the side to the lowest point hes going to smash us on the rocks she screamed dear god if they jumped now theyd still be in calm water she thought hed still be able to get near them their only hope was in waiting and susie knew her twins hand held hers steadying when one twin was in danger the other knew and how much more so now when they were both in deadly peril kenneth had turned away watching the reef he had to he needed to steer until he was almost on the rocks waiting until the last possible moment so they had maximum velocity wait she didnt have to say it theyd hauled themselves hard up on the side of the boat and for a sickening moment the boat lurched and kirsty thought it might go over too soon too soon kenneths boat was a hundred yards from the reef fifty thirty now it happened so fast the cable was sliced through the boat lurched with their sideways motion but kept going kept goingand the women inside fell backwards out of the boat and slammed hard against the surface of the water chapter ten the impact stunned kirsty there was a sharp hot pain across her chest that threatened to overwhelm her as she sank but susies hand was in hers susie was still with her and as she rose to the surface she felt susies grip tighten theyd waited almost too long almost the boats momentum had become their momentum so they were in the wash of white water around the rocks and there was a spray of wood around them splintering parts of the dinghy that had gone forward and smashed hard into the rocks without them they were safe not yet kenneth would still be concentrating on getting his boat clear kirsty thought in the vestige of brain she had left to think of things apart from breathing and staying afloat and ignoring the pain in her chest hed come so close that hed have had to pull an almost oneeightydegree turn to haul his boat away susie was tugging her injured and pregnant as she was susie was rising to their need faster than kirsty the waves were crashing against the rocks this could be a maelstrom at times but not today today the sea was kind the waves werent so great they couldnt fight them and susies hand was hauling her further into the white water rather than away from it in the white water lay their only protection kenneth mustnt see them both of them knew that their hope lay in him being too intent on hauling his boat away from the rocks to have seen what theyd done so they surfaced but they surfaced with fear with their heads barely above the water susie made a tiny hand movement a movement like that of a porpoise maybe hed picked the wrong twins for a watery death kirsty thought fighting back pain and for a moment she allowed herself a glimmer of hope she and susie had played water polohad lived for the game as youngsters susies hand movement meant meet you under water in that direction a fast glance showed she was indicating the only gap in the line of rocks the gap held a mass of white water but maybe it was possible and if they could get through they couldnt do it with linked hands and both of them knew it susies legs were so weak shed be slow but the pain in kirstys chest meant that shed be limited as well shed cracked a rib she thought and gave herself a tiny test breathe in breathe out it hurt but her breathing wasnt impeded maybe she hadnt punctured a lung susies hand was squeezing hers and her eyes were questioning shed know kirsty was in pain but they had no choice and both of them knew it meet you through the rocks go now and amazingly she did it kirsty used her feet kicking hard under the surface of the water duckdiving ignoring the scream of protest in her chest somehow she found the gap the waves were crashing against her pushing her sideways she had to surface just for a moment to reorientate to breathe but the gap was right where shed seen it and down she went againand through through she surfaced and then she had to wait only for seconds but they stayed as some of the longest seconds in her life please let susie be safe how could she get through her legs had no strength she was eight months pregnant eight months pregnant please and then the water exploded beside her and her twin was with her and she was even laughing this was the susie whod been at her side since childhood a tomboy a reckless brave laughing hothead whod chosen landscape gardening as a profession because shed loved playing in mud and whose light had only been dimmed by rorys death somehow in the past few days the old susie had started to resurface and now kenneths threats had lifted her right back to life let him get us now susie said she grabbed kirstys hands and they were treading water behind the rocks their heads were still barely above the water and there were waves breaking between them and the horizon even if kenneth brought the boat round to their side of the rocks he wouldnt be able see them the only way he could was to bring his boat so far that hed risk his own boat being smashed how long should they stay there how long would kenneth wait hed see that their boat was a splintered mess he would assume that theyd be injured at the very least desperately injured and miles from the mainland he wouldnt wait long kirsty thought and they could stay treading water whats hurting susie asked i think i might have cracked a rib kirsty told her no drama how about you i can tread water for hours no she couldnt kirsty thought she wasnt as strong as shed thought the adrenalin was high now but after an hour or so in the water maybe they could get up onto one of the rocks in a little while shed check and see if it was possible but not yet not yet jake you have to find us the beach was deserted but there were signs that thered been people there there were footsteps in the sand three different ones two smallerwomens one larger and a dogs pawprints there was a deep indentation in the sand a boat had been dragged up here and then dragged off again he had them in a boat jake thought his heart almost stopping where well call in the chopper fred mackie dolphin bays only policeman was looking as grim as jake felt if its not being used they can get here in less than half an hour half an hour freds hand was on jakes shoulder meanwhile ill have every boat out of harbour searching if he kills them at sea hes mad but not that mad fred said uneasily though since fred had known kenneth as a boy ill call in the psychiatric crisis assessment team the phone sounded on jakes belt if hed been sensible jake wouldnt have answered it but he answered automatically jake it was angus what the hell theyre saying he has the girls angus sounded breathless and desperately worried now dont dont protect me angus snapped the nurses here have been doing that i knew something was wrong word travels round this place faster than youd believe and the girl who came to take my obs looked sick wouldnt tell me why and that made me think it had to be kenneth so i rang ben boyce and hes with me now dont worry of course im worrying he snarled i should have found the strength to say something this morning i saw spike and i knew it had to be him the thing isi know where he might have taken them where hes dead scared of guns angus said fascinated by them but when they go off he turns to jelly his father used to tease him with them which helped a whole lot i dont think im telling you now that he might threaten them with a gun but i doubt hed use it but if he wanted to do mischief tell me theres rottooth rocks angus said and jake thought he should stop him now because he could hear from anguss whispered speech that the old man was pushing himself past the limit to impart what he felt he ought to a line of rocks about two miles out to sea nornor east you look on a nautical map ill find them jake said quickly why do you think theyre there kenneth killed a dog that way once angus whispered rorys dog that was why rory left rory was staying with mehim and his great black lab that went everywhere with him kenneth came down and hated rory being here he took the lab out to sea on a makeshift raft and dashed him against the rocks oh god move fast jake angus whispered move fast they had to get out of the water theyd crouched behind the rocks for fifteen minutes now growing colder and more terrified by the minute kirstys chest was hurting but that was the least of her worries susie was growing quieter finally she stopped talking altogether she stopped responding to kirstys prompts kirsty thought enough it was a risk to leave their safe haven but a bigger risk to stay one of the rocks had a flattish surface just clear of the water if they could manage susie im climbing up ill tug you up after me susie didnt answer kirsty hauled her round to face her susies eyes were wide with pain focused inward whats wrong nothing yeah right but she had no choice at least the tide was going out more of the rocks were being exposed meaning once they got onto the rock theyd be out of the water for hours long enough for jake to find them as long as kenneth had gone please she grabbed susies hands and tugged her across the gap to the flat rock if they had both been well this would have been a cinch but susies legs were so weak and she was so bulky and kirstys chest hurt she paused and did a bit more test breathing if it hurt this much she surely must have punctured a lungbut her breathing was ok im being a wuss she whispered to susie and susie managed a reply twin wusses wusses who have to climb a rock and somehow they did kirsty first waiting for a wave to give her momentum hauling herself up trying not to cry out as her chest hit the flat unforgiving surface trying not to stay flailing like a beached whale trying to look up searching the horizon fearful that kenneth would be justthere the horizon was empty problem number one despatched she thought with a twinge of triumph before the bigger twinge of her cracked rib washed back ignore the rib now susie and she did have to ignore the rib the only way to get susie onto the rock was to reach down with both hands and pull where was her doctors bag when she needed it her kingdom for morphine morphine wasnt available forget morphine she pulled and susie tried to help and couldnt twice kirsty hauled and she didnt think she could do it but then a wave bigger than the rest washed in and lifted susies body momentarily she slithered onto the rock so there were two beached whales now they lay unmoving not speaking while kirstys pain subsided from agony to just plain awful but theyd done it they were out of the water and kenneth was gone jake would come were ok she whispered and reached out to squeeze susies hand susie squeezed back with such force that kirsty yelped we now only have one problem susie whispered at last which is kirsty wasnt so sure about not having punctured her lung now she found she could scarcely breathe i think ive just had my fourth contraction how fast can we make this thing go rod hendrys fishing trawler was the only boat in harbour that was complete with skipper when jake and sgt mackie arrived to commandeer anything that moved the policeman was now barking orders into his radio while jake stood by rod at the tiller and pushed him to go faster if we go any faster mate the engine will go ahead without the boat rod told him im doing fastern safe as it is then his eyes narrowed against the sun speaking of fastwho the hell is that jake looked he grabbed rods field glasses and focused a speedboat powerful a man crouched low in the back thatd be scott currys speedboat rod said i saw it go out earlier he frowned that cant be right scotts in queensland itll be kenneth jake said flatly the speedboat was altering course now moving away from the fishing boat rather than closer to it fred he yelled to the policeman and fred gazed through the glasses as jake explained you want me to chase him rod asked semihopeful but they all knew chasing a speedboat with a fishing trawler was impossible ill contact base fred said grimly hes alone in the boat now ill have someone else pick him up meanwhile we get to the rocks jake demanded go if he was towing a dinghy with a boat that powerful fred said thoughtfully but jake cut him off before he could finish they all knew what could have happened what had probably already happened i said i wouldnt date her jake whispered and fred looked at his familys doctor in surprise thatd be a first he said gently teasing you wanting to date someone i dont want to date her jake said desperately i want to marry her twoinch dilatation susie youre moving like a train you have to slow down how can i slow down susie whispered desperately cross my legs i dont think so ow pant through contractions kirsty told her whatever you do dont push first labours were supposed to be long she thought desperately but then susie had already gone into premature labour once and it had been suppressed there was nothing here to suppress labour she needed alcohol drips sedation quiet and if the baby was born they were wet and cold already they had nothing to warm a premature baby it would hardly be prem susie was only three weeks before full term it couldnt come she hauled her soaking windcheater over her head and folded it so susie had something approaching a pillow their rock was all of five feet long by three feet wide it sloped two feet above the water at one end one foot at the other as a delivery room it made a great rock im scared susie whimpered and kirsty hauled herself together and tried to sound professional now now mrs douglas what on earth is there to fret about women have babies all the time this is just a water birth with a difference susie tried to smilebut failed i want my bath heated please doctor nonsense she had to pause as another contraction washed over her twin less than two minutes apart uhoh susie was gripping her hand so tightly she was almost reaching bone youll write a book about this she told susie as the pain eased natural birth with a difference sea sun and dolphins and no intervention at all id like enya on the stereo susie said trying to match her mood no enya kirsty was clutching at straws wed need technology to play enya and think of the germs wed have to contend with hospitals are full of golden staph and i bet sound systems have their share too you wouldnt want your baby catching golden staph no indeed susie took a rasping breath and humour died kirsty i cant really have my baby on this rock i suspect you dont have a choice kirsty said and as the next contraction hit she thought no it was more than a suspicion they were miles from anywhere when the tide came in theyd be in the water somewhere there was kenneth intent on murder and they were having a baby if i ever suggested i didnt need a man in my life can i change my mind now she said under her breath jake i need you now rottooth rocks are that white line on the horizon the moment rod said it jake had the field glasses fixed on the horizon cant we go faster he was ignored closer i think jake was straining to see and rod grabbed the glasses back from him the big fishermans eyes were creased from staring at the sea all his life he focused and what he saw he dropped the glasses and gunned the motor so hard black smoke started coming out the rear hey the police sergeant said startled youll kill us theyre on the rock rod snapped from hereones crouching over but onehell maybe ones dead theres a boat coming kirsty whispered it to susie but susie was no longer listening she was in a mist of pain and terror she should have an epidural kirsty thought numbly to have this type of pressure on her already damaged back to have this level of pain there was a boat coming was it kenneth it was still too far away to make out they couldnt slip back down into the water now they couldnt hide another contraction merging into the last no susie screamed kirsty no breathe into it kirsty said firmly releasing the clutching fingers and moving to where she needed to be which gave her exactly six inches of balancing space before she toppled into the sea ok susie if you must you must push kirsty they were near enough to be heard jake was at the side of the boat yelling frantically to the girls on the rock kirsty was kneeling over susie and he couldnt seehe couldnt see she must be able to hear him kirsty fifty yards thirty i darent go closer rod muttered but before he finished saying it jake was over the side stroking his way desperately through the white water one minute kirsty was frantic despairing the next jake was beside her hauling himself up on the rock assessing fast whats happening he snapped and kirsty gave a choked cry of fear and shock jake was grasping her shoulders pulling her aside she was too close to susie for him to be able to see back into medical mode here dr mcmahon and snap just like that it returned somehow enough for her to be able to falter the cord its round the neck i cant stop she was picked up and lifted to the other end of the rock where there was a tiny amount of space by susies head jake was crouching down his big hands moving susie stop pushing he snapped so loudly that kirsty jumped in shock pant dont push youre not to push susie stop kirsty knew what he was doing it was what shed been trying to do but her hands were so cold they were numb the pain in her chest was too sharp she didnt have the strength hed be pushing the baby back just a bit just a little so he could manoeuvre there it was a sigh of triumph and susie cried out i canti cant its ok jake said still triumphant push susie love go for it and ten seconds later rosie kirsteen douglas emerged into the world two miles out to sea on a flat piece of rock not much bigger than a man seven pounds eleven ounces and with the healthiest set of lungs a baby could be blessed with jake held her in his hands moving swiftly ripping up his shirt tying the cord with a scrap of fabric holding her upjust for a secondso the men in the boat could see holding her for another millisecond so kirsty could see and then smiling down at susie showing her her baby and tucking the tiny newborn under susies sodden windcheater tight against her skin after the mammoth effort susie had made her breasts had to be warmest place available kirsty thought it was the warmest place until they could get themselves off the rock sensible but kirsty was no longer sensible susie was smiling and smiling cradling her body into a protective curve no longer aware of anything but this new little life that was gloriously hers kirsty was weeping her head was in her hands and she was out of control and when jake swore and managed to get himself to where he could reach her touch her take her into his arms and hold her the weeping only grew worse she was lost she didnt cry she never cried she cried now as if shed cry for ever chapter eleven she woke and she was on the wrong side of a hospital bed the inside rather than the outside it was so extraordinary that she had to shake her head to make herself believe she wasnt dreaming shaking her head wasnt a good idea shaking anything wasnt good she stayed very still indeed and when babs tiptoed in to do her obs and kirsty spoke babs gave a squeak of surprise i thought you were asleep just very very still kirsty said cautiously she reached out and grabbed babss wrist anxious that this contact with the outside world not be broken whats happening youre black and blue and red all over babs said cheerfully if you want a more technical medical diagnosis ill have to get your doctor which since your doctor has been pacing the corridor for the past two hours waiting for you to wake up wont be too hard at all let me take your blood pressure and temp and ill fetch him and then as she looked at kirstys face she grinned and relented ok ill fetch him now something tells me your blood pressure before and after you see your treating doctor might be very different before kirsty could reply shed whisked herself out of the roomand one minute later jake was there he stood in the doorway with such an expression of anxiety on his face that kirsty almost laughed almost you had to move your chest to laugh and she wasnt about to do any such thing jake in two strides hed reached her taking her hand stooping to kiss her forehead her lips kirsty hey am i dying she managed weakly i dont even act like this with patients two minutes before the end you could have died he growled his voice breaking with emotion he hauled a chair up and sat beside her without letting go of her hand which was very satisfactory indeed kirsty will you marry me her world stilled marry too much was happening too fast this was crazy it couldnt be happening um no she whispered and then at the look on his face she added an addendum well not yet theres things i need to sort out first his face cleared i havent actually got the marriage celebrant out in the hall he told her with a rueful smileand kissed her again what do we need to sort out she was having trouble sorting out her head ive been asleep we gave you ten milligrams of morphine before we winched you off the rock he told her you gave me morphine i was so worried about the baby i didnt see you were in trouble he said then you disintegrated hey i did not disintegrate theres my girl he said approvingly ok you had a wee sniffle you sniffled until the medical evacuation helicopter arrived from barnham we winched susie and the little one up and lowered them onto the boat then we put the harness on you and you proceeded to pass out im sure i didnt she said with an attempt at indignation which didnt quite come off theres no shame in passing out when some stupid medic tries to winch a patient with two broken ribs he told her rule at accident scenes examine and dont take anyones word that theyre not injured hell kirsty your chest is a mess you must have thumped into a rock when you went overboard susie said you hauled her up onto the rock and how you did it his voice broke ive heard of mothers lifting cars off injured kids adrenalin or something it was the bravest susie she said cutting across a description that was starting to unsettle her more even than she was already unsettled it wasnt so much what he was saying it was how he was looking at her as he said it like hed found a new world tell me about susie she managed before he could start again and he took a couple of seconds to recover his voice to make it work again susies great we winched her and the baby over to the boat but she proceeded to sit up and watch as you were winched off the moment she realised youd passed out it was like shed assumed another body she was battered and bruised and shed just given birth after the battering shed taken she should have been unconscious herself instead she was hugging her baby so tight it took two of us to prise her away so we could examine her she was sitting up on the deck yelling at us to take care of you and to bring more doctors she was saying that i was too emotionally involved to treat you and she wanted specialists and to get a team of the best doctors down at the wharf to take control the moment we docked kirsty smiled that was the susie she knew bossy happy in charge of her world oh welcome back susie and the baby really is fine jake smiled a lovely wide smile that encompassed the world rose is gorgeous rose and her mother are currently asleep in the ward next door in the next bed is angus whos refused to go to sydney until hes seen you safe he and susie have both gone to sleep with rosies incubator between them and i cant tell who looks the proudest incubator only until were absolutely sure shes warm but its a precaution im sure we dont need shes fine how wonderful but there was one more question one more thing that had to be asked kenneth his face clouded can it wait no his hold on her hand tightened not good tell me we saw him while we were heading out to the rocks jake said softly angus told us where to lookand why what he said made us think we ought to keep on going but the police sergeant got on the radio and by the time kenneth reached harbour he had a reception committee but they didnt arrest him there was something about his voice that told her he headed out to sea again the fisheries and wildlife patrol boat went after him they followed him for about half an hour not approaching just waiting for him to run out of fuel they knew he was sick then kirsty asked but by the look on jakes face she already knew what was coming he came close to shore jake said grimly they thought hed beach the boat and make a run for it then at the last minute he just hit the throttle took the boat up to maximum speedwhich on that boat is enormousand steered straight at the rocks he didnt stand a chance oh no she lay still letting the enormity of what had happened sink in dear god mental illness is such a void jake said sadly theres so much we dont know maybe if i had my time again id train to be a psychiatrist and then dolphin bay would miss out on having the best family doctor in the world kirsty said softly oh jake which leads back to my original question jake whispered ive just watched a doctor under the most extraordinarily difficult circumstances rescue a patient from drowning perform a flawless delivery hey you delivered perform a flawless delivery jake repeated knowing to a nicety when to accept help it was your timing but he wasnt letting her get a word in edgeways and you did all that when you were so battered yourself that you should have been prostrate with pain ive decided this place needs another doctor i decided that a long time ago but now im certain and that other doctors you kirsty mcmahon i love you so much you cant love me how can i not you dont do love any more yes i do now i do i propositioned you she whispered i goaded you on and very nicely you goaded too but you only asked for a kiss he assumed a look of virtue im taking it further im asking for your hand in marriage it was too much the pain was whirling back again making her senses swim she looked up into his eyes and she saw love and desire and all she wanted to do was sink into those eyesforgetforget marriage jake this isnt fair jake whispered seeing the doubt and confusion and pain in her eyes i wont push you i cant think she had to think she must jake dont he said softly he bent and kissed her lightly on the forehead brushing the saltstiff curls away and letting his fingers rest on her face ill give you something now thatll send you right back into the land of nod and when you wake up we can start again start lets start again kirsty he said softly lets forget you propositioned me lets forget i was a dope and now lets forget i proposed marriage but alsolets forget your fear of commitment your belief that the people around you will die your fear of moving forward sleep my lovely kirsty and wake up to your new world our new world starting now he kept to his word for the next few weeks while kirstys battered body healed while she came to terms with what had happened and while her world righted itself on its axis jake left talk of marriage alone firstly he was her doctor one of the fractured ribs was displaced with sharp rib ends protruding toward the lung and when the air ambulance took angus to sydney it took kirsty as well she needed specialist thoracic surgery you were so lucky you didnt pierce a lung jake growled when he showed her the xrays the fragmented bone was so close so close he strapped her with professional care he handed her over to the careflight doctors with clinical efficiency and only at the last minute did he stoop and kiss her hard briefly lovingly on the lips he didnt ring her in sydney more than a concerned family doctor might have a very caring doctor shed spent a week in sydney a kindly anaesthetist had given her an intercostal block out of pain shed slept and slept and her doctors had looked at the amount shed been sleeping and decreed that she take as long as she needed so when she returnedby road ambulance this time angus was ready to return with her his bypass had been gloriously successful he still had his petdogoxygencannister with him but his breathing was easy his eyes were alive with excitement and he beamed all the way home he had susie to go home to for susie would stay as long as the old man had left kirsty thought susie had rung her over and over while shed been in sydney she had described the perfection of her daughter she had described how much better her walking was without the burden of pregnancy and kirsty was no sooner back at the castle than she was taken out to be shown spike jakes been replenishing his iv drip every day susie told her hes been wonderful is he still staying here he took the girls home this morning susie saidwith no more than a sideways glance at her sister he said you and angus needed to rest and youll rest better without the twins and boris around all the time margie has arranged for her sister to help with the housework until were all fit again which would be soon kirsty thought watching her sister cradling her baby daughter watching her laugh with angus boss angus boss kirsty into resting shed dreaded the babys birth fearing postnatal depression instead the birth had catapulted susie to the other side so jake will comewhen he said hell come tonight and every night while we still need him susie told him for angus for angus and it was for angus jake arrived that night and he spent half an hour with the earl he came downstairs and chatted to kirsty and susie and if his eyes were warm and loving as they looked at kirstywell they were warm when they looked at susie as well and also as he looked down into rosies cradle and smiled and gave the tiny baby his little finger to hold kirsty walked him to the door afterwards and tried to thank him but he took her shoulders in his hands and kissed herlightly on the lips but still far too lightly for her likingand put her away again dont thank me for loving kirsty he told her its all coming together for both of them she knew it but it was as if they both needed time now space to come to terms with what they knew was inevitable she knew the townsfolk were looking at them but she didnt mind she knew susie was big with questions but she didnt mind that either one day soon itd be right but not yetnot yet her job back home was still waiting for her she made no irrevocable decision but she did phone robert and tell him that he should find someone else its a shame robert said weve always been such good friends yes but ive found more she thought but she didnt say it she hardly dared say it herself she didnt think of the future as her ribs healed she did a little medicineshe ran a few clinics she went out to see mavis and spent quite some time at that ladys bedside like susie mavis wasnt asking questions she was almost totally painfree now and her bright inquisitive mind was working at full capacitybut she made no comment about kirsty and jake it was time out it was a time of knowing that happy ever after was just around the corner but not to be rushednot to be rushed and then came harvest thanksgiving harvest thanksgiving in dolphin bay was huge from the moment kirsty had entered the town shed known that this was the biggest festival on the calendar it took the form of a fête a twoday celebration where fun and laughter and affirmation of life was the order of the day it was also spikes moment of glory the districts best jams and jellies most obedient dog highest spongeand widest pumpkinwere all on show angus was to open the proceedings he fretted for days beforehand i couldnt be doing it last year he told them i had pneumonia but ill be getting there this year if it kills me it almost did he spent two hours getting into his full scottish regalia and at the end he had to have a wee lie down kirsty went into his bedroom and found him gasping without oxygen if you think you can open the festival dead you can think again she told him hooking up his oxygen tube and swiping his hand away as he tried to protest the laird of loganaich would never have anything as sissy as an oxygen cylinder he told her and kirsty gazed around the room saw a discarded sash and wound the offending cylinder with the douglas clan there she said the laird of loganaich would find it impossible to leave his loyal and appropriately clad companion behind youd be as bossy as your sister no ones as bossy as susie susies staying on angus said in quiet satisfaction shes promised how about you lass kirsty fiddled adjusting the tartan youre marking time angus said softly waiting for what to be sure she whispered hes sure he was every day kirsty saw jakes certainty grow he still didnt push her he was simply her friendthe friend who laughed with her who talked to her of her patients as she grew more enmeshed in this little community who shared the love and laughter of his little girls you cant be keeping him waiting for ever angus said and kirsty nodded tying the sash with a defiant tug i know so whats holding you back its likeive been so selfcontained for so long she whispered but now im happy youd be fearful that if you take the next step youll compromise what you already have my mothers death tore my family apart she told him my parents were in love but after mom died dad juststopped and susieshe gave herself completely and when rory died she came close to dying as well so youll not go that last step ii will she knew she must she loved jake so much but this last step its a hard hurdle angus told her between deep breaths that replenished his oxygenstarved lungs but its part of life lass you love and risk losing or you dont love at all and then youve lost already deirdre and i had the best fun here i am left with just a bunch of plastic chandeliers and old queen vic in the bathroombut i wouldnt be having it any other way i had forty glorious years of my lovely deidre and here i am falling in love all over again with a wee mite called rose whos twisted around my heart like he paused as the sound of a horn sounded from the forecourt and wiped a surreptitious tear from his wrinkled cheek enough ill be getting maudlin but dont you be risking things by waiting too long lass no she wouldnt all she had to do was say yes she thought as she drove her cargo of angus and susie and rosie in her baby seatand spike in a trailer in the rearto the fair jake was already there alice and penelope whooped up to them the minute they arrived big with all the news of girls whod been deprived of their favourite people for a whole two days they talked jake chatted and joked with angus and susie but all the time kirsty knew jake was watching her no she thought it was different he wasnt watching her he was justwith her she had to take this leap she loved him all she had to do was say yes but she stood apart a little part of this extended family but not quite taking this final step not quite angus played his part in style that choked her up the bagpipes started reaching a crescendo of drums and music that could have come straight from a grey scottish gloaming and then there was anguss speech full of wry humour pulling in each and every one of the people present he truly was the laird kirsty thought her eyes misting with love for the old man his speech was hardly marred by his need for oxygen and the cylinder was inconspicuous behind him how long did he have pulmonary fibrosis was a killer soonsoon not now she glanced up and jakes eyes were on her she met his look full on soon the pumpkin judging was early on the agenda at the appointed hour kirsty and jake brought the trailer round and hauled in a few hands to help tug spike onto the judging dais there were yells of appreciation he has to win kirsty said thanks to dr mcmahon and her magic medication jake said grinning is an iv line illegal in pumpkin circles like doping in sport we cut the stalk away jake said the evidence is rotting in anguss compost patch and i doubt theyve invented a urine test for pumpkins and then there was another cry of awe and they turnedto see another pumpkin being hauled across the judging area a huge pumpkin vast bigger than spike whose kirsty breathed and a head bobbed up from behind the pumpkin and beamed ben boyce hi he said and he looked at angus and his beam darned near split his face youyou for a moment kirsty thought angus was heading for apoplexy she moved toward him but anguss face was recovering his colour turning the healthy red of true indignation you traitor why traitor ben saidall innocence i grew my pumpkin in my back yard and you grew yours in yours whats the harm in that you helped with my pumpkin so i did ben said his wife was firmly tucked by his side and he was walking with a step that was almost sprightly totally at odds with the gnarled appearance of his arthritisaffected bones it wouldnt have been sporting not to have helped he beamed again as his pumpkin was hoisted onto the scales her names fatso by the way he told them and shes a better doer than spike thirstier angus gasped you dont meant to tell me you used iv lines of course we did ben said when you started using them i got some medical advice we watched doc mcmahon do yours and my maggies a nurse we owe you a vote of thanks doc he told kirsty who choked unnoticedor maybe noticed but unobtrusivejakes arm came around her waist fatso will have to win susie was saying she lifted rosie out of her baby sling and perched her small wrinkled person on top of the pumpkin cameras went wild oh angus do you mind very much angus was glowering at his friend of course i mind he barked at ben whippersnapper thats eight out of twenty times youll be beating me you wait until next year next year kirsty blinked this from a man who just weeks ago had intended to die its a date then ben said same time next year angus douglas and its a bottle of your best scotch against one of maggies fruit cakes that ill beat you again done general laughter angus slapped his friend on the back and they headed to the refreshment roomsprobably for one of anguss whiskies laughter being the best medicine tomorrow being the best medicine its time for the motherdaughter sack race someone announced over the loudspeaker jakes hand dropped from her waist he moved over to where alice and penelope were admiring the pumpkins lets go find a lemonade girls he told them all around them women were sorting themselves into groups kirsty watched for a few minutes this seemed to be a general motherdaughter sack race the only rule being that mothers and daughters had to be in the same sack the sacks were piled high a huge assortment of weirdsized sacks the motherdaughter combinations were extraordinary there were ancient mothers with almostasancient daughters one mother had three daughters one mother had five daughters mavis was there kirsty saw in astonishment shed been wheeled along in a wheelchair now someone was frantically cutting holes in a sack for her wheelchair and barbara was preparing to climb in with her there was also barbaras daughter and two more grandkids kirsty hadnt seen before hey i can do that susie said shed come in her wheelchaironly because she still needed a walking stick and she couldnt carry rosie or stay upright very long without it im a mother and if mavis can do it so can i yahoo someone yelledit was mrs grey from the post office wielding a vast pair of scissors she picked up a sack and prepared to chop wheel holes you and rosiell knock em dead girl susie and rosie would race mother and daughter kirsty went to helpand then she paused there were lots of people helping susie she looked across the fairground and saw jake retreating he was leaving he was taking his girls to the lemonade stall so penelope and alice would ask no questions questions like why didnt they have a mother he wouldnt push she thought he had a twin by each hand gripping hard and the slumping of the girls shoulders said they were aware of what was happening and they hated it if she called out could she why not why on earth not the rest of her life started now alice she yelled penelope they turned they all turned alice and penelope looked hopeful do you girls want to come in a sack with me she yelledand every person there knew exactly what she was saying every person in the fairground knew their local doctor and almost every one of them wished for exactly this jake was standing motionless expressionless she dared give him no more than a fleeting glance but in that moment she knew shed crossed some invisible line and there was no going back youre not our mother alice called straight to the point like any fouryearold should be no but a motherdaughter sack race is fun kirsty called back so i thoughti could be a friend whos a sort of motherwhenyouneedme how about that for a declaration she thought breathless even her twin was hornswoggled susie and her chair were halfway into her sack susie sat with her mouth open and the twins stared with their mouths open and kirsty thought there are far too many twins theres too much emotion but not for long people were starting to cheer someone benhauled an extendedfamily sack from the pile and the twins dropped their fathers hands and ran they dived into bens proffered sack whooped around the bottom for a bit and then stood sack pulled to their chins with a gap left in the middle this is your place penelope told kirsty in the middle thats where all the best mothers go susie said softly from beside her jump right in kirsty love heart and all so she did the next minute she was in the sack with the twins lined up in a row stretching right across the fairground the assortment was stunning there were womenfolk from rosies age to maviss age and everything in between mothers of all shapes and sizes alice and penelope were beaming and beaming but not kirsty kirsty stared straight ahead while jake stared at the ground kirsty caught a glimpse of angus patting him on the shoulder and all of a sudden she felt like crying thered been enough tears go they were off jumping running wheeling tumbling mothers and assorted daughters up to four generations in the one sack all making their way any way they knew how to get to the finish line the menfolk were roaring encouragement and advice angus had forgotten all about his lack of oxygen his dicky heart and he was cheering fit to burst kirsty and penelope and alice were concentrating we have to jump in step kirsty gasped at their third tumble there were some fast movers here but the fastest were being handicapped in all sorts of ways dogs racing across their pathsincluding borispeople falling over an exmarathon runner and her sprinter daughter being held back by the local blacksmith who simply darted over and stood on a corner of their sack until his wife and kids passed them by were jumping were jumping the twins were yelling watch us jump daddy go on kirsty heard herself scream we can do this she could do this of course she could and of course they did they reached the finish maybe eighteenth maybe nineteenth but gloriously in the middle of the pack and not at the back they watched in a muddle of sacks and contorted bodies and frantic laughter as someone rushed forward and proclaimed susie and rosesusie and roseas the winners in their chair theyd been out front by a mile and second were mavis and barbara and assorted granddaughters someone was laughing and saying that next year the wheelchairs had to be nobbled but not this year this year the wheelchairs were the winners there were more winners than wheelchairs kirsty lay on the ground and hugged her girls to her and boris bounded over and licked her face and she wondered how she could feel any more of a winner than she did right now then jake was there he was crouching down lifting her out of the puddle of children and sack and dogdoctor performs incision of sack with precision and stylehauling her against him and laughing and kissing her and smiling his pride and his joy for all to see we didnt win daddy alice was saying we didnt win echoed her twin but we jumped really high dont you worry about winning jake told his daughter in a voice that was none too steady theres always next year and then in front of the entire population of dolphin bay in front of these people who would be part of their lives for ever dr jake cameron kissed dr kirsty mcmahon two became one ortwo became part of this wonderful muddly assorted population that was what you called life
