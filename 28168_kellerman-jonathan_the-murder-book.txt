jonathan kellerman the murder book book in the alex delaware series to faye chapter the day i got the murder book i was still thinking about paris red wine bare trees gray river city of love everything that happened there now this robin and i flew in to charles de gaulle airport on a murky monday in january the trip had been my idea of a surprise id pulled it together in one manic night booking tickets on air france and a room at a small hotel on the outskirts of the eighth arrondissement packing a suitcase for two speeding the freeway miles to san diego showing up at robins room at the del coronado just before midnight with a dozen coral roses and a voilà grin she came to the door wearing a white tshirt and a hipriding red sarong auburn curls loose chocolate eyes tired no makeup we embraced then she pulled away and looked down at the suitcase when i showed her the tickets she turned her back and shielded me from her tears outside her window the night black ocean rolled but this was no holiday on the beach shed left la because id lied to her and put myself in danger listening to her cry now i wondered if the damage was irreparable i asked what was wrong as if i had nothing to do with it she said im just surprised we ordered roomservice sandwiches she closed the drapes we made love paris she said slipping into a hotel bathrobe i cant believe you did all this she sat down brushed her hair then stood approached the bed stood over me touched me she let the robe slither from her body straddled me shut her eyes lowered a breast to my mouth when she came the second time she rolled away went silent i played with her hair and as she fell asleep the corners of her mouth lifted mona lisa smile in a couple of days wed be queuing up as robotically as any other tourists straining for a glimpse of the real thing shed fled to san diego because a high school chum lived there a thricemarried oral surgeon named debra dyer whose current love interest was a banker from mexico city so many white teeth alex francisco had suggested a day of shlockshopping in tijuana followed by an indeterminate stay at a leased beach house in cabo san lucas robin feeling like a fifth wheel had begged off and called me asking if id join her shed been nervous about it apologizing for abandoning me i didnt see it that way at all figured her for the injured party id gotten myself in a bad situation because of poor planning blood had spilled and someone had died rationalizing the whole thing wasnt that tough innocent lives had been at stake the good guys had won id ended up on my feet but as robin roared away in her truck i faced the truth my misadventures had little to do with noble intentions lots to do with a personality flaw a long time ago id chosen clinical psychology the most sedentary of professions telling myself that healing emotional wounds was how i wanted to spend the rest of my life but it had been years since id conducted any longterm therapy not because as id once let myself believe id burned out on human misery i had no problem with misery my other life forcefed me gobs of misery the truth was cold once upon a time i had been drawn to the humanity and the challenge of the talking cure but sitting in the office dividing hour after hour by three quarters ingesting other peoples problems had come to bore me in a sense becoming a therapist had been a strange choice id been a wild boy poor sleeper restless overactive high pain threshold inclined to risktaking and injuries i quieted down a bit when i discovered books but found the classroom a jail and raced through school in order to escape after graduating high school at sixteen i bought an old car with summerjob cash ignored my mothers tears and my fathers scowling vote of noconfidence and left the plains of missouri ostensibly for college but really for the threat and promise of california molting like a snake needing something new novelty had always been my drug i craved insomnia and menace punctuated by long stretches of solitude puzzles that hurt my head infusions of bad company and the delicious repellence of meeting up with the slimy things that coiled under psychic rocks a racing heart jolted me happy the kick start of adrenaline punching my chest made me feel alive when life slowed down for too long i grew hollow but for circumstance i mightve dealt with it by jumping out of airplanes or scaling bare rocks or worse years ago id met a homicide detective and that changed everything robin had put up with it for a long time now shed had enough and sooner rather than later id have to make some kind of decision she loved me i know she did maybe thats why she made it easy for me chapter in paris clichés are just fine you leave your hotel step out into the winter drizzle walk aimlessly until you find yourself at a café near the jardin des tuileries where you order overpriced baguettes and grainy frenchpress coffee then move on to the louvre where even during the offseason the lines prove daunting so you cross the seine on the pont royal ignoring the motor din that washes the bridge study the murk of the water below try the musée dorsay and murder your feet for a couple of hours sucking in the fruits of genius then deeper into the grubby side streets of the left bank where you press yourself into the allinblack throng and laugh inwardly at an imagined wheezy accordion sound track overpowering the burping motor scooters and the whining renaults it was early afternoon near a shop in st germain when it happened robin and i had stopped into a dark narrow mens haberdashery with a window full of aggressive neckties and slouching mannequins with pickpocket eyes the rain had been coming in fitful bursts all day the umbrella wed cadged from the hotel concierge wasnt generous enough to shelter both of us and we each ended up more than halfwet robin didnt seem to mind her curls were beaded with droplets and her cheeks were flushed shed been quiet since wed boarded the plane in la sleeping for most of the flight refusing dinner this morning wed woken up late and barely talked during the walk across the river she seemed distracted staring off at nothing in particular holding my hand then dropping it then grabbing again and squeezing hard as if scrambling to cover for some infraction i put it down to jet lag the st germain stroll led us past a private school where beautiful chittering adolescents spilled out onto the sidewalk then a bookstore where id intended to browse until robin pulled me into the clothing store saying these are good silks alex you could use something new the store peddled menswear but smelled like a nail salon the shopgirl was a skinny thing with hackedup hair the color of eggplant rind and the anxiety of a new hire robin took a while thumbing through the goods finally found me a very blue shirt and an extravagant redandgold tie of heavy weave got my nod asked the girl to wrap it up aubergine tresses scurried to a back room and returned with a stout cardiganed woman in her sixties who sized me up took the shirt and returned moments later brandishing a steaming iron in one hand and the garment in the other newly pressed on a hanger shielded by a clear plastic bag talk about service i said as we returned to the street hungry no not yet you didnt touch breakfast shrug the stout woman had followed us out and was standing in the doorway of the shop she looked up at the sky dubiously checked her watch seconds later thunder clapped flashing us a satisfied smile she went back inside the rain was harder colder i tried to draw robin under the umbrella but she resisted remained out in the open raised her face and caught the spray full force a man scrambling for cover turned to stare i reached for her again she continued to balk licked moisture from her lips smiled faintly as if enjoying a private joke for a moment i thought shed share it instead she pointed to a brasserie two doors up the street and ran in ahead of me bonnie raitt i repeated we were at a tiny table tucked in a corner of the clammy brasserie the restaurant floor was a grubby mesh of white tile and the walls were cloudy mirrors and oftpainted brown woodwork a clinically depressed waiter brought us our salads and wine as if service was harsh penance rain washed the front window and turned the city to gelatin bonnie she said jackson brown bruce hornsby shawn colvin maybe others threemonth tour at least three months she said still avoiding my eyes if it goes international it could stretch longer world hunger i said good cause famine and child welfare she said nothing nobler she turned to me her eyes were dry and defiant so i said youre an equipment manager now no more guitarmaking therell be luthiery involved ill be overseeing and repairing all the gear ill not id onevoteelection nothing tentative when exactly did you get the offer i said two weeks ago i see i know i shouldve said something it wasnt it dropped in my lap remember when i was at goldtone studios and they needed those vintage archtops for that retro elvis video the tour manager happened to be in the next booth watching some mixing and ended up talking sociable fellow sociable woman she said she had her dog with her an english bulldog a female spike started playing with her and we started talking animal magnetism i said is the tour dogfriendly or do i keep spike id like to take him along im sure thatll thrill him to no end when do you leave in a week a week my eyes hurt lots of packing ahead she lifted her fork and pronged dead lettuce leaves i can call it off no i said i wouldnt have even considered it alex not for the money good money she named the figure very good money i said listen to what im saying alex that doesnt matter if youre going to hate me it can be undone i dont hate you and you dont want it undone maybe you accepted the offer because i made you unhappy but now that youve committed yourself youre seeing all kinds of positives i craved argument but she didnt answer the restaurant was filling drenched parisians seeking shelter from the downpour two weeks ago i said i was running around with milo on lauren teagues murder hiding what i was doing from you i was stupid to think this trip would make a difference she pushed salad around the room had grown hotter smaller scowling people crowded tiny tables others stood huddled at the doorway the waiter began to approach robin repelled him with a glare she said ive felt so alone for a while you were gone all the time putting yourself in situations i didnt bring up the tour because i knew you couldnt shouldnt be distracted she rolled the side of a small fist along the table rim i guess ive always felt that what you do is important and that what i do is just craft i started to speak but she shook her head but this last time alex meeting with that woman seducing her planning a damned date in order to your intentions were good but it still came down to seduction using yourself as a whore i said thinking suddenly about lauren teague a girl id known a long time ago from my quiet job shed sold her body ended up headshot and dumped in an alley i was going to say lure despite all weve had together this supposed enlightened relationship weve got you go about your own business alex basically youve built this whole other life from which im excluded from which i want to be excluded she reached for her wineglass sipped made a face bad vintage fine vintage im sorry baby i guess it just comes down to timing getting the offer exactly when i was so down she grabbed my hand squeezed hard you love me but you left me alex it made me realize how alone id been for so long we both were the difference is you enjoy going it alone you get high on solitude and danger so when trish and i started talking and she told me shed heard about my work my reputation and all of a sudden i realized i had a reputation and here was someone offering me great money and the chance for something of my own i said yes just blurted it out and then driving home i panicked and said what did you just do and told myself id have to renege and wondered how id do it without looking like an idiot but then i got home and the house was empty and all of a sudden i didnt want to renege i went out to my studio and cried i still mightve changed my mind i probably wouldve but then you arranged that date with that tramp and it felt completely right it still does she looked out the rainclouded window such a beautiful city i never want to see it again the weather remained gray and wet and we kept to our room being together was agonizing suppressed tears edgy silences toopolite chitchat listening to the rain tormenting the dormer windows when robin suggested we return early to la i told her id try to change her ticket but id be staying for a while that hurt her but it also relieved her and the next day when the cab showed up to take her to the airport i carried her bags held her elbow as she got into the taxi paid the driver in advance how long will you be staying she said dont know my teeth ached will you be back before i leave sure please be alex i will then the kiss the smile trembling hands concealed as the taxi drove away i strained for a look at the back of her head a tremor a slump any sign of conflict regret grief impossible to tell everything moved too fast chapter the break came on a sunday some young smileyfaced ponytailed guy i wanted to punch arriving with a large van and two paunchy roadies wearing black kill famine tour tshirts ponytail had a milkbone for spike high fives for me spike ate out of his hand how had the bastard known to bring the treat hi im sheridan he said the tour coordinator he wore a white shirt blue jeans brown boots had a narrow body and a clean smooth face full of optimism thought that was trish trish is the overall tour manager my boss he glanced at the house must be nice living up here uhhuh so youre a psychologist uhhuh i was a psych major in college studied psychoacoustics at uc davis used to be a sound engineer how nice for you hmm robins going to be part of something important hey i said robin came down the front stairs with spike on a leash she wore a pink tshirt and faded jeans and tennis shoes and big hoop earrings began directing the roadies as they loaded her valises and her toolboxes into the van spike looked stoned like most dogs his emotional barometer is finely tuned and for the last few days hed been uncommonly compliant i went over and stooped to pat his knobby french bulldog head then i kissed robin and recited have fun and turned my back and trudged up to the house she stood there alongside sheridan waved standing at the door i pretended not to notice then decided to wave sheridan got behind the wheel of the van and everyone piled in behind him they rumbled away finally now for the hard part i started off determined to maintain my dignity that lasted about an hour and for the next three days i turned off the phone didnt check with my service or open the curtains or shave or collect the mail i did read the paper because news coverage is heavily biased toward the hopeless but other peoples misfortunes failed to cheer me and the words danced by as foreign as hieroglyphics the little i ate i didnt taste im no problem drinker but chivas became a friend dehydration took its toll my hair got dry and my eyes creaked and my joints stiffened the house always too big expanded to monstrous proportions the air curdled on wednesday i went down to the pond and fed the koi because why should they suffer that got me into a scutwork frenzy scouring and dusting and sweeping and straightening on thursday i finally collected my messages robin had called every day left numbers in santa barbara and oakland by tuesday she sounded anxious by wednesday confused and annoyed and talking fast the bus was headed for portland everything was fine spike was fine she was working hard people were being great iloveyouhopeyoureokay she called twice on thursday wondered out loud if id gone off on a trip of my own left a cellphone number i punched buttons got your call cannot be completed just after pm i put on shorts and a workout shirt and sneakers began stomping up beverly glen facing the traffic easing into a clumsy jog when i felt loose enough ending up running harder and faster and more punishingly than id done for years when i got home my body burned and i could barely breathe the mailbox down at the bridle path that leads up to the front gate was stuffed with paper and the postman had left several packages on the ground i scooped it all up dumped the batch on the dining room table thought about more scotch drank a half gallon of water instead returned to the mail and began sorting listlessly bills ads solicitations from real estate brokers a few worthy causes lots of dubious ones the packages were a psychology book id ordered a while back a free sample of toothpaste guaranteed to heal my gums and feed my smile and an eightbytwelve rectangle wrapped in coarse blue paper with dr a delaware and my address typed on a white label no return information downtown postmark no stamps just a meter the blue paper a heavy linen rag so substantial it felt like cloth had been folded neatly and sealed tightly with clear tape slitting the folds revealed another snug layer of wrapping pink butcher paper that i peeled away inside was a threering binder blue pebblegrain leather substantial morocco thumbed grayed and glossy in spots stickon gold letters were centered precisely on the front cover the murder book i flipped the cover to a blank black frontispiece the next page was also black paper encased in a stiff plastic jacket but not blank mounted with black adhesive corner pockets was a photograph sepiatoned faded with margins the color of toowhitened coffee medium shot of a mans body lying on a metal table glassdoored cabinets in the background both feet were severed at the ankles placed just under ragged tibial stumps like a puzzle in partial reassembly no left arm on the corpse the right was a mangled lump same for the torso above the nipples the head was wrapped in cloth a typed caption on the bottom margin read east la nr alameda blvd pushed under a train by commonlaw wife the facing page featured a shot of similar vintage two sprawled gapemouthed bodies men lying on a wooden plank floor angled at forty degrees from each other dark stains spread beneath

side near the elbow of the second clear liquid pooling near the rim hollywood vermont ave both shot by friend in dispute over money i turned the page to a photo that appeared less antique blackandwhite images on glossy paper closeup of a couple in a car the womans position concealed her face stretched across the mans chest and sheathed by a mass of platinum blond curls polkadot dress short sleeves soft arms her companions head rested against the top of the car seat stared up at the dome light a black bloodstream trickled from his mouth separated into rivulets when it reached his

pockets echo park woman stabbed by husband in kitchen bad soup page after page of the same cruel artistry and matteroffact prose why had this been sent to me that brought to mind an old cartoon why not i thumbed through the rest of the album not focusing on the images just searching for some personal message finding only the inert flesh of strangers fortythree deaths in all at the rear a black end page with another centered legend similar stickon gold letters the end chapter i hadnt talked to my best friend in a while and that was fine with me after giving the da my statement on lauren teagues murder id had my fill of the criminal justice system was happy to stay out of the loop until trial time a wealthy defendant and a squadron of paid dissemblers meant that would be years away not months milo had remained chained to the details so i had a good excuse for keeping my distance the guy was swamped give him space the real reason was i didnt feel like talking to him or anyone for years id preached the benefits of selfexpression but my tonic since childhood had been isolation the pattern had been set early by all those bowelchurning nights huddled in the basement hands over ears humming yankee doodle in order to block out the paternal rage thundering from above when things got rough i curled like a mollusk into a gray pocket of solitary confinement now i had fortythree death shots on my dining room table death was milo s raw material i called the west la detectives room sturgis delaware alex whats up i got something i thought you should see photo album full of what look like crimescene photos photos or copies photos how many fortythree you actually counted he said fortythree from the same case fortythree different cases they look to be arranged chronologically you got them how courtesy the us postal service firstclass downtown cancellation no idea who mightve favored you with this i must have a secret admirer crimescene shots he said or someone takes very nasty vacations and decided to keep a scrapbook the callwaiting signal clicked usually i ignore the intrusion but maybe it was robin from portland hold for a sec click hello sir said a cheerful female voice are you the person who pays the phone bill in the house no im the sex toy i said and reconnected to milo dial tone maybe hed gotten an emergency call i punched his desk number got the west la civilian receptionist didnt bother to leave a message the doorbell rang twenty minutes later i hadnt changed out of my running clothes hadnt made coffee or checked the fridge the first place milo heads looking at portraits of violent death would make most people lose their appetites but hes been doing his job for a long time takes comfort food to a whole new level i opened the door and said that was quick it was lunchtime anyway he walked past me to where the blue leather binder sat in full view but made no move to pick it up just stood there thumbs hooked in his belt loops big belly heaving from the run up to the terrace green eyes shifted from the book to me you sick or something i shook my head so whats this a new look a sausage finger aimed at my stubbled face maintaining a leisurely shaving schedule i said he sniffed took in the room no one chewing at my cuffs el poocho out back with robin nope shes here right he said her trucks out front you must be a detective i said unfortunately false leads abound shes out i pointed to the book check that out while i forage in the larder if i can find anything that hasnt petrified ill fix you a sandwich no thanks something to drink nothing he didnt budge whats the problem i said how do i put this delicately he said okay you look like shit this place smells like an oldage home robins truck is here but she isnt and my bringing her up makes your eyes drop to the floor like a suspect what the hells going on alex i look like shit to euphemize oh well i said better cancel the photo shoot with in style and speaking of photography i held the book out to him changing the subject he said squinting down at me from his sixthree vantage what do they call that in psychologist school changing the subject he shook his head kept his expression mild folded his arms across his chest but for springloaded tension around the eyes and mouth he looked at peace pallid acnepitted face a bit leaner than usual beer gut lightyears from flat but definitely less bulge dieting on the wagon yet again hed dressed with uncommon color harmony cheap but clean navy blazer cotton khakis white shirt with just a touch of fray at the neckline navy tie brandnew beige desert boots with pink rubber soles that squeaked as he shifted his weight and continued to study me brandnew haircut too the usual motif clipped fuzzy at the sides and back the top left long and shaggy multiple cowlicks sprouting at the crown a black forelock hooked over his pockmarked forehead the hair from his temples to the bottoms of toolong sideburns had denatured to snowwhite the contrast with the black hair on top was unseemly mr skunk hed taken to calling himself spiffed and freshly barbered i said is this some newleaf thing should i not attempt to feed you either way take the damn book robin later i thrust the blue album at him he kept his arms folded just put it back down on the table pulling out a pair of surgical gloves from the sets he encased his hands in latex studied the blue leather cover opened the book read the frontispiece moved on to the first photo old he murmured the tint and the clothes probably someones creepy collection from the attic department shots probably a home collection pilfered from the evidence room cases get filed away someone gets itchyfingered whos gonna notice if one shot per file gets lifted a cop a cop or a civilian ghoul lots of people have access alex some of them like the job because they dig blood the murder book i said same title as an official case file same color too whoever sent this knows procedure evoking procedure why send it to me he didnt answer i said its not all antique keep going he studied several more photos flipped back to the initial shot then forward to where hed left off resuming his inspection picking up speed and skimming the horror just as i had then he stopped stared at a photo toward the back of the book chunky knuckles swelled the gloves as he gripped the album when exactly did you get this todays mail he reached for the wrapping paper took in the address verified the postmark turned back to the album what is it i said he placed the book on the table open to the page that had stopped him resting his palms on either side of the album he sat there ground his teeth laughed the sound could have paralyzed prey photograph number a body in a ditch muddy water pooled in the trough rusty blood on beige dirt off to the right side of the frame dry weeds bristled whiteink arrows were aimed at the subject but the subject was obvious a young woman maybe a teenager very thin concave belly rib cage washboard fragile shoulders spindly arms and legs slash and puncture wounds meshed her abdomen and neck curious black polka dots too both breasts were gone replaced by purplish discs the shape of marquis diamonds her angular face had been posed in profile gazing to the right above her brow where the hair should have been floated a ruby cloud purple ligature marks banded both wrists and ankles more black dots speckled both legs punctuation marks ringed with rosy haloes inflammation cigarette burns long white legs had been drawn up in a parody of sexual welcome id skimmed right past this one central beaudry ave body dump above freeway onramp sex murder scalped and strangled and slashed and burned ns ns i said no solve milo said there was nothing else besides the book and wrapping no note nope just this he checked the blue wrapping again did the same for the pink butcher paper returned to the brutalized girl sat there for a long time until finally he freed one hand and rubbed his face as if washing without water old nervous habit sometimes it helps cue me in to his mood sometimes i barely notice it he repeated the gesture squeezed the bridge of his nose rubbed yet again twisted his mouth and didnt relax it and stared some more my my he said several moments later yeah that would be my guess no solve ns wasnt appended to any of the other photos i said no answer meaning this is what were supposed to look at i said no answer who was she i said his lips slackened and he looked up at me and showed me some teeth not a smile not even close to a smile this was the expression a bear might take on when it spots a free meal he picked up the blue book it vibrated shaking hands id never seen that happen before emitting another terrible laugh he repositioned the binder flat on the table squared the corners got up and walked into the living room facing the fireplace he lifted a poker and tapped the granite hearth very softly i took a closer look at the mutilated girl his head shook violently what do you wanna fill your head with that for what about your head i said mines already polluted mine too who was she milo he put the poker back paced the room who was she he said someone turned into nothing chapter the first seven killings werent as bad as hed thought not bad at all compared to what hed seen in vietnam the department had assigned him to central division not far geographically or culturally from rampart where hed paid a year of uniform dues followed by eight months with newton bunco managing to talk his way out of the initial newton assignment vice wouldnt that have been a yukfest ha ha ha the sound of one voice laughing he was twentyseven years old already fighting the battle of the bulge brandnew to homicide and not sure if he had the stomach for it for any kind of police work but at this point after southeast asia what else was there a freshly minted detective one managing to hold on to his secret though he knew thered been talk no one confronting him directly but he had ears something different about him like he thinks hes better than anyone drinks but doesnt talk doesnt shoot the shit came to hank swangles bachelor party but when they brought the groupie in and the gang bang started where the fuck was he free blow job and he splits doesnt chase pussy period weird his test scores and solverates and persistence got him to central homicide where they paired him with a railthin fortyeightyearold dii named pierce schwinn who looked sixty and fancied himself a philosopher mostly he and schwinn worked nights because schwinn thrived in the dark bright lights gave the guy migraines and he complained of chronic insomnia no big mystery there the guy popped decongestants like candy for a perpetually stuffed nose and downed a dozen cups of coffee per shift schwinn loved driving around spent very little time at his desk which was a pleasant switch from the buttnumbing routine milo had experienced at bunco but the downside was schwinn had no attention span for whitecollar work couldnt wait to shove all the paperwork at his new junior partner milo spent hours being a goddamned secretary figured the best thing was to keep his mouth shut and listen schwinn had been around must have something to offer in the car schwinn alternated between taciturn and gabby when he did talk his tone got hyper and preachy always making a point guy reminded him of one of his grad school professors at indiana u herbert milrad inherited wealth specialist on byron lockjaw elocution obese pear of a physique violent mood swings milrad had figured milo out by the middle of the first semester and tried to take advantage of it milo still far from clear about his sexuality had declined with tact also he found milrad physically repugnant not a pretty scene the grand rejection and milo knew milrad would torment him he was finished with academia any idea of a phd he finished the goddamned ma thesis by flogging the life out of poor walt whitmans words escaped with a bare pass bored to tears anyway by the bullshit that passed for literary analysis he left iu lost his student deferment answered a want ad at the campus student employment center and took a job as a groundsman at the muscatatuck national wildlife refuge waiting for selective service to call five weeks later the letter arrived by years end he was a medic wading through rice paddies cradling young boys heads and watching the departure of the barely formed souls cupping steaming viscera in his hands intestines were the big challenge the way they slipped through his fingers like raw sausage blood browning and swirling as it hit the muddy water he made it home alive found civilian life and his parents and brothers unbearable struck out on a road trip spent a while in san francisco learned a few things about his sexuality found sf claustrophobic and selfconsciously hip bought an old fiat and drove down the coast to la where he stayed because the smog and the ugliness were reassuring he knocked around for a while on temp jobs before deciding police work might be interesting and why the hell not then there he was three years later seven pm call as he and schwinn sat in the unmarked in the parking lot of a taco tio on temple street eating green chile burritos schwinn in one of his quiet moods eyes jumpy as he gorged himself with no apparent pleasure when the radio squawked milo talked to the dispatcher took down the details said guess wed better shove off schwinn said lets eat first no ones coming back to life homicide number eight the first seven had been no big deal grossoutwise nothing whodunit about them either like nearly every central case the victims were all black or mexican and the same for the victimizers when he and pierce showed the only other white faces at the scene would be uniforms and techs blackbrown cases meant tragedy that never hit the papers charges that mostly got filed and pleabargained or if the bad guy ended up with a really stupid public defender a long stay in county lockup then a quick trial and sentencing to the max allowable the first two calls had been your basic bar shootings juicehead perpetrators drunk enough to stick around when the uniforms arrived literally holding the smoking guns putting up no resistance milo watched schwinn deal with fools caught on to what would turn out to be schwinns routine first hed mumbled an unintelligible miranda to an uncomprehending perp then hed pressured the idiot for a confession right there at the scene making sure milo had his pen and his pad out was getting everything down good boy hed say afterward to the suspect as if the asshole had passed a test overtheshoulder aside to milo hows your typing then back to the station where milo would pound the keys and schwinn would disappear cases three four and five had been domestics dangerous for the responding blues but laid out neatly for the ds three lowimpulse husbands two shootings one stabbing talk to the family and the neighbors find out where the bad guys were hiding usually within walking distance call for backup pick em up schwinn mumbles miranda killing six was a twoman holdup at one of the discount jewelry outlets on broadway cheap silver chains and dirty diamond chips in cheesy tenkarat settings the robbery had been premeditated but the was a fluke that went down when one of the stickup morons guns went off by accident the bullet zipping straight into the forehead of the store clerks eighteenyearold son big handsome kid named kyle rodriguez star football player at el monte high just happened to be visiting dad bringing the good news of an athletic scholarship to arizona state schwinn seemed bored with that one too but he did show his stuff in a manner of speaking telling milo to check out former employees ten to one thats the way it would shake out dropping milo off at the station and heading off for a doctor appointment then calling in sick for the rest of the week milo did three days of legwork assembled a list zeroed in on a janitor whod been fired from the jewelry store a month ago for suspected pilferage turned the guy up in an sro hotel on central still rooming with the brotherinlaw whod been his partner in crime both bad guys were incarcerated and pierce schwinn showed up looking pink and healthy and saying yeah there was no other possibility did you finish the report that one stuck in milo s head for a while kyle rodriguezs beefy bronze corpse slumped over the jewelry case the image kept him up for more than a few nights nothing philosophical or theological just general edginess hed seen plenty of young healthy guys die a lot more painfully than kyle had long ago given up on making sense out of things he spent his insomnia driving around in the old fiat up and down sunset from western to la cienega then back again finally veering south onto santa monica boulevard as if that hadnt been his intention all along playing a game with himself like a dieter circling a piece of cake hed never been much for willpower for three consecutive nights he cruised boystown showered and shaved and cologned wearing a clean white tshirt and militarypressed jeans and white tennies wishing he was cuter and thinner but figuring he wasnt that bad if he squinted and kept his gut sucked in and kept his nerves under control by rubbing his face the first night a sheriffs patrol car nosed into the traffic at fairfax and stayed two car lengths behind his fiat setting off paranoia alarms he obeyed all the traffic rules drove back to his crappy little apartment on alexandria drank beer until he felt ready to burst watched bad tv and made do with imagination the second night no sheriffs but he just lacked the energy to bond and ended up driving all the way to the beach and back nearly falling asleep at the wheel night three he found himself a stool in a bar near larabee sweating too damn much knowing he was even tenser than he felt because his neck hurt like hell and his teeth throbbed like they were going to crumble finally just before am before sunlight would be cruel to his complexion he picked up a guy a young black guy around his own age welldressed wellspoken education grad student at ucla just about the same place as milo sexualhonesty wise the two of them were jumpy and awkward in the guys own crappy little grad student studio apartment on selma south of hollywood the guy attending ucla but living with junkies and hippies east of vine because he couldnt afford the westside polite chitchat then it was over in seconds both of them knowing there would be no repeat performance the guy telling milo his name was steve jackson but when he went into the bathroom milo spotted a date book embossed wes found an address sticker inside the front cover wesley e smith the selma address intimacy a sad case kyle rodriguez but he got over it by the time case seven rolled around a street slashing good old central avenue again knife fight lots of blood all over the sidewalk but only one db a thirtyish mexican guy in work clothes with the homemade haircut and cheap shoes of a recently arrived illegal two dozen witnesses in a nearby cantina spoke no english and claimed blindness this one wasnt even detective work solved courtesy of the blues patrol car spotted a lurching perp ten blocks away bleeding profusely from his own wounds the uniforms cuffed him as he howled in agony sat him down on the curb called schwinn and milo then phoned for the ambulance that transported the wretch to the jail ward at county hospital by the time the detectives got there the idiot was being loaded onto a gurney had lost so much blood it was touchandgo he ended up surviving but gave up most of his colon and a bedside statement pled guilty from a wheelchair got sent back to the jail ward till someone figured out what to do with him now number eight schwinn just kept munching the burrito finally he wiped his mouth beaudry top of the freeway huh wanna drive getting out and heading for the passenger side before milo could answer milo said either way just to hear the sound of his own voice even away from the wheel schwinn went through his jumpy predrive ritual ratcheting the seat back noisily then returning it to where it had been checking the knot of his tie in the rearview poking around at the corner of his lipless mouth making sure no cherrycolored residue of decongestant syrup remained fortyeight years old but his hair was dead white and skimpy thinning to skin at the crown fiveten and milo figured him for no more than most of it gristle he had a lantern jaw that stingy little paper cut of a mouth deep seams scoring his rawboned face and heavy bags under intelligent suspicious eyes the package shouted dust bowl schwinn had been born in tulsa labeled himself ultraokie to milo minutes after theyd met then hed paused and looked the young detective in the eye expecting milo to say something about his own heritage how about black irish indiana fag milo said like the steinbeck book yeah said schwinn disappointed grapes of wrath ever read it sure i didnt defiant tone why the fuck should i everything in there i already learned from my daddys stories schwinns mouth formed a poor excuse for a smile i hate books hate tv and stupidass radio too pausing as if laying down a gauntlet milo kept quiet schwinn frowned hate sports too whats the point of all that yeah it can get excessive youve got the size play sports in college high school football said milo not good enough for college not nearly you read much a bit said milo why did that sound confessional me too schwinn put his palms together aimed those accusatory eyes at milo leaving milo no choice you hate books but you read magazines said schwinn triumphantly magazines cut to the chase take your readers digest collects all the bullshit and condenses it to where you dont need a shave by the time you finish the other one i like is smithsonian now there was a surprise smithsonian said milo never heard of it said schwinn as if relishing a secret the museum in washington they put out a magazine my wife went and subscribed to it and i was ready to kick her butt just what we needed more paper cluttering up the house but its not halfbad theyve got all sorts of stuff in there i feel educated when i close the covers know what i mean sure now you said schwinn they tell me you are educated making it sound like a criminal charge got yourself a masters degree is that right milo nodded from where indiana u but school isnt necessarily education yeah but sometimes it is whatd you study at indiana yooo english schwinn laughed god loves me sent me a partner who can spell anyway give me magazines and burn all the books as far as im concerned i like science sometimes when im at the morgue i look at medical books forensic medicine abnormal psychology even anthropology cause theyre learning to do stuff with bones his own bony finger wagged let me tell you something boyo one day science is gonna be a big damn deal in our business one day to be doing our job a guys gonna have to be a scientist show up at a crime scene scrape the db carry a little microscope learn the biochemical makeup of every damn scrote the vic hung out with for the last ten years transfer evidence milo said you think itll get that good sure yeah schwinn said impatiently right now transfer evidence is for the most part useless bullshit but wait and see they had been driving around central on their first day as partners aimlessly milo thought he kept waiting for schwinn to point out known felons hot spots whatever but the guy seemed unaware of his surroundings all he wanted to do was talk later milo would learn that schwinn had plenty to offer solid detective logic and basic advice carry your own camera gloves and fingerprint powder take care of your own self dont depend on anyone but right now this first day riding around everything seemed pointless transfer said schwinn all we can transfer now is abo blood type what a crock big deal a million scrotes are type o most of the rest are a so what does that do that and hair sometimes they take hair put it in little plastic envelopes but what the fuck can they do with it you always get some hebe lawyer proving hair dont mean shit no im talking serious science something nuclear like the way they date fossils carbon dating one day well be anthropologists too bad you dont have a masters degree in anthropology can you type okay a few miles later milo was taking in the neighborhood on his own studying faces places when schwinn proclaimed english wont do you a damn bit of good boyo cause our customers dont talkie mucho english not the mexes not the niggers either not unless you want to call that jive they give you english milo kept his mouth shut screw english said schwinn fuck english in the ass with a hydrochloric acid dildo the wave of the future is science they hadnt been told much about the beaudry call female caucasian db discovered by a trashpicker sifting through the brush that crested the freeway onramp rain had fallen the previous night and the dirt upon which the corpse had been placed was poordrainage clay that retained an inch of grimy water in the ruts despite a nice soft muddy area no tire tracks no footprints the ragpicker was an old black guy named elmer jacquette tall emaciated stooped with parkinsonian tremors in his hands that fit with his agitation as he retold the story to anyone whod listen and there it was right out there lord jesus no one was listening anymore uniforms and crimescene personnel and the coroners man were busy doing their jobs lots of other people stood around making small talk flashing vehicles blocked beaudry all the way back to temple as a boredlooking patrolman detoured wouldbe freeway speeders not too many cars out pm well past rush hour rigor had come and gone as had the beginnings of putrefaction the coroner was guestimating a half day to a day since death but no way to know how long the body had been lying there or what temperature it had been stored at the logical guess was that the killer had driven up last night after dark placed the corpse zipped right onto the and sped off happy no passing motorist had seen it because when you were in a hurry why would you study the dirt above the onramp you never get to know a city unless you walk which is why so few people know la thought milo after living here for two years he still felt like a stranger elmer jacquette walked all the time because he had no car covered the area from his east hollywood flop to the western borders of downtown poking around for cans bottles discards he tried to peddle to thrift shops in return for soup kitchen vouchers one time hed found a working watch gold he thought turned out to be plated but he got ten bucks for it anyway at a pawnshop on south vermont hed seen the body right away how could you not from up close all pale in the moonlight the sour smell the way the poor girls legs had been bent and spread and his gorge had risen immediately and soon his franksandbeans dinner was coming back the wrong way jacquette had the good sense to run a good fifteen feet from the body before vomiting when the uniforms arrived he pointed out the emetic mound apologizing not wanting to annoy anyone he was sixtyeight years old hadnt served state time since fifteen years ago wasnt going to annoy the police no way yessir nossir theyd kept him around waiting for the detectives to arrive now the men in suits were finally here and jacquette stood over by one of the police cars as someone pointed him out and they approached him stepping into the glare of those harsh lights the cops had put all over the place two suits a skinny whitehaired redneck type in an oldfashioned gray sharkskin suit and a darkhaired pastyfaced heavyset kid whose green jacket and brown pants and ugly redbrown tie made elmer wonder if nowadays cops were shopping at thrift shops they stopped at the body first the old one took one look wrinkled his nose got an annoyed look on his face like hed been interrupted in the middle of doing something important the fat kid was something else barely glanced at the body before whipping his head away bad skin that one and hed gone white as a sheet started rubbing his face with one hand over and over tightening up that big heavy body of his like he was ready to lose his lunch elmer wondered how long the kid had been on the job if hed actually blow chunks if the kid did heave would he be smart enough to avoid the body like elmer had cause this kid didnt look like no veteran chapter this was worse than asia no matter how brutal it got war was impersonal human chess pieces moving around the board you fired at shadows strafed huts you pretended were empty lived every day hoping you wouldnt be the pawn that flipped reduce someone to the enemy and you could blow off his legs or slice open his belly or napalm his kids without knowing his name as bad as war got there was always the chance for making nice sometime in the future look at germany and the rest of europe to his father an omaha beach alumnus buddying up to the krauts was an abomination dad curled his lip every time he saw a hippiefaggot in one of those hitler beetlecars but milo knew enough history to understand that peace was as inevitable as war and that as unlikely as it seemed one day americans might be vacationing in hanoi war wounds had a chance of healing because they werent personal not that the memory of guts slipping through his hands would fade but maybe somewhere off in the future but this this was nothing but personal reduction of human form to meat and juice and refuse creating the antiperson he took a deep breath and buttoned his jacket and managed another look at the corpse how old could she be seventeen eighteen the hands about the only parts of her not bloody were smooth pale free of blemish long tapering fingers pinkpolished nails from what he could tell and it was hard to tell anything because of the damage shed had delicate features mightve been pretty no blood on the hands no defense wounds the girl was frozen in time a heap of ruin aborted like a shiny little wristwatch stomped on the crystal shattered manipulated after death too the killer spreading her legs tenting them pointing the feet at a slight outward angle leaving her out in the open horrible statuary overkill the assistant coroner had pronounced as if you needed a medical degree for that schwinn had told milo to count wounds but the task wasnt that simple the slashes and cuts were straightforward but did he count the ligature burns around both wrists and ankles as wounds and what about the deep angry red trench around her neck schwinn had gone off to get his instamatic always a shutterbug and milo didnt want to ask him loathed coming across uncertain the rookie he was he decided to include the ligatures in a separate column continued making hash marks reviewed his count of the knife wounds both premortem and after death the coroner was guessing one two three four he confirmed fiftysix began his tally of the cigarette burns inflammation around the singed circles said the burns had been inflicted before death very little spent blood at the scene shed been killed somewhere else left here but lots of dried blood atop the head forming a blackening cap that kept attracting the flies the finishing touch scalping her should that be counted as one giant wound or did he need to peer under the blood see how many times the killer had hacked away the skin a cloud of night gnats circled above the body and milo scatted it away noted removal of cranial skin as a separate item drawing the body and topping it with the cap his lousy rendering making the blood look like a beanie so inadequately offensive he frowned closed his pad stepped back studied the body from a new perspective fought back yet another wave of nausea the old black guy whod found her had heaved his cookies from the moment milo had seen the girl hed struggled not to do the same tightening his bowels and his gut trying to come up with a mantra that would do the trick youre no virgin youve seen worse thinking of the worst melonsized holes in chests hearts bursting that kid that indian kid from new mexico bradley two wolves whod stepped on a mine and lost everything below the navel but was still talking as milo pretended to do something for him looking up at milo with soft brown eyes alive eyes dear god talking calmly having a goddamn conversation with nothing left and everything leaking out that was worse right having to talk back to the upper half of bradley two wolves chitchatting about bradleys pretty little girlfriend in galisteo bradleys dreams once he got back to the states he was gonna marry tina get a job with tinas dad putting up adobe fences have a bunch of kids kids with nothing below the milo smiled down at bradley and bradley smiled back and died that had been worse and back then milo had managed to keep his cool keep the conversation going cleaning up afterward loading halfofbradley in a body bag that was much too roomy writing out bradleys death tag for the flight surgeon to sign for the next few weeks milo had smoked a lot of dope sniffed some heroin done an r and r in bangkok where he tried some opium hed even hazarded an attempt at a skinny bangkok whore that hadnt gone so great but bottom line hed maintained you can handle this stupid breathe slowly dont give schwinn something else to lecture about schwinn was back now clicking away with his instamatic the lapd photographer had spotted the little black plastic box caressed his nikon smirked schwinn was oblivious to the contempt in his own little world crouching on all sides of the body getting close to the body closer than milo had hazarded not even bothering to shoo the gnats swarming his white hair so what do you think boyo about said milo click click click the bad guy whats your gut telling you about him maniac think so schwinn said almost absently howlinglunaticdroolingcrazyman he moved away from milo kneeled right next to the flayed skull close enough to kiss the mangled flesh smiled look at this just bone and a few blood vessels sliced at the back a few tears some serrations real sharp blade click click a maniac some shoutatthemoon apache warrior you naughty squaw me scalpum milo battled another abdominal heave schwinn got to his feet dangled the camera from its little black string fiddled with his tie his oakie hatchet face bore a satisfied look cool as ice how often had he seen this how often did this kind of thing come up in homicide the first seven even kyle rodriguez had been tolerable compared to this schwinn pointed at the girls proppedup legs see the way he posed her hes talking to us boyo talking through her putting words in her mouth whats he want her to say boyo milo shook his head schwinn sighed he wants her to say fuck me to the whole world cmon over whole damn world and fuck me silly anyone wants to do anything to me they can cause i got no power hes using her like a puppet you know how kids move puppets around get puppets to say things theyre too scared to say for themselves this guys like that only he likes big puppets hes scared said milo doubtfully what the fuck do you think said schwinn were talking about a coward cant talk to women get laid in any normal way which isnt to say hes a wimpy type he could be macho hes sure nervy enough taking the time for that backward glance at the legs posing her right out in the open risking being seen i mean think about it you had your fun with the body needed to get rid of the body youre carrying it around in your car want to dump it where would you go somewhere remote yeah cause youre not a nervy killer to you it would just be dumping not our boy on the one hand hes smart doing it right by the freeway once hes finished he can get back on no ones conspicuous on the he does it after dark checks to make sure no ones watching pulls over arranges her then zoom zoom zoom its a decent plan it could work nice especially this late rush hours over but taking the time to stop is still a risk just to play puppet so this wasnt about dumping this was showing off having his cake and eating it twice he aint stupid or crazy playing a game said milo because that sounded agreeable thinking about chess but unable to really reconcile this with any game look at me said schwinn thats what hes telling us look what i can do its not enough he overpowered her and fucked the hell out of her hundred to one well find a mess of semen up her twat her ass what he wants now is to share her with the world i control her everyone hop on board gang bang said milo hoarsely flashing back to hank swangles party at newton division the newton groupie a heavy blond bank clerk prim and upright during the day a whole other life when it came to cops pillowy drunk and glazed when collegial hands had shoved milo into the room with her the groupie reaching out to milo lipstick smeared mouthing next like a takeanumber line in a bakery hed muttered some excuse hurried out why the hell was he thinking of that now and now the nausea was returning his hands throbbed he was clenching them schwinn was staring at him he forced himself to release the fingers kept his voice level so hes more rational than a maniac but we are talking someone mentally abnormal right someone normal wouldnt do this hearing the stupidity of each word as it tumbled out schwinn smiled again normal whatever the hell that means he turned his back on milo walked away without a word swinging his camera stood off by himself next to the coroners van leaving milo with his bad sketches and compulsive hash marks whatever the hell that means a knowing smile loose talk about milos sexuality wafting from rampart and newton to central was that why the guy was so hostile milo s hands were clenching again hed started to think of himself as maybe fitting in handling the first seven s okay getting into the groove and thinking he might stick with homicide murder would turn out to be something he could finally live with now he cursed the world got close to the girl closer even than schwinn taking in the sights the smell every wound drinking in the horror telling himself shut up idiot who the hell are you to complain look at her but the rage intensified flowed over him and suddenly he felt hard cruel vengeful analytic seized by a rush of appetite trying to make sense of this needing to he smelled the girls rot wanted suddenly to enter her hell it was nearly eleven by the time he and schwinn were back in the unmarked you drive again said schwinn no sign of any hostility no more possible double entendres and milo started to think hed been paranoid about the normalcy comment just schwinn flapping his lips because the guy was like that he started up the engine where to anywhere tell you what take the freeway for a couple exits then turn around go back downtown i need to think milo complied cruising down the ramp as the killer had done schwinn stretched and yawned sniffed and produced his bottle of decongestant and took a long red swallow then he leaned over and switched off the radio closed his eyes fooled with the corners of his lips this was going to be one of those silent stretches it lasted until milo was back on city streets driving up temple passing the music center and the dirt lots that surrounded it lots of empty space as the rich folk planned additional shrines to culture talking urban renewal pretending anyone would ever bother with this poor excuse for a downtown pretending it wasnt a cement grid of government buildings where bureaucrats worked the day shift and couldnt wait to get the hell out of there and everything got cold and black at night so whats next said schwinn on the girl what do you think find out who she was shouldnt be too hard those smooth nails nice straight teeth if she was a street slut her comedown was recent someonell miss her should we start with missing persons said milo youll start with missing persons start calling tomorrow morning cause mp doesnt staff heavy at night good luck trying to get those guys off their asses at this hour but if she was reported missing getting the info tonight would give us a head start on what this is no race boyo if our bad boys out of town hes long gone anyway if not a few hours wont make a damn bit of difference still her parents have got to be worried fine amigo said schwinn be a social worker im going home no anger just that knowitall smugness want me to head back to the station said milo yeah yeah no forget that pull over now boyo over there yeah yeah yeah stop next to that bus bench the bench was a few yards up on the north side of temple milo was in the lefthand lane and had to turn sharply not to overshoot he edged to the curb looked around to see what had changed schwinns mind dark empty block no one around no there was someone a figure emerging from the shadows walking west walking quickly a source said milo as the shape took form female form schwinn tightened his tie knot stay put and keep the engine going he got out of the car quickly got to the sidewalk just in time to meet the woman her arrival was heralded by spike heels snapping on the pavement a tall woman black milo saw as she shifted into the streetlight tall and busty maybe forty wearing a blue leather mini and a baby blue halter top jumbo pile of hennacolored waves atop her head what looked to be ten pounds of hair schwinn standing facing her looking even skinnier than usual legs slightly spread smiling the woman smiled back offered both cheeks to schwinn one of those italian movie greetings a few moments of conversation too low for milo to make out then both of them got in the backseat of the unmarked this is tonya said schwinn shes a good pal of the department tonya meet my brandnew partner milo hes got a masters degree ooh said tonya are you masterful honey nice to meet you maam tonya laughed start driving said schwinn masters degree said tonya as they pulled away at fifth street schwinn said turn left drive into the alley behind those buildings masturbators degree said tonya speaking of which said schwinn my darling dear ooh i love when you talk that way mr s milo reduced his speed schwinn said dont do that just drive regular turn again and make a right go east alameda where the factories are industrial revolution said tonya and milo heard something else the rustle of clothing the sprick of a zipper undone he hazarded one look in the rearview saw schwinns head resting against the back of the seat eyes closed peaceful smile ten pounds of henna bobbing a moment later oh yes miss t i missed you did you know that did you baby aw youre just saying that oh no its true is it baby you bet miss me too you know i do mr s every day miss t every day mr s cmon baby move a little help me with this happy to help said schwinn protect and serve milo forced his eyes straight ahead no sound in the car but heavy breathing yeah yeah schwinn was saying now his voice weak milo thought this is what it takes to knock off the assholes smugness oh yeah just like that my darling dear oh yes youre a specialist a scientist yes yes chapter schwinn told milo to drop tonya off on eighth near witmer down the block from the ranch depot steak house get yourself a hunk of beef darling slipping her some bills get yourself a lovely tbone with one of those giant baked potatoes mr s came the protest i cant go in there dressed like this they wont serve me with this they will another handful of paper pressed into her hand you show this to calvin up front tell him i sent you you have any problem you let me know youre sure you know i am the rear door opened and tonya got out the smell of sex hung in the car now the night filtered in cool fossilfuel bitter thank you mr s she extended her hand schwinn held on to it one more thing darling hear of any rough johns working the templebeaudry area how rough ropes knives cigarette burns ooh said the hooker with pain in her voice no mr s theres always lowlife but i heard nothing like that pecks on cheeks tonya clicked her way toward the restaurant and schwinn got back in front back to the station boyo closing his eyes selfsatisfied at olive street he said thats a very intelligent nigger boyo given the opportunity a free white woman woulda had she woulda made something of herself whats that about what do you mean the way we treat niggers make sense to you no said milo thinking what the hell is this lunatic about then why hadnt schwinn offered the hooker to him because schwinn and tonya had something special or because he knew what it says offered schwinn the way we treat niggers is that sometimes smart doesnt count milo dropped him off at the central division parking lot watched him get into his ford fairlane and drive off to simi valley to the wife who liked books alone at last for the first time since the beaudry call he was breathing normally he entered the station climbed the stairs hurried to the scarred metal desk theyd shoved into a corner of the homicide room for him the next three hours were spent phoning missing persons bureaus at every station and when that didnt pay off he extended the search to various sheriffs substations and departments of neighboring cities every office kept its own files no one coordinated each folder had to be pulled by hand and mp skeleton crews were reluctant to extend themselves even on a even when he pressed emphasized the whodunit aspect the ugliness he got resistance finally he hit upon something that pried cooperation and curses on the other end the likelihood of news coverage cops were afraid of bad press by am hed come up with seven white girls in the right age range so what did he do now get on the horn and wake up worried parents pardon me mrs jones but did your daughter amy ever show up because weve still got her listing as missing and are wondering if a sackful of tissue and viscera cooling off in a coroners drawer just might be her the only way to do it was preliminary phone contact followed by facetoface interviews tomorrow at a decent hour unless schwinn had other ideas something else to correct him about he transcribed all the data from his pad onto report sheets filled out the right forms redrew the outline of the girls body summarized the mp calls created a neat little pile of effort striding across the room to a bank of file cabinets he opened a top drawer and pulled out one of several blue binders stored in a loose heap recycled binders when cases were closed the pages were removed and stapled placed in a manila folder and shipped over to the evidence room at parker center this particular blue book had seen better times frayed around the edges with a brown stain on the front cover vaguely reminiscent of a wilting rose some ds greasy lunch milo affixed a stickummed label to the cover wrote nothing nothing to write he sat there thinking about the mutilated girl wondered what her name was and couldnt bring himself to substitute jane doe first thing tomorrow hed check out those seven girls maybe get lucky and end up with a name a title for a brandnew murder book bad dreams kept him up all night and he was back at his desk by am the only detective in the room which was just fine he didnt even mind getting the coffee going by he was calling families mp number one was sarah jane causlett female cauc eighteen fivesix last seen in hollywood buying dinner at the okiburger at hollywood and selma ring ring ring mrs causlett good morning hope im not calling too early by am he was finished three of the seven girls had returned home and two others werent missing at all just players in divorce dramas whod escaped to be with noncustodial parents that left two sets of distraught parents mr and mrs estes in mar vista mr and mrs jacobs in midcity lots of anxiety milo withheld facts steeled himself for the facetoface by a few detectives had arrived but not schwinn so milo placed a scrawled note on schwinns desk left the station by pm he was back where he started a recent picture of misty estes showed her to be substantially obese with short curly hair west la missing persons had misrecorded her stats pounds instead of oops sorry milo left the tearful mother and hypertensive father standing in the doorway of their gi bill bungalow jessica jacobs was approximately the right size but definitely not the girl on beaudry she had the lightest of blue eyes and the victims had been deep brown another clerical screwup no one bothering to note eye color in the wilshire division mp file he left the jacobs house sweating and tired found a pay phone outside a liquor store at third and wilton got schwinn on the line and gave a lackofprogress report morning boyo said schwinn haul yourself over here there might be something what come on back when he got to the homicide room half the desks were full and schwinn was balancing on two legs of his chair wearing a nicelooking navy suit shiny whiteonwhite shirt gold tie gold tie tack shaped like a tiny fist leaning back precariously as he chomped a burrito the size of a newborn baby welcome home prodigious son yeah you look like shit thanks dont mention it schwinn gave one of his corkscrew smiles so you learned about our excellent recordkeeping cops are the worst boyo hate to write and always make a mess out of it were talking barely literate milo wondered about the extent of schwinns own education the topic had never come up the whole time theyd worked together schwinn had parceled out very few personal details clerical screwups are the fucking rule boyo mp files are the worst because mp knows its a penny ante outfit most of the time the kid comes home no one bothers to let them know file it forget it said milo hoping agreement would shut him up file it fuck it thats why i was in no big hurry to chase mp you know best said milo schwinns eyes got hard milo said so whats interesting maybe interesting schwinn corrected a source of mine picked up some rumors party on the westside two days before the murder friday night upper stone canyon bel air rich kids filthy rich kids probably using daddy and mommys house my source says there were kids from all over showing up getting stoned making noise the source also knows a guy has a daughter went out with her friends spent some time at the party and never came home maybe interesting schwinn grinned and bit off a wad of burrito milo had figured the guy for a latesleeping pensionsniffing goldbrick and turned out the sonofabitch had been working overtime doing a solo act and producing the two of them were partners in name only he said the father didnt report it to mp schwinn shrugged the fathers a little bit marginal lowlife marginal schwinn repeated irritated as if milo was a poor student kept getting it wrong also the girls done this before goes out partying doesnt come home for a few days if the girls done it before why would this be different maybe its not but the girl fits statwise sixteen around fiveseven skinny with dark hair brown eyes nice tight little body an appreciative tone had crept into schwinns voice milo pictured him with the source some street letch the source laying it on lasciviously hookers pimps perverts schwinn probably had a whole stable of lowlifes he could count on for info and milo had a masters degree shes supposed to be cute schwinn went on no virgin a wild kid also at least one time before she got herself in trouble hitchhiking on sunset got picked up by some scrote who raped her tied her up left her in an alley downtown a juicehead found her lucky for her he was just a bum not a perve fixing to get himself some sloppy seconds the girl never reported it officially just told a friend and the story made the rounds on the street sixteen years old tied and raped and she doesnt report it like i said no virgin schwinns hatchet jaw pulsed and his okie squint aimed at the ceiling milo knew he was holding back something is the source reliable usually who schwinns headshake was peevish lets concentrate on the main thing we got a girl who fits our vics stats sixteen said milo bothered schwinn shrugged from what ive read psychology articles the human rope gets kinked up pretty early he leaned back and took another big bite of burrito wiped salsa verde from his mouth with the back of his hand then gave the hand a lick you think thats true boyo think maybe she didnt report it cause she liked it milo covered his anger with a shrug of his own so whats next talk to the father schwinn righted his chair swabbed his chin this time with a paper napkin stood abruptly and walked out of the room leaving milo to follow partners outside near the unmarked schwinn turned to him smiling so tell me howd you sleep last night schwinn recited the address on edgemont and milo started up the car hollywood boyo a reallife hollywood girl over the course of the twentyminute ride he laid out a few more details for milo the girls name was janie ingalls a sophomore at hollywood high living with her father in a thirdfloor walkup in a longfaded neighborhood just north of santa monica boulevard bowie ingalls was a drunk who might or might not be home society was going to hell in a handbasket even white folk were living like pigs the building was a clumsy pink thing with undersized windows and lumpy stucco twelve units was milos guess four flats to a floor probably divided by a narrow central corridor he parked but schwinn made no attempt to get out so the two of them just sat there the engine running turn it off said schwinn milo twisted the key and listened to street sounds distant traffic from santa monica a few bird trills someone unseen playing a power mower the street was poorly kept litter sludging the gutters he said besides being a juicehead hows the father marginal one of those walkingaround guys said schwinn name of bowie ingalls does a little of this little of that rumor has it he ran slips for a nigger bookie downtown hows that for a white mans career a few years ago he was working as a messenger at paramount studios telling people he was in the movie biz he plays the horses has a chickenshit sheet mostly drunk and disorderly unpaid traffic tickets two years ago he got pulled in for receiving stolen property but never got charged smalltime all around details schwinn had found the time to pull bowie ingallss record guy like that and hes raising a kid said milo yeah its a cruel world isnt it janies mother was a stripper and a hype ran off with some hippie musician when the kid was a baby overdosed in frisco sounds like youve learned a lot that what you think schwinns voice got flinty and his eyes were hard again figuring milo was being sarcastic milo wasnt sure he hadnt meant to be sarcastic ive got a lot to learn he said wasting my time with those mp clowns meanwhile youre getting all this dont lick my ass son said schwinn and suddenly the hatchet face was inches from milos and milo could smell the aqua velva and the salsa verde i didnt do dick and i dont know dick and you did way less than dick hey sorry if fuck sorry pal you think this is some game like getting a masters degree hand in your homework and lick the teachers ass and get your little asslicking grade you think thats what this is about talking way too fast for normal what the hell had set him off milo kept silent schwinn laughed bitterly moved away sat back so heavily against the seat that milos heavy body rocked let me tell you boyo that other shit weve been shoveling since i let you ride with me niggers and pachucos offing each other and waiting around for us to pick em up and if we dont no one gives a shit you think thats what the universe is all about milos face was hot from jawline to scalp he kept his mouth shut this said schwinn pulling a lettersized baby blue envelope from an inside suit pocket and removing a stack of color photos twentyfourhour photo lab logo the instamatic shots hed snapped at beaudry he fanned them out on his skinny lap faceup like fortunetellers cards closeups of the dead girls bloody scalped head intimate portraits of the lifeless face splayed legs this he said is why we get paid the other stuff clerks could handle the first seven murders had gotten milo to think of himself as a clerk with a badge he didnt dare agree agreement seemed to infuriate the sonofa you thought you were gonna get some fun for yourself when you signed up to be a big bad homicide hero said schwinn right talking even faster but managing to snap off each word or maybe you heard that bullshit about homicide being for intellectuals and youve got that masters degree and you thought hey thats me so tell me this look intellectual to you tapping a photo you think this can be figured out using brains shaking his head and looking as if hed tasted something putrid schwinn hooked a fingernail under a corner of a photo and flicked plink plink milo said look im just do you have any idea how often something like this actually gets closed those clowns in the academy probably told you homicide has a seventy eighty percent solve rate right well thats horseshit thats the stupid stuff which should be a hundred percent its so stupid so big fucking deal eighty percent shit he turned and spit out the window shifted back to milo with this plink plink youre lucky to close four outta ten meaning most of the time you lose and the guy gets to do it again and hes saying fuck you to you just like he is to her schwinn freed his fingernail and began tapping the snapshot bluntedged index finger landing repetitively on the dead girls crotch milo realized he was holding his breath had been doing it since schwinn launched the tirade his skin remained saturated with heat and he wiped his face with one hand schwinn smiled im pissing you off or maybe im scaring you you do that with the hand when youre pissed off or scared whats the point pierce the point is you said i learned a lot and i didnt learn dick i was just dont just anything said schwinn theres no room for just theres no room for bullshit i dont need the brass sending me some flybynight masters deg fuck that said milo letting out breath and rage ive been youve been watching me checking me out from the minute you started ive been hoping to learn something for what said schwinn so you can add up the brownie points then move on to an asswarming job with the brass boyo i know what youre about milo felt himself using his bulk moving closer to schwinn looming over the skinny man his index finger pointing like a gun you dont know shi schwinn didnt yield i know assholes with masters degrees dont stick with this tap tap i know i dont wanna waste my time working a whodunit with a suckup intellectual who all he wants to do is climb the ladder you got ambition find yourself some suckup job like daryl gates did driving chief parkers car one day that clownll probably end up chief taptaptap this aint careerbuilding muchacho this is a whodunit get it this likes to munch on your insides then shit you out in pellets youre wrong said milo about me am i knowing smile ah thought milo here it comes the crux but schwinn just sat there grinning tapping the photo long silence then suddenly as if someone had pulled the plug on him the guy slumped heavily looking defeated you have no idea what youre up against he slipped the photos back in the envelope milo thought if you hate the job retire asshole grab your pension two years early and waste the rest of your life growing tomatoes in some loser trailer park long turgid moments passed milo said big whodunit and were sitting here whats the alternative sherlock said schwinn hooking a thumb at the pink building we go in there and talk to this asshole and maybe his daughters the one who got turned into shit or shes not one way weve crawled an inch on a hundredmile hike the other way we havent even started either way we got nothing to be proud of chapter just as quickly as his moods had shifted schwinn bounded out of the car the guy was unstable no question about it milo thought as he followed the front door was unlocked twelve mailboxes to the right the layout was precisely as milo had envisioned screw you expert box eleven was labeled ingalls in smudged red ballpoint they climbed the stairs and schwinn was out of breath by the time they reached the third floor tightening his tie knot he pounded the door and it opened a few seconds later the man who answered was blearyeyed and skinnyfat all sharp bones and stick limbs and saggy sallow skin but with a melon gut he wore a dirty yellow tank top and blue swim shorts no hips or butt and the shorts bagged under the swell of his pot not an ounce of extra flesh anywhere but his belly but what he carried there was grotesque and milo thought pregnant bowie ingalls said schwinn twosecond delay then a small squirrelly nod beery sweat poured out of the guy and the sour smell wafted into the hallway schwinn hadnt recited any physical stats on ingalls hadnt said anything at all by way of preparation to milo ingalls appeared in his midforties with thick wavy coarse black hair worn past his shoulders too long and luxuriant for a guy his age and five days of gray stubble that did nothing to mask his weak features where his eyes werent pink they were jaundiced and unfocused deep brown irises just like those of the dead girl ingalls studied their badges the guys timing was off like a clock with damaged works he flinched then grinned said whus up the words wheezed out on a cloud of hops and malt that mixed with the odors already saturated into the buildings walls mold and kerosene the incongruous blessing of savory home cooking can we come in said schwinn ingalls had opened the door halfway behind him was dirtcolored furniture heaps of rumpled clothes takeout chinese cartons bud empties lots of empties some crushed some intact even at a good clip the number of cans added up to more than one day of serious drinking a multiday bender unless the guy had company even with company a focused juiceathon guys daughter goes missing for four days he doesnt report it holes up instead sucking suds milo found himself entertaining the worstcase scenario daddy did it began scanning ingallss sallow face for anxiety guilt scratches maybe that explained the delays but all he saw was confusion ingalls stood there caught up in a boozeflummox sir said schwinn using the word as an insult the way only cops can can we come in uh yeah sure whu for whu for your daughter ingallss eyes drooped not anxiety resignation as in here we go again preparing himself for a lecture on childrearing whu she cut school again they call in the cops for that now schwinn smiled and moved to enter the apartment and ingalls stepped aside nearly stumbling when the three of them were on the other side of the door schwinn closed it he and milo began the instinctive visual scan offwhite walls brown deepening to black in the cracks and the corners the entire front space was maybe fifteen feet square a living roomdining areakitchen combo the kitchen counters crowded with more takeout boxes used paper plates empty soup cans two miserly windows on the facing wall were shuttered by yellow plastic blinds a scabrous browngray sofa and a red plastic chair were both heaped with unwashed clothes and crumpled paper next to the chair a stack of records tilted precariously the mothers of inventions freak out on top a fifteenyearold lp nearby was a cheap phonograph halfcovered by a snot green bathrobe an open doorway led to a deadend wall a fullview of the front room revealed even more beer cans where does janie go to school sir said schwinn hollywood high what kinda hassle she get herself into now bowie ingalls scratched an armpit and drew himself up to his full height trying to produce some fatherly indignation whens the last time you saw her sir um she was she slept over a friends when sir said schwinn still taking in the room cool all business no one watching him do the detective thing wouldve imagined his lunatic tirade five minutes ago milo stood to the side worked on his cool his mind wanted to work but his body wasnt giving up the anger planted by schwinns outburst heart still racing face still hot despite the importance of the task at hand he kept entertaining himself with images of schwinn falling on his ass hoist on his own petard the selfrighteous fucker busted in flagrante with tonya or some other source that brought a smile to milos brain then a question arose if schwinn didnt trust him why had he risked doing tonya right in front of him maybe the guy was just nuts he shook all that off and returned to bowie ingallss face still no fear just maddening dullness um friday night ingalls said as if guessing you can sit down if you want there was only one place to sit in the damned sty a mansized clearing among the garbage on the couch ingallss dozing spot appetizing no thanks said schwinn he had his pad out now milo waited a few moments before producing his not wanting to be part of some ikeandmike vaudeville routine so janie slept at a friends friday night yeah friday four days ago schwinns gold parker ballpoint was out and he scrawled yeah she does it all the time sleeps over at a friends shes sixteen said ingalls whining a bit whats the friends name the one from friday night ingallss tongue rolled around his left cheek linda no melinda last name blank stare you dont know melindas last name dont like the little slut said ingalls bad influence dont like her coming around melindas a bad influence on janie yeah you know gets janie in trouble said schwinn you know said ingalls kids doing stuff milo wondered what could possibly offend a scrote like ingalls schwinn said stuff yeah such as you know ingalls insisted cutting school running around dope i dunno about that hmm said schwinn writing so melindas a bad influence on janie but you let janie sleep over melindas house let said ingalls coughing you got kids havent been blessed figures you ask me that nowadays kids dont get let anything they do whatever the hell they want to cant even get her to tell me where shes going or to stay in school i tried dropping her off personally but she just went in waited till i was gone and left thats why i figured this was about school what is it about anyway she in trouble youve had trouble with janie before no said ingalls not really like i said just school and running around being gone for a few days but she always comes back let me tell you man you cant control em once the hippies got in and took over the city forget it her mother was a hippie back in the hippie days hippie junkie slut ran out on us left me with janie janie into drugs not around here said ingalls she knows better than that he blinked several times grimaced trying to clear his head and not succeeding whats this about whatd she do ignoring the question schwinn kept writing then hollywood high what years she in second year sophomore another delayedreaction nod from ingalls how many of the cans had been consumed this morning sophomore schwinn copied that down whens her birthday um march said ingalls march um ten she was sixteen last march ten yeah sixteenandahalfyearold sophomore thought milo a year behind borderline intelligence some kind of learning problem yet another factor that had propelled her toward victimhood if she was the one he glanced at schwinn but schwinn was still writing and milo hazarded a question of his own schools hard for janie huh schwinns eyebrows rose for a second but he kept making notes she hates it said ingalls can barely read thats why she hated to the bloodshot eyes filled with fear whats going on whatd she do focused on milo now looking to milo for an answer but that was one ad lib milo wasnt going to risk and ingalls shifted his attention back to schwinn cmon whats going on man whatd she do maybe nothing said schwinn producing the blue envelope maybe something was done to her he fanned out the snaps again stretching his arm and offering ingalls the display huh said ingalls not moving then no calmly no inflection milo thought okay it wasnt her false lead good for him bad for us theyd accomplished nothing schwinn was right as usual the pompous bastard hed be gloating the remainder of the shift would be unbearable but schwinn continued to hold the pictures steady and bowie ingalls continued to stare at them no ingalls repeated he made a grab for the pictures not a serious attempt just a pathetic stab schwinn held firm and ingalls stepped away from the horror pressing his hands to the sides of his head stamping his foot hard enough to make the floor quake suddenly he grabbed his melonbelly bent over as if seized by cramps stamped again howled no kept howling schwinn let him rant for a while then eased him over to the clearing on the couch and told milo get him some fortification milo found an unopened bud popped the top held it to ingallss lips but ingalls shook his head no no no get that the fuck away from me the guy lives in a boozehaze but wont medicate himself when he sinks to the bottom milo supposed that passed for dignity he and schwinn stood there for what seemed to be an eternity schwinn serene used to this enjoying it finally ingalls looked up where he said who schwinn gave him the basic details talking quietly ingalls moaned through the entire recitation janie janie what can you tell us that would help us said schwinn nothing what could i tell ingalls shuddered shivered crossed skinny arms over his chest that who would oh god janie tell us something pressed schwinn anything help us what i dont know she didnt since she was fourteen shes basically been gone using this place as a crash pad but always gone telling me to fuck off mind my own business half the time she aint here see what im sayin sleeping at friends houses said schwinn melinda other friends whatever oh god i cant believe this tears filled ingallss eyes and schwinn was there with a snowwhite hankie ps monogram in gold thread on a corner the guy talked despair and pessimism but offered his own starched linen to a drunk for the sake of the job help me he whispered to ingalls for janie i would i dont know she i we didnt talk not since she used to be my kid but then she didnt want to be my kid telling me to fuck off all the time im not saying i was any big deal as a daddy but still without me janie wouldve she turned thirteen and all of a sudden she didnt appreciate anything started going out all hours the school didnt give a shit janie never went no one from the school ever called me not one time you call them ingalls shook his head whats the point talking to people who dont give a shit ida called theyda probably sent cops over and busted me for something child neglect whatever i was busy man working i used to work at paramount studios oh yeah said schwinn yeah publicity department information transfer janie interested in the movies nah said ingalls anything i was into she wasnt into what was she into nothing running around this friend melinda if janie never told you where she was going how do you know she was with melinda friday night because i seen her with melinda on friday what time around six i was sleeping and janie busts in to get some clothes i wake up by the time im sitting up shes heading out the door and i look out there he jabbed a thumb at the shuttered windows i seen her walking away with melinda walking which way that way hooking his finger north toward sunset maybe hollywood boulevard if the girls had kept going anyone else with them no just the two of them walking not driving said schwinn janie didnt have no license i got one car and it barely drives no way was i gonna she didnt care anyway got around by hitching i told her about that i used to hitch back when you could do it but now with all the you think thats what happened she hitched and some oh god unaware of janies downtown rape if so the guy was being truthful about one thing janie had been lost to him for a long time some what said schwinn some you know moaned ingalls getting picked up some stranger the death snaps were back in the envelope but schwinn had kept the envelope in full view now he waved it inches from ingallss face id say sir that only a stranger would do something like this unless you have some other idea me no said ingalls she was like her mother didnt talk gimme that beer when the can was empty schwinn waved the envelope again lets get back to friday janie came home to get clothes what was she wearing ingalls thought jeans and a tshirt red tshirt and those crazy black shoes with those heels platform heels she was carrying her party clothes party clothes when i woke up and saw her going out the door i could see part of what she had in the bag what kind of bag shopping bag white zodys probably cause thats where she shops she always stuffed her party stuff inside shopping bags what did you see in the bag red halter the size of a bandaid i always told her it was hooker shit she should throw it out used to threaten her id throw it out but you didnt no said ingalls what woulda been the point a red halter said schwinn what else thats all i saw probably a skirt one of those microminis thats all she buys the shoes she already had on black with big heels shiny black said ingalls patent leather those crazy heels i kept telling her shed fall and break her neck party outfit said schwinn copying redandblack party outfit thought milo remembering something that had gone round in high school boys sitting around pontificating pointing with glee red and black on fridays meant a girl put out all the way him laughing along pretending to care bowie ingalls said except for the jeans and tshirts thats all she buys party stuff speaking of which said schwinn lets take a look at her closet the rest of the apartment was two cellsized bedrooms separated by a windowless bathroom stale with flatulence schwinn and milo glanced into bowie ingallss sleep chamber as they passed a queensize mattress took up most of the floor unwashed sheets were pulled halfoff and they puddled on cheap carpeting a tiny tv threatened to topple from a pressedwood bureau more bud empties janies room was even smaller with barely enough space for a single mattress and a nightstand of the same synthetic wood cutouts from teen magazines were taped to the walls mounted at careless angles a single muddylooking stuffed koala slumped on the nightstand next to a soft pack of kents and a halfempty box of ludens cough drops the room was so cramped that the mattress prevented the closet door from opening all the way and schwinn had to contort to get a look inside he winced stepped out and told milo you do it milos size made the task excruciating but he obeyed zodys was a cutrate barn even at their prices janie ingalls hadnt assembled much of a wardrobe on the dusty floor sat one pair of tennis shoes size next to red thom mcan platform sandals and white plastic boots with seethrough plastic soles two pairs of size s jeans were carelessly hung in the closet one faded denim with holes that couldve been genuine wear or contrivance the other denim patchwork both made in taiwan four ribbed snugfit tshirts with biascut sleeves a floral cotton blouse with moth wounds pocking the breast pocket three shiny polyester halter tops not much bigger than the hankie schwinn had offered to ingalls peacock blue black pearlescent white a red sweatshirt emblazoned hollywood in puffy gold letters a black plastic shortie jacket pretending to be leather cracking like an old ladys face on the top shelf were bikini underpants bras panty hose more dust everything stank of tobacco only a few pockets to search other than grit and lint and a doublemint wrapper milo found nothing such a blank existence not unlike his own apartment he hadnt bothered to furnish much since arriving in la had never been sure hed be staying he searched the rest of the room the magazine posters were the closest thing to personal possessions no diary or date book or photographs of friends if janie had ever called this dump home shed changed her mind sometime ago he wondered if she had some other place of refuge a crash pad a sanctuary somewhere she kept stuff he checked under the bed found dirt when he extricated himself his neck killed and his shoulders throbbed schwinn and ingalls were back in the front room and milo stopped to check out the bathroom compressing his nostrils to block out the stench examining the medicine cabinet all overthecounter stuff painkillers laxatives diarrhea remedies antacids a host of antacids something eating at bowie ingallss gut guilt or just alcohol milo found himself craving a drink when he joined schwinn and ingalls ingalls was slumped on the couch looking disoriented saying what do i do now schwinn stood away from the guy detached no more use for ingalls therell be some procedures to go through identification filling out forms identification can wait till after the autopsy we may have more questions for you ingalls looked up about what schwinn handed ingalls his card if you think of anything give a call i already told you everything milo said was there anywhere else janie mighta crashed like what like a crash pad somewhere kids go i dunno where kids go dunno where my own kid goes so how would i know okay thanks sorry for your loss mr ingalls schwinn motioned milo to the door but when they got there he turned back to ingalls one more thing what does melinda look like basic question thought milo but he hadnt thought to ask it schwinn had but he orchestrated it timed everything the guy was nuts but miles ahead of him short big tits built big kinda fat blond hair real long straight voluptuous said schwinn enjoying the word whatever and shes janies age maybe a little older said ingalls a sophomore too i dunno what she is bad influence said schwinn yeah do you have a picture of janie something we could show around id have to have one wouldnt i said bowie making it sound like the answer to an oral exam pulling himself to his feet he stumbled to his bedroom returned moments later with a threebyfive snap a darkhaired child around ten years old wearing a sleeveless dress and staring at a fivefoottall mickey mouse mickey giving that idiot grin the kid unimpressed scared actually no way to connect this child to the outrage on beaudry disneyland said ingalls you took janie there said milo trying to imagine that nah it was a school trip they got a group discount schwinn returned the photo to ingalls i was thinking in terms of something more recent i should have something said ingalls but hell if i can find anything if i do ill call you i noticed said milo that there was no diary in janies room you say so you never saw a diary or a date book a photo album ingalls shook his head i stayed out of janies stuff but she wouldnt have any of that janie didnt like to write writing was hard for her her mother was like that too never really learned to read i tried to teach janie the school didnt do shit papa juicehead huddled with janie tutoring hard to picture schwinn frowned hed lost patience with milos line of questioning and gave the doorknob a sharp twist afternoon mr ingalls as the door closed ingalls cried out she was my kid what a stupid asshole said schwinn as they headed to hollywood high stupid parents stupid kid genes thats what you were getting at right with those questions about school i was thinking learning problems coulda made her an easier victim said milo schwinn grumbled anyone can be a victim the school was an ugly pile of graybrown stucco that filled a block on the north side of sunset just west of highland as impersonal as an airport and milo felt the curse of futility the moment his feet touched down on the campus he and schwinn walked past what seemed to be thousands of kids every one of them bored spaced surly smiles and laughter were aberrations and any eye contact directed at the detectives was hostile they asked directions of a teacher got the same icy reception not much better at the principals office as schwinn talked to a secretary milo studied girls walking through the sweaty corridor tight or minimal clothes and hooker makeup seemed to be the mode all those freshly developed bodies promising something they might not be able to deliver and he wondered how many potential janies were out there the principal was at a meeting downtown and the secretary routed them to the vice principal for operations who sent them farther down the line to the guidance office the counselor they spoke to was a pretty young woman named ellen sato tiny eurasian with long sidewinged blondtipped hair the news of janies murder made her face crumple and schwinn took advantage of it by pressing her with questions useless shed never heard of janie finally admitted shed been on the job for less than a month schwinn kept pushing and she disappeared for a while then returned with bad news no ingalls j files on record for any guidance sessions or disciplinary actions the girl was a habitual truant but hadnt entered the system bowie ingalls had been right about one thing no one cared the poor kid had never had any moorings thought milo remembering his own brush with truancy back when his family still lived in gary and his father was working steel making good money feeling like a breadwinner milo was nine had been plagued by terrible dreams since the summer visions of men one dreary monday he got off the school bus and instead of entering the school grounds just kept walking aimlessly placing one foot in front of the other ending up at a park where he sat on a bench like a tired old man all day a friend of his mother spotted him reported him mom had been perplexed dad always actionoriented knew just what to do out came the strap ten pounds of oily ironworkers belt milo hadnt sat comfortably for a long long time yet another reason to hate the old man still hed never repeated the offense ended up graduating with good grades despite the dreams and all that followed certain his father wouldve killed him if he knew what was really going on so he made plans at age nine you need to get away from these people now he mused maybe i was the lucky one okay schwinn was telling ellen sato so you people dont know much about her the young woman was on the verge of tears im sorry sir but as i said i just what happened to her someone killed her said schwinn were looking for a friend of hers probably a student here also melinda sixteen or seventeen long blond hair voluptuous cupping his hands in front of his own scrawny chest satos ivory skin pinkened melindas a common name how about a look at your student roster the roster satos graceful hands fluttered i could find a yearbook for you you have no student roster i i know we have class lists but theyre over in vp sullivans office and there are forms to be filled out okay sure ill go look in the meantime i know where the yearbooks are right here pointing to a closet great said schwinn without graciousness poor janie said sato who would do such a thing someone evil maam anyone come to mind oh heavens no i wasnt let me go get that list the two detectives sat on a bench in the counseling office waiting room flipping through the yearbooks ignoring the scornful eyes of the students who came and went copying down the names of every caucasian melinda freshmen included because who knew how accurate bowie ingalls was about age not limiting the count to blondes either because hair dye was a teenagegirl staple milo said what about lightskinned mexicans nah said schwinn if she was a greaser ingalls wouldve mentioned it why because he doesnt like her wouldve loved to add another bad point to the list milo returned to checking out young white faces the end product eighteen possibles schwinn regarded the list and scowled names but no numbers well still need a fucking roster to track her down talking low but his tone was unmistakable and the receptionist a few feet away looked over and frowned howdy said schwinn raising his voice and grinning at the woman furiously she flinched and returned to her typewriter milo looked up janie ingallss freshman photo no list of extracurricular activities huge dark hair teased with abandon over a pretty oval face turned ghostly by slathers of makeup and ghoulish eye shadow the image before him was neither the tenyearold hanging with mickey nor the corpse atop the freeway ramp so many identities for a sixteenyearold kid he asked the receptionist to make a photocopy and she agreed grudgingly staring first at the picture know her maam milo asked her as pleasantly as possible no here you go it didnt come out too good our machine needs adjusting ellen sato returned freshly madeup weakeyed forcing a smile howd we do schwinn bounded up quickly was in her face bullying her with body language beaming that same hostile grin oh just great maam he brandished the list of eighteen names now how about introducing us to these lovely ladies rounding up the melindas took another forty minutes twelve out of eighteen girls were in attendance that day and they marched in looking supremely bored only a couple were vaguely aware of janie ingallss existence none admitted to being a close friend or knowing anyone who was none seemed to be holding back not much curiosity either about why theyd been called in to talk to cops as if a police presence was the usual thing at hollywood high or they just didnt care one thing was clear janie hadnt made her mark on campus the girl who was the most forthcoming ended up in milos queue barely blond notatall voluptuous melinda kantor oh yeah her shes a stoner right is she he said the girl shrugged she had a long pretty face a bit equine twoinch nails glossed aqua no bra milo said does she hang around with other stoners uhuh shes not a social stoner more like a loner stoner a loner stoner yeah which means the girl shot him a youareaprimelameo look she run away or something something like that well said melinda kantor maybe shes over on the boulevard hollywood boulevard the resultant smirk said another stupid question and milo knew he was losing her the boulevards where the loner stoners go now melinda kantor was regarding him as if he were braindead i was just making a suggestion whatd she do maybe nothing yeah right said the girl weird what is usually they send over narcs who are young and cute ellen sato produced addresses and phone numbers for the six absent melindas and milo and schwinn spent the rest of the day paying house calls the first four girls lived in smallish but tidy single homes on hollywoods border with the los feliz district and were out sick melindas adams greenberg jordan were in bed with the flu melinda hohlmeister had been felled by an asthma attack all four mothers were in attendance all were freaked out by the dropin but each allowed the detectives access the previous generation still respected or feared authority melinda adams was a tiny platinumhaired fourteenyearold freshman who looked eleven and had a little kids demeanor to match melinda jordan was a skinny fifteenyearold brunette with a frighteningly runny nose and vengeful acne greenberg was blond and longhaired and somewhat chesty both she and her mother had thick almost impenetrable accents recent immigrants from israel science and math books were spread over her bed when the detectives had stepped in shed been underlining text in yellow marker had no idea who janie ingalls was melinda hohlmeister was a shy chubby stuttering homely kid with short corncolored ringlets a straight a average and an audible wheeze no response to janies name from any of them no answer at melinda van eppss big white contemporary house up in the hills a woman next door picking flowers volunteered that the family was in europe had been gone for two weeks the father was an executive with standard oil the van eppses took all five kids out of school all the time for travel provided tutors lovely people no reply either at melinda waterss shabby bungalow on north gower schwinn knocked hard because the bell was taped over and labeled broken okay leave a note he told milo itll probably be bullshit too just as milo was slipping the pleasecallus memo and his card through the mail slot the door swung open the woman who stood there could have been bowie ingallss spiritual sister fortyish thin but flabby wearing a faded brown housedress she had a mustard complexion wore her peroxided hair pinned back carelessly confused blue eyes no makeup cracked lips that furtive look mrs waters said milo im eileen cigarette voice what is it schwinn showed her the badge wed like to talk to melinda eileen waterss head retracted as if hed slapped her about what her friend janie ingalls oh her said waters whatd she do someone killed her said schwinn did a right sloppy job of it wheres melinda eileen waterss parched lips parted revealing uneven teeth coated with yellow scum shed relied upon suspiciousness as a substitute for dignity and now losing both she slumped against the doorjamb oh my god wheres melinda demanded schwinn waters shook her head lowered it oh god oh god schwinn took her arm his voice remained firm wheres melinda more headshakes and when eileen waters spoke again her voice was that of another woman timid chastened reduced she began crying finally stopped melinda never came home i havent seen her since friday chapter the waters household was a step up from bowie ingallss flop furnished with old ungainly furniture that mightve been handmedowns from some upright midwestern homestead browning doilies on the arms of overstuffed chairs said someone had once cared ashtrays were everywhere filled with gray dust and butts and the air felt sooty no beer empties but milo noticed a quarterfull bottle of dewars on a kitchen counter next to a jam jar packed with something purple every drape was drawn plunging the house into perpetual evening the sun could be punishing when your body subsisted on ethanol either schwinn had developed an instant dislike for eileen waters or his bad mood had intensified or he had a genuine reason for riding her hard he sat her down on a sofa and began peppering her with questions she did nothing to defend herself other than chainsmoke parliaments was easy with the confessions melinda was wild had been wild for a long time had fought off any attempts at discipline yes she used drugs marijuana for sure eileen had found roaches in her pockets wasnt sure about anything harder but wasnt denying the possibility what about janie ingalls asked schwinn you kidding shes probably the one introduced melinda to dope whys that that kid was stoned all the time how olds melinda seventeen what year in school eleventh grade i know janies in tenth but just because melindas older doesnt mean she was the instigator janie was streetsmart im sure janies the one got melinda into grass lord where could she be milo thought back to his search of janies room no evidence of dope not even rolling paper or a pipe melinda and janie were a perfect pair waters was saying neither of them gave a damn about school they cut all the time whatd you do about it the woman laughed right then the fear came back melinda will come back she always does in what way was janie streetwise said schwinn you know said waters you can just tell like shed been around sexually i assume melinda was basically a good girl janie spend much time here no mostly shed pick up melinda and theyd be off that the case last friday dunno what do you mean i was out shopping came home and melinda was gone i could tell shed been here because she left her underwear on the floor and some food out in the kitchen food for one waters thought one popsicle wrapper and a pepsi can i guess so the last time you saw melinda was friday morning but you dont know if janie came by to pick her up waters nodded she claimed she was going to school but i dont think so she had a bag full of clothes and when i said whats all that she said she was going to some party that night might not be coming home we got into a hassle about that but what could i do i wanted to know where the party was but all she told me was it was fancy on the westside where on the westside i just told you she wouldnt say the womans faced twitched fancy party rich kids she said that a bunch of times told me i had nothing to worry about she looked to schwinn then milo for reassurance got two stone faces fancy westside party said schwinn so maybe beverly hills or bel air i guess i asked her how she was getting all the way over there she said shed find a way i told her not to hitch and she said she wouldnt you dont like her hitching would you standing there on sunset thumbing any kind of pervert she stopped went rigid where was whered you find janie near downtown waters relaxed so there you go the complete opposite direction melinda wasnt with her melinda was over on the westside schwinns slit eyes made the merest turn toward milo bowie ingalls had seen melinda pick janie up on friday watched the two girls walking north toward thumb alley but no reason to get into that now melindall come back said waters sometimes she does that stays away she always comes back sometimes said schwinn like once a week no nothing like that just once in a while and how long does she stay away a night said waters sagging and trying to calm herself with a twentysecond pull on her cigarette her hand shook confronting the fact that this was melindas longest absence then she perked up one time she stayed away two days went up to see her father hes in the navy used to live in oxnard wheres he live now turkey hes at a naval base there shipped out two months ago howd melinda get to oxnard eileen waters chewed her lip hitched im not going to tell him even if i could reach him in turkey hed just start in with the accusations and that bitch of his second wife said schwinn his whore spat waters melinda hated her melinda will come home further questioning was futile the woman knew nothing more about the fancy westside party kept harping on the downtown murder site as clear proof melinda hadnt been with janie they pried a photo of melinda out of her unlike bowie ingalls shed maintained an album and though melindas teen years were given short shrift the detectives had a page of snaps from which to choose bowie ingalls hadnt been fair to melinda waters nothing chubby about the girls figure she was beautifully curvy with high round breasts and a tiny waist straight blond hair hung to her rear kissme lips formed a heartbreaking smile looks like marilyn doesnt she said her mother maybe one day shell be a movie star driving back to the station milo said how long before her body shows up who the fuck knows said schwinn studying melindas picture from the looks of this maybe janie was the appetizer and this one was the main dish look at those tits thatd give him something to play with for a while yeah i can see him holding on to this one for a while he pocketed the photo milo envisioned a torture chamber the blond girl nude shackled so what do we do about finding her nothing said schwinn if shes already dead we have to wait till she shows up if hes still got her hes not gonna tell us what about that westside party what about it we could put the word out with west la the sheriffs beverly hills pd sometimes parties get wild the blues go out on a nuisance call so what said schwinn we show up at some rich assholes door say excuse me are you cutting up this kid he sniffed coughed produced his bottle of decongestant and swigged shit waterss dump was dusty allamerican mom another poor excuse for an adult who knows if there even was a party why wouldnt there be because kids lie to their parents schwinn swiveled toward milo whats with all these fucking questions you thinking of going to law school milo held his tongue and the rest of the ride was their usual joyfest a block from the station schwinn said you wanna go snooping for westside nuisance calls be my guest but i think blondie was lying to mommy like she always did because a fancy westside party was exactly the kind of thing that would calm the old lady down hundred to one blondie and janie were fixing to thumb the strip score some dope maybe trade blow jobs for it or whatever they got into the wrong set of wheels and ended up downtown janie was too stupid to learn from her past experience or like i said maybe she liked being tied up she was a stoner both of them probably were your source mentioned a westside party street talks like watermelon you got to pick around the seeds the main thing is janie was found downtown and chances are melindas somewhere around there too if a scrote got her and finished with her for all we know he kept her in the trunk while he was setting up janie on beaudry got back on the freeway he could be in nevada by now he shook his head stupid kids two of them thought they had the world in their sweet little hands and the world upped and bit em back at the station schwinn collected his things from his desk and walked off without a word to milo not even bothering to sign out no one noticed none of the detectives paid much attention to schwinn period an outcast milo realized did they stick me with him by coincidence pushing all that aside he played phone poker until well after dark contacting every police entity west of hollywood division in search of party calls throwing in rentacop outfits too the bel air patrol and other private firms that covered beverlywood cheviot hills pacific palisades the privates turned out to be the worst to deal with no one was willing to talk without supervisory clearance and milo had to leave his name and badge number wait for callbacks that probably wouldnt happen he kept going casting his net to santa monica and beyond even including the southern edge of ventura county because melinda waters had once hitched pch to oxnard to see her father and kids flocked to the beach for parties hed spent many a sleepless night driving up and down the coast highway spotting bonfires that sparked the tide the faint silhouettes of couples wondering what it would be like to have someone four hours of work resulted in two measly hits either la had turned sleepy or no one was complaining about noise anymore two big zeros an eye surgeons fiftieth birthday party on roxbury drive in beverly hills had evoked a friday midnight complaint from a cranky neighbor kids no dont think so laughed the bh desk officer were talking black tie all that good stuff lester lanins orchestra playing swing and still someone bitched theres always some killjoy right the second call was a santa monica item a bar mitzvah on fifth street north of montana had been closed down just after am after rambunctious thirteenyearolds began setting off firecrackers milo put the phone down and stretched his ears burned and his neck felt like dry ice schwinns voice was an obnoxious mantra in his head as he left the station just before am told you so asshole told you so asshole he drove to a bar a straight one on eighth street not far from the ambassador hotel hed passed it several times a shabbylooking place on the ground floor of an old brick apartment building that had seen better days the few patrons drinking this late were past their prime too and his entrance lowered the median age by a few decades mel torme on tape loop scarylooking toothpicked shrimp and bowls full of cracker medley decorated the cloudy bar top milo downed a few shots and beers kept his head down left and drove north to santa monica boulevard cruising boystown for a while but didnt even wrestle with temptation tonight the male hookers looked predatory and he realized he wanted to be with no one not even himself when he reached his apartment images of melinda waterss torment had returned to plague him and he pulled down a bottle of jim beam from a kitchenette cupboard tired but wired removing his clothes was an ordeal and the sight of his pitiful white body made him close his eyes he lay in bed wishing the darkness was more complete wishing for a brain valve that would choke off the pictures alcohol lullabies finally eased him stumbling to bed the next morning he drove to a newsstand and picked up the mornings times and heraldexaminer no reporter had called him or schwinn on the ingalls murder but something that ugly was sure to be covered but it wasnt not a line of print that made no sense reporters were tuned in to the police band covered the morgue too he sped to the station checked his own box and schwinns for journalistic queries found only a single phone slip with his name at the top officer del monte from the bel air patrol no message he dialed the number talked to a few flat bored voices before finally reaching del monte oh yeah youre the one called about parties the guy had a crisp clipped voice and milo knew he was talking to an exmilitary man middleaged voice korea not vn thats right thanks for calling back whatve you got two on friday both times kids being jerks the first was a sweet sixteen on stradella allgirls sleepover that some punks tried to crash not local boys black kids and mexicans the girls parents called us and we ejected them where were the crashers from they claimed beverly hills del monte laughed right they give you any trouble not up front they made like they were leaving bel air we followed them to sunset then hung back and watched idiots crossed over near ucla then tried to come back a few minutes later and head over to the other party del monte chuckled again no luck pachuco our people were already there on a neighbor complaint we ejected them before they even got out of the car where was the second party that was the live one bigtime noise upper stone canyon drive way above the hotel the locale schwinns source had mentioned whose house empty house said del monte the family bought a bigger one but didnt get around to selling the first one and the parents took a vacation left the kiddies behind and big surprise the kiddies decided to use the empty house for fun n games invited the entire damn city mustve been two three hundred kids all over the place cars porsches and other good wheels and plenty of outside wheels by the time we showed up it was a scene its a big property coupla acres no real closeby neighbors but by now the closest neighbors were fed up by now said milo this wasnt the first time silence weve had a few other calls there tried to contact the parents no luck theyre always out of town spoiled brats del monte laughed you didnt hear that from me anyway whats up with all this tracing a victims whereabouts silence homicide nah no way this was just kids partying and playing music too loud im sure youre right said milo but ive got rumors that my db mightve attended a party on the westside so ive gotta ask whats the name of the family that owns the house longer silence listen said del monte these people you do me wrong i could be parking cars and believe me no one saw anything worse than drinking and screwing around a few joints big deal right anyway we closed it down im just going through the routine officer said milo your name wont come up but if i dont check it out ill be parking cars who owns the house and whats the address a rumor said del monte there had to be tons of parties friday night any party we hear about we look into thats why yours wont stick out okay the familys named cossack del monte uttered it weightily as if that was supposed to mean something cossack said milo keeping his tone ambiguous as in office buildings shopping malls garvey cossack big downtown developer part of that bunch wanted to bring another football team to la yeah sure lied milo his interest in sports had peaked with pop warner baseball cossack on stone canyon whats the address del monte sighed and read off the numbers how many kids in the family said milo three two boys and a girl didnt see the daughter there but she couldve been you know the kids personally nah just by sight so the boys threw the party said milo names the big ones garvey junior and the younger ones bob but they call him bobo how old juniors probably twentyone twentytwo bobos maybe a year younger more than kids thought milo they gave us no trouble said del monte theyre just a couple guys like to have fun and the girl her i didnt see milo thought he picked up something new in del montes voice name caroline age younger maybe seventeen it was really no big deal everyone dispersed my message said youre central where was your db found milo told him there you go said del monte fifteen miles from bel air youre wasting your time probably three hundred partying kids just caved when you showed up weve got experience with that kind of thing whats the technique said milo use sensitivity said the rentacop dont treat em like you would a punk from watts or east la cause these kids are accustomed to a certain style which is being treated like theyre important if that doesnt work threaten to call the parents and if that doesnt work that usually works gotta go nice talking to you i appreciate the time officer listen if i came by and showed a photo around would there be a chance anyone would recognize a face whose face the vics no way like i said it was a swarm after a while they all start to look alike rich kids any kids it was nearly am and schwinn still hadnt shown up figuring sooner rather than later was the best time to spring janies photo on del monte and his patrol buddies milo threw on his jacket and left the station del monte had been decent enough to call and look where it got him no good deed goes unpunished it took nearly forty minutes to reach bel air the patrol office was a white tileroofed bungalow tucked behind the west gate lots of architectural detail inside and out milo wouldve been happy to make it his house hed heard that the gates and the privatecop scrutiny had been instituted by howard hughes when he lived in bel air because the billionaire didnt trust lapd the rich taking care of their own just like the party on stone canyon tickedoff neighbors but everything kept private no nuisance call had reached the west la station del monte was at the front desk and when milo came in his dark round face turned sour milo apologized and whipped out a crimescene snap hed taken from the pile schwinn had left in his desk the least horrifying of the collection side view of janies face just the hint of ligature ring around the neck del montes response was a cursory head flick two other guards were drinking coffee and they gave the picture more careful study then shook their heads milo would have liked to show melinda waterss photo but schwinn had pocketed it he left the patrol office and drove to the party house on stone canyon drive huge redbrick threestory sixcolumn colonial black double doors black shutters mullioned windows multiple gables milos guess was twenty twentyfive rooms the cossack family had moved to something more generous a huge dry lawn and flaking paint on some of the shutters said the maintenance schedule had slackened since the house had emptied shredded hedges and scraps of paper confettiing the brick walkway were the only evidence of revelry gone too far milo parked got out picked up one of the shreds hoping for some writing but it was soft and absorbent and blank heavyduty paper towel the gate to the backyard was bolted and opaque he peered over saw a big blue egg of a pool rolling greenery lots of brick patio blue jays pecking behind one of the hedges the glint of glass cans and bottles the nearest neighbor was to the south well separated from the colonial by the broad lawns of both houses a much smaller meticulously maintained onestory ranch emblazoned with flower beds and fronted by dwarf junipers trimmed japanesestyle the northern border of the cossack property was marked by a tenfoot stone wall that went on for a good thousand feet up stone canyon probably some multiacre estate a humongous chateau pushed back too far from the street to be visible milo walked across the dry lawn and the colonials empty driveway up to the ranch houses front door teak door with a shiny brass knocker shaped like a swan off to the right a small cement shinto shrine presided over a tiny babbling stream a very tall woman in her late sixties answered his ring stout and regal with puffy rouged cheeks she wore her silver hair tied back in a bun so tight it looked painful had sheathed her impressive frame in a cream kimono handpainted with herons and butterflies in one liverspotted hand was an ivoryhandled brush with pointed bristles tipped with black ink even in black satin flat slippers she was nearly eye level with milo heels would have made her a giantess yees watchful eyes deliberate contralto out came the badge detective sturgis mrs schwartzman what brings a detective to bel air well maam last friday your neighbors had a party a party she said as if the description was absurd she aimed the brush at the empty colonial more like rooting at the trough the aptly named cossacks aptly named barbarians said mrs schwartzman a scourge youve had problems with them before they lived there for less than two years let the place go to seed thats their pattern apparently move in degrade move out to something bigger but of course bigger is better right theyre vulgarians no surprise given what the father does what does he do he destroys period architecture and substitutes grotesquerie packing cartons pretending to be office buildings those drivein monstrosities strip malls and she desperately blond the sweaty anxiety of an arriviste both of them gone all the time no supervision for those brats mrs schwart if youd care to be precise its dr schwartzman pardon me doctor im an endocrinologist retired my husband is professor arnold schwartzman the orthopedic surgeon weve lived here twentyeight years had wonderful neighbors for twentysix the cantwells he was in metals she was the loveliest person the two of them passed on within months of one another the house went into probate and they bought it who lives on the other side said milo indicating the stone walls officially gerhard loetz milo shot her a puzzled look german industrialist as if everyone should know baron loetz has homes all over the world palaces ive been told hes rarely here which is fine with me keeps the neighborhood quiet baron loetzs property extends to the mountains the deer come down to graze we get all sorts of wildlife in the canyon we love it everything was perfect until they moved in why are you asking all these questions a girl went missing said milo theres a rumor she attended a party on the westside friday night dr schwartzman shook her head well i wouldnt know about that didnt get a close look at those hoodlums didnt want to never left the house afraid to if youd like to know i was alone professor schwartzman was in chicago lecturing usually that doesnt bother me we have an alarm used to have an akita the hand around the brush tightened mansized knuckles bulged but friday night was alarming so many of them running in and out screaming like banshees as usual i called the patrol had them stay until the last barbarian left even so i was nervous what if they came back but they didnt no so you never got close enough to see any of the kids thats correct milo considered showing her the death photo anyway decided against it maybe the story hadnt hit the papers because someone upstairs wanted it that way dr schwartzmans hostility to the cossacks might very well fuel another rumor working alone like this he didnt want to screw up bigtime the patrol he said not the police thats what we do in bel air detective we pay the patrol so they respond your department on the other hand there seems to be a belief among law enforcement types that the problems of the fortunate are trivial i learned that the hard way when sumi my doggie was murdered when was this last summer someone poisoned him i found him right there indicating the front lawn they unlatched the gate and fed him meat laced with rat poison that time i did call your department and they finally sent someone out a detective allegedly do you remember his name dr schwartzman gave a violent headshake why would i he barely gave me the time of day clearly didnt take me seriously didnt even bother to go over there just referred it to animal control and all they offered to do was dispose of sumis body thank you very much for nothing they said milo schwartzmans brush pointed at the party house you suspect one of the cossacks poisoned sumi i dont suspect i know said schwartzman but i cant prove it the daughter shes mad quite definitely walks around talking to herself a bizarre look in her eyes all hunched over wears the same clothes for days on end and she brings black boys home clearly not right sumi despised her dogs have a nose for madness anytime that crazy girl walked by poor sumi would fly into a rage throw himself against the gate it was all i could do to calm him down and let me tell you detective the only time he responded that way was to stranger intrusion protective akitas are thats the whole point of an akita but sweet and smart he loved the cantwells even grew accustomed to the gardeners and the mailman but never to that girl he knew when someone was wrong simply despised her im sure she poisoned him the day i found his poor body i spied her watching me through a secondstory window that pair of mad eyes staring i stared right back and waved my fist and youd better believe that drapery snapped back into place she knew that i knew but soon after she came out and walked past me right past me staring shes a frightening thing that girl hopefully that party was the last time well see them around here she was at the party said milo dr schwartzman crossed her arms across her bosom have you been listening to me young man i told you i didnt get close enough to check sorry said milo how old is she seventeen or eighteen younger than her brothers those two said schwartzman so arrogant ever have any problems with the brothers other than parties all the time their attitude attitude entitled said schwartzman smug just thinking about them makes me angry and anger is bad for my health so im going to resume my calligraphy good day before milo could utter another syllable the door slammed shut and he was staring at teak no sense pushing it frau doktor schwartzman could probably beat him in an arm wrestle he returned to the car sat there wondering if anything shed said mattered the cossack brothers had a bad attitude like every other rich kid in la the sister on the other hand sounded anything but typical if schwartzman could be believed and if schwartzmans suspicion about her dog was right sister cossacks quirkiness was something to worry about seventeen years old made caroline cossack an age peer of janie ingalls and melinda waters a rich girl with a wild side and access to the right toys might very well have attracted two street kids taking black boys home racism aside that spelled rebel someone willing to push the envelope dope a couple of party girls venturing from hollywood into uncharted territory still it came down to nothing more than rumor and he had nowhere to take it he stared at the empty party house took in bel air silence shabby grace a lifestyle hed never attain feeling out of his element every inch the ignorant rookie and now he had to report back to schwinn this is a whodunit this likes to munch on your insides then shit you out in pellets the bastards reproachful voice had crept into his head and camped there obnoxious but authoritative while milod spun his wheels schwinn had come up with the single useful lead on the ingalls case the tip that had led them straight to janies father a source he wouldnt identify not even bothering to be coy coming right out and accusing milo of spying for the brass because he knew he was under suspicion maybe thats why the other ds seemed to shun the guy whatever was going on milod been shoved square in the middle of it he had to push all that aside and concentrate on the job but the job going nowhere made him feel inadequate poor janie and melinda waters what was the chance she was alive what would she look like when they finally found her it was nearly noon and he couldnt remember the last time hed eaten but he could find no reason to stop for grease had no appetite for anything chapter he arrived back at the station wondering if schwinn had returned and hoping he hadnt before he made it to the stairwell the desk sergeant said someones waiting for you without looking up who go see for yourself interview five something in the guys voice pinged milos gut interview five uhhuh the blue kept his head down busy with paperwork an interrogation room someone being questioned a suspect for ingalls in custody so soon had schwinn pulled off another solo end run i wouldnt keep them waiting said the sergeant writing something down still avoiding eye contact milo peered over the counter saw a crossword puzzle book them no answer milo hurried down the toobright corridor that housed the interview rooms and knocked on five a voice not schwinns said come in he opened the door and came facetoface with two tall men in their thirties both were broadshouldered and goodlooking in wellcut charcoal suits starched white shirts and blue silk ties corporate bobbsey twins except one guy was white swedish pink actually with a crew cut the color of cornflakes and the other was black as the night together they nearly spanned the width of the tiny stale room a twoman offensive line black had opened the door he had a smooth round head topped by a razortrimmed cap of ebony fuzz and glowing hairless bluetinged skin the clear hard eyes of a drill instructor his unsmiling mouth was a fissure in a tar pit pinkie hung toward the rear of the tiny room but he was the first to speak detective sturgis have a seat reedy voice northern inflection wisconsin or minnesota he pointed to the rooms solitary chair a folding metal affair on the near side of the interrogation table facing the oneway mirror the mirror not even close to subterfuge every suspect knew he was being observed the only question was by whom and now milo was wondering the same thing detective said the black man offering him the suspect chair on the table was a big ugly satchellcarlson reeltoreel tape recorder the same gray as the twins suits everything colorcoordinated like some psychology experiment and guess who was the guinea pig whats going on he said remaining in the doorway come in and well tell you said pinkie how about a proper introduction said milo as in who are you and whats this all about surprising himself with his assertiveness the suits werent surprised both looked pleased as if milo had confirmed their expectation please come in said black putting some steel into please he came closer stepped within inches of milos nose and milo caught a whiff of expensive aftershave something with citrus in it the guy was taller than milo sixfour or five and pinkie looked every bit as big size was one of the few advantages milo figured god had given him for the most part hed used it to avoid confrontation but between these guys and the wagnerian dr schwartzman it had been a bad day for exploiting body type detective said black his face was strangely inanimate an african war mask and those eyes the guy had presence he was used to being in charge that was curious since the watts riots thered been some race progress in the department but for the most part it was lip service blacks and mexicans were despised by the brass shunted to deadend patrol jobs in the highestcrime segments of newton southwest and central with scant chance for advancement but this guy his suit looked like mohair blend the stitching on the lapels handsewn what kind of dues had he paid and who the hell was he he stepped aside and as milo entered the room nodded approvingly in terms of an introduction im detective broussard and this is detective poulsenn internal affairs said poulsenn broussard smiled in terms of why we want you here it would be better if you sat down milo settled on the folding chair poulsenn remained in the far corner of the interrogation room but cramped quarters placed him close enough for milo to count the pores in his nose if hed had any like broussard his complexion glowed like a poster for clean living broussard positioned himself to milos right angled so milo had to crane to see his lips move how do you like central division detective i like it fine milo chose not to strain to meet broussards eyes kept his attention on poulsenn but stayed inert and silent enjoying homicide work said broussard yes sir what about homicide work do you like specifically solving problems said milo righting wrongs righting wrongs said broussard as if impressed by the originality of the response so homicide can be righted not in the strict sense this was starting to feel like one of those stupid grad school seminars professor milrad taking out his frustration on hapless students poulsenn checked his fingernails broussard said are you saying you enjoy trying to achieve justice exactly justice said poulsenn is the point of all police work yes it is said broussard sometimes though justice gets lost in the shuffle slipping a question mark into the last few words milo didnt bite and broussard went on a shame when that happens isnt it detective sturgis poulsenn inched closer both ia men stared down at milo he said im not getting the point of you were in vietnam said broussard yes you were a medic saw lots of action yes and before that you earned a masters degree yes indiana university american literature correct is there some your partner detective schwinn never went to college said broussard in fact he never finished high school got grandfathered in back when that was acceptable did you know that no nor did detective schwinn serve in any branch of the military too young for korea too old for nam have you found that a problem a problem in terms of commonality developing rapport with detective schwinn no i milo shut his mouth you said broussard nothing you were about to say something detective not really oh yes you were said broussard suddenly cheerful milo craned involuntarily saw his purplish bowed lips hooked up at the corners but broussards mouth locked shut no teeth you were definitely going to say something detective i lets recap detective to refresh your memory i asked you if detective schwinns lack of higher education and military service had posed a problem for you in terms of rapport and you said no i it was fairly obvious that you changed your mind about saying what you were going to say theres no problem between detective schwinn and myself thats all i was going to say we get along fine do you said poulsenn yes broussard said so detective schwinn agrees with your point of view about what about justice i youd have to ask him youve never discussed weighty issues with detective schwinn no as a matter of fact we concentrate on our cases youre telling us that detective schwinn has never verbalized any feelings about the job to you about righting wrongs achieving justice his attitude toward police work well said milo i cant really pinpoint poulsenn stepped forward and pushed the record button on the satchellcarlson kept going and ended up inches from milos left side now both ia men were flanking him boxing him in broussard said are you aware of any improper behavior on the part of detective schwinn no consider your words before you speak detective sturgis this is an official department inquiry into detective schwinns behavior or mine is there a reason to look into your behavior detective sturgis no but i didnt know there was any reason to look into detective schwinns behavior you didnt said poulsenn to broussard his position seems to be that hes unaware broussard clicked his tongue switched off the recorder pulled something out of a jacket pocket a sheaf of papers that he waved milo was craning hard now saw the front sheet the familiar layout of a photocopied mug shot female arrestee deadeyed and darkskinned mexican or a lightskinned black numbers hanging on her chest broussard peeled off the sheet held it in front of milos eyes darla washington dob ht wt instinctively milos eyes dropped to the penal code violation loitering for the purpose of prostitution have you ever met this woman said broussard never not in the company of detective schwinn or anyone else never it wouldnt be in the company of anyone else said poulsenn cheerfully nothing happened for a full minute the ia men letting that last bit of dialogue sink in letting milo know that they knew he was the least likely man in the room to engage a female hooker or was he being paranoid this was about schwinn not him right he said never saw her anywhere broussard placed darla washingtons sheet at the bottom of the stack flashed the next page latawna hodgkins pc what about this woman never saw her this time broussard didnt push just moved to the next page the game went on for a while a collection of boredstonedsadeyed streetwalkers all black donna lee bumpers royanne chambers quitha martha masterson deshawna devine smith broussard shuffled the deck like a vegas pro poulsenn smiled and watched milo kept outwardly cool but his bowels were churning knowing exactly where this was going she was the eighth card dealt different hair than last nights red extravagance a bleached blond mushroom cloud that made her look ridiculous but the face was the same schwinns backseat tumble tonya marie stumpf the teutonic surname seemed incongruous where had that come from the mug shot danced in front of him for a long time and he realized he hadnt responded to broussards and this woman broussard said detective sturgis milos throat tightened and his face burned and he had trouble breathing like one of those anaphylactic reactions hed seen as a medic perfectly healthy guys surviving firefights only to keel over from eating peanuts he felt as if hed been forcefed something toxic detective sturgis broussard repeated nothing friendly in his tone yes sir this woman have you seen her before theyd been watching the unmarked surveilling schwinn and him for how long had they been spying the beaudry murder site snooped during the entire time he and schwinn had been riding together so schwinns paranoia had been well justified and yet hed picked up tonya stumpf and had her do him in the backseat the stupid noimpulsecontrol sonofa detective sturgis broussard demanded we need an answer a whir from the table distracted milo tape reels revolving slowly when had the machine been switched on again milo broke out in a fullbody sweat recalling schwinns tirade in front of bowie ingallss building the sudden vicious distrust convinced milo was a plant and now told you so detective said broussard answer the question now yes said milo yes what ive seen her yes you have son said broussard crouching low exuding citrus and success son the asshole was only a few years older than milo but it was clear who had the power you definitely have seen her they kept him in there for another hour and a half taping his statement then replaying it over and over explaining that they wanted to make sure everything had copied accurately but milo knew the real reason wanting him to hear the fear and evasiveness in his own voice in order to instill selfloathing soften him up for whatever they had in store he copped only to the basic details of tonyas pickup stuff they knew already and resisted the pressure to elaborate the room grew hot and rancid with fear as they changed the subject from tonya to schwinns comportment in general picking at him like gnats wanting to hear about schwinns political views racial attitudes his opinions about law enforcement prodding pushing cajoling threatening milo subtly and notsosubtly until he felt as alive as chuck steak they returned to probing sexual details he maintained his denial of witnessing any actual sexual encounters between schwinn and tonya or anyone else which was technically correct hed kept his eyes on the road had harbored no desire to rearview peep the blow job when they asked about the conversation between schwinn and tonya he gave them some bullshit story about not hearing because it had all been whispers whispers said broussard you didnt think that was unusual detective schwinn whispering to a known prostitute in the backseat of your departmentissue vehicle i figured it for work talk she was an informant and schwinn was pressing her for info waiting for the obvious next question info on what but it never came no questions at all about janie ingallss murder or any other case he and schwinn had worked you thought she was an informant said poulsenn thats what detective schwinn said then why the whispering said broussard youre detective schwinns alleged partner why would he keep secrets from you because he knew this would happen asshole milo shrugged maybe there was nothing to tell nothing to tell not every snitch has something to offer said milo broussard waved that off how long were schwinn and tonya stumpf in the backseat of the car as you drove not long maybe a few minutes quantify that knowing the car had probably been observed milo kept it close to the truth ten maybe fifteen minutes after which tonya stumpf was dropped off correct where eighth street near witmer after she left the unmarked where did she go he named the ranch depot steak house but didnt mention schwinns funding of tonyas dinner did money exchange hands said poulsenn not knowing how much theyd seen he chanced a lie no long silence during the entire time broussard finally said you were driving correct when detective schwinn asked you to stop to pick up tonya stumpf you werent at all concerned about being an accessory to prostitution i never saw any evidence of prosti broussards hand slashed air did tonya stumpfs mouth make contact with detective schwinns penis not that i if you were driving never looked back as you claim how can you be so sure you asked me if i saw something i didnt i asked you if oralgenital contact occurred not that i saw so tonya stumpfs mouth might have made contact with detective schwinns penis without your seeing it all i can say is what i saw did detective schwinns penis make contact with tonya stumpfs vagina or tonya stumpfs anus i never saw that was the bastard emphasizing anus because did tonya stumpf engage in physical intimacy of any sort with detective schwinn i never saw that milo repeated wondering if theyd used some sort of night scope had everything on film and he was burnt toast mouth on penis said poulsenn yes or no no penis on or in vagina no penis on or in anus same emphasis definitely not coincidence no said milo and i think id better talk to a protective league representative do you said broussard yes this is obviously you could do that detective sturgis if you think you really need representation but why would you think that milo didnt answer do you have something to worry about detective said broussard i didnt until you guys hauled me in we didnt haul you we invited you oh said milo my mistake broussard touched the tape recorder as if threatening to switch it on again leaned in so close milo could count the stitches on his lapel no pores not a single damn pore the bastard was carved of ebony detective sturgis youre not implying coercion are you no tell us about your relationship with detective schwinn milo said were partners not buddies our time together is spent on work weve cleared seven homicides in three months one hundred percent of our calls recently we picked up an eighth one a serious whodunit thats gonna require detective said broussard louder cutting off that avenue of conversation have you ever witnessed detective schwinn receiving money from anyone during work hours no desire to talk about janie ingalls caught up in his headhunter ritual one that wouldnt couldnt be stopped until it played itself out or something else an active disinterest in janie ingalls milo said no not with tonya stumpf no or anyone else barked broussard no said milo never not once broussard lowered his face and stared into milos eyes milo felt his breath warm steady minty now suddenly sour as if bile had surged up his gullet so the guy had body processes after all not once he repeated they let him go as abruptly as theyd hauled him in no parting words both ia men turning their backs on him he left the station directly didnt go upstairs to his desk or bother to check his messages the next morning a departmental notice appeared in his home mailbox plain white envelope no postmark handdelivered immediate transfer to the west la station some gobbledygook about manpower allocation a typed addendum said hed already been assigned a locker there and listed the number the contents of his desk and his personal effects had been moved from central his outstanding cases had been transferred to other detectives he phoned central tried to find out whod caught janie ingallss murder got a lot of runaround finally learned that the case had left the station and gone to metro homicide parker centers highprofile boys kicked upstairs metro loved publicity and milo figured finally janie would hit the news but she didnt he phoned metro left half a dozen messages wanting to give them the information he hadnt had time to chart in the ingalls murder book the cossack party melinda waterss disappearance dr schwartzmans suspicions about caroline cossack no one returned his calls at west la his new lieutenant was piggish and hostile and milos assignment to a partner was delayed more department gibberish a huge pile of stale s and a few new ones idiot cases luckily landed on his desk he rode alone walked through the job like a robot disoriented by his new surroundings west la had the lowest crime stats in the city and he found himself missing the rhythm of the bloody streets he made no effort to make friends avoided socializing after hours not that invitations came his way the westsides ds were even colder than his central colleagues and he wondered how much of it could be blamed on his pairing with schwinn maybe picking up a snitch jacket or had the rumors followed him here too fag cop fag snitch cop a few weeks in a cop named wes baker tried to be social telling milo hed heard milo had a masters it was about time someone with brains went into police work baker figured himself for an intellectual played chess lived in an apartment full of books and used big words when small ones wouldve sufficed milo saw him as a pretentious jerk but allowed baker to rope him in on double dates with his girlfriend and her stewardess pals then one night baker drove by and spotted him standing on a west hollywood street corner waiting for the light to change the only men out walking were seeking other men and bakers silent stare told milo plenty shortly after someone broke into milos locker and left a stash of sadomasochistic gay porn a week after that delano hardy the stations only black d was assigned to be his partner the first few weeks of their rides were tightlipped worse than with schwinn almost unbearably tense del was a religious baptist whod run afoul of the brass by criticizing the departments racial policies but he had no use for sexual nonconformity news of the porn stash had gotten round iceeyes seemed to follow milo around then things eased del turned out to be psychologically flexible a meticulous straightarrow with good instincts and an obsession with doing the job the two of them began working as a team solved case after case forged a bond based on success and the avoidance of certain topics within six months they were in the groove putting away bad guys with no sweat neither of them invited to station house barbecues bar crawls copgroupie gang bangs when the work day was over del returned to a leimert park tract home and his upright uptight wife who still didnt know about milo and milo skulked back to his lonelyguy pad but for the ingalls case he had a nearperfect solve rate but for the ingalls case he never saw pierce schwinn again heard a rumor the guy had taken early retirement a few months later he called parker center personnel lied managed to learn that schwinn had left with no record of disciplinary action so maybe it had nothing to do with schwinn after all and everything to do with janie ingalls emboldened he phoned metro again fishing for news on the case again no callback he tried records just in case someone had closed it was informed they had no listing of the case as solved no sighting of melinda waters one hot july morning he woke up dreaming about janies corpse drove over to hollywood and cruised by bowie ingallss flop on edgemont the pink building was gone razed to the dirt the soil chewed out for a subterranean parking lot the beginnings of framework set in place the skeleton of a much larger apartment building he drove to gower and headed a mile north eileen waterss shabby little house was still standing but waters was gone and two slender effeminate young men antiques dealers were living there within moments both were flirting outrageously with milo and that scared him hed put on all the cop macho and still they could tell the prettyboys were renting the house had been vacant when theyd moved in neither had any idea where the previous tenant had gone ill tell you one thing said one of the lads she was a smoker the place reeked disgusting agreed his roomie we cleaned up everything went neobiedermeir you wouldnt recognize it grinning conspiratorially so tell us what did she do chapter milo finished the story and walked into my kitchen the beeline to the fridge finally i watched him open the freezer compartment where the bottle of stolichnaya sat the vodka had been a gift from him to robin and me though i rarely touched anything other than scotch or beer and robin drank wine robin i watched him fill half a glass splash in some grapefruit juice for color he drained the glass poured a refill returned to the dining room table thats it he said i said a black detective named broussard as in yup ah tossing back the second vodka he returned to the kitchen fixed a third glass more booze no juice i thought of saying something sometimes he wants me to play that role remembered how much chivas id downed since robins departure and held my tongue this time when he returned he sat down heavily wrapped thick hands around the glass and swirled creating a tiny vodka whirlpool john g broussard i said none other the way he and the other guy leaned on you sounds kafkaesque he smiled today i woke up as a cockroach yeah good old john g had a knack for that kind of thing from way back served the lad well hasnt it john gerald broussard had been las chief of police for a little over two years handpicked by the outgoing mayor in what many claimed was an obvious pander aimed at neutralizing critics of lapds racial problems broussard had a military bearing and a staggeringly imperious personality the city council distrusted him and most of his own officers even black cops despised him because of his headhunter background broussards open disdain for anyone who questioned his decisions his apparent disinterest in the details of street policing and his obsession with interdepartmental discipline helped complete the picture broussard seemed to revel in his lack of popularity at his swearingin ceremony decked out as usual in full dress uniform and a chestful of ribbon candy the new chief laid out his number one priority zero tolerance for any infractions by police officers the following day broussard dissolved a beloved system of communitypolice liaison outposts in highcrime neighborhoods claiming they did nothing to reduce felonies and that excessive fraternization with citizens deprofessionalized the department spotless john broussard i said and maybe he helped bury the ingalls case any idea why he didnt answer drank some more glanced again at the murder book looks like it was really sent to you i said still no reply i let a few more moments pass did anything ever develop on ingalls he shook his head melinda waters never showed up i wouldnt know if she did he said once i got to west la i didnt pursue it for all i know she got married had kids is living in a nice little house with a bigscreen tv talking too fast too loud i knew confession when i heard it he ran a finger under his collar his forehead was shiny and the stress cracks around his mouth and eyes had deepened he finished the third vodka stood and aimed his bulk back at the kitchen thirsty i said he froze wheeled glared look whos talking your eyes you gonna tell me youve been dry this morning i have been i said congratulations wheres robin he demanded what the hells going on with you two well i said my mails been interesting yeah yeah where is she alex words filled my head but logjammed somewhere in my throat my breath got short we stared at each other he laughed first show you mine if you show me yours i told him the basics so it was an opportunity for her he said shell get it out of her system and come back maybe i said it happened before alex thanks for the memory pal i said this time i cant help thinking its more she kept the offer from me for two weeks you were busy he said i dont think thats it the way she looked at me in paris the way she left the fault line might have shifted too much cmon he said how about some optimism youre always preaching to me about that i dont preach i suggest then i suggest you shave and scrape the crud from your eyes and get into clean clothes stop ignoring her calls and try to work things out for gods sake you guys are like like what i was gonna say an old married couple but were not i said married all these years together and neither of us took the initiative to make it legal what does that say you didnt need the paperwork believe me i know all about that he and rick had been together even longer than robin and i would you if you could i said probably he said maybe whats the big issue between you guys anyway its complicated i said and i havent been avoiding her we just keep missing each other try harder shes on the road milo try harder anyway goddammit whats with you i said acute disillusionment on top of all the chronic disillusionment the job deals me he clapped a hand on my shoulder i need some things in my life to be constant pal as in you guys i want robin and you to be okay for my peace of mind okay is that too much to ask yeah yeah its selfcentered but tough shit what can you say to that i sat there and he swiped at his brow more sweat leaked through he looked thoroughly miserable crazily enough i felt guilty well work it out i heard myself saying now tell me why you looked like death when you saw janie ingallss photo low blood sugar he said no time for breakfast ah i said hence the vodka he shrugged i thought it was out of my head but maybe i figure i shouldve pursued it maybe ns means someone else thinks you should pursue it now do any of the other photos in the book mean anything to you nope i looked at the gloves hed discarded going to run prints maybe he said then he grimaced what ghost of failures past he poured a fourth glass mostly juice maybe an ounce of vodka i said any guesses who sent it sounds like youve got one your expartner schwinn he had a fondness for photography and access to old police files why the hell would he be contacting me now he couldnt stand me didnt give a damn about the ingalls case or any other maybe time has mellowed him he worked homicide for twenty years before you came on meaning hed have been on the job during much of the period covered by the photos the ones that preceded his watch he swiped he bent the rules so lifting a few crimescene photos wouldnt have been much of an ethical stretch the book could be part of a collection he assembled over the years he called it the murder book and bound it in blue to be cute but why send it to me via you why now whats his damn point is janies picture one schwinn couldve snapped himself peeling on a new pair of gloves he flipped back to the death shot nah this is professionally developed better quality than what hed have gotten with that instamatic maybe he had the film reprocessed or if hes still a photography bug hes got himself a home darkroom schwinn he said screw all this hypothesizing alex the guy didnt trust me when we worked together why would he be contacting me what if he learned something twenty years ago that hes finally ready to share such as the source that directed him to bowie ingalls and the party maybe he feels guilty about holding back has the urge to come clean by now hed be close to seventy could be sick or dying or just introspective age can do that he knows hes in no position to do anything about the case but figures you might be he thought about that degloved again stood stared at the fridge but didnt move we can spin theories all day but the book couldve been sent by anyone could it i said janies murder never hit the news so it had to be someone with inside information and schwinns belief in science becoming a major investigative tool might play into it that day has arrived right dna testing all that other good stuff if semen and blood samples were saved i dont even know if there was any semen in her alex schwinn figured it for a sex thing but neither of us ever saw the autopsy results once they closed us down i never saw a scrap of official paper a big fist slammed the table and the murder book jumped this is total bullshit i kept my mouth shut he began pacing the dining room bastard i have a good mind to go facetoface with him if it was him so why was it sent to you covering tracks i said schwinn knew we worked together another indication of an interest in police affairs or just someone who reads the paper alex our names were paired on the teague case and you came out of that one smelling sweet big solve schwinn may not have liked you or respected or trusted you but maybe hes followed your career and changed his mind give me a break he picked up his glass a thread of vodka had settled on the bottom an icy ribbon of alcohol all this hypothesizing my head feels like its gonna split open sometimes i wonder what exactly it is that forms the basis for our friendship thats easy i said common pathology what pathology mutual inability to let go schwinn or whoever sent the murder book knows it yeah well screw him im not biting your decision damn right ah i said i hate when you do that he said do what say ah like a fucking dentist ah his arm drew back and a bigfisted hand shot toward my jaw he tapped gently mouthed pow i hooked a thumb at the blue album so what do you want me to do toss it dont do anything he got to his feet im feeling a little gonna take a nap the spare bedroom fixed up as always pleasant dreams thank you norman bates he stomped toward the rear of the house was gone for maybe ten minutes before returning tieless shirt untucked looking as if hed crammed a nights worth of nightmares into six hundred seconds what im gonna do he said all im gonna do is make a basic attempt to find schwinn as in make a call if i find him and it turns out he did send the book he and i will have a little chat believe me if it wasnt him we forget the whole thing sounds like a plan what you dont like it its fine with me i said good cause thats it great regloving he picked up the murder book headed for the front door said sayonara its almost been fun as he stepped outside he said be there for robins call deal with it alex sure i dont like when you get agreeable then screw you he grinned ah i sat there a long time feeling low wondering if robin would call from eugene figuring if she didnt within a couple of hours id go somewhere anywhere i fell asleep at the dining room table the phone woke me two hours later alex hi i finally got you she said ive tried so many times been out sorry out of town just errands hows it going fine great the tour weve been getting excellent publicity sellout crowds hows oregon green pretty mostly ive seen soundstages hows spike hes good adapting i miss you miss you too alex uhhuh whats are you okay sure so tell me are sex drugs and rock n roll what theyre cracked up to be its not like that she said which part the sex or the drugs silence im working really hard she said everyone is the logistics are incredible putting everything together exciting its satisfying id hope so i said longer silence i feel she said that youre very far away from me and please dont be literal as opposed to metaphorical youre angry im not i love you i really do miss you alex nothings stopping you from coming home anytime i said its not that simple why not i said what its turned into a heavy metal tour shackles and chains please dont be like this alex like what sarcastic veiled i know youre mad at me and thats probably the real reason you didnt call me back right away but you leave and im the bad guy i said yes the real reason we missed each other was i was in no shape to talk to anyone not anger i just got hollow after that i did try to call but like you said youre busy im not angry im do what you need to do do you want me to quit no youd never forgive me for that i want to stay then stay oh alex ill try to be mr cheerful i said no i dont want that probably couldnt pull it off anyway never been much of a performer guess i wouldnt fit in with your new buddies alex please oh damn hold on theyre calling me some sort of crisis dammit i dont want to sign off like this do what you need to do i said ill call you later i love you alex loveyoutoo click good work delaware for this we sent you to therapist school i shut my eyes struggled to empty my head then filled it with mental snapshots finally i found the image i wanted and wedged it behind my eyes janie ingallss brutalized body a dead girl granting me momentary grace as i lost myself in her imagined agony chapter one thing about sensory deprivation it does tend to freshen up your perceptions and a plan any plan opens the door to selfimportance when i left the house the sun kissed me like a lover and the trees were greener under a benevolent sun that reminded me why people kept moving to california i collected the days mail junk junk junk then walked around to the rear garden and stopped at the pond the koi were a sinuous brocade hyperactive clamoring at the rock border brought to the surface by my footsteps ten very hungry fish i made them happy then i drove to school i used my crosstown med school faculty card to get a parking spot on the us north campus walked to the research library sat myself down in front of a computer began with the inhouse data banks then logged onto the internet and made my way through half a dozen search engines janie or jane ingalls pulled up the ingallsdudenhoffer family tree website from hannibal missouri greatgreatgreatgrandmother jane martha ingalls would be years old next week bowie ingalls connected me to a david bowie fan club in manchester england and to a university of oklahoma history professors site on jim bowie several melinda waters hits popped up but none seemed remotely relevant a physicist by that name worked at lawrence livermore laboratory nineteenyearold melinda sue waters was hawking nude pictures of herself from a small town in arkansas and melinda waters attorneyatlaw specializing in bankruptcy and evictions advertised her services on a legal bulletin board out of santa fe new mexico no crime stories or death notices on either girl perhaps janies friend had indeed surfaced as milo had suggested and slipped back into society unnoticed i tried her mothers name eileen with no success next search tonya marie stumpf nothing on pierce schwinns backseat playmate no surprise there i hadnt expected an aging hooker to have her own website no data on pierce schwinn either his surname pulled up several schwinn bicycle items and one news piece that caught my eye because it was relatively local a ventura weeklys account of a horse show last year one of the winners was a woman named marge schwinn who raised arabians in a place called oak view i looked up the town seventy miles north of la near ojai exactly the kind of semirural escape that might attract an excop i wrote down her name logging the activities of the cossack family kept me busy for a long time as i caught dozens of articles in the la times and the daily news that stretched back to the sixties the boys father garvey cossack senior had received intermittent coverage for tearing down buildings and putting up shopping centers working the zoning board for variances mixing with politicians at fundraisers cossack development had contributed to the united way and to all the right diseases but i found no records of donations to the police benevolent society or any links to john g broussard or the lapd a twentyfiveyearold socialpage picture showed cossack senior to be a short bald rotund man with huge blackframed eyeglasses a tiny dyspeptic mouth and a fondness for oversize pocket squares his wife ilse was taller than he by half a head with dishwater hair worn too long for her middleaged face hollow cheeks tense hands and barbiturate eyes other than chairmanship of a wilshire country club charity debutante ball shed stayed out of the limelight i checked the list of young women presented at the ball no mention of caroline cossack the girl who never changed her clothes and mightve poisoned a dog garvey jr and bob cossack began making the papers by their midtwenties just a few years after the ingalls murder senior had keeled over on the seventh hole of the wilshire country club golf course and the reins of cossack development passed to the sons theyd diversified almost immediately continuing ongoing construction projects but also bankrolling a slew of independent foreign films none of which made money calendar shots showed the cossack brothers attending premieres sunning in cannes venturing to park city for the sundance festival eating hipforananosecond cuisine hanging out with starlets and fashion photographers addicted heirs people famous for being famous the usual assortment of hollywood leeches garvey cossack jr seemed to love the camera his face was always closest to the lens but if he thought himself photogenic that was more than a bit of delusion the visage he flaunted was squat porcine topped by thinning curly light brown hair and anchored by a squishy dinner roll of a neck that propped up the sphere of cranium like an adipose brace younger brother bob bobo because as a kid hed loved the wrestler bobo brazil was also coarsefeatured but thinner than his brother with long dark hair combed straight back from a low square brow and a frank zappa mustache that diminished his chin both brothers favored the black suitandtshirt combo but it came across as costumery nothing fit garvey right and bobo looked as if hed shoplifted his threads these countenances were meant for the back room not the klieg lights the cossack brothers bigscreen adventures appeared to last for three years then they shifted gears and began making noises about bringing a football team to the coliseum resurrecting one of their fathers unfulfilled dreams assembling a consortium of financial types the brothers submitted a proposal to the city council that ended up being denounced by the more populist members as a scheme to lock in taxpayer financing of their forprofit plan the sports venture fizzled as had the movie game and for a couple years the cossacks were out of print then garvey cossack resurfaced with plans for a federally funded community redevelopment project in the san fernando valley and bobo garnered attention for attempting to demolish a hollywood bowling alley that the locals wanted preserved as a landmark in order to put up a giant strip mall their mothers obituary was dated three years ago ilse cossack had died after a long battle with alzheimers disease private services in lieu of flowers donations to still no mention of sister caroline i began scanning the web and the periodicals files for accounts of sexual homicides taking place within five years of janie ingallss murder found nothing dramatically similar interesting because sexual sadists dont quit voluntarily so maybe janies murderer was dead or imprisoned if so would milo ever get the answers he wanted i went downstairs to the public affairs room got my hands on every back issue of the fbi law enforcement journal i could find along with stacks of forensic magazines and crime periodicals because the savagery of what had been done to janie was notable and perhaps the wound pattern scalping in particular had repeated itself but if it had i couldnt find the evidence the fbi magazine had veered away from vicap alerts and detailed crime studies to bland copspeak articles geared for public relations and the only case report involving removal of cranial skin cropped up in a wire service piece on crime in brazil a germanborn doctor son of a nazi immigrant had murdered several prostitutes and kept their scalps as trophies the man was in his late twenties a toddler at the time of the ingalls case everyone starts off as a cute little baby maybe janies murderer had continued to pursue his grisly interests without leaving any bodies behind but that didnt make sense hed flaunted janies corpse twenty years ago and was likely to get more not less brazen when i got home my message machine registered zero calls i phoned milos house and rick silverman answered sounding sleepy hes an er surgeon no matter when i call i seem to be waking him up alex hows it going he sounded casual so milo hadnt told him about robin fine and with you im working theyre paying me im not complaining youre the only doctor who isnt he laughed actually im bitching plenty but too much of that and you get bored with yourself i keep telling myself its a good thing im salaried dont have to deal with the hmos directly maybe one day miloll pay all the bills thatll be the year he heads to paris for the big couture shows he laughed again but i was thinking paris where did that come from professor freud so youre busy i said just came off an eighteenhour funfest multicar collision daddy and mommy having a spat in front two kids in the back three and five no car seats no belts daddy and mommy survived she may even walk again enough of this or ill have to pay you the big guys not in breezed by for dinner then left he say where he was going nope we had chinese takeout and i nearly fell asleep in my moo goo when i woke hed tucked me in and left a note saying he might be busy for a while he did seem a little edgy is there something i should know about you two into something new no i said everythings old i tried reading watching tv listening to music meditating what a joke that was all i could focus on was bad stuff by pm i was ready to claw the plaster from the walls and wondering when robin would call again at this hour the eugene concert would be in full force and shed be backstage wonderfully harried needed all those guitarstrumming savetheworld sonofabitch rrrrring my hello was breathless what you in the middle of working out said milo im in the middle of nothing whats up i cant locate schwinn but i mightve found his old lady first name marge mecca ranch in oak view i said his exhalation was a protracted hiss well well well someones been a busy worker bee more like a drone howd you find her exemplary detective work he said i got hold of schwinns retirement file a naughty thing so this stays between you and me his pension checks went to the ranch for the first fifteen years after he left they went to an address in simi valley then he switched to a postoffice box in oxnard for two years then the ranch hes not listed in any dmv files but the address crossreferenced to marge schwinn i just called her got a machine left a message no dmv listing for him i said think hes dead or he doesnt drive anymore an excop who doesnt drive yeah he said true suburban life in simi followed by a twoyear pob interlude before the ranch that could be divorce intervening lonely bachelorhood remarriage or widowhood his first wife was named dorothy and she stopped being a beneficiary when he moved to oxnard two years later marge came on he paused dorothy i think he mentioned her name its getting hard to tell what i remember and whats wishful thinking anyway thats it for now i recounted my time in the library what id learned about the cossacks rich kids stay rich he said big surprise i also looked for melinda waters shes on no state files and neither is her mother eileen that may not mean much if she got married andor mom got remarried and they both changed their names i wish i knew the name of melindas navy dad but i never learned it the guy had shipped out to turkey good luck tracing that i did locate bowie ingalls and hes definitely dead nineteen years dead a year after janie i said what happened singlemotorist vehicular accident up in the hills ingalls plowed into a tree and went through the windshield blood alcohol four times the legal limit dozen bud empties in the car up in the hills where bel air near the reservoir why not that far from the party house so maybe he was reminiscing he said the facts still say drunk driver the whole cossack angle was pure supposition for all i know janie and melinda went to a whole other party or schwinn was right and there was no westside link at all they got picked up by a psychopath and slaughtered nearer to the dump site im tired alex gonna head home whats the plan with marge schwinn shes got my message and if she doesnt return it ill try again if schwinn is dead maybe marge sent the murder book i said she couldve come across it in his effects along with a reference to you and me anythings possible my friend if you do reach her mind if i tag along who says im visiting her i didnt answer he said what youve got nothing better to do not a thing he humphed robin called i said we talked good he said putting a question mark on the end of it i swerved back into safe territory by the way did you have time to run the prints on the murder book just one set that i can see mine well he said im no ace powder man but i have printed you and those whorls look familiar so whoever sent it wiped it clean i said interesting either way he knew exactly what i meant a careful cop or a fastidious taunting killer whatever he said nightynight have some sweet dreams yourself oh sure here come the sugarplum fairies chapter i didnt expect to hear from him anytime soon but the following morning at eleven he showed up at my front door wearing a navy windbreaker over a plaid shirt and baggy jeans below the jacket his gun bulged his waistline but otherwise he looked like a guy with a day off i was still in my robe no call so far from robin ready for fresh air he said horse manure all of the above the second mrs schwinn got back to you the second mrs schwinn didnt but i figured what the hell ojais pretty this time of year a reflexive ah rose in my throat and stuck there ill get dressed that would be best he said the sevilles nice on long drives and i obliged the moment i started the engine he threw back his head shut his eyes covered them with a handkerchief let his mouth drop open for the next hour he dozed in the passenger seat opening his eyes periodically to gaze out the window and appraise the world with distrust and wonder the way kids and cops do i didnt feel conversational either and i played music for company some old oscar aleman cuts from the buenos aires days aleman wailing away on a diamondbright nickelsilver national guitar the route to oak view was north on the transfer to the toward ventura then an exit on highway ten more miles on two lanes that sliced through pinkgray mountains but rose barely above sea level took us toward ojai ocean moisture hung in the air and the sky was cottony white above the horizon then slatecolored strata where the sun should have been the stifled light brought out the greens turned the world nuclearblast emerald it had been a few years since id been here chasing down a psychopath bent on revenge and meeting up with an impressive man named wilbert harrison i had no idea if harrison still lived in ojai a psychiatrist and a philosopher hed taken a reflective view of life and given the violence id introduced him to i could see him moving on the first few miles of highway were insulted by slag fields oil rigs rows of metallic coils that crowned the cableandpylon salad of an electrical plant like so much oversize fusilli soon after that everything turned woodsy and ojaiheterogenous cute little cabins graced by meticulous stone walls and shadowed by live oaks and pines cute little shops selling homemade candles and fragrances massage clinics yoga institutes schools that would teach you how to draw paint sculpt find inner peace if only youd let them into your consciousness mixed in with all that was the other side of smalltown life rusty mobile homes behind barbedwire fencing baitandtackle sheds trucks on blocks dusty homesteads with one or two hollowbellied horses nosing the dirt crude placards advertising beef jerky and homemade chili boarding stables modest shrines to the conventional god and everywhere the hawks huge relaxed confident circling in lazy predatory arcs mecca ranch was on the west side of announced by nailedon iron letters in a pine slab the sign bordered by cactus and some sort of wild grass a left turn up a barely paved road lined with scraggly birds of paradise in poor flower took us five hundred yards into low gentle hills that topped off at a couple of acres of gravelcolored mesa off to the right was a corral fashioned from iron posts and wooden crossbeams more than big enough for the five brown horses grazing sleek wellnourished steeds they paid us no attention directly behind the enclosure were several unhitched horse trailers and a bunk of paddocks up at roads end the birds of paradise were planted more closely together and better tended and the orangeandblue blossoms led the eye to a small flatroofed salmoncolored house with teal green wood trim parked in front were a tenyearold brown jeep wagoneer and a dodge pickup of the same color and vintage a transitory shadow washed over the corral a hawk orbiting so low i could see the surgical curve of its beak i turned off the engine got out filled my nose with the bite of pine and that curious maple syrupandrot tang of dried equine dung dead silence i could see pierce schwinn thinking this would be heaven but if he was like milo and so many other people hooked on noise and evil how long would that have lasted milo slammed the passenger door hard as if offering fair warning but no one came out to greet us and no face appeared in the houses undraped front windows we walked to the front door milos bellpush set off fifteen seconds of chimes some tune i couldnt identify but it brought back memories of missouri department store elevators now sound from the corral one horse whinnying still no human response the hawk had flown off i studied the animals wellmuscled mahogany creatures two stallions three mares manes glossy and combed over the corral arced a semicircle of iron soldered with vaguely moorish lettering mecca a triangle of blue had broken through the cottony sky the foothills ringing the ranch were greentopped gentle a nurturant border it was hard to imagine the murder book emanating from this quiet place milo rang again and a female voice called out one minute moments later the door opened the woman who stood there was petite and strongshouldered anywhere from fifty to sixty she wore a royal blue and yellow checked shirt tucked into tight jeans that showed off a flat tummy tight waist boyish hips creased but clean work boots peeked out from under the jeans white hair that retained some of its blond origins was tied back in a short ponytail a merest upward twist of free locks her features were strong in a way that made them attractive in later life but as a girl shed probably been plain her eyes were a mottle of green and brown lacking too much of the former to be called hazel shed plucked her eyebrows into spidery commas but wore no makeup her skin was testament to everything the sun could to do to skin puckered cracked corrugated coarse to the point of woodiness a few scarylooking dark patches danced under the eyes and crowned her chin when she smiled her teeth were the milky white pearls of a healthy virgin mrs schwinn said milo reaching for the badge before he got it out of his pocket the woman said im marge and i know who you are detective i got your messages no apology for not returning the calls once the smile faded not much in the way of any emotion and i wondered if that contributed to eventempered horses i know the cop look she explained what look is that maam fear mixed with anger always expecting the worst sometimes pierce and i would be riding and thered be a sound a scurrying in the brush and hed get the look so you were his last partner he talked about you she glanced at me the past tense hung heavy she bit her lip pierce is dead died last year im sorry so am i i miss him terribly when did he fell off a horse seven months ago one of my tamest akhbar pierce was no cowboy he never rode until he met me thats why i gave him akhbar as a regular mount and they bonded but something mustve spooked akhbar i found him down near lake casitas on his side with two broken legs pierce was a few yards away head split on a rock no pulse akhbar had to be put down im so sorry maam yeah im dealing with it okay its the goneness that hits you one day someones here and then marge schwinn snapped her fingers looked milo up and down basically youre what i expected given the passage of time youre not here to tell me something bad about pierce are you no maam why would i call me marge pierce loved being a detective but he had bitter feelings about the department said theyd been out to get him for years because he was an individualist ive got his pension coming in dont want funny business dont want to have to hire a lawyer thats why i didnt call you back i wasnt sure what you were up to her expression said she still wondered milo said its absolutely nothing about pierces pension and im not here as a representative of the department just working a case a case you worked with pierce a case i was supposed to work with pierce till he retired retired said marge thats one way to put it well thats nice pierce wouldve liked that you seeking his opinion after all these years he said you were smart come in coffees still warm tell me about your days with pierce tell me good things the house was spare and lowceilinged walls alternating between rough pine paneling and sandcolored grass cloth a series of tight dim rooms furnished with wellworn severe tweedy fifties furniture for which some twentyyearold starlet would gladly overpay at the latest la brea junktique the living room opened to a rear kitchen and we sat down opposite a blond kidneyshaped coffee table as marge schwinn filled mugs with chicoryscented coffee western prints hung on the grass cloth along with equestrian portraits a corner trophy hutch was full of gold and silk in the opposite corner was an old magnavox console tv with bakelite dials and a bulging greenish screen atop the set was a single framed photo a man and a woman too far away to make out the details the kitchen window framed a panoramic mountain view but the rest of the place was oriented toward the corral the horses hadnt moved much marge finished pouring and sat in a straightbacked chair that conformed to her perfect posture young body old face the tops of her hands were a giant freckle interrupted by spots of unblemished dermis callused wormed with veins pierce thought a lot of you she told milo milo got rid of the surprised look almost immediately but she saw it and smiled yes i know he told me he gave you all sorts of grief his last years on the force were a rough time in pierces life detective sturgis she lowered her eyes for a moment no more smile did you know that when you rode with pierce he was a drug addict milo blinked crossed his legs i remember that he used to take cold remedies decongestants thats right said marge but not for his sinuses for the high the decongestants were what he did openly on the sly he was fooling around with amphetamines speed he started doing it to stay awake on the job to be able to get back home to simi valley without falling asleep at the wheel thats where he lived with his first wife he got hooked bad did you know dorothy milo shook his head nice woman according to pierce shes dead too heart attack soon after pierce retired she was a chain smoker and very overweight thats how pierce first got his hands on speed dorothy had lots of prescriptions for diet pills and he started borrowing it got the better of him the way it always does he told me hed turned really nasty suspicious had mood swings couldnt sleep said he took it out on his partners especially you he felt bad about that said you were a smart kid he figured youd go far she trailed off milo tugged at the zipper of his windbreaker did pierce talk much about his work maam he didnt talk about specific cases if thats what you mean just how rotten the department was i think his work poisoned him as much as the speed when i met him hed touched bottom it was right after dorothys death and pierce had stopped paying rent on the simi house they never bought just rented he was living in a filthy motel in oxnard and earning minimum wage sweeping the floors at randalls western wear thats where i first saw him i was doing a show in ventura came in to randalls to look at boots collided with pierce when he took out the trash he knocked me on my rear we both ended up laughing about it i liked his laugh and he made me curious someone that age doing that job usually its young mexicans next time i came in we talked some more there was something about him strong no wasted words im a gabby type as you can see comes from living alone most of my life talking to the horses talking to myself so as not to go nuts this land was my grandfathers i inherited it from my parents i was the youngest stayed home to take care of mom and dad never strayed very far the horses pretend theyre listening to me thats what i liked about pierce he was a good listener soon i was making up reasons to drive down to oxnard she smiled bought a lot of boots and jeans and he never knocked me down again she reached for her coffee we knew each other a full year before we finally agreed to get married we did it because were oldfashioned no way would either of us live together without paper but most of what we had was friendship he was my best friend milo nodded when did pierce get off speed he was already getting off when i met him thats why he moved into that fleabag punishing himself he had some savings and his pension but was living like he was a broke bum because thats how he thought of himself by the time we started going out he was off dope completely but he was sure it did damage to him swisscheese brain he used to call it said if they ever xrayed his head theyd find holes big enough to stick a finger through mostly it was his balance and his memory he had to write things down or they were gone i told him that was just age but he wasnt convinced when he told me he wanted to learn how to ride i worried here he was not a young man no experience not the best balance but pierce managed to stay in the saddle until the horses loved him he had a calming influence on them maybe because of all hed been through getting himself clean maybe he ended up at a higher level than if he hadnt suffered youll probably find this hard to believe detective sturgis but during his time with me pierce was a blessedly serene man she got up retrieved the picture atop the tv held it out to us snapshot of schwinn and her leaning against the posts of the corral out front i had only milos rawbone oakie description to fuel my expectation of the former detective and had expected a grizzled old cop the look the man in the photo had long white hair that snaked past his shoulders and a snowy beard that reached nearly to his navel he wore a peanutbuttercolored buckskin jacket denim shirt blue jeans a turquoise bracelet one turquoise earring oldtime trapper or geriatric hippie hand in hand with a sunpunished woman who barely reached his shoulder i saw milos eyes widen he was my flower power grandpa said marge different from when you knew him huh a bit said milo she placed the picture in her lap so what kind of advice did you hope to get from him on this case of yours i was just wondering if pierce had any general recollections something that old and now youre working it again who got killed a girl named janie ingalls pierce ever mention that name no she said like i said he didnt talk about his work did pierce leave any papers behind what kind of papers anything to do with his work newspaper clippings photos police mementos no she said when he moved out of his simi house he got rid of everything didnt even own a car when we went out i had to pick him up back when i knew him said milo he was a photography buff he ever get back into that yes he did as a matter of fact he enjoyed taking walks in the hills and capturing nature bought himself a cheap little camera when i saw how much he liked it i bought him a nikon for his sixtyeighth birthday his pictures were pretty want to see them she took us to the houses single bedroom a tidy pinepaneled space filled by a queen bed covered with a batik spread and flanked by two mismatched nightstands framed photos blanketed the walls hills valleys trees arroyos dry and flowing sunrises sunsets the kiss of winter snow crisp colors good composition but nothing higher than vegetable on the evolutionary scale not even a bird in the sky nice said milo did pierce have his own darkroom we converted a half bath wasnt he talented he was maam when i knew pierce he liked to read about science did he well i never saw that mostly hed turned meditative could just sit in the living room and stare out at the view for hours except for the times when he got the cop look or had those dreams he was at peace ninetynine percent of the time he was at peace during the one percent i said did he ever say what was bothering him no sir during the last month or so before his accident how was his mood fine she said her face clouded oh no dont go thinking that it was an accident pierce wasnt a strong rider and he was sixtyeight years old i shouldnt have let him ride that long by himself even on akhbar that long said milo he was gone half a day usually he only rode for an hour or so he had his nikon with him said he wanted to catch some afternoon sun taking pictures he never got to the roll inside his camera was blank he mustve fallen right at the beginning and lain there for a while i shouldve gone looking sooner the doctor assured me that kind of head wound would have taken him right away at least he didnt suffer hit his head on a rock said milo she shook her head i dont want to talk about this anymore sorry maam milo stepped closer to the photos on the wall these really are good maam did pierce keep any albums of his slides or proofs marge stepped around the bed to the lefthand nightstand atop the table were a womans watch and an empty glass sliding open a drawer she removed two albums and placed them on the bed a pair of blue leather books fine morocco a size and style i recognized no labeling marge opened one began turning pages photographs encased in stiff plastic jackets held in place by black adhesive corner pockets green grass gray rock brown dirt blue sky pages of pierce schwinns fantasy of an inanimate world milo and i made admiring noises the second book held more of the same he ran a finger down its spine nice leather i bought them for him where said milo love to have one for myself oneill chapin right down the road over by the celestial café they cater to artists carry quality things these are originally from england but theyre discontinued i bought the last three wheres the third pierce never got to it you know why dont i give it to you i have no need for it and just thinking about pierces unfinished business makes me want to cry and pierce wouldve liked that your having it he thought a lot of you really maam no i insist said marge crossing the room and stepping into a walkin closet she emerged a moment later emptyhanded i could swear i saw it up here but that was a while back maybe its somewhere else maybe pierce took it over to the darkroom lets check the converted bathroom was at the end of the hall fivebyfive windowless acrid with chemicals a narrow wooden file cabinet next to the sink marge slid open drawers revealed boxes of photographic paper assorted bottles but no blue leather album no slides or proofs either i said looks like pierce mounted everything he had i guess she said but that third book so expensive its a shame to let it go to waste its got to be here somewhere tell you what if it shows up ill send it to you whats your address milo handed her a card homicide she said that word just jumps out at you i never thought much about pierces life before me didnt want to picture him spending so much time with the dead no offense its not a job for everyone maam pierce he was outwardly strong but inside he was sensitive had a need for beauty looks like he found it said milo looks like he found real happiness marges eyes moistened youre nice to say so well its been good meeting you coupla good listeners she smiled must be a cop thing we followed her to the front door where milo said did pierce ever have any visitors not a one detective the two of us hardly ever left the ranch except to buy provisions and that was maybe once a month for bulk shopping in oxnard or ventura once in a while wed go into santa barbara for a movie or to a play at the ojai theater but we never socialized tell the truth we were both darned antisocial evenings wed sit and look up at the sky that was more than enough for us the three of us walked to the seville marge looked toward the horses and said hold on guys groom times coming milo said thanks for your time mrs schwinn mrs schwinn said marge never thought id be mrs anybody but i do like the sound of that i guess i can be mrs schwinn forever cant i when we got in she leaned into the passenger window you wouldve liked the pierce i knew detective he didnt judge anyone touching milos hand briefly she turned on her heel and hurried toward the corral chapter back on highway i said so now we know where the book came from milo said guy pierces his ear turns into mr serene its california he didnt judge you know what she meant by that dont you schwinn decided my being gay was acceptable gee i feel so validated when you rode together was he homophobic nothing overt just general nastiness but what man of that generation likes queers i was always on edge with him with everyone fun times i said oh yeah whoopsiedoo i always felt he didnt trust me finally he came out and said so but wouldnt explain why knowing what we know now maybe it was speedparanoia but i dont think so think the department knew about his addiction they didnt bring it up when they interrogated me just concentrated on his whoring what i find interesting is that they eased him out with full pension rather than bring him up on charges i said maybe because going public about a doping whoring cop might have brought other doping whoring cops to light or it had something to do with handling the ingalls case several miles passed before he spoke again a speed freak asshole was a jumpy insomniac skinny as a razor gulped coffee and cough syrup like a vampire chugs blood add paranoia and the sudden mood swings and its narco i shoulda seen it you were concentrating on the job not his bad habits anyway turns out whatever personal feelings he had toward you he respected your skills thats why he had someone send you the book someone he snarled he dies seven months ago and the book arrives now think that someone could be good old marge she seemed to be dealing straight with us but who knows shes lived alone for most of her life couldve developed some survival instincts if it was her what are we dealing with schwinns last wish to wifeypoo and that doesnt explain why you were the gobetween same reason i said schwinn covering his tracks he pierced his ear but held on to a cops survival instinct paranoid to the end paranoia can be useful i said schwinn had built a new life for himself finally had something to lose he thought about that okay put aside who sent the damn thing and shift to the big question why schwinn held something back about janie for twenty years and started feeling guilty all of a sudden for most of those twenty years he had other things on his mind bitterness toward the department widowhood serious addiction sinking to the bottom like marge said he got old kicked his habit and bought himself a bunch of new distractions remarriage easing into a new life learning to sit still and stare at the stars finally had time to introspect i had a patient once a dutiful daughter taking care of her terminally ill mother a week before the mother passed on she motioned the daughter over and confessed to stabbing the womans father with a butcher knife as he lay sleeping my patient had been nine at the time all these years she and the rest of the family had been living with the myth of the bogeyman some nocturnal slasher her life had been a mass of fear and now she learned the truth from an eightyfouryearold murderer what schwinn knew he was gonna die the guy fell off a horse all im saying is old age and introspection can be an interesting combination maybe schwinn started reflecting about unfinished business decided to communicate with you about janie but still wanted to hedge his bets so he used me as a conduit if i didnt pass the book on to you hed have fulfilled his moral obligation if i gave it to you and you traced it to him hed deal with that but if you threatened him in any way he could always deny he puts together a whole bloody scrapbook just to remind me about janie the book probably started out as a twisted hobby exorcising his demons its no coincidence his later photos had no people in them hed seen people at the worst we rode in silence he sounds like a complicated man i said he was a freak alex pilfered death shots from the evidence room and cataloged them for personal enjoyment for all i know he got a sexual kick out of the book then he grew old and couldnt get it up anymore and decided to share he frowned i dont think marge knew about the murder book he wouldnta wanted her to think of him as a freak that means someone else sent it to you alex she made like the two of them had built this little domestic cocoon but i think she was real wrong another woman i said why not someone he visited when he wanted out from hilltop nirvana this is a guy who tumbled with whores in the backseat while on duty i dont have that much faith in transformation if there was another woman i said she might live far from ojai this is a small town too hard to be discreet that would explain the la postmark bastard he cursed under his breath i never liked the guy and now hes yanking my chain from the grave lets say he did have some big moral epiphany about janie what does the book communicate where am i supposed to take it screw this i dont have to play this game we didnt talk until i was back on the freeway at camarillo i shifted to the fast lane pushed the seville to eighty he mumbled pedal to the metal bastard starts feeling righteous and ive got to jump like a trained flea you dont have to do anything i said damn right im an amurrican entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of unhappiness we crossed the la county line by midafternoon stopped at a coffee shop in tarzana for burgers got back on ventura boulevard hooked a right at the newsstand at van nuys continued to valley vista and on to beverly glen along the way i had milo call my service on his cell phone robin hadnt called when we reached my house milo was still in no mood to talk but i said caroline cossack sticks in my mind why a girl poisoning a dog is more than a prank her brothers are all over the papers but she doesnt get a word of newsprint her mother ran a debutante ball but caroline wasnt listed as one of the debs she wasnt even included in her mothers funeral if you hadnt told me the poisoning story id never know she existed its as if the family spit her out maybe for good reason the neighbor that cranky old lady doc schwartzman mightve been overly imaginative she had no use for any of the cossacks but her most serious suspicions were of caroline he made no move to exit the car i said a girl using poison makes sense poisoning doesnt require physical confrontation so a disproportionate number of poisoners are female i dont have to tell you psychopathic killers often start with animals but theyre usually males who dig blood for a girl that young to act out so violently would be a serious red flag im wondering if carolines been confined all these years maybe because of something a lot worse than killing a dog or she died find the death certificate he knuckled his eyes looked up at my house poisons sneaky what was done to janie was blatant the way the body was dumped in an open spot no way did a girl do that im not saying caroline murdered janie by herself but she mightve been part of it mightve served as a lure for whoever did the cutting plenty of killers have used young women as bait paul bernardo charlie manson gerald gallegos christopher wilding caroline wouldve been the perfect lure for janie and melinda a girl their age outwardly inoffensive and rich caroline couldve stood by and watched as someone else did the wet work or participated the way the manson girls did maybe it was a group thing just like the mansons party scene gone bad females are affiliative even female killers group settings lower their inhibitions sugar and spice he said and the family found out put the screws on with the department to hush up the case locked crazy caroline away somewhere the ghoul in the attic big family money can furnish a really nice attic he accompanied me inside where i went through the mail and he got on the phone with county records and social security no death certificate on caroline cossack nor had she received a social security number or a drivers license melinda waters had received a card at age fifteen but shed never driven in california or worked or contributed payroll tax which made sense if shed died young but no certificate on her either disappeared i said melinda probably died the same night janie did and carolines either very well hidden or she expired too and the family hushed it up hidden as in hospitalized or just watched carefully rich kid like that shed have a trust fund could be living in some mediterranean villa with twentyfourhour supervision he began pacing little miss nowhere but at some point when she was a kid she had to have an identity be interesting to pinpoint when exactly she lost it school records i said living in bel air wouldve meant palisades or university high if the cossacks chose public school beverly if they played fast and loose with residency forms on the private side thered be harvardwestlake which was westlake school for girls back then or marlborough buckley john thomas dye crossroads he flipped open his pad scrawled notes or i added a school for troubled kids any particular place come to mind i was in practice back then can recall three very highpriced spreads one was in west la the others were in santa monica and the valley north hollywood names i recited and he got back on the phone santa monica prep was defunct but achievement house in cheviot hills and valley educational academy in north hollywood were still in business he reached both schools but hung up frowning no onell give me the time of day confidentiality and all that schools dont enjoy confidentiality privileges i said you ever deal with either of the places professionally i visited achievement house once i said the parents of a boy i was seeing kept holding the place over the kids head as a threat if you dont shape up well send you to achievement house that seemed to scare him so i dropped by to see what spooked him talked to a social worker got the fiveminute tour converted apartment building near motor and palms what stuck in my mind was how small it was maybe twentyfive thirty kids boarding in meaning it had to cost a fortune no snake pit that i could see later i talked to my patient and turns out what he was worried about was stigmatization being thought of as a weirdogeekloser achievement house had a bad reputation in his mind any special placement had a bad reputation did he get sent there no he ran away wasnt seen for years oh he said i smiled dont you mean ah he laughed got himself grapefruit juice opened the freezer and stared at the vodka bottle but changed his mind ran away your version of loose ends loose ends were a big part of my life back then i said the price of an interesting job as it turns out this particular kid made it okay he stayed in touch he called after his second child was born ostensibly to ask about how to handle sibling jealousy he ended up apologizing for being a surly teen i told him he had nothing to be sorry about because id finally learned the whole story from his mother his older brother had been molesting him since he was five his face got hard family values he paced some more finished his juice washed the glass got back on the phone contacting palisades and university and beverly hills high schools then the private institutions putting on the charm claiming to be conducting an alumnus search for whos who no one had caroline cossack on their files little miss nowhere hed talked about washing his hands of the ingalls case but his face was flushed and hunters tension bunched his shoulders i didnt tell you he said but yesterday i went over to parker center and searched for janies case file disappeared nothing at the metro office or in evidence or the coroners not even a coldcase classification or a notice that the file had been moved somewhere else there is absolutely no paper anywhere that says the case was ever opened in the first place i know it was because i opened it schwinn used to shove all the paperwork at me i filled out the right forms transcribed my street notes created the murder book no coroners records so much for science i said whens the last time you saw the file the morning before my interrogation by broussard and that swede after they worked me over i was so shaken up i didnt return to my desk just split the station the next day the transfer notice was in my box and my desk had been cleared he tilted back in his chair stretched his legs seemed suddenly relaxed you know my friend ive been working too damn hard maybe thats what i can learn from old mr serene stop and sniff the manure a smile abrupt and broad did something unsettling to his mouth he rotated his head for several turns as if working kinks out of his neck brushed black strands of hair out of his face sprang to his feet see you thanks for your time where are you headed i said into a life of meditative leisure got lots of vacation time stored up seems a good time to cash in chapter leisure was the last thing i needed the moment the door closed i reached for the phone larry daschoff and i have known each other since grad school after our internships i took a professorship at the med school crosstown and worked the cancer wards at western pediatric medical center and he went straight into private practice i stayed single and he married his high school sweetheart sired six kids made a good living converted his squaremealinaroundcan defensiveguard physique to middleaged fat watched his wife go back to law school took up golf now he was a young grandfather living on investment income wintering in palm desert i reached him at his condo there it had been some time since wed spoken and i asked him about the wife and kids everyones great especially the ultimate grandchild well as long as you asked yes samuel jason daschoff is clearly the messenger of the second coming another jewish savior little guy just turned two and has evolved from sweetness and light to ageappropriate obnoxiousness let me tell you alex theres no revenge sweeter than watching your own kids contend with the crap they shoveled at you ill bet i said wondering if id ever know so said larry howve you been doing keeping busy im actually calling you about a case i figured as much oh you were always taskoriented alex youre saying i cant be purely sociable like i can be purely skinny what kind of case therapy or the bad stuff you do with the constabulary the bad stuff still subjecting yourself to that still i guess i can understand the motivation he said its a helluva lot more exciting than breathing in angst all day and you were never one to sit still so how can i help you i described caroline cossack without mentioning names asked him to guess where a teen that troubled mightve been schooled twenty years back dosing rover with cyanide he said impolite how come she didnt end up in trouble maybe family connections i said as i realized incarceration would be an excellent reason not to have a social security card and neither milo nor i had thought of checking prison records both of us thrown off kilter a rich notnice kid said larry well back then there was no real place for a runofthemill dangerous delinquent other than the state hospital system camarillo but i suppose a rich family couldve placed her somewhere cushy i was thinking achievement house or valley educational or their outofstate counterparts definitely not valley educational alex i consulted there and they stayed away from delinquents concentrated on learning probs even back then they were getting fifteengrand tuition had a twoyear waiting list so they could afford to be picky unless the family covered up the extent of the girls pathology but that kind of violent tendency would be hard to suppress for very long as far as achievement house i never had any direct experience with them but i know someone who did right around that time period too now that i think about it nineteen twenty years ago not a pretty situation for the students for the someone i know remember when i used to do mentoring for the department undergrads considering psych as a career one of my mentorees was a freshman girl precocious barely seventeen she got herself a volunteer placement at achievement house what problems did she have there the director got overtly freudian with her sexual harassment back then it was just called mashing and groping despite her age the girl was a clearheaded feminist way ahead of her time complained to the board of directors who promptly gave her the boot she talked to me about pursuing it she was really traumatized and i offered to back her up if she wanted to take it further but in the end she decided not to she knew it was his word against hers he was the respected health administrator and she was a goodlooking teenager who wore her skirts too short i supported the decision what would she have gained other than a mess was there ever any suggestion the director was molesting students not that i heard remember his name alex i really dont want my mentoree drawn into it i promise she wont be larner michael larner psychologist or psychiatrist business type administrator are you still in touch with the mentoree occasionally mostly for crossreferrals she stayed on track graduated summa got her phd at penn did a fellowship at michigan moved back here shes got a nice westside practice is there any way to ask her if shed talk to me silence you think this is important honestly i dont know larry if asking her will put you in a difficult position forget it let me think about it he said ill let you know that would be great great he said extremely helpful you know he said right as we speak ive got my feet up and my belt loosened and im looking out at miles of clean white sand just finished a plate of chile rellenos con mucho cerveza just let out a sonicboom belch and no ones around to give me a funny look to me thats great i heard from him an hour later her names allison gwynn and you can call her but she definitely doesnt want to get involved in any police business no problem i said so he said hows everything else everythings fine we should get together for dinner with the women next time we come into town good idea i said call me larry thanks everythings really okay sure why do you ask dont know you sound a bit tentative but maybe its just that i havent talked to you in a while i called dr allison gwynn at her santa monica exchange a youhavereachedtheoffice tape answered but when i mentioned my name a softaroundtheedges female voice broke in this is allison its funny larry calling out of the blue and asking if id talk to you ive been reading some articles on pain control and a couple were yours i do some work at st agnes hospice those articles are ancient history not really she said people and their pain dont change that much most of what you said still holds true anyway larry says you want to know about achievement house its been a long time nearly twenty years since i had anything to do with that place thats exactly the time period im interested in what do you need to know i gave her the same anonymous description of caroline cossack i see she said larry assures me youll be discreet absolutely thats essential dr delaware look i cant talk now have a patient in two minutes and after that im running a group at the hospice this evening ill be teaching but in between i will be eating dinner fiveish or so if you want to stop by thats fine i usually go to café maurice on broadway near sixth because its close to st agnes ill be there i said i really appreciate it no problem she said i hope i endured the afternoon by running too fast for too long trudged up my front steps winded and dehydrated and checked the phone machine two hangups and a canned solicitation for discount home loans i pressed and traced the hangups to a harried woman in east la who spoke only spanish and had dialed a very wrong number and a montana avenue boutique wondering if robin castagna would be interested in some new silk fashions from india i guess i shouldve left a message said the nasal girl on the other end but the owner likes us to make personal contact so do you think robin might be interested according to our records she bought a bunch of cool stuff last year when i talk to her ill ask her oh okay you could come in yourself you know do like a gift thing if she doesnt like it well give her full store credit on return women love to be surprised do they oh sure totally ill bear that in mind you really should women love when guys like surprise them like a trip to paris i said paris she laughed you can surprise me with that dont tell robin i said that okay at pm i stepped out the kitchen door to the rear patio crossed the garden to robins studio unlocked the cool vaulted room and walked around smelling wood dust and lacquer and chanel no and listening to the echos of my footsteps shed swept the floor clean packed her tools put everything in its place afternoon sun streamed through the windows beautiful space in perfect order it felt like a crypt i returned to the house and skimmed the morning paper the world hadnt changed much why did i feel so altered at fourthirty i showered got dressed in a blue blazer white shirt clean blue jeans brown suede loafers at ten after five i walked into café maurice the restaurant was compact and dark with a coppertopped bar and a half dozen tables set with white linen the walls were raised walnut panels the ceiling repousse tin inoffensive music on low volume competed with low conversation among three whiteaproned waiters old enough to be my father i couldnt help but think of the left bank bistro where robin had told me of her plans i buttoned my jacket and allowed my eyes to acclimate the sole patron was a darkhaired woman at a center table peering into a glass of burgundy she wore a formfitted whiskeycolored tweed jacket over a cream silk blouse a long oatmealcolored skirt with a slit up the side beige calfskin boots with substantial heels a big leather bag sat on the chair next to her she looked up as i approached and gave a tentative smile dr gwynn alex delaware allison she placed her bag on the floor and held out a slender white hand we shook and i sat she was a longstemmed beauty out of john singer sargent ivory face soft but assertive cheekbones highlighted with blush a wide strong mouth shaded coral huge judiciously lined deep blue eyes under strong arching brows studied me warm scrutiny no intrusiveness her patients would appreciate that her hair was a sheet of true black that hung midway down her back circling one wrist was a diamond tennis bracelet the other sported a gold watch baroque pearls dotted each earlobe and a gold link cameo necklace rested on her breastbone her hand returned to her wineglass good manicure frenchtipped nails left just long enough to avoid frivolousness i knew she was thirtysix or seven but despite the tailored clothes the baubles the cosmetics she looked ten years younger thanks for your time i said i wasnt sure if you were a punctual person she said so i ordered for myself i only have an hour till class same gentle voice as over the phone she waved and one of the ancient waiters tore himself away from the staff confab brought a menu and hovered what do you recommend i asked the entrecôte is great i like it rare and bloody but theyve got a pretty good selection of more virtuous stuff if youre not into red meat the waiter tapped his foot whatre you drinking sir weve got a good selection of microbrews id expected a gallic accent but his drawl was pure california surfer boy grown old and i found myself musing about a future where grandmothers would be named amber and heather and tawny and misty grolsch i said and ill have the entrecôte medium rare he left and allison gwynn smoothed alreadysmooth hair and twirled her wineglass she avoided my eyes what kind of work do you do at st agnes i said you know the place i know of it just some volunteer work she said mostly helping the staff cope do you still work in oncology no not for a while she nodded it can be tough she drank some wine where do you teach i said the u adult extension this quarter im doing personality theory and human relations all that and a practice sounds like a busy schedule i said im a workaholic she said with sudden cheer hyperactivity channeled in a socially appropriate manner my beer arrived we both drank i was about to get down to substance when she said the girl you described would that be caroline cossack i put down my mug you knew caroline so it was her how did you know from your description she stood out oh yes what can you tell me about her not much im afraid she stood out because of how they labeled her there was a pink tab on her chart the only one id seen and id seen most of the charts was a gofer that summer running errands picking up and delivering files they used a colorcoding system to alert the staff if a kid had a medical problem yellow for juvenile diabetes blue for asthma that kind of thing caroline cossacks tab was pink and when i asked someone what that meant they said it was a behavioral warning high risk for acting out that and your saying it might be a police case helped me put it together so caroline was high risk for violence someone thought so back then what specifically were they worried about i said i dont know she never did anything wrong during the month i was there but she was the only one labeled like that yes she said there werent a lot of kids period maybe thirty back then achievement house was exactly what it is today a repository for rich kids who fail to perform to their parents expectations chronically truant drugabusing noncompliant children of the dream i thought take away the dream and you had janie and melinda but she went on they were basically harmless kids other than the obvious sneaky doping and drinking nothing seriously antisocial went on that i saw harmless kids locked up i said it wasnt that draconian she said more carrot than stick highpriced babysitting they locked the doors at night but it didnt feel like a prison what else can you tell me about caroline she didnt seem scary at all i recall her as quiet and passive thats why the behavioral warning surprised me she licked her lips moved her wineglass aside thats really all i can tell you i was a student volunteer fresh out of high school didnt ask questions her face tilted to the left the enormous blue eyes didnt blink bringing up that place is not the most fun thing ive done all week larry told you about my experience there with larner i nodded if the same thing happened today she said you can bet id be a lot more proactive probably page gloria allred close that place down and walk away with a settlement but im not blaming myself for how i handled it so have you worked with the police for a while a few years do you find it difficult difficult in what way i said all the authoritarian personalities for starts mostly i deal with one detective i said hes a good friend oh she said so you find it fulfilling it can be what aspect trying to explain the unexplainable one of her hands covered the other jewelry everywhere else but no rings on her fingers why had i noticed that i said if you dont mind i have a few more questions about caroline she grinned go ahead did you have much personal contact with her nothing direct but i was allowed to sit in on some therapy groups and she was in one of them general purpose rap session the leader tried to draw her out but caroline never talked would just stare at the floor and pretend not to hear i could tell she was taking it in though when she got upset her facial muscles twitched what upset her any personal probing what was she like physically i said all this interest twenty years later she said you cant tell me what she did she may have done nothing i said sorry to be evasive but this is all very preliminary unofficial too a lot of my work is random archaeology both her hands cupped her wineglass no gory details aw shucks she laughed showed perfect teeth im not sure id really want to know anyway okay caroline physically this is all through the perspective of my seventeenyearold eyes she was short kind of mousy a little chubby unkempt stringy hair mousy brown she wore it to here she leveled a hand at her own shoulder it always looked unwashed she had acne what else she had a defeated posture as if something heavy sat on her shoulders the kids were allowed to dress any way they wanted but caroline always wore the same shapeless dresses old ladys housedresses i wonder where she found them dressing down i said she sounds depressed definitely did she hang around with the other kids no she was a loner shleppy withdrawn i guess today id look at her and be thinking schizoid but they saw her as potentially aggressive they did howd she spend her time mostly she sat in her room by herself dragged herself to meals returned alone when id pass her in the hall id smile and say hello but i kept my distance because of the pink tab a couple of times i think she nodded back but mostly she shuffled on keeping her eyes down was she medicated i never read her chart now that i think about it its possible the group leader who tried to draw her out do you remember a name jody lavery she said she was a clinical social worker very nice to me when i had my problem with larner years later i ran into her at a convention and we ended up becoming friends did some crossreferring but forget about talking to her she died two years ago and she and i never talked about caroline caroline was more of a nonentity than an entity if not for the pink tab i probably wouldnt have paid her any attention at all in fact the only sir madam said the waiter our dishes were set in place and we cut into our steaks excellent i said after the first bite glad you like it she speared a french fry you were about to say something was i you were talking about caroline not being memorable then you said in fact the only hmm oh yes i was saying the only person i ever saw her talk to was one of the maintenance men willie something a black guy willie burns i remember his name because it was the same as robert burns and i recall thinking there was nothing scottish about him he paid special attention to caroline i suppose you could say that once or twice i came across him and caroline chatting in the hall and they moved apart very quickly and willie resumed working and one time i did see willie coming out of carolines room carrying a mop and broom when he saw me he said shed been sick he was cleaning up volunteering an explanation it was kind of furtive whatever the situation burns didnt stick around long one week he was there then he was gone and caroline went back to being alone a week i said it seemed like a short period do you remember what month this was had to be august i was only there during august janie ingalls had been murdered in early june how old was willy burns not much older than caroline maybe twenty twentyone i thought it was nice someone paying attention to her do you know something about him i shook my head you didnt read the chart but did you ever hear why caroline was sent to achievement house i assumed the same reason every other kid was unable to jump high hurdles i know that world alex grew up in beverly hills my dad was an assistant attorney general i thought i wanted something simple would never return to california larry said you went to penn for grad school went to penn and loved it then i spent a couple of years at ann arbor came back to penn and took an assistant professorship if it had been up to me id have stayed back east but i married a wharton guy and he got a fantastic job offer at union oil here in la and all of a sudden we were living in a condo on the wilshire corridor and i was cramming for the california boards sounds like things have worked out i said shed speared steak on her fork and dipped it in bearnaise the meat remained suspended for a moment then she placed the fork down on her plate life was rolling along quite nicely then three summers ago my father woke up at am with chest pains and my mom called us in a panic grant my husband and i rushed over and the three of us took dad to the hospital and while they were working him up grant wandered off i was so caught up supporting mom and waiting for the verdict on dad that i didnt pay much attention finally just as they told us dad was fine gastric reflux and we could take him home grant showed up and from the look on his face i knew something was wrong we didnt talk until after we dropped mom and dad off then he told me he hadnt been feeling well for a while bad stomachaches hed figured it was job stress kept thinking the pain would go away was eating antacids like candy hadnt wanted to alarm me but then the pain got unbearable so while we were at the hospital he got hold of a doctor he knew a penn golfing buddy and had x rays taken and they found spots all over a rare bileduct tumor that had spread five weeks later i was the mourning widow living back with mom and dad im sorry she nudged her plate away its rude of me to unload like this another tentative smile ill blame it on your being too good a listener without thinking i reached out and patted her hand she squeezed my fingers then spiderwalked away took hold of her wineglass drank while staring past me i took a healthy swallow of beer want to hear something funny she said tonight im lecturing about posttraumatic stress listen alex its been nice meeting you and good luck with whatever youre trying to do but ive really got to run she summoned the waiter and over her objections i paid the check she removed a gold compact and lipstick from her bag freshened her mouth touched a long black eyelash checked her face in the mirror we got up from the table id figured her for tall but in threeinch heels she wasnt more than fivefive another little looker just like robin we left the restaurant together her car was a tenyearold black jaguar xjs convertible that she stepped into with agility and revved hard i watched her drive away her eyes stayed fixed on the road chapter two new names michael larner willie burns perhaps both were irrelevant but i drove south into cheviot hills located achievement house on a culdesac just east of motor and south of palms idled the seville across the street the building was an undistinguished twostory box next to an open parking lot pale blue in the moonlight surrounded by white iron fencing the front façade was windowless glass doors blocked entry to what was probably an interior courtyard half a dozen cars sat in the lot under highvoltage lighting but the building was dark and there was no signage i could see from this distance wondering if i had the right location i got out and crossed the street and peered through the fence slats tiny white numbers verified the address tiny white letters nearly invisible in the darkness spelled out achievement house private property i squinted to get a look at what was behind the glass doors but the courtyard if thats what it was was unlit and all i made out was reflection the street was far from quiet traffic from motor intruded in bursts and the more distant rumble of the freeway thrummed nonstop i got back in the car drove to the u returned to the research library got my itchy hands on that old friend the periodicals index nothing on willie burns which was no surprise how many janitors made the news but michael larners name popped up twelve times during the past two decades two citations were dated from larners tenure as director of achievement house coverage of fundraising events no photos no quotes then nothing for the next three years until larner popped up as official spokesman for maxwell films demeaning the character of an actress sued by the film company for breach of contract no followup on how that case resolved and a year later larner had made another occupational change an independent producer inking a deal with the very same actress for a scifi epic a movie id never heard of the industry given larners sexual aggressiveness it was either that or politics the next four citations caught my eye because of larners new affiliation director of operations for cossack development these were brief items from the business section of the times larners job seemed to be lobbying council members for garvey and bobs development deals caroline cossack shunted to achievement house soon after janie ingallss murder not the kind of kid achievement house accepted but a few years later the director was working for the cossack family id be brightening milos evening i got home and checked my phone machine still nothing from robin not like her then i thought everythings new the rules have changed i realized id never gotten an itinerary of the tour i hadnt asked and robin hadnt offered no ones fault both of us caught up everything moving so fast the two of us tripping through the calisthenics of separation i went into my office booted up the computer found the kill famine tours homepage pr shots and cheerful hype links to mailorder cd purchases photostreams of previous concerts finally times and dates and venues eugene seattle vancouver denver albuquerque everything subject to change i phoned the vancouver arena got voice mail and entered a pushbutton maze to learn our offices are closed open tomorrow at a m left out in the cold id never set out to exclude robin from my life or had i during all the time wed spent together id kept my work to myself kept her at arms length claiming confidentiality even when it didnt apply telling myself it was for her good she was an artist gifted sensitive needed to be protected from the ugliness sometimes shed learned what id been up to the hard way the night id blown it shed left the house for a recording studio full of trust the moment she was gone i left for a meeting with a beautiful crazy dangerous young woman id screwed up royally but hadnt my intentions been noble blah blah blah two tickets to paris pathetic a sudden rush of memories took hold exactly what id worked hard at forgetting the other time wed separated ten years ago nothing to do with my bad behavior that had been all robin needing to find her own way forge her own identity lord rephrased that way it sounded like a poppsych cliché and she deserved better i loved her she loved me so why wasnt she calling grow up pal its only been two days and you werent exactly mr charming the last time she tried had i failed some kind of test by letting her go too easily ten years ago shed come back but not before dont get into that but at that moment i wanted nothing but punishment opened the box let loose the furies the first time shed stayed away for a long time and eventually id found another woman then that had ended well before robin returned when we reunited robin had seemed a bit more fragile but otherwise everything seemed to be fine then one day she broke down and confessed shed found someone too a guy just a guy a stupid guy shed been stupid really stupid alex id held her comforted her then she told me pregnancy abortion shed never told the guy dennis id blocked out his name goddamn dennis had gotten her pregnant and shed left him gone through the ordeal alone i kept holding her said the right things what a sensitive guy the essence of understanding but a nagging little voice in my head refused to let go of the obvious all those years together she and i had waltzed around the topic of marriage and kids had been careful a few months away from me and another mans seed had found its way had i ever really forgiven her did she wonder about that too what was she thinking about right now where the hell was she i picked up the phone wondered who to call swept the damn thing off the desk and onto the floor screw you mr bell my face was hot and my bones twitched and i began pacing the way milo does not limiting myself to one room racing around the entire house unable to burn off the pain home smothering home i headed for the front door threw it open threw myself into the night i walked the glen north up into the hills did it the stupid way with the traffic to my back undeterred by the rush of approaching engines the flashfreeze of headlights drivers sped by honking someone yelled idiot that felt right it took miles before i was able to conjure up janie ingallss corpse and relax when i got back to the house the front door was ajar id neglected to shut it and leaves had blown into the entry i got down on my knees picked up every speck returned to my office the phone remained on the floor the answering machine had tumbled too and lay there unplugged but the machine in the bedroom was blinking one message i ignored it went to the kitchen got the vodka out of the freezer used the bottle to cool my hands and my face put it back i watched tv for hours ingested hollow laughter tortured dialogue commercials for herbal sexual potency remedies and miracle chemicals that attacked the most hideous of stains shortly after midnight i punched the bedroom machines play button alex i guess youre not in we were supposed to fly to canada but weve been held over in seattle doing an extra show there were some equipment modifications that needed to be done before the concert so i was tied up i guess youre out again anyway im at the four seasons in seattle they gave me a nice room its raining alex i hope youre okay im sure you are bye honey bye honey no i love you she always said i love you chapter at am i called the four seasons in seattle the operator said its past the time where we put calls through sir shell talk to me are you her husband her boyfriend well actually it looks like youre going to have to leave a message ive got her as out of her room her voice mails engaged here you go she put me through i hung up trudged to bed fell into something that mightve been called sleep had it been restful found myself sitting up at am drymouthed and seeing double at seven i phoned milo his voice was fuzzy as if filtered through a hay bale yo general delaware he said isnt it a little early for my field report i told him what id learned about caroline cossack and michael larner jesus i havent even brushed my teeth okay let me digest this you figure this larner did a favor for the cossacks by stashing caroline and they paid him back what fifteen years later not exactly immediate gratification there couldve been other rewards along the way both larner and the cossacks were involved in independent film production you find any film link between them no but no matter ill buy a relationship between larner and carolines family she was a screwy kid and larner ran a place for screwy kids it says nothing about what got her in there in the first place the behavioral warning on her chart says plenty my source says caroline was the only one tagged anyway do what you want with it sure thanks you all right everyone kept asking me the same damn question i forced amiability into my voice im fine you sound like me in the morning you rarely hear me this early that must be it behavioral warning huh but your source didnt know why the assumption was some kind of antisocial or aggressive behavior add to that dr schwartzmans dead akita and a picture starts forming a rich kid doing very bad things would explain a coverup your basic disturbed loner he said what would we homicide folk do without them something else i said i was thinking maybe the reason caroline never got a social security card was because eventually she did act out and ended up in lockup yeah i thought of that right after we talked stupid of me not to jump on that sooner but sorry shes not in any state penitentiary in the lower fortyeight hawaii or alaska i suppose its possible shes stashed at some federal pen or maybe you were right about them shipping her to some nice little villa in ibiza sunsplashed exterior padded walls know of anyone wholl fund a factfinding mediterranean tour for a deserving detective fill out a form and submit it to john g broussard hey gosharoo why didnt i think of that alex thanks for your time but the whole thing is still deadending just like twenty years ago ive got no files no notes to fall back on cant even locate melinda waterss mother and i was thinking about something i gave eileen waters my card if melinda never returned home wouldnt she have called me back maybe she did and you never got the message you were in west la by then i got other calls he said bullshit stuff central forwarded them to me exactly silence maybe in any event i cant see anywhere to take it one more thing i said i told him about willie burns expected him to blow it off he said willie burns would he be around forty by now twenty or twentyone then so yeah i knew a willie burns he had a baby face he said woulda been twentythree back then his voice had changed softer lower focused who is he i said maybe no one he said let me get back to you he phoned two hours later sounding tight and distracted as if someone was hovering nearby where are you i said at my desk thought you were taking vacation time theres paper to clear whos willie burns i said lets chat in person he said do you have time sure you do youre living the merry bachelor life meet me out in front of the station lets say half an hour he was standing near the curb and hopped into the seville before the car had come to a full stop where to i said anywhere i continued up butler took a random turn and cruised the modest residential streets that surround the west la station when id put half a mile between us and his desk he said there is definitely a god and hes jerking my chain payment for old sins what sins the worst one failure willie burns is another cold one willie burns is an old perp on a cold one wilbert lorenzo burns dob fortythree and a half years ago suspicion of homicide i picked it up right after i transferred and guess what another file seems to have gone missing but i did manage to find one of burnss old probation officers and he came up with some old paper and there it was achievement house willied finagled a summer placement there lasted less than a month and was booted for absenteeism a homicide suspect and hes working with problem teens back then he was just a junkie and a dealer same question guess willie never told him about his background whod he kill bail bondsman name of boris nemerov ran his business right here in west la big tough guy but he sometimes had a soft heart for cons because he himself had spent some time in a siberian gulag you know how bail bonds work the accused puts up a percentage of the bail and leaves collateral if he skips trial the bondsman pays the court and confiscates the collateral basically he said except generally the bondsman doesnt actually pay the initial bail with his own money he buys a policy from an insurance company for two to six percent of the total bail to cover the premiums and make a profit he collects a fee from the perp usually ten percent nonrefundable if the perp goes fugitive the insurance company shells out to the court and has the right to collect the collateral which is usually a piece of property grandma letting her beloved felon offspring tie up the cute little bungalow where shes lived for two hundred years but seizing the cottage from poor old grandma takes time and money and gets bad press and what do insurance companies want with lowrent real estate so theyd always rather have the perp in hand thats why they send out bounty hunters who take their cut trickledown economics i said crimes good for the gdp boris nemerov made out okay as a bondsman treated people like human beings and had a low skip rate but he sometimes took risks forgoing collateral discounting his ten percent hed done that for willie burns because burns was a habitual client whod never let him down before last time burns presented himself to nemerov he had no collateral what was the charge dope as usual this was after he was fired at achievement house and didnt show up at his probation appointment up till then burns had been nonviolent as far as i could tell his juvey record began at age nine and it was sealed his adult crime career commenced the moment he was old enough to be considered an adult one week after his eighteenth birthday petty theft drugs more drugs yet more drugs a whole bunch of plea bargains put him back on the street then he finally had to stand trial and got probation the last bust was more serious burns was caught trying to peddle heroin to some junkies on the venice walkway the junkie he picked was an undercover officer and the arrest came during one of those times when the department claimed to be fighting the war on drugs all of a sudden burns faced a tenyear sentence and the court imposed a fiftythousanddollar bond burns went to boris nemerov as usual and nemerov posted for him and accepted burnss promise to work off the five grand but this time burns skipped nemerov called around trying to locate burnss family friends got zilch the address burns had listed was a parking lot in watts nemerov started to get irritated started i said patient fellow cold winters on the steppes can teach you patience eventually nemerov put the bounty hunters on burnss trail but they got nowhere then out of the blue nemerov got a call from burns guy claimed to want to give himself up but was scared the hunters were gonna shoot him in his tracks nemerov tried to put his mind at ease but burns was freaking out paranoid said people were after him nemerov agreed to pick up burns personally east of robertson near the east overpass nemerov set out late at night in this big old gold lincoln he used to tool around in never came home mrs nemerov went crazy missing persons prioritized it because boris was wellknown at the station two days later the lincoln was found in an alley behind an apartment on guthrie not far from the meeting place those days the neighborhood was serious gang territory meeting burns alone there didnt worry nemerov boris was selfconfident big jolly type probably thought hed seen the worst and survived the lincoln was stripped and gutted and covered with branches someone had made a halfbaked attempt to conceal it boris was in the trunk bound and gagged three holes in the back of his head execution i said no good deed goes unpunished del hardy and i got the case and worked it all the way to nowhere you would think something like that would make the papers burnss name pulled up zilch that i can explain nemerovs family wanted it kept quiet and we obliged they didnt want boriss lapse in judgment made public bad for business and they had quite a few favors to pull in reporters kids whod been bailed out cops kids too del and i were ordered to do our job but to do it very quietly did that hamstring you not really finding burns wasnt going to be accomplished by feeding the press the nemerovs were decent folk first everything theyd gone through in russia and now this we didnt want to upset them everyone felt bad about the whole thing the business almost went under anyway the insurance companies werent pleased wanted to sever all ties nemerovs widow and son agreed to eat all fifty grand of burnss forfeited bail and begged for a chance to prove themselves they managed to hold on to most of their policies eventually they got their heads above water theyre still in business same place right around the corner from the station nowadays theyre known for never giving an inch and willie burnss trail went cold i said i dogged him for years alex anytime i had a lull i checked on the asshole i was sure hed turn up eventually because a junkies unlikely to change his ways my bet was hed end up incarcerated or dead maybe he did end up dead i said the nemerov family had access to professional searchers even good folk can develop a thirst for revenge my gut says no but if thats what happened its a definite dead end im starting to feel like im back in junior high staring at tests i flunked maybe its only one big test i said maybe willie burns knew caroline before she was sent to achievement house one of the black guys dr schwartzman saw caroline hanging with burnss murdering nemerov couldve been nothing new for him because hed killed before at a party in bel air burnss record was nonviolent alex till it wasnt i said what if the nonviolent crimes were the ones he never got caught for was he only into heroin no polydrug addict heroin acid pills meth since the age of ten ups and downs i said unpredictable behavior put someone like that in contact with an unbalanced kid like caroline stick both of them at a dope party where two nottoobright street girls show up and who knows what might happen carolines family suspected or knew shed been part of something bad and sent her to achievement house willie split back to the streets but found his way over to achievement house to visit caroline stupid move but junkies are impulsive and no one caught on he worked there for a month was fired because of absenteeism he drummed his fingers on his knees burns and caroline as a killing couple with or without additional friends burns participating in a murder could also explain his skipping out on nemerov the city was clamping down on dope dealers and he knew he was likely to serve time that wouldve made him a captive audience if janie ingallss murder came to light then whyd he call nemerov and offer to turn himself in to accomplish exactly what he did ambush nemerov rob him take his car it was stripped for all we know burns fenced the stereo and the phone and that halfbaked attempt at hiding it is pure hype also carolines disappearance could be willie taking no chances figuring she was high risk to talk if burns or anyone else disappeared caroline you dont think her family wouldve reacted leaned on the department to solve it maybe not caroline had been an embarrassment to them all through childhood the weird sib and if they knew shed been an accomplice to murder theyd have wanted to keep it quiet its consistent with sequestering her at achievement house with a pink tab he said burns found her anyway maybe she contacted him for all we know she was with him when he ambushed boris nemerov when exactly was nemerov executed december right before christmas i remember mrs nemerov talking about it how they were russian orthodox celebrated in january thered be nothing to celebrate caroline was at achievement house in august i said four months later she couldve been out of there willie couldve broken her out perhaps they were planning to cut town all along and thats why burns was trying to sell dope in venice my my so many possibilities he said ah he had me drive in the direction of the station then turn onto purdue and park in front of an old redbrick building just south of santa monica boulevard the entrance to kwik n ready bail bonds was a glassfronted storefront heralded by neon above the door and gold leaf on the glass unlike achievement house this placed welcomed attention i pointed to the no stopping tow away warning milo said ill watch out for the parking nazis failing that ill go your bail the front office was a stuffy sliver of fluorescence with a high counter and walls paneled in something mustardcolored that bore no biological link to trees a knobless door was cut into the rear paneling a single maxfield parrish print purple mountains majesty hung to the left of the doorway behind the counter a roundfaced man in his late thirties sat on an old oak swivel chair and ate a big wet sandwich wrapped in wax paper a coffeemaker and a computer sat to his left cabbage and slabs of meat and something red protruded from the sandwich the mans shortsleeved white shirt was clean but his chin was moist and as the door closed behind us he swiped at himself with a paper napkin and aimed cautious gray eyes at us then he grinned detective sturgis he hauled a thick body out of the chair and a pink forearm shot across the counter an anchor tattoo blued the smooth flesh his brown hair was cropped to the skull and his face was a potpie that had been nibbled at the edges georgie said milo hows everything people are very bad so everythings very good said georgie he glanced at me he doesnt look like a business opportunity for me no business today said milo this is dr delaware he consults for the department doctor george nemerov a doctor for the cops said georgie pumping my hand what do you specialize in sexually transmitted diseases or insanity good guess georgie hes a shrink nemerov chuckled people are nuts so everythings good for you doctor if you knew more about this business youd try to lock me up too heavy eyelids compressed and the gray eyes narrowed but the rest of the soft doughy face remained placid so whats up detective milo this and that georgie eating your spinach hate that stuff said nemerov patting his anchor tattoo to me when i was a kid i was a big cartoon fan popeye the sailor one night when i was a high school punk me and some friends were over at the pike in long beach and i got this shit put on me my mother almost skinned me alive how is your mom said milo good as can be expected said nemerov next month shes seventythree give her my best will do milo she always liked you so why you here nemerovs smile was angelic ive been looking into some old files and your dads case came up oh yeah said nemerov came up how willie burnss name surfaced with regard to another that so nemerov shifted his weight his smile had died well that wouldnt surprise me the guy was lowlife scum you telling me hes been spotted around no said milo the other case is also old and cold actually went down before your dad and this never came to light when you guys were looking for that murderous fuck no georgie burns isnt officially a suspect on the other one his name just came up thats all i see georgie repeated actually i dont he rolled a wrist and muscles bulged in his forearm what things are so relaxed around the corner that theyve got you chasing ghosts sorry to bring up old crap georgie whatever milo we all got our jobs back then i was a kid firstyear college cal state northridge i was going to become a lawyer instead i got this pudgy hands spread milo said i just wanted to verify that you guys never caught any wind of burns nemerovs eyes were ashcolored slits you dont think id tell you if we did im sure you would but we go by the law milo making our living depends on it i know you do georgie sorry georgie picked up his sandwich so who else did burns off milo shook his head too early to let that out when you guys were looking for him did you uncover any known associates nah said nemerov guy was a fucking loner a dopehead and a bum and a scumbag today those legal aid assholes would call him a poor poor pitiful homeless citizen and try to get you and me to pay his rent his mouth twisted a bum my dad always treated him with respect and thats how the fuck repaid him it stinks said milo it stinks bad even after all this time your dad was a good guy georgie nemerovs gray slits aimed at me my dad could read people like a book doctor better than a shrink i nodded thinking boris nemerov had misread willie burns in the worst possible way georgie rested one beefy arm on the countertop and favored me with a warm gust of garlic and brine and mustard he could read em my dad could but he was too damn good too damn soft my mom tortured herself for not stopping him from going to meet the fuck that night i told her she couldnta done nothing dad got an idea in his head you couldnt stop him thats what kept him alive with the communists heart of gold head like a rock burns the fuck was a loser and a liar but hed always made his court dates before so why wouldnt my dad see the best in him absolutely said milo ah said nemerov the door in the rear panel pushed open and seven hundred pounds of humanity emerged and filled the office two men each close to sixsix wearing black turtlenecks black cargo pants black revolvers in black nylon holsters the larger one a fine distinction was samoan with long hair tied up in a sumo knot and a wispy mustachegoatee combo his companion wore a red crew cut and had a finefeatured babysmooth face georgie nemerov said hey both monsters studied us hey said sumo red grunted boys this is detective milo sturgis an old friend from around the corner he investigated the scumfuck who murdered my dad and this is a shrink the department uses because we all know cops are crazy right slow nods from the behemoths georgie said these are two of my prime finders milo this heres stevie but we call him yokuzuna cause he used to wrestle in japan and the little guys red yaakov from the holy land so whats new boys we got something for you said stevie out back in the van the stevie the samoan smiled the and guess what a bonus were leaving the s crib idiots right there in bed like he doesnt believe anyones gonna come looking for him and in two secs weve got him braceleted are taking him out to the car and a window shade in the nextdoor house moves and some other guys staring out at us and yaakov says waitaminute aint that the we been looking for since the democratic convention yaakov said det stoopid guy garcia broke dose windows and reeped off all dot stereo raul garcia said georgie he broke into a grin no kidding yeah him said stevie so we go in and get him too both of them are out there in back squirming in the van turns out they played craps together neighborly spirit and all that they actually asked us to loosen the bracelets so they could play in the van georgie highfived both giants two for one beautiful okay let me process the papers then you can take both geniuses over to the jail im proud of you boys come back at five and pick up your checks stevie and yaakov saluted and left the way theyd come in thank god said georgie that criminals are retarded he returned to his chair and picked up his sandwich milo said thanks for your time the sandwich arced toward nemerovs mouth then paused inches from its destination you actually going to be looking for burns again should i said milo i figure if he was findable you guys woulda brought him in a long time ago you got that said georgie knots formed along milos jawline as he sauntered closer to the counter you think hes dead georgie nemerovs eyes shifted to the left that would be nice but why would i think that because you never found him could be milo cause were good at what we do maybe when it first happened we werent like i said i was a college kid what did i know and mom was all torn up you remember how the insurance companies were jerking us around one day were doing the funeral the next day were fighting to stay out of bankruptcy so maybe burns didnt get looked for like he should but later i sent guys out for him weve still got him on our list look ill show you he got up pushed the paneled door hard was gone for a few moments came back with a piece of paper that he dropped on the counter wilbert lorenzo burnss wanted sheet mug shot in full face and profile the usual necklace of numbers mediumdark face wellformed features that were soft and boyish what would have been a pleasant face but for the hype eyes burnss long hair protruded in wooly tufts as if it had been yanked his statistics put him at sixtwo onesixty with knifescars on both forearms and the back of the neck no tattoos wanted for pcs possession with intent to sell escape after remand or arrest homicide i think of him from time to time said georgie between bites of wet sandwich probably he is dead he was a hype whats those fuckheads life expectancies anyway but you learn different call me chapter as we left the bail bond office a meter readers gocart pulled up behind the seville milo said lets get going and we ran for the car the reader got out with his little computerized instrument of evil but i peeled away before he could punch buttons close call said milo thought you had clout i said clouts an ephemeral thing i turned the corner headed back to the station he said so what do you think about what georgies demeanor i dont know georgie even so he seemed to get edgy when you brought up burns he did at that normally hes eventempered you never hear him swear this time he was tossing out the fword maybe recalling his fathers murder got him worked up maybe youre wondering if he did take care of burns but youre unlikely to ever know thought you were supposed to make people feel better purification through insight i said pulling up near the westside staff parking lot and letting the seville idle milo remained in place long legs drawn up high hands flat on the seat screw schwinn he finally said that would be easy i said if it was really about schwinn he glared at me more purification what are friends for a few minutes later why the murder book if he really wanted to help all he had to do was call and give me the facts maybe theres more to the book than just janies photo such as i dont know but its worth a second look he didnt answer made no effort to leave the car so i said so i was thinking of a visit to achievement house maybe pick up on the latest trends in special education youre still on it i dont know what i am i took pico east to motor sped past rancho park and into cheviot hills in the daylight achievement house didnt look any more impressive the light stucco id seen last night was baby blue a few more cars occupied the lot and a dozen or so adolescents hung in loose groups when we pulled up to the curb they paid scant notice the kids were a varied bunch ranging from blacklipped goths to preppy chirpers who couldve been extras on the ozzie and harriet set milo rang the bell on the gate and we were buzzed in without inquiry another buzz got us through the door the lobby smelled of room freshener and corn chips a reception desk to the right and an office door marked administration were separated by a hallway that emptied to a softly lit waiting room where no one waited cream walls hung with chromeframed floral prints plumcolored carpeting neatly arranged magazines on teak tables offwhite overstuffed chairs glass panes in the rear double doors provided a view of more corridor and bursts of gawky adolescent movement the receptionist was a young indian woman in a peach sari surprised but untroubled by milos badge and this is about she said pleasantly an inquiry said milo with downright good cheer during the ride hed been tense and silent but all that was gone now hed combed his hair tightened his tie was coming across like a man with something to look forward to an inquiry she said a look at some student records maam ill get you ms baldassar shes our director she left returned said this way and showed us to the door across the hall we entered a front office and a secretary ushered us through a door to a tidy space where an ash blond woman in her forties sat behind a desk and stubbed out a cigarette milo offered the badge and the blonde said marlene baldassar thin tan and intensely freckled she had hollow cheeks golden brown eyes and a knifepoint chin her navy blue aline dress was piped with white and bagged on her bony frame the ash hair was bluntcut to midneck bangs feathered to fringe she wore a gold wedding band and an oversize black plastic divers watch tortoiseframed glasses hung on a chain the big glass ashtray on her desk was halffilled with lipsticktipped butts the rim read mirage hotel las vegas the rest of the desk was taken up with books papers framed photos and a shiny silver harmonica she saw me looking at the instrument picked it up with two fingers tooted twice put it down smiling tension reliever im trying to quit smoking and obviously not doing very well old habits i said very old and yes i have tried the patch all of them my dnas probably saturated with nicotine she ran a finger along the edge of the harmonica so whats this shoba tells me about a police inquiry has one of our alumni gotten into trouble you dont seem surprised by that possibility said milo ive worked with kids for going on twenty years very little surprises me twenty years here maam three here seventeen with the county juvenile hall community mental health centers gangviolence prevention programs welcome change i said for the most part she said but county work could even be fun lots of futility but when you do come across a gem in the trash pile its exciting working heres extremely predictable by and large the kids are a decent bunch spoiled but decent we specialize in serious learning disabilities chronic school failure severe dyslexia kids who just cant get it together educationally our goals specific try to get them to a point so that when they get hold of their trust funds they can read the small print so if your inquiry is about one of my current charges id be surprised we steer away from highrisk antisocials too much maintenance milo said are the kids confined twentyfour hours a day heavens no she said this isnt prison they go home on weekends earn passes so what do you need to know and about whom actually said milo this is more of a historical venture someone who was here twenty years ago marlene baldassar sat back fooled with her eyeglasses sorry im not free to talk about alumni an emergent situation with a current student would be something else someone in the here and now posing a danger to themselves andor others the law would require me to work with you on that schools have no confidentiality maam but psychotherapists do detective and many of our files contain psychotherapeutic records id love to help but what about personnel records said milo were also looking into someone who worked here thered be no protection of any sort there baldassar fiddled with her glasses i suppose thats true but twenty years ago im not sure we even have records going back that far one way to find out maam whats this persons name wilbert lorenzo burns no recognition on the freckled face baldassar got on the phone asked a few questions said wait right here and returned a few moments later with a scrap of pink paper burns wilburt l she said handing it to milo this is all weve got mr burnss notice of termination he lasted three weeks august third through the twentyfourth was terminated for absenteeism see for yourself milo read the scrap and handed it back what did mr burns do theres a fugitive warrant out on him mostly he was a narcotics violator kind of alarming that when he worked here he was on probation for a drug conviction about to face trial for selling heroin baldassar frowned wonderful well that wouldnt happen today you vet your employees carefully a pusher wouldnt get by me guess the former director wasnt that picky said milo do you know him michael larner the only one i know is my immediate predecessor dr evelyn luria lovely woman she retired and moved to italy shes at least eighty i was told that she was brought in to beef up clinical services i was brought in to organize things she poked the harmonica youre not implying this burns was dealing to the kids here do the kids here have drug problems detective please said baldassar theyre teenagers with poor selfesteem and plenty of disposable income you dont need a phd to figure it out but believe me i dont allow any species of felon to pass through our gates as far as what happened twenty years ago she picked up the harmonica put it down if thats all actually said milo the investigations not just about willie burns its about a student burns was friendly with a girl named caroline cossack baldassar stared then she snorted i suppose it was laughter but she looked anything but happy she said lets go outside i want to smoke but i dont want to poison anyone else she took us through the glasspaned double doors past ten rooms some of which had been left open we walked by carelessly made beds piles of stuffed animals movie and rock star posters boom boxes guitars books stacked in little wooden desks a few teens were stretched across beds listening to music through earphones one boy did pushups a girl read a magazine brow knitted lips moving laboriously we followed marlene baldassar under a rear staircase where she pushed a door marked exit and let us pass through to an alley behind the building two dumpsters were pushed against a cinderblock wall nearby stood a chesty girl with her elbows to the block hips thrust at a tall buzzcut boy wearing low pants that puddled around his unlaced sneakers he looked like a scarecrow about to come apart moved in for a kiss but stopped as the girl said something turned and frowned baldassar said hi guys expressionless the couple ambled off and disappeared around a corner somethingus interruptus said baldassar i almost feel guilty power lines were strung ten feet above the wall and i could hear them buzzing a pigeon soared overhead baldassar lit up dragged hungrily smoked down a half inch of her cigarette is there any chance we can talk confidentially she said id like to promise you that said milo but if youve got knowledge of a crime no its nothing like that and i never met the cossack girl though i do know that she was once a resident but in terms of her family lets just say theyre not very popular around here whys that maam baldassar smoked and shook her head i suppose if you dug around enough youd find out anyway where should i be digging what i should do your job for you ill take anything i can get maam said milo she smiled county records ill tell you what i know but i cant have any of it traced back to me okay okay im trusting you detective thank you maam and no more maams please she said im starting to feel like im in some old dragnet script fair enough ms baldassar cut him off with a wave of her cigarette to make a long story exquisitely short several years ago seventeen or eighteen years ago achievement house ran into some severe financial problems due to bad investments the board was comprised of stuffy old farts who were conservative with their personal fortunes but turned out to be a good deal more adventurous with achievement houses endowment remember all that junkbond foolishness the board hired a money manager who traded achievement houses blue chips for a whole slew of what ended up as worthless paper at the time the interest rates were enticing and the income allowed the school to run at such a high paper profit that the board was starting to think achievement house would pay for itself then everything crashed and to make matters worse the manager had taken out a second mortgage and bought additional bonds on margin when everything hit the fan achievement house was way in the hole and facing foreclosure on the property the rich old farts wouldve let that happen the rich old farts served on the board in order to feel noble and to get their names in the social pages during gala season to make matters worse thered been a bit of unpleasantness with the director your mr larner i know all this from evelyn luria she briefed me before she left for europe but wouldnt give me details but she did hint that it had been something of a sexual nature something that mightve gotten the board members the worst type of publicity so the school was in danger of closing down and the board wouldnt go to bat god i hope this doesnt blow up after all those years i was looking at this job as a way to relax nothing will get traced to you ms baldassar now tell me why the cossacks arent popular because they came to the rescue white knights and then turned into something quite different carolines father carolines father and brothers the three of them had some kind of real estate business and they stepped in and renegotiated with the bank and got a better rate for the mortgage then had achievement houses deed signed over to them for a while they made payments no questions asked then a couple of years later they announced they were evicting the school because the land was too valuable for a nonprofit theyd been buying up lots had plans to develop the entire block she dropped her cigarette ground it out with the toe of her pump achievement house is still here said milo what happened threats accusations lawyers the board and the cossacks finally reached an agreement but it meant dipping into some deep pockets in order to pay the cossacks off from what i was told the outrage was compounded by the fact that caroline cossacks stay here had been a favor to the family she didnt qualify why not she was a psychiatric case severe behavior problems not learning disabilities custodial care i said yes the rules were bent for her then for her family to do that milo said do you have any records on caroline baldassar hesitated let me check wait out here please she reentered the building i said i wonder if michael larner had something to do with the cossacks trying to evict the school after the board fired him he wouldnt have been fond of the institution milo kicked one of the dumpsters another pigeon flew overhead then three more airborne rats he muttered barely audible but the vibrations must have reached the birds and they scattered marlene baldassar returned another cigarette in one hand a pink index card in another no chart all i found was this listing the dates of her stay milo took the card admitted august discharged december but it doesnt say where she went no it doesnt said baldassar you dont hold on to old charts we do it should be here she studied milos face youre not shocked like you im pretty much beyond being shockable ms baldassar and im going to ask you to return the favor keep this visit confidential for everyones sake no problem with that said baldassar she took a deep drag blew a smoke ring here i thought it was going to be a lazy day and it turned out to be heavyduty déjà vu gentlemen you brought back memories of my days with the county how so i said problems that cant be solved with phonics and a credit card chapter interesting time line i said as we headed for the car under the nowwatchful eyes of the kids in the parking lot janie ingalls is murdered in early june two months later caroline gets checked into achievement house and willie shows up and works there for three weeks willies fired then hes busted for dope gets boris nemerov to bail him out when was nemerov ambushed december said milo the day after caroline leaves achievement house voluntarily or otherwise maybe willie took his girlfriend out then took care of her or cossack family money found both of them a nice safe place to hide out and one more thing georgie couldve gotten nervous when you brought up burns not because his men finished off his dads killer but because they didnt were paid off not to he accepted money to let his dads murderer off the hook uhuh not georgie he and his mother were in severe financial straits maybe it took more than twentyhour days and clever negotiating to keep the business going no i cant see it he said georgies always been a straightahead guy youd know yeah im a font of knowledge cmon lets go over to my place have another look at that damn book rick and milo lived in a small wellkept bungalow in west hollywood on a quiet elmdarkened street further shadowed by design centers alarming blue bulk ricks white porsche was gone and the blinds were drawn a few years ago la suffered through a drought and rick had the lawn dug up and replaced with pea gravel and grayleafed desert plants this year la had plenty of water but the xeriscape remained in place bursts of tiny yellow blossoms punctuating the pallid vegetation i said the cactus are thriving milo said great especially when i come home in the dark and snag my pants nothing like seeing the bright side thats my core philosophy he said the glass is either halfempty or broken he unlocked the front door disarmed the alarm picked up the mail that had fallen through the slot and tossed it on a table without breaking stride the kitchen often lures him in his own digs too but this time he walked through it into the service porch nook that serves as his office a cramped dim space sandwiched between the washerdryer and the freezer and smelling of detergent hed set it up with a hideous metal desk painted schoolbus yellow a folding chair and a painted wooden sharkface lamp from bali the blue book sat in an oversize ziploc bag on the top shelf of a miniature bookcase bolted above the desk he gloved up unbagged the book flipped to janie ingallss photo and studied the death shot any sudden insights lets see what follows only three more pages after janie a trio of crimescene photos all of the victims young men one black youth two hispanics each sprawled on bloodsplotched pavement white lights on the corpses and dark periphery said nighttime death a shiny revolver lay near the right hand of the final victim the first photo was labeled gang driveby brooks st venice one dead two wounded next gang driveby commonwealth and fifth rampart finally gang driveby central ave three of a kind i said thats kind of interesting why until now there was variety milo said gang stuff business as usual maybe schwinn ran out of interesting pictures if these took place after janie when he was already out of the department he coulda had trouble getting hold of crimescene shots god only knows how he managed to get these he closed the book you see any way drivebys could be connected to janie i sure dont mind if i take another look take as many looks as you want he produced another pair of gloves from a desk drawer and i slipped them on as i turned to the first photo he stepped around the washerdryer and into the kitchen i heard the fridge door creak open want something to drink no thanks heavy footsteps a cabinet opened glass touched tile im gonna go check the mail i took my time with the crimescene shots thinking about schwinn addicted to speed and divesting himself of worldly goods even as he held on to his purloined photos moving on to a life of serenity but assembling this leatherbound monstrosity in secrecy as i turned pages nowfamiliar pages and images began to blur i tore myself away from speculation and tried to focus on each brutal death the first goround i came up with nothing but on the second circuit something made me pause the two photos that preceded janies death shot the second page back was a fullcolor mediumrange shot of a thin rangy black man whose skin had begun to fade to postmortem gray his long body lay on brown dirt and one arm curled toward his face protectively gaping mouth halfopen lifeless eyes splayed limbs no blood no visible wounds drug od possible hotshot the next page faced janies id avoided it because it was one of the most repellent images in the book the camera had focused on a heap of mangled flesh beyond recognition as human hairless legs and a battered concave pelvic section suggested a woman the caption precluded the need for deduction female mental case fell or thrown in front of double tractor trailer i flipped back to the skinny black man returned to the beginning of the murder book and doublechecked then i went to get milo he was in the living room studying his gas bill a shot glass of something amber in his paw finished i said come look at this he tossed back the rest of his drink held on to the glass and followed me i showed him the pictures preceding janie he said whats your point two points i said first of all content right before janie are a black drugusing male and a white woman with mental problems sound familiar second context these two deviate stylistically from every other photo in the book fortyone photos including janies list the location and the police division where the murder took place these are the only two that dont if schwinn lifted the photos from police files he had access to the data yet he left the locales out are you willing to consider a bit of psychological interpretation schwinn being symbolic he said these two represent willie burns and caroline cossack theyre missing information because they represent the missing willie burns and the missing caroline cossack schwinn designated no locations because burnss and cossacks whereabouts remain unknown then he followed up with janies picture and wrote ns for no solve right after janie he placed three drivebys grouped together i dont think thats a coincidence either he knew how youd see them business as usual just like you said hes outlining a process here a missing black man and mentally ill white woman are connected to janie whose murder is never solved on the contrary shes abandoned and then its business as usual hes describing the coverup he pulled at his lower lip games pretty subtle you said schwinn was a devious sort i said suspicious verging on paranoid lapd dumped him but he continued to think like a rogue cop played games to the end in order to cover his rear he decided to communicate with you but set it up so that only you would get it that way if the book went astray or was ever traced back to him he could disclaim ownership he took pains to make sure it wasnt traced to him no fingerprints only you were likely to recall his photography hobby and make the connection he might have planned to send you the book himself but changed his mind and chose someone else as a gobetween as another layer of security he studied the dead black man paged to the truckcrash nightmare then janie repeated the process willie and carolines surrogates too weird i pointed to the black mans corpse how old does he look to you he squinted at the ashen face forties if willie burns were alive today hed be fortythree that means schwinn saw the dead man as a surrogate for willie in the here and now both the pictures are faded probably decades old but schwinn oriented them toward the present meaning he finished the book fairly recently wanted to focus you on the present he rolled the empty shot glass between his palms bastard was a good detective if the department got rid of him because someone was worried about what he knew about janie that means they didnt worry about me you were a rookie i was the dumb shit they figured would just follow orders and guess what he laughed its likely when schwinn learned hed been forced out and you hadnt it confirmed his suspicions of you maybe he figured youd played a role in his dismissal thats why he didnt tell you what hed learned about janie for years and then he changed his mind he came to admire you told marge mr serenity he said so he enlists his girlfriend or some old cop washout to serve as gobetween whyd whoever it was wait until seven months after schwinn died i had no answer for that milo tried to pace but the confined quarters of the laundry area made it a twostep exercise he said then the guy falls off a horse a horse so gentle marge felt comfortable with schwinn riding up into the hills alone but akhbar got spooked anyway marge said by something maybe it was someone he stared past me reentered the kitchen washed out the shot glass returned and glared at the book nothing says schwinns death wasnt an accident nothing at all he pressed his hands flat against the wall as if straining to push it down bastards he said who everyone we sat down in his living room each of us thinking in silence neither of us coming up with anything if he felt as weary as i did he needed a break the phone rang he snatched up the receiver this is him what who yes one week yeah i did thats right whats that yeah i just told you that anything else okay then hey listen why dont you give me your name and number and ill the other party cut him off he held the phone at arms length began gnawing his upper lip who was that i said some guy claiming to be from department personnel downtown wanting to verify that i was indeed taking vacation time and how long did i plan to be away i told him id filled out the forms claiming to be from personnel ive never known the department to make calls like that and he hung up when i asked his name also he didnt sound like a department clerk how so he sounded like he gave a damn chapter he slipped the murder book back into the plastic bag and said this goes in the safe didnt know you had a safe i said for all my cartier and tiffany wait here he disappeared and i stood there humbled once more by the truism id learned a thousand patients ago everyone has secrets at the core were alone that made me think of robin where was she what was she doing with whom milo returned minus his necktie hungry not really good lets eat he locked up and we got back in the car i said that call from personnel maybe procedures have tightened up with john broussard in charge isnt troop discipline his pet issue yeah how about hot dog heaven i drove to san vicente just north of beverly and parked at the curb hot dog heaven was built around a giant hot dog yet another testament to las literal thinking the fastfood joint became a landmark when the pony ride that had occupied the corner of la cienega and beverly for decades was replaced by the neonandconcrete assault known as the beverly center too bad philip k dick had committed suicide a few years later and hed have seen blade runner spring to life or maybe hed known what was coming back during ponyride days the dirt track had been a favorite weekend visitation hangout for divorced dads and their kids hot dog heaven had thrived peddling nitrites to lonely men who smoked and hung around the lowslung corral watching their progeny go round and round where did displaced dads go now not the mall the last thing kids at the mall wanted was proximity to their parents milo ordered two jumbo chili cheese dogs with extra onions and i got a knockwurst we filled out the bill with two large cokes and sat down to eat as traffic roared by it was late for lunch and early for dinner and only two other tables were occupied an old woman reading the paper and a tall longhaired youth in hospital blues probably a cedarssinai intern milo wolfed the first chili dog without the aid of respiration after tweezing every scrap of cheese from the wax paper with his fingers he gulped coke and got to work on the second he finished that one too sprang up and bought a third my wurst tasted fine but it was all i could do to feign hunger he was counting his change when a bronze jeep cherokee parked in front of my seville and a man got out and walked past me toward the counter black suit pearl shirt sootcolored tie smiling thats what made me notice him a big wide toothy grin as if hed just received terrific news i watched him stride quickly to the counter and come to a stop just behind milo where he waited bouncing on his heels his black suede loafers were lifted by twoinch heels without them he was an easy six feet he stood close to milo kept bouncing milo didnt seem to notice something made me put down the wurst and keep my eyes on both of them smiley was thirty or so with dark hair gelled and combed back curling over his collar bigjawed face prominent nose golden tan the suit was well cut italian or pretending to be and it looked brandnew as did the suede shoes the gray shirt was satinfinish silk the tie a bulky knit dressed for an audition as a game show host he edged even closer to milo said something milo turned and answered smiley nodded milo picked up his food and returned to the table friendly sort i said who the guy behind you hes been smiling since he left that jeep so so whats to smile about milo allowed his own mouth to curl upward but he let his eyes drift back to the counter where the smiling man was now conversing with the counter girl anything other than that bother you about him he was standing close enough to you to smell your cologne if i wore any he said but he continued to watch the goingson at the counter finally sat back and sank his teeth into the third chili dog nothing like health food he regarded my halffinished wurst whats with the anorexia just out of curiosity what did he say to you up there oh boy he shook his head he wanted to know what was good okay i told him i liked anything with chili heavyduty intrigue i smiled or flirting me him oh sure strangers always come up and hit on me the old fatal charm and all that but he hazarded another glance at the counter where smiley was still gabbing with the girl as he paid for his dog plain no chili he sat down at the table closest to ours unfolded a napkin over his lap flipped his hair beamed at milo said chickened out on the chili your loss smiley laughed tugged at his lapel took a bite a dainty little bite that didnt alter the shape of the hot dog i mumbled fatal charm milo said enough and wiped his face smiley continued to nibble without making much progress dabbed his chin showed off his dental work made several attempts at catching milos eye milo moved his bulk around stared at the ground smiley said these really are a mouthful i fought back laughter milo nudged my arm lets go we stood smiley said have a nice day he got to his feet as we reached the car and jogged toward us sandwich in one hand the other waving what the hell said milo and his hand sidled under his coat smiley reached into his own jacket and all at once milo had interposed himself between the stranger and me a flesh barrier immense tension seemed to enlarge him then he relaxed smiley was still waving but the something in his hand was small and white a business card sorry for being so forward but i heres my number call me if youd like why would i do that said milo smileys lips drew back and his grin morphed into something hungry and unsettling because you never know he dangled the card milo stood there smiley said oh well and placed the card on the hood of the seville his new face was serious vulpine purposeful he trotted away from us tossed the uneaten hot dog in the trash got into the jeep and sped away as milo hustled to copy down his license plate he picked the card off the hood read it and handed it to me offwhite vellum with a faintly greasy feel engraved letters paris m bartlett health facilitator below that a cell phone number because you never know said milo health facilitator do i look sick other than stains on your shirt you look perfectly puttogether health facilitator he repeated sounds like something from the aids industry he pulled out his cell phone and jabbed in paris bartletts number frowned again no longer in service what the hell time to dmv the plates i said dmving is illegal when im on vacation using departmental resources for personal reasons big nono john g would disapprove mightily mightily he made the call to state motor vehicles recited the plate waited a while wrote something down the plates belong to a twoyearold jeep so thats kosher registered to the playa del sol corporation the address is right here in west hollywood i recognize it parking lot of the healthy foods market on santa monica theres a postoffice box outlet there i know because i used to rent there myself when long time ago a safe a pob all the new things i was learning about my friend dead number shadow address i said playa del sol could be nothing more than a cardboard box in someones apartment but it does have the ring of a real estate outfit as in the cossacks he studied the card that and the call about my vacation time right after we talk to marlene baldassar maybe she cant be trusted or maybe he hadnt covered his trail i said it could be just a pickup attempt but i knew that was wrong paris bartlett had bounded out of his car with clear intention he slipped the card in his pocket alex i grew up in a big family never got much attention never developed a taste for it i need some alone time i drove him back to his place and he hurtled out of the seville mumbled something that mightve been thanks slammed the door and loped toward his front door i made it to my own front door thirtyfive minutes later told myself id be able to walk right past the phone but the red blinking on the answering machine snagged me and i stabbed the message button robins voice looks like i missed you again alex theres another change in schedule were adding an extra day in vancouver maybe the same in denver its crazy around here ill be in and out twosecond delay then several decibels lower i love you obligatory addon unlike pierce schwinn i didnt need drugs to prime the paranoia pump i phoned the four seasons seattle again and asked for ms castagnas room this time if they gave me voice mail id leave a message but a man answered young one of those laughing voices familiar sheridan he of the ponytail the cheerful outlook and the milkbone for spike robin oh hi yeah sure seconds later this is robin and this is alex oh hi finally finally finally we connect is everything okay everythings peachy i said am i interrupting something what oh sheridan no we were just finishing up a meeting a bunch of us busy busy ive got time now so how are you busy yourself this was too much like small talk and it depressed me muddling along hows spike thriving theres a bunch of other dogs along for the ride so theres a nice kennel space spikes getting pretty sociable theres an eightypound shepherd bitch who seems to have caught his fancy does the kennel space include a ladder for him to reach her she laughed but sounded tired so i said so are you getting in any social time im working alex were putting in twelve thirteenhour days sounds tough i miss you miss you too we both knew this would be difficult then we were both right honey hold on alex someone just stuck their head in her voice got muffled and distant hand over the phone ill see what i can do give me a little time on it okay whens soundcheck that soon okay sure back to me as you can see i havent had much solitude ive had plenty im jealous are you yes she said we both like our solitude right you can have yours back anytime i cant exactly walk out on everyone no i said as richard nixon said that would be wrong i mean i if there was some easy if that would really make you happy id do it it would ruin your reputation it sure wouldnt help it youre committed i said dont worry about it why the hell is sheridan so happy alex when i do get a minute to breathe i think of you wonder if i did the right thing then i plan all the things im going to tell you but then when we finally talk it doesnt seem to go the way id planned absence makes the heart cranky not my heart guess its me then i said guess i dont do well with separation never got used to it used to it she said your parents my parents were the last thing id thought of now bad old memories ignited the wasting away of the two people whod brought me into this world bedside vigils a pair of funerals in as many years alex no i said i was just talking generally you sound upset she said i didnt mean to you didnt do anything what did you mean by that never getting used to separation random blather i said are you saying that even when we were together you felt abandoned that i neglected you because i no i said youve always been there for me except for the other time you left except for finding another man and it really was blather rob put it down to missing you alex if this is really bad for you ill come home no i said im a big boy it wouldnt be good for you for either of us and ive got things on my plate little odd jobs the kind you hate thats true she said but just say the word the word is i love you thats three words picky picky she laughed finally i uttered a few pleasantries and she did the same when we hung up she sounded okay and i figured i faked it pretty well milo claimed to want alone time but i figured hed be nosing around on the fringes of the lapd bureaucracy if the call from personnel andor the encounter with the toothy paris bartlett did have something to do with his raking up the ingalls case that meant he we had been tagged were being watched marlene baldassar as the source didnt sit right with me and i thought about the trail we mightve left my solo activities had consisted of the call to larry daschoff dinner with allison gwynn computer work at the research library none of that was likely to attract attention together milo and i had interviewed marge schwinn and baldassar and georgie nemerov i supposed either woman couldve reported the conversation but neither had been hostile and i couldnt see why theyd have bothered nemerov on the other hand had grown antsy when talking about his fathers murder and willie burnss skip nemerovs bail bond business gave him close ties to the department if john g broussard had been part of a fix the department would care a third possibility was milos solo work on janie ingalls had attracted attention as far as i knew that had been limited to phone work and unearthing old files but hed worked at the west la station sneaked around parker center thinking hed been discreet but he couldve invited scrutiny from clerks other cops anyone in a position to witness him nosing john g broussard had sent a clear directive to tighten up discipline among the rank and file the new chief had also waged war on the blue code of silence talk about irony maybe cops informing on cops was the new lapd zeitgeist the more i thought about that the more it made sense milo was a pro but hed taken too much for granted procedurally hed been outed that made me think about his continuing vulnerability twenty years in the department with one of the highest solve rates in homicide but that wasnt enough would never be enough for two decades hed functioned as a gay man in a paramilitary organization that would never be free of gutlevel bias and still hadnt acknowledged the existence of homosexual cops i knew everyone knew that scores of gay officers patrolled the streets but not a single one had gone public neither had milo in a strict sense but after those first brutal years of selftorment he had stopped hiding department statisticians were happy to file his solves in the assets column but the brass continued to retard his progress and made periodic attempts to get rid of him milo had collected secrets of his own along the way finally managed to leverage his way to relative job security and seniority hed turned down the offer to take the lieutenants exam twice because he knew the departments real intention was to shunt him to some desk job where they could pretend he didnt exist while boring him to the point of voluntary retirement instead hed stayed on the detective track had taken it as far as it would go to detectiveiii maybe pierce schwinn had followed all that come to respect milo for holding his own offered milo a perverse gift normally nothing heated milos blood like a good cold case but this was a rethaw from his own past and perhaps hed gotten careless and turned himself into prey i thought of how paris bartlett had targeted milo ignored me meaning i had room to move the timing was perfect the logic exquisite what were friends for chapter alone at his crappy little pisscolored desk the washer churning the clothes hed just loaded for background noise milo felt better free of alex he felt better because alexs mind could be a scary thing cerebral flypaper stuff flew in but never left his friend was capable of sitting quietly for long stretches when youd think he was listening actively listening the way theyd taught him in shrink school then hed let loose a burst of associations and hypotheses and apparently unrelated trivialities that turned out too often to be righton houses of cards that more often than not withstood the wind milo on the receiving end of the nonstop volleys felt like a wobbly sparring partner not that alex pushed he just kept supposing suggesting another shrink tactic try ignoring any of it milo had never met anyone smarter or more decent than alex but hanging with the guy could be draining how many nights sleep had he lost because one of his friends suggestions had hooked a barb in his brain but for all his bloodhound instincts alex was a civilian and out of his element and hed failed to mature in one regard had never developed a proper sense of threat in the beginning milo had attributed it to the carelessness of an overenthusiastic amateur it hadnt taken long to learn the truth alex got off on danger robin understood that and it scared her over the years shed confided her fears to milo more nuance than complaint and when the three of them were together and alex and milo lapsed into the wrong type of conversation and her face changed milo caught it quickly and changed the subject strangely enough alex for all his perceptiveness sometimes missed it alex had to realize how robin felt yet he made no effort to change and robin put up with it love is blind and deaf and dumb maybe shed simply made a commitment and was smart enough to know it was damn near impossible to change anyone but now shed gone on that tour and taken the dog for some reason that felt wrong the damn pooch alex was claiming to be okay but that first day milod dropped in hed looked really bad and even now he was different distracted something was off or maybe not hed poked a bit at alexs resistance playing shrink to the shrink and why the hell shouldnt he how could you have a real friendship when the therapy went only one way but no luck alex talked the talk openness communication blah blah blah but in his own articulate empathetic eversodisgustingly civilized way the guy was painintheass deadend immovable now that he thought about it had alex ever been deterred milo couldnt remember a single instance alex did exactly what alex wanted to do and robin milod offered his smoothest reassurances and he supposed hed done a decent job of keeping alex out of harms way but there were limits everyone stood alone he got up poured himself a vodka and pinkgrapefruit juice rationalizing that the vitamin c counteracted the oxidation but wondering how closely his liver resembled that medical journal photo rick had shown him last month erosion of hepatic tissue and replacement with fatty globules due to advanced cirrhosis rick never pushed either but milo knew he wasnt happy with the fresh bottle of stoli in the freezer switch channels back to alex other peoples problems were so much more engaging he walked half a mile to a budget rentacar on la cienega and got himself a fresh blue taurus driving east on santa monica he crossed into beverly hills then west hollywood not much traffic past doheny drive but at the west hollywood border the boulevard had been narrowed to one lane in either direction and the few cars in sight were crawling west hollywood the city that never stopped decorating had been digging up the streets for years plunging businesses into bankruptcy and accomplishing little milo could see other than a yawning stretch of dirt piles and ditches last year the ribbon had been cut on a spanking new west hollywood fire station one of those architectural fancies peaks and troughs and gimcracks and weirdshaped windows cute except the doors had proved too narrow for the fire engines to squeeze through and the poles didnt allow the firefighters to slide down this year west hollywood had embarked on a sistercity deal with havana milo doubted fidel would approve of boystown nightlife among the few businesses the roadwork couldnt kill were the allnight markets and the gay bars a guy had to eat and a guy had to party milo and rick stayed in most nights how long had it been since hed cruised and now here he was he found himself smiling but it felt like someone elses mirth because what the hell was there to be happy about pierce schwinn andor a confederate had manipulated him into warming up ingalls hed accomplished nothing but had managed to screw up royally attracting attention playa del sol that toothy putz paris bartlett first thing he did after ditching alex was to check city records for a business registration on playa nothing then he ran bartlett through every database he could think of like that could be a real name taking a giant risk because what hed told alex had been true as a civilian he was forbidden to use departmental resources he was treading felonious water hed put up a firewall by using the id numbers of other cops for the requests half a dozen ids of cops he didnt care for jumping around different divisions his version of identity theft hed been collecting data for years stashing loose bits of paper in his home safe because you never knew when your back was gonna be against the wall but if someone tried hard enough the calls could be traced back to him clever boy but the search had been futile no such person as paris bartlett which he supposed hed known right away apart from the moniker having a phony ring bartlett all hair and teeth and eagerness had had that actor thing going on in la that didnt necessarily mean a sag card and a portfolio full of headshots lapd liked guys who were good at pretending too channeled them into undercover work nowadays that meant mostly narcotics occasionally vice when the word came down to run yet another week or two of hooker rousts for public relations years ago undercover had meant another vice game a regularly scheduled weekend production friday and saturday night operations put together with military lust staking out targets and delineating the enemy and moving in for the attack bust the queers not naked aggression the way it had been back before christopher street when gay bars were ripe for routine bigtime headbreaking most of that ended by the early seventies but milo had caught the tail end of the departments fagbashing fervor lapd masked the raids as drug busts as if hetero clubs werent fueled by the same dope during his first month at west la hed been assigned to a saturday night bivouac against a private club on sepulveda near venice outoftheway dive in a former autopainting barn where a hundred or so wellheeled men believing themselves to be secure went to talk and dance and smoke grass and gobble quaaludes and enjoy the bathroom stalls lapd had a different notion of security the way the supervisor a hypermacho d ii named reisan who milo was certain was tucked deeply in the closet laid out the plan youda thought it was a swoop on some cong hamlet squinty eyes military lingo triangulated diagrams scrawled on the board give me a break milo sat through the orientation struggling not to succumb to a fullbody sweat reisan going on about coming down hard on resisters dont be shy about using your batons then leering and warning the troops not to kiss anyone because you didnt know where those lips had been looking straight at milo when hed cracked wise milo laughing along with the others and wondering whythehellishedoingthat fighting to convince himself hed imagined it the day of the raid he called in sick with the flu stayed in bed for three days perfectly healthy but he worked hard at degrading himself by not sleeping or eating just sucking on gin and vodka and rye and peach brandy and whatever else he found in the cupboard figuring if the department checked on him hed look like death warmed over vn combat vet now a reallife working detective but he was still thinking like a truant high school kid over the three days he lost eight pounds and when he stood his legs shook and his kidneys ached and he wondered if that yellow tinge in his eyes was real or just bad lighting his place was a dingy hovel the few windows it offered looked out to airshafts and no matter how many bulbs he used he could never get the illumination above tombstrength the first time in three days that he tried food a barely warmed can of hearty man chili what he didnt heave whooshed out the other end he smelled like a goat pen his hair felt brittle and his fingernails were getting soft for a full week later his ears rang and his back hurt and he drank gallons of water a day just in case hed damaged something the day he returned to the station a transfer slip vice to auto theft signed by reisan was in his box that seemed a fine state of affairs two days later someone slipped a note through the door of his locker hows your bunghole faggot he pulled into the healthy foods lot stayed in the taurus scanned the parking lot for anything out of the ordinary during the drive from his house to the station then from budget to the market hed been on alert for a tail hadnt picked up any but this wasnt the movies and the hard truth was in a city built around the combustion engine you could never be sure he watched shoppers enter the market finally satisfied himself that he hadnt been followed and crossed over to the row of small stores rehabbed shacks really that sat across from healthy foods locksmith dry cleaners cobbler west hollywood easy mail center he flashed his badge to the pakistani behind the maildrop counter pile up those violations sturgis and inquired about the box number listed on the jeeps registration the clerk was sullen but he thumbed through his circular rolodex and shook his head no playa del sol behind him was the wall of brass boxes a sign advertised fedex ups rubber stamps whileuwait giftwrapping milo spotted no ribbons or happyface wrapping paper this was all about secrets when did they stop renting he said had to be at least a year ago how do you know because the current tenant has been renting for thirteen months tenant milo pictured some leprechaun setting up house in the mailbox tiny stove refrigerator murphy bed thumbnailsized cable tv blaring the pot of gold network whos the current tenant he said you know i cant tell you that sirrr aw shucks said milo producing a twentydollar bill keep those felonies coming the pakistani stared at the bill as milo placed it on the counter closed his hand over andrew jacksons gaunt visage then he turned his back on milo and began fiddling with one of the empty mailboxes and milo reached over and took hold of the rolodex and read the card mr and mrs irwin block address on cynthia street just a few blocks away know these people said milo old people said the pakistani still showing his back she comes in every week but they dont get anything nothing once in a while junk then why do they need a pob the clerk faced him and smiled everyone needs one tell all your friends he reached for the rolodex but milo held on to it thumbing back from bl to ba no bartlett then up to p no playa del sol the pakistani said stop please what if someone comes in milo released the rolodex and the clerk placed it under the counter how long have you been working here oh said the clerk as if the question was profound ten months so youve never dealt with anyone from playa del sol that is true who worked here before you my cousin where is he kashmir milo glared at him its true said the man he had enough of this place west hollywood america the morals no curiosity about why milo wanted to know about playa del sol given the guys line of work milo supposed hed learned not to be curious milo thanked him and the clerk rubbed his index finger with his thumb you could show your thanks in another way okay said milo taking a very low bow thank you very much as he left he heard the man utter something in a language he didnt understand he drove to the cynthia street apartment of mr and mrs irwin block pretended to be a census taker and enjoyed an affable fiveminute chat with the possibly hundredyearold selma block a bluecaftaned champagnehaired pixie of a woman so bent and tiny she might very well have fit into one of the mailboxes behind her sat mr block on a greenandgold sofa a mute static vacanteyed apparition of similar antiquity whose sole claim to physiologic viability was the occasional moist and startling throat clear five minutes taught milo more about the blocks than hed wanted to know both had worked in the industry selma as a costume mistress for several major studios irwin as an accountant for mgm three children lived back east one was an orthodontist the middle one had gone into the financial world and became a republican and our daughter weaves and sews handfashioned is this the only address you keep maam said milo pretending to write everything down but doodling curlicues no chance of mrs b spotting the ruse the top of her head was well below the pad oh no dear we keep a postoffice box over by the healthy foods whys that maam because we like to eat healthy why the postoffice box maam selma blocks tiny claw took hold of milos sleeve and he felt as if a cat was using his arm for a spring post politics dear political mailers oh said milo what party do you belong to dear im an independent well dear we like the green party rather subversive you know the claw dug in deeper you keep the box for green party mailers oh yes said selma block youre too young but we remember the way it used to be the way it used to be when the old days those house unamerican fascists that louse mccarthy refusing the invitation to stay for tea and cookies he extricated himself from mrs block and drove around aimlessly trying to figure out his next move playa del sol alex was right it did have that real estate ring so maybe the cossacks did have their hand in this assisted by lapd the fix again early on hed looked up cossack developments address found it on wilshire in midcity but he hadnt retained the numbers in his head those days were gone so he called information and fixed the placement between fairfax and la brea the sky was dark and traffic had started to thin and he made it over in less than a quarter hour the cossack brothers had headquartered themselves in a threestory pink granite zigguratdominated complex that occupied a full city block just east of the county art museum years ago this had been junk real estate the fringes of the pathetically misnamed miracle mile back in the forties the miles construction had been an historic first a commercial strip with feeble street appeal but entry through the rear parking lots yet another symptom of las postwar infatuation with the car twenty years later westward flight had left the central city area a sump of poorly maintained buildings and lowrent businesses and the only miracle was that any part of the mile survived now the current cycle urban renewal county art not much in the way of a museum but the courtyard did offer free concerts and la didnt expect much had spawned other museums tributes to dolls folk art and most effectively the car big glossy office structures had followed if the cossacks had gotten in early and owned the land under the pink granite thing theyd made out well he parked on a side street climbed wide slick granite steps past a huge shallow black pool filled with still water and dotted with pennies and entered the lobby guard desk to the right but no guard half the lights were off and the cavernous space echoed the complex was divided into east and west wings most of the tenants were financial and showbiz outfits cossack industries took up the third floor of the east wing he rode the elevator stepped into an unfurnished whitecarpeted whitewalled space one big abstract lithograph greeted him yellow and white and amorphous maybe some geniuss notion of a softboiled egg then to the left double white doors locked no sound from the other side the elevator door closed behind him turning he stabbed the button and waited for it to return back on wilshire he continued to study the building lot of lights were on including several on the third floor a couple of weeks ago the state had warned of impending power shortages urged everyone to conserve either the cossacks didnt care or someone was working late he rounded the corner returned to the taurus reversed direction and parked with a clear view of the buildings subterranean parking lot fighting back that old feeling wasted hours stakeout futility but stakeouts were like vegas slots once in a great while something paid off and what better basis for addiction twentythree minutes later the lots metal grate slid open and a battered subaru emerged young black woman at the wheel talking on a cell phone six minutes after that a newish bmw young white guy with spiked hair also gabbing on cell oblivious he nearly missed colliding with a delivery truck both drivers traded insults and birdflips the streets were safe tonight milo waited another half hour was just about to split when the grate yawned once more and a soot gray lincoln town car nosed out vanity plates ccccccc windows tinted well past the legal limit even the drivers pane but otherwise nice and conservative the lincoln stopped at the red light at wilshire then turned west traffic was heavy enough for milo to obtain cover two lengths behind but sufficiently fluid to allow a nice easy tail perfect for what it was worth he followed the gray lincoln half a mile west to san vicente boulevard then north to melrose and west again to robertson where the town car pulled into the front lot of a restaurant on the southwest corner brushed steel door matching steel nameplate above the door engraved heavily sangre de leon new place the last time milo had taken the time to look an indonesianirish fusion joint had occupied the corner before that had been some kind of vietnamese bistro run by a celebrity chef from bavaria and bankrolled by movie stars milo figured the patrons had never served in the military before that he recalled at least six other startup trendolas in as many years new owners refurbishing grand opening garnering the usual breathless puff pieces in la magazine and buzz only to close a few months later badluck corner same for the site across the street the bamboofaced onestory amorphoid that had once been a pacific rim seafood palace was now shuttered a heavy chain drawn across its driveways sangre de leon lions blood appetizing he wouldnt take bets on this one enduring longer than a bout of indigestion he found a dark spot across robertson parked diagonal to the restaurant turned off his headlights the rest of the decor was windowless gray stucco and sprigs of tall bearded grass that looked like nothing other than dry weeds an army of pinkjacketed valets all goodlooking and female hovered at the mouth of the lot stingy lot the seven mercedes parked there filled it the town cars chauffeur a big thick bouncer type nearly as large as georgie nemerovs hunters jumped out and sprang a rear door a chesty puffyfaced guy in his forties with sparse curly hair got out first his face looked as if it had been used as a waffle iron milo recognized garvey cossack right away the guy had put on weight since his most recent newspaper photo but not much else about him had changed next came a taller softlooking character with a shaved bullet head and a frank zappa mustache that drooped to his chin little brother bobo minus his slickedback hairdo middleaged sap doing the youthculture thing cranial skin as a proud badge of rebellion either way the guy enjoyed mirror time garvey cossack wore a dark sport coat with padded shoulders over a black turtleneck black slacks below the slacks white running shoes now there was a touch of elegance bobo had on a toosmall black leather bomber jacket tootight black jeans and black tshirt toohigh black boots blacklensed shades too call the paramedics weve got an emergency overdose of cool a third man exited the lincoln and the big chauffeur let him close his own door number three was dressed the way businessmen used to dress in la dark suit white shirt undistinguished tie normal shoes shorter than the cossack brothers he had narrow shoulders and a subservient stoop saggy wrinkled face though he didnt appear any older than the cossacks miniscule oval eyeglasses and long blond hair that shagged over his collar fought the joecorporate image the top of his scalp was mostly bald spot minispecs hung back as the cossacks entered the restaurant garvey in a flatfooted waddle bobo swaggering and bopping his head in time to some private melody the chauffeur returned to the car and began backing out and specs walked past the pink ladies expectant smiles the town car turned south on robertson drove a block pulled to the curb went dark specs remained out in the lot for a few seconds looking around but at nothing in particular facing the taurus but milo caught no sign the guy saw anything that bothered him no this one was just full of random nervous energy hands flexing neck rotating mouth turned down the tiny lenses of his glasses darting and catching street light a pair of reflective eggs guy made him think of a crooked accountant on audit day finally specs ran his finger under his collar rotated his shoulders and made his way to the pleasures of leonine hemoglobin no additional diners materialized during the thirtyseven minutes milo sat there when one of the untipped valets looked at her watch stepped out to the sidewalk and lit up a cigarette he got out of the taurus and loped across the street the girl was a gorgeous little redhaired thing with blueblue eyes so vivid the color made its way through the night maybe twenty she noticed milo approaching kept smoking the cigarette was wrapped in black paper and had a gold tip shermans did they still make those she looked up when he was three feet away and smiled through the cloud of nicotine that swirled in the warm night air smiling because milo had his latest bribe visible two twenties folded between his index and tall fingers backed by a freelance journalist cover story forty bucks was double what hed paid the pakistani pob clerk but the valet her tag said val was a helluva lot cuter than the clerk and as it turned out a lot easier to deal with ten minutes later he was back in the taurus cruising past the town car mt chauffeur was snoozing with his mouth open a shavedhead latino guy the redhead had supplied minispecs id oh thats brad he works with mr cossack and his brother mister cossack mr garvey cossack and his brother blueeyed glance back at the restaurant he coowns this place along with a string of celebrity names followed milo pretended to be impressed must be a jumping place it was when it opened no more huh you know she said rolling her eyes hows the food the parking cutie smiled and smoked and shook her head how would i know its like a hundred bucks a plate maybe when i get my first big part her laugh was derisive she added maybe when pigs fly so young so cynical hollywood said milo yeah val looked back again all the other girls were loafing and a few were smoking probably keeping their weight down thought milo any of them couldve modeled val lowered her voice to a whisper tell the truth i hear the food sucks the name cant help lions blood ick isnt that gross what kind of cuisine is it ethiopian i think or something african maybe also latino i dunno cuban maybe sometimes theyve got a band and from out here it sounds kind of cuban her hips pistoned and she snapped her fingers i hear its on its way out cuban music no silly this place time for a new job said milo no prob theres always bar mitzvahs stubbing out her cigarette she said you dont happen to ever work for variety do you or the hollywood reporter mostly i do wire service stuff someones interested in the restaurant milo shrugged i drive around youve got to dig if you wanna find oil she looked at the taurus and her next smile was ripe with sympathy another la loser well if you ever do variety remember this name chataqua dale milo repeated it nice but so is val a cloud of doubt washed over the blue eyes you really think so cause i was wondering if chataqua was maybe you know over the top no said milo its great thanks she touched his arm let the cigarette drop to the pavement ground out the butt got a dreamy look in her eyes audition fever well gotta go thanks for your time said milo reaching into his pocket and slipping her another twenty you are soooo nice she said not usually oh i bet you are let me ask you you meet people right know any decent agents cause mine is an asshole only agents of destruction he said puzzlement lent the beautiful young face temporary complexity then her actors instincts cut in still not comprehending but recognizing a cue she smiled and touched his arm again right see you around bye said milo by the way what does brad do walks around with them she said a walkingaround guy you got it they all need them hollywood types rich types with gross bodies know brads last name larner brad larner hes kind of a jerk how so hes just a jerk said val not friendly never smiles never tips a jerk he drove the two blocks to santa monica boulevard made a right turn and circled back to melrose this time approaching the corner from the east and parking just up from the shuttered chinese place the rest of the boulevard was taken up by art galleries all closed and the street was dark and quiet he got out stepped over the chinese places heavy chain and walked across a lot starting to sprout weeds through the cracks and dotted with mounds of dry dog shit finding himself a nice little vantage point behind one of the dead restaurants gateposts he waited taking in the chinese places grimness up close black paint flaking bamboo shredding another dream rent asunder he liked that nowhere to sit so he continued to stand there well concealed watching nothing happen at sangre de leon for a long time his knees and back began to hurt and stretching and squatting seemed to make matters worse last christmas rick had bought a treadmill for the spare bedroom used it religiously every morning at five last month hed suggested that milo give regular exercise a try milo hadnt argued but neither had he complied he was no good in the morning usually pretended to be asleep when rick left for the er he checked his timex the cossacks and brad the jerk larner had been inside for over an hour and no other patrons had materialized larner was no doubt the achievement house directors son the harassers son yet another link between the families daddy putting up crazy sister caroline at achievement house buying jobs for himself and junior connections and money so what else was new presidents were selected the same damn way if any of this provided a hook to janie ingalls he couldnt see it but he knew on a gut level that it did matter that pierce schwinns forced retirement and his own transfer to west la had resulted from more than schwinns dalliances with street whores twentyyearold fix john g broussard doing the dirty work schwinn had sat on whatever hed known for two decades pasted photos in an album finally decided to break silence why now maybe because broussard had reached the top and schwinn wanted his revenge to be a gourmet dish using milo to do the dirty work then he falls off a docile horse headlights from the north end of robertson slapped him out of his rumination two sets of lights a pair of vehicles approaching the melrose intersection the traffic signal turned amber the first car passed through legally and the second one ran the red both pulled up in front of sangre de leon vehicle number one was a discreet black mercedes coupe surprise surprise whose license plate he copied down quickly out stepped the driver another businesssuit moving so quickly the pink ladies had no time to get his door he slipped a bill to the nearest valet anyway let milo have a nice clean look at him older guy late sixties to midseventies balding with a sparse gray combover wearing a boxy beige suit a white shirt and a dark tie medium height medium build cleanshaven the skin falling away from the bone at jowls and neck no expression on his face milo wondered if this was larner senior or just a guy out for dinner if so it wouldnt be a solo dinner because the occupants of the second car nearly tripped over themselves to get to his side vehicle two was also black but no feat of german engineering big fat crown victoria sedan anachronistically oversize the only places milod seen those things recently were government offices but this one didnt have stateissue e plates but neither did lots of unmarkeds and for a second he thought department brass and experienced a rush of expectations met too easily documenting cop honchos with the cossacks why the hell hadnt he remembered to bring a damn camera but the moment the first guy out of the crown victoria turned and showed his face it was a whole different story long dark lizard face under a black pompadour city councilman eduardo ed the germ bacilla the official representative of a district that encompassed a chunk of downtown he of the serious bad habits and poor work habits bacilla attended maybe one out of every five council meetings and a couple of years ago hed been nabbed in boyle heights trying to buy powdered coke from an undercover narc quick and frantic negotiations with the das office had led to the draconian sentence of public apology and public service two months on graffitiremoval detail bacilla working alongside some of the very gangbangers hed favored with cityfunded scam rehab programs lack of a felony conviction meant the councilman could keep his job and a recall effort by a leftist homeboy reformer sputtered and now here was ol germ kissing up to tan suit so was crown victoria rider two and guess what another civil stalwart this guy had looped his arm around tan suits shoulder and was laughing about something no expression on suits ceo face mr jocular was older around tan suits age with white temples and a bushy white mustache that concealed his upper lip tall and narrowshouldered with an onionbulb body that a wellcut suit couldnt enhance and the iceeyed cunning of a cornered peccary city councilman james diamond jim horne he of the suspected kickbacks and briberies and exwives hushmoneyed to silence back in the good old days when domestic violence was still known as wifebeating milo knew through the lapd gravevine that horne was a longtime serious spousebasher with a penchant for pulverizing without leaving marks like germ bacilla diamond jim had always managed to squeak through without arrest or conviction for over thirty years hed served a district that bordered bacillas a northcentral strip filled with tickytack houses and belowcode apartments once solidly workingclass white hornes constituency had turned percent poor hispanic and the councilman had watched his vote pluralities tumble from percent to a series of opponents with surnames ending in ez had failed to topple horne the corrupt old bastard got the potholes fixed and plenty else germ and diamond jim walking arm in arm with tan suit heading for the steel door of sangre de leon milo returned to the taurus and using the id of a pacific division vice detective he despised pulled up the mercedes coupes plates he half expected another corporate shield but the numbers came back matching a fouryearold mercedes owned by a reallife person we obey the three hundred block of muirfield road in hancock park walter obey he of the billiondollar fortune nominally walt obey was in the same business as the cossacks concrete and rebar and lumber and drywall but obey occupied a whole different galaxy from the cossacks fifty years ago obey construction began nailing up homes for returning gis the company was probably responsible for percent of the tracts that snaked parallel to the freeways and sprawled across the smogchoked basin that the chumash indians had once called the valley of smoke walt obey and his wife barbara were on the board of every museum hospital and civic organization that meant anything in the lipgnawing overtheshoulder uncertainty known as la society walt obey was also a model of rectitude mr upright in a business that claimed few saints the guy had to be at least eighty but he looked a good deal younger good genes clean living now here he was supping with germ and diamond jim the cossacks and brad larner had been inside for one hour no shock it was their restaurant still the question hung table for three or six he obtained sangre de leons number from information and called the restaurant five rings later a bored central europeanaccented male voice said yes this is mr walter obeys office ive got a message for mr obey hes dining with the cossacks i believe theyre in a private room yes they are ill get the phone to him eagerness to please had wiped out the boredom milo hung up he drove home trying to piece it all together the cossacks and walt obey and two city councilmen noshing on designer grub brad larner along as a gofer or his dads surrogate alex had pulled up something about the cossacks trying to bring a football team to la maybe reactivating the coliseum the scheme had died as had nearly everything else the cossacks had tried movies tearing down landmarks on the face of it the brothers were losers yet they had enough clout to bring walt obey from hancock park to west hollywood the cossacks in their chauffeured town car with personalized plates screamed new money but obey the real money man drove himself in an anonymous fouryearold sedan the billionaire was so unobtrusive he could pass for your average middling cpa what got vulgarians and bluenoses together something big the coliseum sat in germ bacillas district and next door was diamond jim hornes domain was this one of those complicated deals that always managed to elude zoning laws and whatever else stood in its way taxpayers footing the bill for rich guys indulgences something that might be jeopardized by the rehash of a twentyyearold murder and the exposure of the cossacks role in covering up for their crazy sister and junkiemurderer willie burns why had georgie nemerov gotten so antsy the only possible thread between nemerov and the rest of it was the department and now the department was verifying his vacation time and maybe sending that bartlettt asshole to spook him health facilitator meaning what be careful not to get unhealthy suddenly he wanted very much to make someone else deathly ill when he pulled into his driveway the white porsche was parked up near the garage little red alarm light blinking on the dash extrastrength lock bar fixed to the steering column rick loved the car was as careful with it as he was with everything else he found rick at the kitchen table still wearing his scrubs and eating warmedup chinese food from last night a glass of red wine was at his elbow he saw milo and smiled and gave a weak wave and the two of them shared a brief hug and rick said working late the usual howd your day go the usual heroics hardly rick pointed to the empty chair across the table the final dark hairs in his dense cap of curls had faded to gray last summer and his mustache was a silver toothbrush despite being a doctor and knowing better he liked to tan out in the backyard and his skin had held on to summer color he looked tired milo sat down opposite him and began picking at orange chicken theres more in the refrigerator said rick the egg rolls the rest of it no ill just take yours rick smiled weary bad stuff on shift said milo not particularly couple of heart attacks couple of false alarms kid with a broken leg from falling off a razor scooter colon cancer patient with a serious gut bleed that kept us busy for a long time woman with a darning needle in her eye two auto accidents one accidental shooting we lost that one the usual trivia exactly rick pushed his food away there was one thing the shooting was the last case i pulled i couldnt do anything for the poor guy he came in flat never beeped looks like he was cleaning his mm stared into the barrel maybe making sure it was clear and boom the cops who came in with the body said they found gun oil and rags and one of those barrelreaming tools on the table next to him bullet entered here rick touched the center of his mustache under his nose an accident said milo not suicide or anything else the cops who came in kept calling it an accident maybe they knew something technical itll go to the coroner sheriffs cops said milo no you guys it happened near venice and highland but thats not what i want to tell you the body had just gone to the morgue and i came back to chart and the cops who brought the guy in were in the cubicle next door and i heard them talking going on about their pensions sick leave department benefits then one said something about a detective in west la division whod tested hivpositive and put in for retirement the other cop said guess what goes round comes round then they both laughed not a joyful laugh a mean laugh rick picked up a chopstick and seesawed it between two fingers looked into milos eyes touched milos hand milo said i havent heard anything about that didnt assume you had or youd have told me milo withdrew his hand stood and got himself a beer rick stayed at the table continued to play with the chopstick tilting it deftly precisely a surgeons grace milo said its bullshit ida heard i just thought it was something youd want to know highland and venice what the hell would wilshire division know about west la what the hell would blues know about ds probably nothing big guy is there something i should know some tight spot youve gotten yourself into why what does this have to do with me milo didnt like the defensiveness in his own voice thinking the goddamn department rumor mill then thinking health facilitator you never know rick said okay and started to get up milo said wait and came around and stood behind rick and put his hands on ricks shoulders and told him the rest of it chapter i got on the computer typed in paris bartlett as a keyphrase on several search engines and came up with nothing next i tried playa del sol and its english translation sun beach and connected to hundreds of resort links all over the world costa del sol costa del amor playa negra playa blanca playa azul sun city sunrise beach excursion packages time shares white sand blue water adults only bring the kids also a guy whod devoted an obsessive site to the old song cuando caliente el sol the joys of the information age i stuck with it for hours felt my eyes crossing and broke for a midnight sandwich a beer and a shower before returning to the screen by am i was fighting sleep and nearly missed the article in a threeyearold issue of the resort journal elicited by yet another try at playa del sol this time id logged on to a pay service a businessoriented data bank that i hadnt used since last fall when id considered selling a lot of municipal bonds i clicked my assent to pony up by credit card and continued what i got was a rearofthemagazine piece entitled seeking the good life on distant shores americans looking for foreign bargains often find themselves on the losing end the article recounted several real estate deals gone sour among them a construction project down in baja named playa del sol highend condos peddled to american retirees lured by americanstyle luxury living at mexican prices two hundred units out of a planned four hundred fifty had been built and purchased the first wave of retirees hadnt yet moved in when the mexican government invoked a fineprint provision of an obscure regulation confiscated the land and sold it to a saudi arabian consortium who turned the condos into a hotel the playa del sol company ltd incorporated in the cayman islands dissolved itself and its american subsidiary playa enterprises declared chapter the retirees lost their money no comment from the president of playa enterprises michael larner recalling the obscure business journal references that had come up on my first search for larner magazines not in the research librarys holdings i looked for anything else i could find on the former achievement house director and came across several other deals hed put together during the past five years larners specialty was real estate syndication getting moneyed people together to buy out incomplete building projects that had run into trouble highrise apartments in atlanta defunct country clubs in colorado and new mexico a ski lodge in vermont a golf course in arizona once the deal was inked larner took his cut and walked away all the subsequent articles had the rahrah tone of paid ads none mentioned the mexican debacle playa enterprises or the playa del sol company ltd larners corporate face was now the ml group no mention of the cossack brothers either or any of larners fellow venture capitalists though showbiz and wall street affiliations were implied the only other ml staffer named was larners son bradley executive vice president using ml group as a keyphrase i retraced all the search machines and obtained the exact same articles plus one more a twoyearold stroke job in a glossy rag titled southwest leisure builder centered amid the text was a color photo larners father and son posing on a bright day in phoenix wearing matching royal blue golf shirts white canvas slacks white smiles michael larner looked around sixtyfive squarefaced and florid he wore wide steelframed aviators glasses turned to mirrors by the arizona sun his smile was selfsatisfied and heralded by overly large capped teeth he had a drinkers nose a big hardlooking belly and meticulously styled white hair a casting agent wouldve seen venal executive bradley larner was thinner and smaller and paler than his father barely a nuance of his father late thirties or early forties he was also bespectacled but his choice of eyewear ran to goldframed narrow oval lenses so tiny they barely covered his irises his hair was that lank waxy blond destined to whiten and it trailed past his shoulders less enthusiasm in his expression barely a smile at all though to read the article the larners were riding the crest of the real estate wave bradley larner looked like a kid forced to sit for yet another obnoxious family snapshot an accompanying picture on the following page showed michael larner in an icecream suit blue shirt and pink tie posed next to a whiteonwhite rolls royce silver spirit to his fathers right brad larner perched atop a gold harleydavidson wearing black leather the caption read different generations but the same flair for the ultimate ride the playa del sol link meant paris bartlett was likely an envoy to milo from the larners warning him off the trail of caroline cossack because the larners and the cossacks went way back the families had something else in common big deals that often went bad but all of them managed to stay on top maintaining the good life the ultimate ride in the cossacks case inherited wealth mightve provided a nice safety blanket michael larner on the other hand had bounced from job to job and industry to industry leaving scandal or bankruptcy in his wake but always managing to position himself higher that smile teeth as white and gleaming as his rolls royce a man willing to do whatever it took or friends in the right places or both back when larner had bent the rules and admitted caroline cossack to achievement house her brothers had been barely out of adolescence but already in the real estate business larner might have dealt initially with garvey cossack senior but the relationship endured well after seniors demise and found larner working for men twentyfive years his junior then i thought of something bradley larner was about the same age as the cossack brothers was there some link there something that went beyond business when searching for school data on caroline milo hadnt gotten very far with the local high schools because everyone was litigationwary and watched episodic tv and believed cops without warrants were impotent maybe also because carolines emotional problems meant she hadnt enjoyed much of a school history but perhaps tracking her brothers would be easier the next morning i was back at the library thumbing through whos who neither bob cossack nor bradley larner were listed but garvey cossack had merited a biography a single paragraph of puffery mostly what id already learned from the web tucked among all the corporate braggadocio was garveys educational history hed completed two years of college at cal state northridge but hadnt graduated maybe thats why hed bothered to list his high school and the fact that hed been student body treasurer during his senior year university high i checked with the reference desk and found that the library maintained three decades of local yearbooks in the reference section uni was as local as it got finding the right volume wasnt hard i estimated garveys age and nailed it on the second try his graduation picture revealed a fullfaced acneplagued eighteenyearold with long wavy hair wearing a lightcolored turtleneck sandwiched between the top of the sweaters collar and the boys meaty chin was a pukashell necklace his grin was mischievous listed under his picture were memberships in the business club the managerial staff of the football team and something called the kings men but there was no mention of his being treasurer according to the student council page the treasurer was a girl named sarah buckley thumbing through the three preceding yearbooks taught me that garvey cossack had never served in any studentgovernment capacity petty fib for a middleaged millionaire that made it all the more interesting i located robert bobo cossacks headshot one class back hed come to photo day wearing a black shirt with a high collar and a chokerlength chain equine face hair darker and even longer than his brothers a more severe blemish bobo wore a sullen expression and his eyes were halfshut sleepy or stoned or trying to look the part his attempts to grow a beard and mustache had resulted in a halo of dark fuzz around his chin and spidery wisps above his upper lip no affiliations below his picture other than the kings men also in the junior class was a very skinny bradley larner wearing tinted aviator glasses a buttondown shirt and peroxide surferdo that obscured half his face the part that was visible was as dispirited as bobo cossacks another kings man i searched the yearbook for mention of the club found a listing in the roster of school service organizations but no details finally in a breathless account of the homecoming game i spotted a reference to the revelry high jinks and other good stuff perpetrated by the kings men an accompanying snapshot showed a group of six boys at the beach wearing bathing trunks and striped beanies and clowning around with crosseyed grins goofy poses behindthehead rabbit ears the beer cans in their hands had been blacked out clumsily in one case the miller logo was still visible the caption surfs up but the kings men crave other liquid entertainment partying at zuma g cossack l chapman r cossack v coury b larner n hansen the cossack brothers had been high school party animals and the bel air bash a couple of years later was just more of the same and the link between them and the larners had been forged on the sands of zuma not in the boardroom that made me wonder if the idea for secreting problematic sister caroline might have originated with the boys not their father hey dad brads dad works at this place for weirdos maybe he can help out i searched the yearbooks for mention or a picture of caroline cossack nothing i drove around the pretty residential streets of westwood thinking about pierce schwinn and what hed really wanted from milo had the former detective finally decided to come clean with secrets held for two decades as id suggested or had he undertaken his own freelance investigation late in life and come up with new leads either way schwinn hadnt been as serene as his second wife believed or as faithful hed found a confidante to mail the murder book as id told milo ojai was a small town and it was doubtful schwinn couldve pulled off a regular assignation there without marge finding out but before hed married marge hed lived in oxnard in a fleabag motel marge hadnt mentioned the name but she had given us the site of schwinns minimumwage job and said schwinn hadnt owned a car taking out the trash at randalls western wear somewhere within walking distance the place was still in business on oxnard boulevard id taken the scenic route because it was the quickest way and i had no stomach for the freeway sunset to pch then north on the coast highway past the laventura line and deer creek road and the campgrounds of sycamore creek fifteen miles of state land that kissed the ocean and separated the last private beach in malibu from oxnard the water was sapphire blue under a chamberofcommerce sky and the bodies that graced the sand were brown and perfect at las posas road i avoided the eastern fork that swoops into glorious green tables of farmland and up to the foothills of camarillo and continued on route natures beauty gave way soon enough to dinge and depression and seventyfive minutes after leaving the house i was enjoying the sights of central oxnard oxnards a funny place the towns beach sports a marina and luxury hotels and fishing excursions and tour boats to the channel islands but the core is built around agriculture and the migrant workers whose dreadful lives put food on the nations tables the crime rates high and the air stinks of manure and pesticide once you get past the marina turnoff oxnard boulevard is a lowrent artery lined with trailer parks autoparts yards thrift shops taco bars taverns blaring mexican music and more spanish than english on the signage randalls western wear was a red barn in the center of the strip stuck between bernardos batteries and a windowless bar called el guapo plenty of parking in back only two pickups and an old chrysler in the lot inside was the smell of leather and sawdust and sweat ceilinghigh racks of denim and flannel stetsons stacked like waffles cowboy boots and belts on sale one corner devoted to sacks of feed a few saddles and bridles off in another travis tritts mellow baritone eased through scratchy speakers trying to convince some woman of his good intentions slow day in the ranchduds biz no customers just two salesmen on duty both white men in their thirties one wore gray sweats the other jeans and a black harleydavidson tshirt both smoked behind the counter showing no interest in my arrival i browsed found a tooled cowhide belt that i liked brought it to the counter and paid harleyd rang me up offering no eye contact or conversation as he handed back my credit card i let my wallet open and showed him my lapd consultant badge its a clipon deal with the departments badge as a logo not good for much and if you look closely it tells you that im no cop but few people get past the insignia and harley was no exception police he said as i closed the wallet he wore a bad haircut like his own badge of honor had a handlebar mustache that drooped to his chin and a cloggedsinus voice stringy arms and stringy hair a scatter of faded tattoos i said thought maybe you could help me with something with what sweats looked up he was a few years younger than harley with a blondgray crew cut a square shelf of a chin finishing a florid face stocky build quiet eyes my guess was exmilitary a few questions about a guy who worked here a while back pierce schwinn him said harley he hasnt been here for what coupla years he looked back at sweats coupla sweats agreed harley looked at the belt what you bought that to get friendly or something i bought it because its a nice belt i said but i have no problem with being friendly what do you remember about schwinn harley frowned when he worked here he was a bum whats up with him now have you seen him since he stopped working here maybe once he said or maybe not if he did come in it was with his wife that right another consultation with sweats probably why said harley what he do nothing just a routine investigation even as i said it i felt ridiculous not to mention criminal but if milo could risk violations of the public order so could i so the last time mr schwinn worked here was a couple of years ago thats right harleys smile was derisive if you wanna call it work it wasnt man he said leaning on the counter let me tell you it was a gift from our mom to him she owns the place he used to live down the block at the happy night mom felt sorry for him let him clean up for spare change the happy night motel i said right down the block so it was a sympathy thing i said from your mother shes got a soft heart said harley aint that so roger sweats nodded and smoked and turned up the volume on travis tritt the singers voice was plaintive and rich id have been convinced schwinn have any friends i said nope what about marge the woman who married him she comes in for feed when she runs out on her bulk order said harley yeah she married him but that makes her his wife not his friend and when are you entering law school f lee picky i said marge met him here guess so harleys brows knitted havent seen her either for a while roger said shes probably ordering off the internet like everyone we gotta get with that yeah said harley listlessly so cmon tell me man whyre you asking about him someone off him or something no i said hes dead all right fell off a horse a few months ago that so well she never mentioned it marge didnt whens the last time you saw her harley looked back at roger whens the last time i saw her roger shrugged maybe four five months ago mostly everyone orders bulk from suppliers said harley and the internet we do gotta get hooked up so marge has been in since schwinn died but she never mentioned his death probably i couldnt swear to it man listen dont pin me down on any a this roger gave another sweatsuited shrug marge dont talk much period travis tritt bowed out and pam tillis weighed in about the queen of denial harley said is this about drugs or something why do you say that harley fidgeted his brother said what vance means is that the happy night everyone knows about it people go in and out you wanna do us a favor get it moved outta here this block used to be a nice place i kept my car in the randalls lot and walked the block to the motel the place was a twelveunit gray stucco c built around a central courtyard and open to the street the yard was tiled with crumbling bricks didnt look as if it had been designed for parking but four dirty compact cars and an equally grubby truck with a camper shell occupied the space the office was off to the right a cubicle that smelled of gym sweat manned by a young skinheaded hispanic man wearing an aqua blue cowboy shirt with bloodred piping spangling on the yokes too but oily splotches in the armpits and ketchupcolored freckles across the front mitigated the garments charm resting on the pleat was a heavy iron crucifix attached to a stainlesssteel chain my entry rang a bell over the door and the clerk shot a look at me then glanced under the counter reflexively probably checking out the requisite pistol or just wanting to let me know he was armed a sign on the wall behind him said cash only same message in spanish right below he didnt move but his eyes jumped around and the left lid twitched he couldnt be more than twentytwo or three could probably take the adrenaline surges and bloodpressure spikes for a few more years i showed him the badge and he shook his head atop the counter was a novella blackandwhite photos of characters speaking in captions storyboard laid out like a comic book upside down i caught a few words sexualismo con passion he said don know nothin heavy accent i havent asked anything don know nothin good for you i said ignorance is bliss his stare was dull pierce schwinn i said he used to live here no answer i repeated the name don know nothin an old man anglo white hair white beard nothing he used to work at randalls uncomprehending look randalls western wear down the block dont know nothin whats your name don kno lights on in the brown eyes gustavo gustavo what gustavo martinez reyes you speak any english mr martinez reyes headshake anyone work here who does don know noth so much for ace detective work but id come this far why not give ojai another try check out a place i knew marge schwinn had frequented the shop where shed bought the blue albums oneill chapin over by the celestial café from england discontinued i bought the last three maybe she hadnt or maybe schwinn had also shopped for himself i continued to the next freeway onramp and was back on highway within minutes the air was cold and clean every color on full volume and i could smell ripening fruit in the neighboring groves oneill chapin sat in one of those cozy commercial groupings that had sprouted along the road this one a wellshaded segment just past the center of ojai but several miles before the turnoff to marge schwinns ranch the shop was a miniscule shingleroofed clapboard cottage dominated by live oaks the boards were painted forest green and the store was fronted by five feet of cobblestones running from the earthen curb to dutch doors painted creamy mint gold leaf lettering across the front window proclaimed oneill chapin purveyors of fine paper and pigments est behind the windows were dark oak shutters a sign leaning against the slats said on a buying trip in europe back soon i checked out the neighboring business to the right was the candlery also shuttered then marta spiritual counselor and the humanos theosophic institute to the left was a onestory office building faced in river rock chiropractors office a notary publiccuminsurance broker a travel agent specializing in naturefriendly excursions next to that in a sunnier spot sat an adobe cube with a wooden sign over the door celestial café gold stars danced around the edges of the signs lights flickered behind blue gingham curtains it was nearly pm and id fed neither my brain nor my gut times like this i supposed organic muffins and herbal tea wouldnt be halfbad but according to the blackboard mounted above the open kitchen the café specialized in country french food crepes quiche soufflés chocolate desserts real coffee lord amighty some kind of new age sound track tinkly bells flute and harp eased out of speakers set into the low woodbeam ceiling more blue gingham covered half a dozen tables a woman with elaborately braided gray hair wearing a buckskin jacket over a crinkly pink dress sat enjoying what looked to be ratatouille no server was in sight just a pastyfaced heavyset whiteaproned woman wearing a blue bandana over her hair cutting vegetables in the kitchen at her elbow was a sixburner wolfe range with one flame aglow under a castiron crepe pan fresh batter had just been poured into the pan and the cook stopped cutting long enough to grab a towel and take hold of the handle tilting deftly she created a perfect disc that she slid onto a plate then topped with creamed spinach a dash of nutmeg and the crepe was rolled and placed on the counter then back to the vegetables the grayhaired woman got up and took the crepe beautiful aimee the cook nodded she looked to be forty or so had a squashed face and downturned eyes the hairs that had peeked out from under the bandana were light brown and silver i smiled at her her face registered no expression and she continued chopping i read the blackboard how about a mixedcheese crepe and coffee she turned around left the kitchen through a side door i stood there listening to bells and flute and harp behind me the graybraided woman said dont worry shell be back i was wondering if it was something i said she laughed no shes just shy heck of a cook though aimee returned with a small wheel of white cheese you can sit she said in a very soft voice ill bring it to you thanks much i tried another smile and her mouth quivered upward for less than a second and she began wiping the crepe pan the grayhaired woman finished her meal just as aimee brought me my plate a mug of coffee utensils wrapped in a heavy yellow linen napkin she returned to her vegetables and the graybraided woman said here you are dear and paid her cash no change exchanged no credit card signs anywhere in the café i unfolded the napkin looked at my plate two crepes with her back to me aimee said you only have to pay for one i had lots of cheese thank you i said they look delicious chop chop chop i cut into the first crepe and took a bite and flavor burst on my tongue the coffee was the best id had in years and i said so chop chop chop i was working on the second crepe when the front door opened and a man walked in and headed for the counter short chubby whitehaired he wore a purplish red polyester jumpsuit zipped in front with big floppy lapels crimson clogs and white socks clad stubby feet his fingers were attenuated too the thumbs little more than arced nubs his ruddy face was impish but peaceful an elf in repose a leatherthonged bolo tie was held in place by a big shapeless purple rock flashing on his left hand was a huge gold pinkie ring set with a violet cabochon he looked to be in his midsixties but i knew he was seventyseven because i knew him i also understood why he wore a single color it was the only hue he could perceive in an otherwise blackandwhite world a rare form of color blindness was one of a host of physical anomalies hed been born with some like the shortened digits were visible others hed assured me were not dr wilbert harrison psychiatrist anthropologist philosopher eternal student a sweet and decent man and even a murderous psychopath bent on revenge had recognized that sparing harrison as he conducted a rampage against the doctors he believed had tormented him i hadnt been spared and id met bert harrison years ago trying to figure all of that out since then we talked occasionally infrequently bert i said he turned smiled alex holding up a finger he greeted aimee without making eye contact she poured him tea and selected an almondcrusted pastry from the glass case beneath the blackboard a regular he said thank you darling sat down at my table placed his cup and plate in front of him and grasped my hand with both of his alex so good to see you good to see you too bert what have you been up to the usual and you soft gray eyes twinkled ive embarked on a new hobby ethnic instruments the more esoteric the better ive discovered ebay how wonderful the global economy in its finest form i find bargains wait like a child on christmas eve for the packages to arrive then try to figure out how to play them this week my project is a onestringed curiosity from cambodia i havent learned its proper name yet the seller billed it as a southeast asian thingamajig sounds dreadful so far like a cat with indigestion but i have no neighbors per se harrisons home was a purple cottage high on a hill above ojai bordered by olive groves and empty fields and nearly hidden by snarls of agave cactus berts old chevy station wagon sat in a dirt driveway always freshly waxed each time id visited the houses front door had been unlocked sounds like fun i said its great fun he bit into the pastry let loose a flow of custard licked his lips wiped his chin delicious what have you been doing for fun alex figuring out how to answer that must have done something to my face because harrison placed his hand atop mine and he looked like a concerned parent that bad son is it that obvious oh yes alex oh yes indeed i told him about robin he thought a while and said sounds like small things have been amplified not so small bert shes really had it with my risktaking behavior i was referring to your feelings your anxiety about robin i know im being paranoid but i keep flashing back to the last time she left she made a mistake he said but she bore the brunt of it and you might think about disconnecting yourself from her pain her pain i said think it still bothers her after all these years if she allows herself to focus on it my guess is she feels a good deal worse about it than you do hed met robin twice and yet i didnt feel him presumptuous a few months after our house had burned down wed driven up to santa barbara for a change of scenery and had run into bert at an antiquarian bookstore on state street hed been browsing through eighteenthcentury scientific treatises in latin my current hobby kids dust had speckled the front of his jumpsuit she loves you deeply he said at least she did when i saw her and i have my doubts about that depth of feeling just vanishing he ate more pastry picked almond slivers from his plate and slipped them between his lips the body language the mind language was all there i remember thinking this is the girl for alex i used to think so cherish what youve got my second wife was like that accepted me with all my irregularities you think robin accepts me no matter what if she didnt shed have left long ago but putting her through more of my risktaking would be cruel he squeezed my hand life is like a bus stop alex we map out our route but linger briefly between adventures only you can chart your itinerary and hope god agrees with it so what brings you to ojai enjoying the scenery then come up to my house let me show you my acquisitions we finished our food and he insisted on paying the old station wagon was parked out front and i followed him into town and onto signal street where we climbed past a drainage ditch paved with fieldstones and spanned by footbridges up to the top of the road the front door to the purple house was open and shielded by a welloxidized screen bert climbed the steps with agility and ushered me into the living room the space was exactly as i remembered small dark plankfloored crammed with old furniture shawls throw pillows an upright piano the bay window lined with dusty bottles but now there was no room to sit a gigantic hammeredbronze gong nudged the piano every couch and chair bore drums and bells and lyres and zithers and pan pipes and harps and objects i couldnt identify the floor space behind the piano bench was taken up by a sixfoot dragonshaped contraption topped with corrugated wood harrison ran a stick along the ridges and set off a percussive but melodic scale bali he said ive learned old macdonald on it sigh one day mozart he cleared instruments from a sagging sofa and said be comfortable as i sat something metallic behind the couch caught my eye a foldedup wheelchair bert said im storing it for a friend and settled his small frame on a hardbacked chair the fingers of his right hand brushed against a pedal harp but not hard enough to make a sound despite your stress you look well as do you knock wood he rapped the rim of the harp and this time a note rang out g sharp so youre just passing through next time call and we can have lunch unless of course you need solitude no id love to get together of course we all need solitude he said the key is finding the right balance you live alone bert i have friends so do i milo milo and others well thats good alex is there anything i can do for you no i said like what anything alex if you could solve cold cases that would be helpful cold cases he said a murder i nodded the body may be cold he said but i wonder if the memory ever really cools care to tell me about it i didnt yes i did chapter i described the ingalls murder without mentioning names or places or the murder book but there was no sense withholding milos name bert harrison had met milo had given a statement to milo on the bad love case as i talked he rarely allowed his gaze to wander from my face when i finished he said this girl the one who poisoned the dog sounds monstrous at the very least severely disturbed first a dog then a person thats the typical pattern though you have only the neighbors accusation to go on the behavioral warning in the girls chart is consistent with the neighbors report she didnt belong in that school bert stringpulling by her family probably got her in safe hiding during the investigation of the murder he folded his hands in his lap and no word on the other possible victim i assume milos been looking for her no sign of her yet i said most likely shes dead the disturbed girl seems to have vanished completely no paper trail at all that reeks of more stringpulling a supportive family he said in terms of aiding and abetting hmm alex if the case was taken out of milos hands twenty years ago how did he manage to be reassigned he was unofficially reassigned i said by someone who knew we worked together and was sure id give him the message what message alex i thought about how much to say told him about the murder book and its probable link to pierce schwinn pierce he said so thats why youre here you knew him i did i know his wife marge as well sweet woman milo and i were up at her ranch a few days ago i said its a good bet schwinn assembled that book but the only photos of his she claims to know about are nature shots claims said harrison you doubt her she seemed truthful id believe her alex whys that because shes an honest woman and schwinn i have nothing bad to say about him either how well did you know him bert we ran into each other from time to time in town shopping at the little theater are you aware of any confidante he mightve had other than marge someone hed have trusted to send the book because it was mailed to me seven months after he died youre certain it emanated from pierce the photos are lapd crimescene shots probably purloined from old files schwinn was a shutterbug used to bring his own camera to crime scenes in order to snap his own pictures on top of that marge schwinn said she purchased three identical blue leather albums for pierce over at oneill chapin she showed us two but the third was missing and she had no idea where it was thats what drew me back here i wanted to speak to the shops owners to see if theyd sold any others the owner he said is a lovely woman named roberta bernstein and shes in europe oneill chapin are her pet terriers he pressed a blunt little index finger to his lips sounds like the totality of evidence does point to pierce but no buts alex youve put together a solid argument any idea who he mightve passed it to he crossed his legs hooked a finger under the hem of a purple trouser leg the only person i ever saw pierce with was marge and as i said i doubt shes involved because shes honest and because pierce was protective of her alex i cant see him exposing her to something like that sounds like you knew them both pretty well i said he smiled im a psychiatrist im allowed to theorize no we never really socialized but this is a small town you meet the same people over and over i suppose im drawing upon pierces body language when they were together protective very much so marge seemed to take well to that i found that interesting shed never lived with anyone before her family goes way back in this region and shes taken care of that ranch nearly singlehandedly for years people of a certain age can get set in their ways not take well to the demands of a relationship but marge seemed quite content with domestic life they both did did you know pierce had been a detective marge told me he said soon after pierce moved in i believe it was at the theater as a matter of fact out in the lobby during intermission she introduced me and we began chatting about a crime story in the newspaper something down your way bank robbers a shootout the criminals had escaped marge said something along the lines of if pierce were still on the force hed solve it howd pierce react to that if i recall correctly unreactive didnt say much of anything thats the way he usually was reserved milo had described schwinn as verbally aggressive prone to sermonizing lots had changed over twenty years i said marge told us pierce had grown serene shed know best so pierce was milos partner how interesting the world grows smaller yet the way he died i said falling off that horse any thoughts about that he uncrossed his leg tapped a rosy cheek and allowed his hand to brush against an ornate concertina you suspect something other than an accident why alex because thats the way my mind works ah he said i could hear milo laughing small world he repeated thats about all i can tell you can i fix you some tea alex wait youre a guitarist arent you ive got something in back that might interest you a turnofthecentury knutsen hawaiian harpguitar perhaps you can tell me how to tune the drone strings his spare bedroom was filled with instruments and antique music stands and i hung around for a while watching him fiddle and tinker listened to him expound on music and rhythm and culture he began to reminisce about his time in chile ethnographic research in indonesia a summer of musicology in salzburg ministering to israeli kibbutz children whod been traumatized by terrorism no mention of his santa barbara days the years hed spent at a school for troubled kids just a few miles away the kind of place someone like caroline cossack might easily have ended up that highpriced travesty had caused more problems than it had solved bert had a selective memory for the positive perhaps thats why hed seemed reluctant to imagine a young girl evincing brutality he stopped narrating and threw up his hands im such a bore youve probably begun wondering if im going senile i havent at all bert though i had thought he seems distracted the truth is i have lost some shortterm memory but nothing beyond my age norms your memory seems fine to me i said thats kind of you to say he gestured around the room all this all these toys alex theyre a wonderful distraction a boy needs a hobby pudgy fingers took hold of my forearm his grip was forceful we both know that dont we i stuck around for tea finally told him i needed to get back to la as he walked me to my car he said that girl so monstrous if its true you seem skeptical he nodded i do find it hard to believe that a young female would be capable of such savagery im not saying she acted alone bert or even initiated the murder but she couldve lured the victims and either receded into the background or participated any theories about the main perpetrator the girl had a boyfriend six years older with a criminal history including murder sexual murder no an ambush killing i see he said any particular reason you didnt mention him initially the coverups more likely related to the girl this fellow wasnt wealthy young black street pusher i see and what became of this murderous young felon he vanished too a girl and a young man he said that would change things psychosocially a killing team i said one scenario is the two of them picked up the victims at the party and took them somewhere to be raped and murdered a svengalitrilby situation he said dominant male submissive female because thats what it usually takes to get an impressionable young female involved in extremely violent behavior nearly all sexual violence seems to emanate from the y chromosome doesnt it what else do you know about this boyfriend apart from being a junkie and a pusher he was manipulative enough to get a streetsmart bail bondsman to forgo a bond and calculated enough to ambush the bondsman thats the homicide hes wanted for still wanted another of milos open cases sad convergence for milo he said a junkie in the strict sense heroin heroin was his first choice but he was eclectic hmm then i suppose that would explain it explain what i said with sexual sadists one usually thinks of alcohol or marijuana as the drugs of choice correct something mild enough to take the edge off inhibition but not sufficiently incapacitating to blunt the libido other drugs amphetamines cocaine can foster violence but thats usually more of a paranoid reaction but heroin he shook his head opiates as the great pacifiers take away the necessity to steal in order to obtain heroin and no place would be safer than a city full of addicts ive certainly never heard of a junkie acting out in such a sexually violent manner not while high i said but a heroin addict in need of a fix wouldnt be good company i suppose he scratched an ear even then alex wouldnt the violence be impulsive born of frustration an addict would be interested in the needle not luring and raping and cutting up young girls just garnering the concentration would be difficult wouldnt you say at least thats the way it was years ago when i worked with addicts when was that during my internship i rotated through the federal hospital in lexington where havent you been bert oh lots of places do forgive my rambling alex what do i know about crime youre the expert as i got in the seville he said what i told you before about robin i didnt mean to presume to instruct you how to live your life ive presumed an awful lot today havent i i didnt take it that way bert he sighed im an old man alex most of the time i feel young sometimes i wake up in the morning ready to dash to the lecture hall and take notes then i look in the mirror the life cycle one regresses loses ones sense of propriety forgive me tears welled in the gray eyes theres nothing to forgive youre kind to say that i placed a hand on his shoulder beneath the purple polyester he was soft and frail and small is everything okay bert everything is as it should be he reached up and patted my hand lovely seeing you son dont give up on the case on anything that matters i drove down the hill paused to look through the rearview mirror he remained standing in the driveway waved a tired wave definitely distracted i thought as i drove away and the sudden mood swings the tears a different bert from the buoyant man id known the allusions to senility nothing beyond my age norms as if hed tested himself maybe he had an impressive man afraid he called me son several times i realized that for all his travels and adventures the firsttime mention of being married hed never spoken of having children alone in a house full of toys if i reached his age how would i be living i got home just before dark with a head full of road glare and lungs teeming with smog no numeral blinked on my phone machine but two messages had been left with my service someone wanting to sell me earthquake insurance and a request to call dr allison gwynn a young female voice answered at allisons office hi dr delaware im connie martino dr gwynns psych assistant shes in session right now but she told me to let you know that shed like to speak with you her last patients finished by eight and you can drop by the office if youd like or let me know what works for you eight works for me great ill tell her at sevenforty i set out for santa monica allison gwynns building was on montana avenue just east of the beach citys boutique row a pale onestory lateforties moderne affair with rounded corners and grilled slat windows and apricottinted accent lighting a small patch of daylilies sprouted near the front door bleached white by the night inside were four suites a threewoman obstetricgynecology group a plastic surgeon an endodontist and at the rear a gwynn phd and associates allisons waiting room was empty and smelled of face powder and perfume and the merest nuance of stress the decor was soft chairs and thick wool carpeting and marine prints everything tinted in variants of soft aqua and beige as if someone were trying to bring the beach indoors halogen spots tuned to dim cast a golden white glow the beach at twilight magazines were stacked neatly a trio of red call buttons next to the door listed allisons name above those of two assistants c martino ma and e bracht phd i rang in and a moment later she opened the door her black hair was tied back into a ponytail and she wore an anklelength navy crepe dress above matte brown boots the dress had a scoop neck that dipped just below her collarbone the same meticulously applied makeup same diamond accents at wrist and neck and ears but tension played around the big blue eyes the first time id met her shed maintained steady eye contact now she was focused somewhere over my left shoulder sorry for bringing you all the way here she said but i didnt want to talk over the phone i dont mind being here her eyebrows rose well then come in her inner office was more of the same maritime hues and compassionate lighting the room was large enough for group therapy but set up for individual work with a desk in the corner a sofa and a pair of facing easy chairs she took one of the chairs and i sat down opposite her the navy dress covered most of her but clung to her body and as she positioned herself i saw muscle and curve the sweep of thigh the tug of bosom remembering her history with michael larner i switched mental gears she said this may turn out to be nothing but given the seriousness of what youre doing i thought it best that i tell you she shifted in the chair showed me another aspect of her figure not seductively her mouth was set tight i said i appreciate any help you can give me the edge of her lower lip insinuated itself between her teeth and she chewed her hands flexed she shook her head neither of us spoke two therapists measuring the silence she said i recalled something right after we talked id forgotten about it or maybe it never really registered because at the time im sure its nothing but a short while after willie burns left achievement house maybe a week later i was with him larner and he was angry about willie worked up i know because he called me into his office and his anger was obvious i never really thought about it in terms of willie because i had my own issues she chewed her lip again let me back up undoing her ponytail she shook her hair loose in a sable billow tied it up again tucking her legs under her she hugged herself and studied the carpet larner had been bothering me for a while it began soon after i started volunteering nothing blatant looks smiles little asides about my clothes how cute they were what a nice healthy girl i was hed pass me in the hall and pat me on the head or brush my hip or chuck my chin i knew what was going on but what i didnt realize was just how wrong it was she took hold of her hair smoothed the ends i didnt want to leave achievement house thought it would be a good summer experience and even if id told someone what was he really doing to me insidious i said insidious and devious and altogether creepy i tried to avoid him for the most part it worked but that day it was a monday i remember that because id been to the beach over the weekend had gotten tan willie burns had been gone a good week maybe more i remember asking about willie because with him gone the halls were quiet when he worked hed usually be humming lowkey some kind of bluesy thing he always looked stoned but he did have a good voice and he was friendly would generally look up and smile and say hi friendly to everyone to the kids they seemed to like him though i got the feeling some of them were making fun of him that druggedout demeanor the only time he got furtive was when he was with caroline anyway he was gone and an older woman was doing his job an old latina who didnt speak english i asked people what had happened to willie but no one seemed to know she twisted in her chair cupped one hand over a knee that monday id been delivering charts when larner called me into his office something about new filing procedures that sounded strange why would the director want to talk to a student volunteer about procedure i didnt want to go but i couldnt see any way out if i refused that would be insubordination when i got there larners secretary was out in front and that made me feel better but then she told me to go right in and closed the door after me it was summer and i was wearing a sleeveless white sundress and my tan was pretty blatant and i just knew hed say something about it and started to tell myself i was stupid for not covering up more but larner didnt even look at me he was standing sleeves rolled up a cigar in one hand his back turned on the phone listening i stood near the door he was rocking on his heels and clenching the phone tight he was a big pink disgusting thing and his hands were tight around the receiver mottled like lunch meat then he half turned but he still didnt acknowledge me his face was different from all the other times id seen him in the past hed always smiled leered now he looked furious redfaced hes naturally ruddy but this time he was like a beet i remember the contrast with his hair he had this blondwhite hair that looked as if he waxed it i just stayed there with my back against the door and he barked something into the phone and slammed it down all i caught was willie burnss name then something about wed better do something about it then he hung up she held out one hand thats it i never paid much attention to that because it really wasnt the focus of my memories you had your own issues i said she lowered her head then raised it very slowly her eyes were closed and her face had lost color after he slammed down the phone he began to dial another number then he saw me gave me this surprised look surprised and hateful as if i wasnt supposed to be there then there it was that smile of his but the anger remained on his face also and the combination scared me predatory he came around from behind the desk shook my hand held on too long told me to sit down said something to the effect of hows my favorite volunteer then he walked behind me and just stood there not talking or moving i could smell his cigar the smoke kept wafting toward me to this day i cant see a cigar without she sprang up strode to her own desk and sat down putting wood and space between us he started talking softly in a singsong how did i like working at achievement house was i finding satisfaction had i thought about career choices maybe teaching would be good for me because i was clearly a people person i didnt say much he really didnt want answers it was a monologue droning hypnotic then he stopped talking and i tensed up and he said dont be nervous allison were all friends here nothing happened for what seemed to be forever then suddenly i felt his finger on my cheek pressing stroking and he said something about my skin how clean and fresh it was how nice it was to see a young lady who cared about her hygiene she caught hold of her hair with one hand and tugged hard then both hands slapped flat on the desk and she was staring at me daring me to look away he kept stroking she said it was annoying ticklish and i twisted my head away and then he chuckled and i looked up and i saw that it hadnt been his finger on my cheek it was his thing oh listen to me like a child it was his penis and he was rubbing it against my cheek pushing i was so freaked out that my mouth dropped open and that was the worst thing to do because he chuckled again and in it went and all of a sudden he was holding the back of my head with his other hand the hand with the cigar and the smoke wrapped around me and he forced himself deeper into my mouth and i couldnt breathe i was gagging but my eyes were open for some reason i kept them open and i could see his white shirt and his tie a striped tie blue and black and the bottom of his face all that pink flab quivering his double chin and he was rocking on his heels again but in a different way and the cigar smoke was burning my eyes and i started to cry she turned icy and still didnt move for a long time he didnt come thank god for that i managed to wrench free first made it to the door ran out never looked back drove home like a zombie called in sick which wasnt much of a stretch because i felt sick as a dog for the next few days i took to bed threw up when my mother wasnt listening lay there feeling degraded and scared and worst of all stupid replaying it over and over blaming myself for the tan and the dress and not being on guard i know its never the victims fault god knows how many times ive told that to patients but you were seventeen i said im not sure id have handled it better or felt differently had i been twentyseven not at the level of consciousness twenty years ago she slumped loosened her hair again fooled with it flicked something away from the corner of one eye the worst part was how alone i felt abandoned with no one in my corner i couldnt tell my parents because i was too humiliated i told larry daschoff a sanitized version because even though larry had been my mentor for the summer and hed been kind and helpful he was a man and i couldnt get rid of the feeling that i was to blame so i just kept calling in sick to achievement house told my mother i had some kind of flu stayed holed up in my room obsessing about what had happened dreaming about it in the dreams it was worse in the dreams i didnt get away and larner came in my mouth and then he hit me and raped me and forced me to smoke the cigar finally i realized i was falling apart was wasting i needed to do something so i found out the name of the schools chairman of the board some downtown lawyer preston something and after agonizing about it for a whole week i called his office got through after several attempts and told him what had happened only i didnt really tell him i softpedaled it reduced it to grabbing the same story i told larry larry had told me mashing and groping howd preston react i said he listened didnt say anything at all at first didnt ask any questions which really upset me i got the impression he thought i was crazy finally he said hed get back to me two days later a letter of dismissal arrived in the mail i was being let go for poor work habits and excessive absenteeism i never showed the letter to my parents just told them id quit because the job wasnt challenging they didnt care my mother wanted me to swim at the club and play tennis and meet guys what she wasnt happy about was that i just wanted to hang around the house and not be social so she arranged a family cruise to alaska big luxury liner cruising past the glaciers baby otters nursing amid the ice floes all that blue ice wasnt as cold as my heart was that summer she stood returned to the easy chair tried to look comfortable but couldnt pull it off ive never told anyone what really happened not until now but this was the wrong time and place wasnt it using a stranger im sorry nothing to be sorry for allison all these years she said and it still eats at me not going after that piece of dirt who knows how many others hes done that to what i couldve prevented it wouldve been his word against yours and he was in power i said it wasnt your fault then and its not your fault now do you know how many women ive treated how many patients ive helped deal with exactly this kind of thing not because i pursue those kinds of cases not because im using my patients to work through my own garbage because its so damned common ive helped my patients but then when it comes to my own garbage i repress its crazy dont you think no i said its human ive preached the virtues of talking it out but when it comes to my own stuff i usually go it alone do you i nodded and youre going through something now arent you i stared at her your eyes are sad she said im going through a bit of something i said well then she said i guess were kindred spirits and i guess well leave it at that she walked me to the waiting room door like i told you the first time youre just too good a listener sir occupational hazard was it helpful telling you that larner was angry about willie burns yes i said thanks very much i know it was an ordeal she smiled not an ordeal an experience what youre going through it has nothing to do with caroline cossack or willie burns does it i shook my head sorry she said no more prying she reached for the doorknob and her shoulder brushed my arm the contact sent something electrical down my arm suddenly i was rockhard fighting to keep my breathing even to keep my hands off her she stared at me no tension around the huge blue eyes just softness sadness maybe desire it wasnt an ordeal she said you said the right thing heres another confession i was looking forward to seeing you again me too i said i smiled and shrugged and she did the same gracious mimickry you too but she said that bit of something right i nodded well maybe in another galaxy alex youre very sweet good luck good luck to you too she held the door open kept it open as i walked down the hall chapter milo woke up early the next morning with the faces of the men at the sangre de leon meeting leering in his head thinking too many ways to take it not enough of me to go around he stumbled to the shower shaved picked clothes randomly got the coffee machine going looked at the clock seventhirteen an emergency call had yanked rick out of bed three hours ago milo had watched in the darkness as rick slipped into the scrubs he kept neatly folded on a bedroom chair picked up his porsche keys from the nightstand and padded out the door rick stopped returned to the bed kissed milo lightly on the forehead milo pretended to be sleeping because he didnt feel like talking not even goodbye the two of them had talked plenty all night sitting up late at the kitchen table mostly milo had blabbed and rick had listened maintaining a superficial calm but milo knew he was shaken by the paris bartlett encounter and the hiv rumor all these years and milos work had never intruded on their personal life milo reassured him and rick nodded complained of crushing fatigue and fell asleep the moment his head hit the pillow milo cleaned up the chinese takeout cartons and the dinner dishes and slipped into bed beside him lying there for an hour or so listening to ricks even breathing thinking the cossacks walt obey larner junior germ bacilla diamond jim horne plus the player who hadnt shown up he saw that face clearly a stoic ebony mask smiley bartlett the personnel inquiry and the hiv rumor said john g broussards hand was in all of it he recalled broussard smelled broussards citrus cologne in the interview room twenty years ago the handstitched suit all that confidence taking charge he and his pink pal poulsenn milo had no idea what had happened to his career but look how far john g had come a white man and a black man teamed up and the black man had been the dominant partner a black man advancing that quickly back in lapds bad old racist days that had to mean broussard had harpoons in all the right whales had probably used his ia dirt to build up leverage mr straight and narrow and hed covered up janie ingalls and lord knew what else milo had been part of it allowed himself to be swept along pretended he could forget about it now he wondered what that had done to his soul he poured coffee but the muddy brew tasted like battery acid and he spit it out and gulped a glass of tap water the light through the kitchen window was the yellowgray of old phlegm he sat down kept thinking about broussard a south central guy whod ended up in hancock park neighbor to walt obey every police chief before broussard had lived in his own house but john g had convinced the mayor to give him an empty mansion on irving street rentfree the threestory edifice donated to the city years ago by the heirs of a longdead oil tycoon was twelve thousand square feet of english tudor with big lawns a pool and a tennis court milo knew because hed done security years ago at a party for an ambassador the envoy from some small asian state that had since changed its name set aside originally as a mayors residence the irving house had sat dormant for years because the mayors predecessor had his own place in brentwood and the current mayors even larger spread in pacific palisades was just fine too john g broussards crib prior to his promotion had been a toosmall affair in ladera heights and john g claimed he needed to be closer to headquarters ladera heights was a half hour ride downtown the mansion on irving was fifteen minutes up sixth street the mayors drive from the westside could stretch to over an hour but no one saw the inconsistency in john gs logic and the new chief got himself baronial lodgings irving street less than a mile from walt obeys estate on muirfield obey was one of the mayors big donors had supported broussard for chief over three other candidates the mayor and obey obey and broussard obey and a bunch of lowlifes supping nouvellewhatever cuisine in a private room at sangre de leon private enterprise and municipal government and the long arm of the law arm in arm and schwinn had thrown him right into it he left his house looking in all directions and over his shoulder got into the rented taurus and drove north iding the asshole who claimed to be paris bartlett shouldnt have been a problem if his hunch about a department plant was true just head over to the police academy in elysian park and thumb through the face books but that was too conspicuous for all he knew it was his sneaky little trips to parker center and back to his west la desk that had sicced the department on him in the first place besides bartlett was a minor player just a messenger and did it really matter whod sent him stay healthy maybe he should return to ojai and nose around a bit more up there but what more could he learn schwinn was the ojai link and he was gone falling off a goddamn horse he pulled over to the curb yanked out his cell phone got the number of the ventura county morgue using an insuranceinvestigator lie he spent the next half hour being bounced from desk to desk trying to get the full facts on schwinns death finally a coroners assistant who knew something got on the line the death was written up just as marge schwinn had described massive head injuries and fractured ribs consistent with a fall copious blood on a nearby rock ruled accidental no suspicious circumstances no dope or booze in schwinns system or the horses the clerk added an equine drug scan seemed thorough and milo told the ca so special request of the widow said the guy a middleagedsounding guy named olivas she wanted the horse tested and was willing to pay for it she suspect something all it says here is that she requested a full drug scan on akhbar thats the horse we had a vet in santa barbara do it and she sent us the results mrs schwinn got the bill so the horse was clean said milo as a whistle said olivas it busted itself up plenty though two broken legs and a torsion injury of the neck when the widow got there it was down on the ground moaning pretty much out of it she had it put down whats up the insurance company has problems with something no just checking it was an accident he was an old guy said olivas riding a horse at his age what was he thinking president reagan rode when he was in his eighties yeah well he had secret service guys to look after him its like old people driving cars my dads eightynine blind as a bat at night but he insists on getting behind the wheel and driving to la to get authentic menudo that kind of thing and idiots on cell phones give me a break youd see what i see comes in here every day youd be scared im scared said milo hefting his phone pays to be scared he craved caffeine and cholesterol drove to farmers market at fairfax and third and had a green chili omelet and two stacks of toast at dupars keeping his eye on a homeless guy in the next booth the bum wore three jackets and hugged a battered stringless guitar the instrument made milo think about robin but the psychosis in the homeless guys eyes pulled him into the here and now they engaged in a staring contest until the homeless man finally threw down a couple of dollars and waddled off mumbling at unseen demons and milo was able to enjoy his eggs once again he thought ive brought peace and light to the world but then the waitress smiled with relief and gave him a thumbsup and he realized hed really accomplished something still hungry he ordered a stack of hotcakes drained everything down with black coffee walked around the market dodging tourists figuring the distraction might get his brain in gear but it didnt and after inspecting produce stands full of fruit he didnt recognize and buying a bag of jumbo cashews he left the market drove south on fairfax turned left on sixth at the old may company building now an adjunct of the art museum and kept going east chief john g broussards official residence was beautifully tended with grass as green as ireland and more flower beds than milo remembered from that diplomatic party a flagpole had been erected smack in the middle of the lawn and the stars and stripes and the california bear swooshed in the midday breeze no walls or fences or uniformed officer on patrol but the driveway had been gated with wrought iron and through the stout bars milo saw a blackandwhite cruiser and behind that a latemodel white cadillac the caddy was probably mrs broussards wheels he recalled her as a trim pretty woman with hennatinted coldwaved hair and the resigned look of a political spouse what was her name bernadette bernadine did she and john g have kids milod never heard of any and he realized how little he knew about the chiefs personal life how little the chief doled out seven blocks west and a half mile south was walt obeys address on muirfield the billionaires nest sat at the end of the road where muirfield terminated on the southern border of the wilshire country club no house in sight just tenfoot stone walls broken by an opaque black steel gate studded with enormous bolts closed circuit tv camera on one post the implication was a grand place on multiple acres and milo flashed to baron loetzs spread neighbor to the cossack party house did obey spend time on his veranda sipping gin and enjoying what god had given him eighty years old and still taking meetings with hustlers like the cossacks some big deal on the verge he found himself staring at obeys gate the tv camera remained immobile the place was close enough for an athletic guy like john g to jog over obey and broussard on the veranda making plans running things all of a sudden milo felt very small and vulnerable he rolled down the window heard birds peeping a plink of running water behind obeys walls then the camera began to rotate an automatic circuit or maybe his presence had attracted attention he backed up halfway down the block whipped a uturn and got the hell out of there a few minutes later he was parked on mccadden near wilshire cell phone hot against his ear more dmv finagling gave him other addresses and he had a look at all of them michael larner lived in a highrise condo just east of westwood in the wilshire corridor pink stone and cheesylooking brick doorman out in front an oversize fountain son bradleys santa monica canyon place turned out to be a smallish blue frame house with stupendous ocean views and a for rent sign out in front no cars in the driveway and the gardening looked a little lax so brad was living somewhere else garvey cossack junior and brother bob bunked together at a carolwood address in holmby hills not far geographically from alexs place off beverly glen but a whole different world financially carolwood was a lovely hilly block leafy and sinuous shaded by oldgrowth trees one of the highestpriced stretches in la most of the houses were architectural masterpieces landscaped like botanical gardens many of them cosseted by greenery and bearing that classy look that only came from durability the cossack brothers pad was an exceedingly vulgar bluetileroofed and monstrously gabled heap of gray limestone perched atop a scarred dirt hill with no grass or trees in sight stone facing only the sides were lumpy stucco bad trowel job cheaplooking white metal fencing and an electric gate partitioned the front of the property from the street but without benefit of vegetation the house sat in full view baking in the sun puffy flanks glaring white in spots a doublesized dumpster overflowing with trash advertised ongoing construction but no workers were in sight drapes covered the windows and a mini car museum took up the rest of the massive driveway plumcolored rolls royce corniche black humvee with blackedout windows red what else ferrari that came as close as milo had seen to a penis on wheels a taxi yellow pantera a pair of dodge vipers one white with a blue center stripe the other anthracite gray striped orange and a white corvette convertible all under a drooping makeshift canvas awning that stretched across listing metal stilts off to the side in the full sun was a tenyearold honda that had to be the maids wheels big house and all those cars but no landscaping just the kind of eyesore a couple of teenagers would put together if they tumbled into endless cash and milo was willing to bet the cossacks had six figures worth of stereo equipment inside along with a stateoftheart screening room a pub a game room or two he was starting to think of them as a dual case of profound arrested development the house was exactly the kind of eyesore that would provoke neighbor complaints in a bluechip district meaning now he had something to look for he drove downtown to the hall of records made it through the traffic by pm and combed through the zoningboard complaint files sure enough three gripes had been lodged against the cossacks all by carolwood residents irritated about noise and dirt and other indignities caused by protracted construction all dismissed for lack of cause he moved over to the property files ran searches on the cossacks walt obey both larners john g broussard obeys holdings were protected by a cadre of holding companies a firewall that would take weeks if not months to break through same for the larners and the cossacks although a few pieces of real estate were held privately by each duo in the case of the larners it was half a dozen condos in a marina del rey building owned jointly by father and son sixteen strip malls in lowrent exurbs were registered to the cossack brothers the boys living together working together how touching nothing was registered to sister caroline shifting gears for a moment he pulled up georgie nemerovs records the bail bondsman and his mother coowned a singlefamily dwelling in van nuys that milo recognized as the family home from twenty years ago and a sixunit apartment in granada hills also jointly registered to ivana nemerov whatever georgie had or hadnt done building a real estate empire didnt seem part of the equation john g broussard and his wife bernadelle had held on to the house in ladera heights as well as three contiguous lots on west th street in watts maybe the chiefs or his wifes parents place an inheritance once again no empire if john g was trading for something it wasnt land unless he was embedded somewhere in walt obeys corporate acreage he ran searches on melinda waters and mother eileen and came up empty was thinking about what else to do when the records clerk came over and told him the building was closing he left and drove up and down temple street past the place where pierce schwinn had spotted tonya stumpf strutting the block was a music center parking lot now filled with its daytime load of municipal workers and litigants vehicles due to the court building down the street lots of people lots of movement but milo felt out of it out of the rhythm he drove toward home slowly not caring about rushhour toxins streetwork delays notably stupid driving by what seemed to be fifty percent of his fellow commuters all the urban niceties that usually drove up his blood pressure and made him wonder why the hell hed chosen to live like this he was sitting at a red light at highland when his phone rang alexs voice said i got you good whats up maybe nothing but my source the woman michael larner molested called me again and i met with her last night seems the day larner made his move on her he was angry about willie burns enraged talking to someone about burns willie had been gone from achievement house for a few days so it sounds like larner found out who burns was was steamed because burns disappeared enraged said milo thats how she describes it she walked into his office just as he got off the phone said larner was flushed and agitated then he composed himself and turned his attention to her which could be more than a coincidence harassers and rapists often get stoked by anger anyway its probably no big deal but it does fit with our working hypothesis the cossack family contracted larner to hide caroline until janie ingallss murder cooled down burns made contact with caroline then split and the family panicked but they never found him he even managed to slip away after his dope arrest because boris nemerov bailed him out immediately four months later he ambushed nemerov interesting said milo good work he summarized what hed seen at sangre de leon last night big money said alex same old story one more thing when i was looking for melinda waters on the internet i got a few hits but dismissed them then i realized maybe id been too hasty about one in particular an attorney in santa fe new mexico specializing in bankruptcy and evictions id been thinking about melinda as a stonedout truant didnt see a pathway from that to a legal career but your comment about her turning up with a family and picket fence got me thinking so i pulled up her website again and checked her bio shes thirtyeight years old which would be exactly our melindas age and she didnt graduate college until she was thirtyone law school till thirtyfour before that she worked as a paralegal for three years but her résumé still leaves the years between eighteen and twentyeight unaccounted for which would mesh with someone going through changes pulling her life together and get this she was schooled in california san francisco state for undergrad hastings for law hastings is a top school said milo bowie ingalls described melinda as a loser bowie ingalls was not a sterling judge and people change if i didnt believe that id choose another profession bankruptcy and eviction i guess anythings possible maybe shes not our gal but dont you think its worth looking into anything else interesting in her bio no married two kids do they have picket fences in santa fe not that hard to find out its a ninetyminute flight to albuquerque another hour by car to santa fe and southwest airlines has cheap flights calling her on the phone would be too easy said milo if shes trying to put her past behind her she may lie theres a flight at sevenfortyfive tomorrow morning i booked two seats manipulative im proud of you its cold there said alex twenty to forty fahrenheit some snow on the ground so bundle up chapter by sevenfifteen milo and i were at the back of a long queue at the southwest airlines gate the terminal was ellis island minus the overcoats weary posture worried eyes languagesoup thought we had our seats he said eyeing the front of the line we have electronic tickets i said southwests system is you wait for your seat assignment they board in groups give you little plastic number tags great ill take half a dozen bagels a rye sliced thin and two onion rolls the flight was booked full and cramped but amiable populated by seasoned mostly easygoing passengers and flight attendants who fancied themselves standup comedians we arrived early on a tarmac specked with snow and turned our watches ahead one hour sunport airport was lowprofile and blessedly quiet done up in earth tones turquoise and mock adobe and riddled with talismanic hints of a decimated indian culture we picked up a ford escort at the budget desk and i drove north on highway toward santa fe feeling the wind buffet the tiny car snow clean white fluff was banked up along the side of the road but the asphalt was plowed clear and the sky was bluer and bigger than id ever imagined and when i opened the window to test the air i got a faceful of pure sweet chill nice i said milo grunted city sprawl fastfood franchises and indian casinos gave way soon enough to long low vistas of desert bounded by the purplish tips of the sangre de cristo mountains and that vast sky that just seemed to grow bigger gorgeous i said hey look at this said milo seventyfivemileanhour speed limit put some weight on that pedal as we neared santa fe the highway climbed and the altitude registers increased steadily to seven thousand feet i was speeding across the highest of deserts no cactus or sandy desolation the mountains were green where the snow had melted and so were the lowlands bearded by windhardy droughttolerant piñon trees ancient and ragged and low to the ground darwinian victors and the occasional vertical statement of barebranch aspens millions of trees tipped with white not a cloud in the sky i wondered if melinda waters attorneyatlaw had woken up thinking this was going to be a great day would we be a petty annoyance or an intrusion shed never forget i took the saint francis exit to cerrilos road and continued through the southern part of santa fe which seemed not much different from any other small city with shopping centers and auto dealers and gas stations and the type of businesses that hug highways melinda waterss office was listed on a street called paseo de peralta and my reading of the map id grabbed at the rental counter put that right off cerrilos but the address numerals didnt check out and i followed the signs north to city center and the plaza and suddenly we were in a different world narrow winding streets some of them cobbled forced me to reduce my speed as i rolled past diamondbright onestory adobe and spanish colonial buildings plastered in sienna and peach and dun and gold pools of melting ice glistened like opals the luxuriant trees that lined the road had managed to shrug off all but reminiscent flecks of snow and through their branches streamed the skys blue smile different businesses filled the north side art galleries sculpture and glass studios gourmet cookware emporia purveyors of fine foods highfashion clothing and handhewn furniture custom picture framers cafés and restaurants never tainted by corporate logos abounded promising everything from southwestern to sushi suvs were the steeds of choice and sinuous happy people in jeans and suede and boots that had never known the kiss of manure crowded the sidewalks we reached the central plaza a square of treeshaded green set up with a bandstand and surrounded by lowrise shops drove past a covered breezeway where a couple of dozen downparkaed indians sat behind blankets of silver jewelry near the palace of the governors across the square was a massive blocky structure of fieldstone that seemed more european than american more restaurants and galleries a couple of luxury hotels and suddenly paseo de peralta had disappeared very pretty said milo but youre going in circles at washington avenue in the shadow of a salmon pink scottish rite temple i spotted a whitehaired couple in matched shearling jackets walking an english sheep dog that couldve supplied the garments linings and asked directions the man wore a plaid cap and the womans hair was long and braided and gray and set off by silver butterflies she wore the kind of makeup meant to convey no makeup at all had crinkly eyes and a ready smile when i showed her the address she chuckled you want the northern part of paseo de peralta it horseshoes at the plaza herb wheres this address exactly the man shared her mirth at least id made someone happy right there my friend just up the block melinda waterss law office occupied one of eight suites in a sandcolored adobe building that abutted an italian taverna the restaurants chimney billowed storybook puffs of smoke and cooking smells that got my salivary glands going then i thought about what lay ahead and my appetites shifted the units faced a large open parking lot backed by a high berm and an opaque stand of trees as if the property the town itself terminated at a forest we parked and got out the air was frigid and perfect each office had its own entrance a wooden post hung with shingles served as a directory four other lawyers a psychotherapist a practitioner of therapeutic massage an antiquarian book dealer a print gallery how far was ojai melinda waterss door was unlocked and her front room smelled of incense big rustandwinecolored chenille chairs with fringed pillows were arranged around a battered old blackwood chinese table atop the table were art books magazines that worshipped style a brass bowl full of hard candy and straw baskets of potpourri would any of that ease the pain of bankruptcy and eviction blocking the rear door a roundfaced indian woman of thirty or so sat behind a weathered oak desk and pecked at a slate gray laptop she wore a pink sweatshirt and big dangling earrings geometric and hardedged and gold more new york than new mexico as we approached her desk she looked up without conveying much in the way of emotion and continued typing how can i help you is ms waters in do you have an appointment no maam said milo producing his card la said the receptionist the police youve come all that way to talk to mel yes maam her eyes scanned the card homicide no surprise no inflection at all she reached for the phone melinda waters was fivefive curvy and chunky and busty in a tailored moss green pantsuit turned greener by the wall of maroonbound law books behind her her eyes were a lighter green edged with gray and her hair was honey blond cut short and swept back from a wellformed face softened by full lips and the beginnings of a double chin big round tortoiseshell eyeglasses were perfectly proportioned for the thin straight nose upon which they rested her lips were glossed her manicure was impressive and the diamond ring on her finger looked to be two carats minimum she barely looked at us gave off an air of bored competence but seemed to be working at that the moment i saw her my heart jumped same face as in the hollywood high yearbook milo knew it too his expression was pleasant but cherrysized lumps had formed where his jaw met his sideburns melinda waters stared at his card and waved us into two canebacked chairs that faced her desk her private office was rustcolored and small tiny really with barely enough room for the bookcase and the desk and a red lacquer stand off to one side set with a single white orchid in a blueandwhite pot the walls perpendicular to the books were hung with watercolor landscapes green hills above the ocean live oaks fields of poppies california dreaming the rest of the space bore family photos melinda waters with a slim tall darkbearded man and two mischievouslooking boys around six and eight skiing scuba diving horseback riding fishing the family that plays together homicide detectives well this is certainly different soft voice edged with sarcasm under normal circumstances she was probably the image of professionalism but a quaver at the tail end said she wasnt pretending this was routine different from what maam said milo from what i thought id be doing right before lunch frankly im confused im not working on any la cases at all let alone homicide i specialize in tenants rights and financial janie ingalls said milo melinda waterss sigh stretched for a very long time she fiddled with papers and pens closed her laptop tamped her hair finally she punched an intercom button on her phone and said hold my calls please inez wheeling her chair back the few inches that remained between her and the law book backdrop she said thats a name from a long time ago what happened to her you dont know well she said your card says homicide so am i safe in assuming very safe melinda waters removed her glasses made a fist knuckled one eye the glossy lips trembled oh damn i suppose i knew it all along but i didnt really damn poor janie that is so obscene very said milo she sat up straighter as if drawing upon a reserve of strength now her eyes were different searching analytical and youre here after all this time because because it remains an open case ms waters open or reopened it was never closed officially youre not saying the la police have been working on this for twenty years does that matter maam no i suppose not im rambling this is really this takes me by total surprise why are you here because you were one of the last people to see janie ingalls alive but no one ever took your statement in fact it was only recently we learned you hadnt been a victim yourself a victim you thought oh my youve been hard to locate ms waters so has your mother my mother died ten years ago she said lung cancer back in pennsylvania where she was from before that she had emphysema she suffered a lot sorry to hear that so was i said waters she picked a gold pen from several resting in a cloisonné cup balanced it between the index fingers of both hands the office was a jewel box everything arranged with care all this time you really thought i might be how strange weak smile so im reborn huh the pen dropped and clattered to the desk she snatched it up placed it back in the cup maam could you please tell us everything you remember about that night i did try to find out where janie was called her father youve met him hes dead too maam howd he die car accident driving drunk yes no surprise there said waters what a lowlife always plastered he couldnt stand me and the feeling was mutual probably because i knew hed grope me if he had a chance so i never gave him one always made sure to meet janie outside her building he came on to you said milo i never gave him a chance but his intentions were obvious leering undressing me mentally plus i knew what hed done to janie he abused janie sexually only when he was drunk said waters in mocking singsong she never told me until shortly before she was before i last saw her i think what made her talk about it was shed had a bad experience a month or so before that she was hitching got picked up by some deviant who took her to a hotel downtown tied her up had his way with her when she first told me about it she didnt seem very upset kind of blasé really and at first i didnt believe her because janie was always making things up then she pulled up her jeans and her top and showed me the rope marks where hed tied up her ankles and her wrists her neck too when i saw that i said jesus he couldve strangled you and she just clammed up and refused to say any more about it what did she tell you about the man who did this that he was young and nicelooking and drove a great car thats why she said she went with him but to tell the truth she probably wouldve gone with anyone a lot of the time janie was out of it stoned or drunk she didnt have much in the way of inhibitions she removed her glasses played with the sidepieces glanced at the photos of her family some lawyer i am running my mouth before we go any further i need your assurance that anything i tell you be kept confidential my husbands a semipublic figure what does he do jims an aide to the governor liaison to the highway department i keep my maiden name for work but anything unsavory could still be traced back to him ill do my best maam waters shook her head thats not good enough she stood im afraid this meeting is adjourned milo crossed his legs ms waters all we came here for are your recollections about janie ingalls no assumption was made of any criminal involvement on your part you bet your boots no assumption was made waters jabbed a finger that didnt even cross my mind for gods sake but what happened to janie twenty years ago isnt my problem safeguarding my privacy is please leave ms waters you know as well as i do that i cant guarantee confidentiality thats the das authority im being honest and id appreciate the same from you if youve done nothing wrong you have nothing to worry about and refusing to cooperate wont shield your husband if i wanted to complicate his life all id have to do is talk to my boss and hed make a call and he showed her his palms waters slapped her hands on her hips her stare was cold and steady why are you doing this in order to find out who murdered janie ingalls youre right about one thing it was obscene she was tortured burned with cigarettes mutilat no no no none of that shock treatment give me some credit milos palms pressed together this has become needlessly adversarial ms waters just tell me what you know and ill do my utmost to keep you out of it thats the best i can offer the alternative means a bit more overtime for me and a lot more complication for you you have no jurisdiction in new mexico said melinda waters technically youre trespassing technically youre still a material witness and last time i checked new mexico had diplomatic relations with california waters looked at her family again sat back down put her glasses back on mumbled shit the three of us sat in silence for a full minute before she said this isnt fair im not proud of the kind of kid i was back then and id like to forget it i said weve all been teenagers well i was a rotten teenager a total screwup and a stoner just like janie thats what drew us together bad behavior jesus i dont think a day went by when we werent getting loaded and other things that give me a migraine when i think about them but i pulled myself out of it in fact the process started the day after janie and i split up at the party said milo waters grabbed for another pen changed her mind played with a drawerpull lifting the brass and letting it drop once twice three times she said ive got kids of my own now i set limits am probably too strict because i know whats out there in ten years i havent touched anything stronger than chardonnay i love my husband hes going places my practice is rewarding i dont see why any of that should be derailed because of mistakes i made twenty years ago neither do i said milo im not taking notes and none of that goes in any file i just want to know what happened to janie ingalls that friday night and anything else you can tell me about the man who raped her downtown i told you everything i know about him young and nicelooking with a nice car the car couldve been janies fantasy how young she didnt say race i assume he was white because janie didnt say he wasnt and she wouldve she was a bit of a racist got it from her father any other physical description no a fancy car said milo what kind i think she said a jaguar but i cant be sure with fur rugs i do remember that because janie talked about how her feet sank into the rug but with janie who knows im trying to tell you she was always fantasizing about what mostly about getting loaded and partying with rock stars that ever happen she laughed not hardly janie was a sad little girl from the wrong part of hollywood a young guy with a jaguar said milo what else thats all i know said waters really which hotel did he take her to she just said it was downtown in an area full of bums she also said the guy seemed to know the place the desk clerk tossed him a key the moment he walked in but she didnt think he was actually staying there because the room he took her to didnt look lived in he wasnt keeping any clothes there and the bed wasnt even covered just a mattress and rope hed put the rope in a dresser drawer she didnt try to escape when she saw that waters shook her head he gave her a joint on the ride over a huge one highgrade maybe laced with hash because she was really floating and thats what hash usually did to her she told me the whole experience was like watching someone else even when he pushed her down on the bed and started tying her up her arms and legs and her neck thats where the marks were what happened next anger flashed behind waterss eyeglass lenses what do you think he did his thing with her used every orifice she said that in cruder terms the gray in her eyes had deepened as if an internal light had been dampened she said she knew what he was doing but didnt even feel it and she was blasé about it at first she was later a few days later she got loaded on southern comfort and started talking about it again not crying angry at herself do you know what really bugged her not so much what he did to her she was out of it during the whole thing what made her mad was that when he was finished he didnt drive her all the way back home just dropped her off in east hollywood and she had to walk a couple of miles that ticked her off but even there she blamed herself said something along the lines of it must be something about me makes people treat me like that even him i said whos him and she got this really furious look on her face and said him bowie that freaked me out first the deviant now incest i asked her how long that had been going on but she clammed up again i kept nagging her to tell me and finally she told me to shut up or shed tell my mother what a slut i was she laughed which was a viable threat i was no poster child for wholesome living and even though my mother was no betty crocker she wasnt like bowie she wouldve cared she wouldve come down on me hard bowie didnt care said milo bowie was scum total lowlife i guess that explains why janie would do anything to avoid going home i thought of the bareness of janies room said did she have a crash pad or somewhere else she stayed nowhere permanent shed sleep at my house crash once in a while in those abandoned apartments north of hollywood boulevard sometimes shed be gone for days and wouldnt tell me where shed been still the day after the party after janie and i had split up i called bowie i despised the ground that lowlife walked on but even so i wanted to know janie was okay thats what i was trying to tell you i made an attempt but no one answered when did you split up soon after we got there i cared about janie we were both so screwed up that was our bond i guess i had a bad feeling about the party about her just disappearing in the middle of all that commotion i never really forgot about her years later when i was in college and learned how to use a computer i tried to find her then after i got to law school and had access to legal databases i tapped into all kinds of municipal records california and the neighboring states property rolls tax files death notices but she was nowhere she picked up milos card la homicide means she was murdered in la so why wasnt an la death notice ever filed good question maam oh said waters she sat back this is more than a reopened case isnt it something got really screwed up milo shrugged great wonderful this is going to suck me in and screw me up no matter what i do isnt it ill do my best to prevent that maam you sound almost sincere she rubbed her forehead took a bottle of advil out of a desk drawer extricated a tablet and swallowed it dry what else do you want from me the party said milo howd you and janie hear about it for starters just street talk kids talking there was always plenty of that especially as the weekend approached everyone trying to figure out the best way to party hearty so many of us hated our homes would do anything to be away janie and i were a twosome partywise sometimes wed end up at squatraves promoters sneaking into an abandoned building or using an outdoors spot some remote corner of griffith park or hansen dam were talking bare minimum in terms of entertainment some tonedeaf band playing for free cheap munchies lots of drugs mostly lots of drugs because the promoters were really dealers and their main goal was bulk sales other times though it would turn out to be a real party in someones house an open invitation or even if it wasnt there was usually no problem crashing she smiled occasionally we got bounced but a girl could almost always crash and get away with it the party that night was one of those said milo someones house someones big house a mansion and the talk on the street was mucho drugs janie and i figured wed check it out to us a trip to bel air was like blasting off to a different planet janie was going on and on about partying with rich kids maybe finding a rich boyfriend whod give her all the dope she wanted as i said she loved to fantasize the truth is we were both such losers no wheels no money so we did what we always did hitched we didnt even have the address guessed once we got to bel air wed figure it out i picked janie up at her place friday afternoon and we hung out on hollywood boulevard most of the day playing arcade games shoplifting cosmetics panhandling for spare change but we didnt get much after dark we walked back down to sunset where the best hitching was but the first corner we tried was near some hookers and they threatened to cut our asses so we moved west between la brea and fairfax where all the guitar stores are i remember that because while we waited for a ride we were looking at guitars in windows and saying how cool it would be if we started a girl band and got rich no matter that neither of us had a lick of talent anyway finally we mustve have been waiting there over an hour we got picked up what time said milo mustve been nine ten who picked you up a college student nerdy type said he went to caltech but he was heading to the u because he had a date with a girl there and that was really close to bel air he had to tell us that because we had no idea i dont think either of us had ever been west of la cienega unless we were taking the bus straight to the beach or in my case when i visited my father at the navy base in point mugu the nerd was a nice guy shy probably picked us up on impulse and regretted it because we immediately started hassling him turning the radio to our station blasting it loud teasing him flirting asking him if he wanted to come to the party with us instead of some lame date with a college girl being real obnoxious he got embarrassed and that cracked us up also we were hoping he might take us all the way to the party because we still had no idea where it was so we kept nagging him but he said no he liked his girlfriend i remember janie getting really rude about that saying something to the effect of shes probably colder than ice i can give you something she cant that was the wrong thing to say he stopped the car at stone canyon and sunset and ordered us out i started to but janie held me back started ragging on him to take us to the house and that just made him angrier janie was like that she could be extremely pushy had a real talent for getting on peoples nerves the nerd started shouting and shoved janie and we got out and she flipped him off as he drove away stone canyon and sunset close to the party we didnt know that we were ignorant and drunk back on the boulevard wed also boosted a bottle of southern comfort had guzzled our way through most of it i hated the stuff to me it tasted like peaches and cough syrup but janie loved it it was her favorite high she said it was what janis joplin had been into and she was into janis joplin because she had some idea that her mom had been like janis joplin back in the hippie days that shed named janie after janis another fantasy i said she nodded she needed them her mom abandoned her ran away with a black guy when janie was five or six and janie never saw her again maybe thats another reason janie always made racist comments milo said whatd the two of you do after you were dropped off started walking up stone canyon and promptly got lost there were no sidewalks and the lighting was very bad and no one was around to ask directions all those incredible properties and not a soul in sight none of the noises you hear in a real neighborhood it was spooky but we were having fun with it an adventure once we saw a bel air patrol car driving our way so we hid behind some trees she frowned complete idiocy thank god my boys arent hearing this howd you find the party we walked in circles for a while finally ended up right where we started back at sunset and thats when the second car picked us up a cadillac turning onto stone canyon the driver was a black guy and i was sure janie wouldnt want to get in with her it was always nigger this nigger that but when the guy rolled down the window and shot us this big grin and said you girls looking to party janie was the first one in what do you remember about the driver early twenties tall thin for some reason when i think of him i always think of jimi hendrix not that he was hendrixs spitting image but there was a general resemblance he had that rangy mellow thing going on loose and confident played his music really loud and moving his head in time a cadillac said milo and a newer one but not a pimpmobile big conservative sedan well taken care of too shiny freshsmelling sweetsmelling lilacs like it belonged to an old woman i remember thinking that wondering if hed stolen it from an old woman because he sure didnt match the car dressed the way he was in this ugly denim suit with rhinestones all over it all these gold chains what color something pale milo opened his briefcase removed willie burnss mug shot handed it across the desk melinda waterss eyes got big thats him hes the one who killed janie hes someone were looking for hes still out there maybe maybe what does that mean its been twenty years and he was a heroin addict youre saying hed have a poor life expectancy she said but youre still looking for him why has janies murder been reopened whats the real reason i was the original detective on the case said milo i got transferred off now ive been transferred back on transferred back on by your department or you requested it yourself said waters does it matter maam she smiled its personal isnt it youre trying to undo your own past milo smiled back and waters returned the mug shot wilbert burns so now i have a name he never introduced himself he called himself our new friend i knew he was a junkie as well as a dealer from how spacey he was slurring his words driving really slow his music was junkie music slow jazz this really draggy trumpet janie tried to change the station but he put his hand on hers and she didnt try again howd you know he was a dealer said milo he showed us his wares carried one of those mens purses and had it on the seat next to him when we got in he put it in his lap and after we were driving for a while he zipped it open and said how about a taste of something sweet ladies inside were envelopes of pills and little baggies full of white stuff i couldnt tell you if it was coke or heroin that stuff i stayed away from for me it was just grass and alcohol once in a while acid what about janie janie had no boundaries did she sample burnss wares not in the car but maybe later probably later because she and burns got something going on right from the beginning all three of us were in the front seat janie alongside burns and me next to the door the minute he started driving she started in flipped her hair in his face rested her hand on his leg started moving it up howd burns react to that he loved it said ooh baby stuff like that janie was giggling both of them were laughing at nothing in particular despite her racism i said i couldnt believe it i elbowed her a couple of times as in whats going on but she ignored me burns drove to the party he knew exactly where it was but we had to park up the road because there were so many cars there did he say anything about the party said milo he said he knew the people throwing it that they were rich but cool it was going to be the finest of the fine then when we got there he said something along the lines of maybe the presidentll show up because the house had huge pillars like the white house janie thought that was hilarious i was pretty put out by then felt like janie was shutting me out what happened next we went inside the house it was vacant and rancidsmelling and pretty much trashed with beer cans and bottles and lord knows what else all over the place kids running around everywhere no band just loud tapes a bunch of different stereos set up all over the place really cacophonous but no one seemed to care everyone was blasted kids were walking around looking dazed bumping into each other girls were on their knees going down on guys right in the middle of the dance floor thered be couples dancing and right next to them other couples would be screwing getting kicked stepped on burns seemed to know a lot of people got plenty of high fives as we walked through the crowd then this funnylooking kind of dumpy girl showed up out of nowhere and latched on to him funnylooking how short fat zits odd spacedout but he immediately got all kissykissy with her and i could see janie didnt like that waters shook her head shed known the guy all of fifteen minutes and she was jealous janie do anything about that no she just got this tickedoff look on her face i could read it because i knew janie burns didnt see it or he didnt care threw one arm around the dumpy girl the other around janie and led both of them off that little purse of his bouncing on his shoulder and you i stayed behind someone handed me a beer and hands started groping me not delicately it was dark and whoever was doing it started to get rough yanking at my clothes i broke away started walking around looked for a quiet room to mellow out in but there was none every inch of that place was partytime guys kept putting their hands all over me once in a while someone would pull me hard onto the dance floor and rather than fight it id just dance for a while then make my escape then the lights went out and the house got even darker and i could barely see where i was stepping the southern comfort in my system wasnt helping either i felt nauseous dizzy wanted to get out of there looked some more for janie couldnt find her and got angry at her for bailing on me finally i told myself forget her and the next time someone pulled me onto a dance floor i danced for a while and when someone offered me a pill i swallowed it the next thing i remember is waking up on the floor of an upstairs bathroom hearing shouts that the cops were going to roust the party and running out of there along with everyone else it was like a stampede somehow i ended up in the back of someones truck bouncing along sunset whose truck a bunch of guys surfer types they ended up at the beach santa monica or malibu i couldnt tell you which we partied some more and i fell asleep on the sand the next morning i woke up and i was alone cold and wet and sick to my stomach the sun was rising over the ocean and i suppose it was gorgeous but all i could think about was how lousy i felt then i thought about my father stationed up at mugu and i started crying and got it into my head that i had to go see him it took me four hitches to get up there and when i reached the base the sentry wouldnt let me through the gate i started crying again it had been a long time since id seen my dad hed remarried and his new wife hated me or at least thats what my mother was always telling me whatever the truth was hed pretty much stopped calling i bawled like a baby and the sentry made a call and told me my dad wasnt there hed shipped out to turkey three days before i just broke down and i guess the sentry felt sorry for me because he gave me all the money in his pocket thirtythree dollars and fortynine cents she smiled that i remember precisely reaching under her glasses she fingered the inside corners of her eyes finally someone was being nice to me i never thanked him never knew his name walked back to pch stuck out my thumb caught a ride with some mexicans heading over to ventura to pick cabbage just kept thumbing my way up the coast my first stop was santa cruz and i stayed there a while because it was beautiful and there was this retrohippie thing going on plenty of free food and parks to sleep in eventually i moved on to san francisco crescent city oregon seattle back down to sacramento the next ten years are kind of a blur finally i got it together you dont want to know the boring details like i said we want to maintain your privacy melinda waters laughed thanks for the thought chapter milo asked her a few more questions more gently unproductively then we left her sitting at her desk looking dazed as i drove out of the lot the smoke from the italian restaurants chimney caught my eye want lunch i said i guess yeah why not no fast food though lets aim high we deserve it for what making some progress you think so the taverna across the street was divided into four small whitewashed rooms each warmed by a beehiveshaped fireplace and topped by low ceilings striped with roughhewn logs we ordered beer a mixed antipasto spaghetti with capers and olives and garlic and osso bucco from a lithe young woman who seemed genuinely happy to serve us when she left milo said progress we can place janie with willie burns and caroline cossack the night of the murder you dont have doubts she was the dumpy girl do you he shook his head i said melindas story also supplies a possible motive jealousy caroline had a thing for burns thought janie was moving in on her territory the eternal triangle leading to that the eternal triangle combined with dope and psychopathology and a lowinhibition party scene and janies racism no shortage of triggers and something else fits janies murder presented as a sadistic sex killing and weve been wondering why other victims havent shown up because cold sexual sadists dont quit but if the murder resulted from a passionofthemoment flareup a sole victim would make sense janie in the wrong place at the wrong time melindas description of janie makes her the perfect victim druggedout not too bright prone to fantasy a tendency to irritate people a history of sexual abuse throw enough ingredients into the stew toss in a few careless niggers and who knows what do you think about janies blasé reaction to the downtown rape doesnt surprise me i said people expect rape victims to react the way they do on tv and sometimes that happens but pseudocalm is pretty common protective numbness given janies victimization by her father it makes perfect sense for her it woulda been more of the same he said poor kid he picked at his food slid his plate away theres a discrepancy between janies description of the rape as melinda remembers it and what schwinn told me according to melinda the rapist dropped janie off a couple of miles from her home schwinns informant told him janied been dumped in an alley and found unconscious by some wino that couldve been janie prettying up the picture i said grasping for a shred of dignity pathetic he said any idea who schwinns informant was nope he never gave me a single bit of insider info i kept waiting for him to clue me in to help me learn the ropes but we just went from call to call and when the time came for paperwork he went home and now here he is pulling strings from the grave if janie made up the part about walking home maybe the young guy in a jag was bogus too her not wanting to admit he was a drooling scabby hunchback in a jalopy the alleged wino could be but if she was being truthful the jag storys interesting a young guy with hot wheels checking into a fleabag hotel wouldnt be safe unless he had connections as in daddy owns the place and janie told melinda the clerk seemed to know the guy it might be interesting to know who held the deed on fleabag hotels twenty years ago youre thinking some real estate honcho the cossacks or larner he told me about playa del sol rubbed his face i remember a few of the hotels down there the scuzziest ones were on or near main between third and seventh sro flops full of winos the exeter the columbus there mustve been a good half dozen mostly propped up by federal subsidies so now im supposed to solve a twentyyearold rape with no victim as well as a murder dont think so alex just tossing out suggestions i said isnt that what you pay me for he forced a smile sorry im feeling hemmed in unable to do my usual investigative thing because it puts me in the crosshairs paris bartlett and the call from personnel and the level of the players that dinner with obey i dont imagine they were convening to crochet samplers bacilla and horne live for graft and if walt obeys involved in something it has lots of zeros attached to it broussard wasnt at the restaurant but his hands been in this right from the beginning hes obeys neighbor and obey was one of his biggest supporters all that makes me a flea and guess what a rumors circulating around the department about an hivpositive detective about to retire soon stay healthy huh oh my i said subtle cops subtlety we train with nightsticks not scalpels looks like i couldnt have picked a worse time to stir the ashes alex the hell of it is ive accomplished nothing you finished lets get back to the smog this citys too damn pretty during the drive back to albuquerque he was glum and unreachable the tavernas food had been excellent but id finished more of my plate than he had and that was a first he spent the flight to la dozing when we were back in the seville he said finding melinda was progress in terms of motive means and opportunity but what the hells all that worth when i have no idea where my suspects are if i had to bet my money would be on willie burns in some unmarked grave the money folks behind caroline would have seen him as a threat and even if they never got to him there was his heroin habit crazy caroline who could also be dead or anywhere from the bahamas to belize even if i found her what could i prove theyd bring in one of your colleagues and shed go right back to some plushpadded room sounds bleak i said some therapist you are reality therapy reality is the curse of the sane i took sepulveda to venice got onto motor avenue going south drove past achievement house talk about subtle he said its a shortcut there are no shortcuts life is tedious and brutish it cant hurt to look into those sros something i can do without attracting attention but dont expect anything and dont get yourself in trouble thinking you can fight my battles trouble as in as in anything robin had left a message on my machine sounding hurried and detached the tour had moved on to vancouver and she was staying at the pacific lodge hotel i called the number and connected to her room a happy male voice answered sheridan i said yes its alex delaware oh hi ill go get robin where is she in the bathroom hows my dog uh great the reason im asking is because you seemed pretty in tune with him showing up prepared with a milkbone very intuitive he i like dogs do you i said well yeah well good for you silence let me tell robin youre on the phone gee thanks i said but hed put down the receiver and i was talking to dead air she came on the line a few moments later alex hi i said whats wrong with what sheridan said you sounded upset sheridan would know i said being a sensitive guy and all that silence whats going on alex nothing its not nothing she said every time i call youre more insensitive i said as opposed to youknowwho longer silence you cant be serious about what about him she laughed glad to amuse you alex she said if you only knew i cant believe this whats gotten into you tough times bring out the best in me why in the world would you even think that she laughed again and that was probably what set me off the guy shows up with a damned dog biscuit i said let me tell you hon men are pigs altruism like that always comes with strings you are being totally ridiculous am i each time i call your room hes right there alex this is absurd okay then sorry but there was nothing remorseful in my tone and she knew it whats gotten into you alex i thought about that then a rush of anger clogged my throat and out it came i suppose i can be forgiven a bit of absurdity the last time you left me didnt turn out so great silence oh alex her voice broke on my name my jaw locked she said i cant do this then she hung up i sat there perversely satisfied with a dead brain and a mouth full of bile then that sinking feeling set in idiot idiot i redialed her room no answer tried the hotel operator again was informed that ms castagna had gone out i pictured her running through the lobby tearstreaked what was the weather in vancouver had she remembered her coat had sheridan followed ever ready with consolation sir said the operator would you like her voice mail uh sure why not i was connected listened to robins voice deliver a canned message waited for the beep chose my words carefully but ended up choking and letting the phone drop from my hand i moved to my office drew the drapes sat in graybrown darkness listened to the throbbing in my head a fine fix youve gotten yourself into alexander the hell of it was bert harrison had warned me bert was a wise man why hadnt i listened what to do send flowers no that would insult robins intelligence make matters worse two tickets to paris it took a long time before i was able to shove my feelings somewhere south of my ankles turn suitably numb i stared at the wall visualized myself as a speck of dirt worked hard at disappearing i booted up the computer and downloaded google because that search engine could locate a hamburger joint on pluto walter obey pulled up three hundred and someodd hits percent of them pertaining to the billionaire with a quarter of those repetitive most were newspaper and business journal articles about evenly divided between coverage of obeys philanthropic activities and his financial dealings walter and barbara obey had contributed to the philharmonic the music center planned parenthood the santa monica mountains convervancy the humane society shelters for homeless youth a slew of foundations raging battle against tragic diseases the sierra club too which i found interesting for a developer i came up with no connection to organized sports nor to any link between any of the aborted plans to bring sports teams to la in none of the articles was obeys name mentioned alongside those of the cossack brothers or the larners he and his wife socialized very little and lived an understated life for billionaires a single albeit baronial residence in hancock park no livein help offtherack clothing no expensive hobbies barbara drove a volvo and volunteered at her church if the press could be believed both obeys were as wholesome as milk one item a yearold wall street journal piece did catch my eye one of obeys development companies a privately held corporation named advent builders had invested in a huge parcel of land south of the la city limits an unincorporated county area where the developer planned to build an entire community complete with ethnically diverse lowtomiddleincome housing public schools welllandscaped commercial districts and industrial parks comprehensive recreational facilities obey had taken ten years to accumulate fifteen thousand acres of contiguous lots and had spent millions to rid the earth of toxic waste left behind by a longdefunct county power depot unlike other empirebuilders hed considered the environmental impact of his projects from the beginning was out to crown his career with something culturally significant the new city was to be named esperanza spanish for hope i combined esperanza with each of the cossack brothers names and the larners but came up with nothing tossing john g broussard into the mix proved no more fruitful i tried advent properties and advent still nothing on the cossacks and the larners but a backpage construction journal article informed me that las police chief had been hired as a security consultant to the esperanza project broussard hamstrung by city regulations was working for free but private shares in advent had been gifted to the chiefs wife and his only child daughter joelle a corporate attorney with a whiteshoe downtown firm broussard hadnt shown up at the private dinner but milos hunch was right on the chiefs hand was in everything the bitter aftertaste of my bad behavior with robin kept rising like vomitus as i worked hard at concentrating on obey and broussard and the others and wondering what it could possibly mean comprehensive recreational facilities could mean playgrounds for kids or it was a buzzword for bringing pro football back to the la environs billionaire with a big dream i could see that being the crowning glory of obeys long career and it made good sense to place the top cop on your masthead but if the pr about obeys righteous mien and the size of his personal fortune was accurate why would he waste time with the cossacks who alienated their neighbors and couldnt seem to get any projects off the ground and in the case of the larners the association would be even more hazardous they were outright hustlers tainted by the playa del sol debacle unless obeys balance sheets werent as glowing as the press believed and he needed financial backup for his dream even billionaires could lose sight of assets and debits and obey had spent a decade buying up land and financing and detoxifying his holdings without a single spadeful of esperanza dirt dug big dreams often meant cataclysmic problems i switched to several financial databases and probed for thorns in obeys numerous gardens at least seven separate corporations were listed under his leadership including advent but only one outfit was publicly traded a commercial leasing company named bwo financing bwo probably stood for barbara and walt obey homey from everything i could tell the company was doing great with common stock trading at percent of its high preferred units paying consistent dividends and solid ratings from standard poor still wall streets top analysts had been known to be caught with their pinstriped trousers around their ankles because at root they were dependent upon what companies told them and because their interests lay in selling stock was obeys empire teetering and had he sought out the cossacks and the larners for support did the cossacks and the larners have enough to offer obey bacilla and hornes involvement was puzzling obeys planned city was located outside city limits so what use could a pair of councilmen be unless plans had changed and the focus had shifted back to downtown nothing really sat right then i thought of the cement that held it all together john g broussards aid in covering up the ingalls murder implied hed had connections to the cossacks and maybe the larners walt obey was one of the chiefs major patrons maybe broussard had put them all together earned himself a big fat finders fee in addition to the private stock assigned to his wife and daughter had the chief concealed a substantial lump sum payment from public scrutiny with obeys multiple corporations as shield concealing cash wouldve been easy enough payoff payback for all his power and status john g broussard remained a civil servant whose salary and pension by themselves would relegate him to uppermiddleclass status at best playing with the big boys could mean so much more i imagined the deal walt obey salvaging his dream the cossacks and the larners offered a bigtime social and economic leap upward from strip malls and parking lots to the grandest of monuments for chief broussard and the councilmen good old cash so much at stake and now milo had the opportunity to blow it all to smithereens chapter interesting theory said milo i was wondering along the same lines except that night obeys body language was more grantor than grantee bacilla and horne were kissing up to him bigtime i said bacilla and horne would be supplicants any way you look at it because their political life depends on fat cats and obeys been alphadog with politicians for a long time but you never had a chance to watch him interact with the cossacks no he admitted we were at his kitchen table id spent a miserable hour mulling how to mend things with robin had made another attempt to reach her at the hotel out when i reached milo he was on the way home from the hall of records with a briefcase full of photocopies hed combed through the property tax files and found fourteen fleabag hotels operating near skid row twenty years ago but no ownership by the cossacks or any of the other players so much for that i scanned the tax roster hed spread out between us then a name jumped out at me a trio of central avenue hotels the excelsior the grande royale the crossley owned by vance coury and associates a kid by the name of coury hung out with the cossacks and brad larner back in high school i said they all belonged to some club called the kings men coury he said never heard of him he brought his laptop over from the laundry room office a search yielded three hits on two men named vance coury an elevenyearold times piece described a vance coury sixtyone of westwood as having been brought up by the city attorney on slumlord charges coury was described as the owner of several buildings in the downtown and westlake districts who had failed repeatedly to correct numerous building and safety violations one year prior to his indictment coury had been convicted of similar charges and sentenced by a creative judge to live in one of his own buildings for two weeks hed rehabbed a single unit in two days and set up housekeeping under protection by an armed guard but courys empathy quotient hadnt risen a notch hed done nothing to improve his tenants living conditions and the judge lost patience a followup article three weeks later reported that coury had avoided a felony trial by collapsing in his attorneys office and dying of a stroke an accompanying headshot showed a railthin silverhaired silverbearded man with the defiantfrightened eyes of one scrambling to remember his latest tall tale vance coury jr appeared in a twoyearold sunday daily news item having contributed the custom paint job to the winning entry in a california hot rod contest coury fortytwo owned an auto body shop in van nuys specializing in groundup restoration of classic and specialty vehicles and his outfit had sprayed fortyfive coats on a chopped and blown dodge roadster known as the purple people eater another father and son duo said milo father owns the hotel son makes use of the premises i said and son was a pal of the cossacks meaning he might very well have been at that party which turns the prism a whole new way what if it went down this way janie separated from melinda and tagged along with burns and caroline burns gave her some dope introduced her to some of his richkid pals all of a sudden janie finds herself facetoface with vance coury the prince charming who tied her up and raped her and dumped her in an alley like garbage she freaks out theres an altercation and coury maybe with a little help from his friends spirits janie away before she can cause a scene they subdue her and bring her somewhere secluded and coury thinks hmm why not take advantage of the situation we know hes into bondage and what would be more arousing than helplessness he does his thing and this time the others join in it gets out of hand goes really bad now they need to dump the body because of his fathers properties courys familiar with downtown and he picks a spot he knows is quiet and relatively deserted late at night the beaudry onramp he takes a buddy or two along which would explain taking the risk of leaving janie out in the open with one person as lookout and to help with the body the danger wouldve been minimized milo stared at the tax roster and placed his finger on courys name boys being boys the cossack brothers themselves not just caroline them coury brad larner maybe the other members of the kings men i think their names were chapman and hansen a high school club a party club i said noted for liquid refreshment high jinks and other good fun janies murder took place a few years after graduation but that doesnt mean the fun stopped so where do caroline and burns fit into a gangbang killing both had reason to dislike janie so they couldve participated the fact that caroline was stashed at achievement house indicates her involvement so does burnss disappearance a gangbang killing also meshes with the absence of a sequel it took the right combination to turn things bad dope a defiant victim and the ultimate adolescent drug group conformity adolescent he said all the males were in their twenties arrested development funny you should say that when i saw the cossacks current house thats exactly what went through my mind he described the eyesore mansion the cars the history of neighbor complaints it also matches something else you said early on he added women tend to be affiliative caroline wouldnt have had the drive or the strength to slice janie up by herself but once janie was incapacitated a few cuts and burns wouldve been easy enough but carolines involvement and willie burnss created a new level of risk for the boys two weak links who couldnt be counted on to keep their mouths shut caroline because of her mental instability and burns because he was a junkie with a tendency to flap his gums what if burns found himself in a desperate situation poor cash flow and a strong heroin jones what if he tried to scratch up some money by blackmailing the others to a street guy like burns a bunch of rich white boys with a very nasty secret wouldve seemed perfect marks that would explain michael larners rage at burnss disappearance burns had made himself a very viable threat to larners son and now he was gone burns blackmailing would also explain his skipping on boris nemerov even though hed always been dependable before given all that his paranoid rant about people being after him when he phoned boris nemerov makes perfect sense burns wasnt worried about going to jail hed been part of a brutal murder and had gotten on the wrong side of his coparticipants milo flipped his notepad open chapman and hansen any first names all i read in the yearbook were initials and i dont remember them high school he said oh the glory days they were garvey cossacks glory days he lied about being class treasurer preparing for a career in finance okay lets go have a look at that yearbook within moments of our arrival wed filled out details on the other kings men at eighteen vance coury jr had been a goodlooking darkhaired boy with heavy black eyebrows a curledlip smile that bordered on sneer and a piercing stare a certain type of girl wouldve thought him hot teenage lothario i said just as janie described despite what melinda said she wasnt always fantasizing ten to one his dad owned a jag twenty years ago like the cossacks and brad larner courys outofclass interests had been limited auto shop monitor and the kings men l chapman turned out to be moonfaced luke a hulking fairhaired boy with a vacant mien nothing on his plate but the kings men the last boy nicholas dale hansen was a different story a cleancut buttondown youth with an eversoserious expression nick hansen had participated in the junior chamber of commerce art club and the boy scouts hed also made honor roll for two semesters the smart one in the group said milo wonder if he was smart enough not to be there or the brains behind the organization we got hold of the whos who that had helped me locate the boys in the first place no bios on anyone but garvey cossack jr courys a van nuys fenderbender said milo so no big surprise there and old luke doesnt look like the brightest bulb in the chandelier but personally im disappointed in nick hansen maybe he didnt fulfill his promise we left the library and sat out in front on a stone bench that ran along the reflecting pond flanking the entrance i watched students come and go as milo appropriated the identity of a southwest division auto theft detective and phoned dmv it took some prodding to get the clerk to go back two decades but when milo hung up hed filled two pages with scrawls makes models owners and addresses of record vance coury sr owned a jaguar mark sedan a lincoln continental and a camaro so janie was right on i said the lincoln was probably the missuss wheels and vance jr drove the camaro when he was out to impress girls he took daddys car with the deep pile carpeting something that would set them at ease before he got them up in that room and pulled out the rope hes got himself a slew of wheels now eight registered vehicles mostly classics including a couple of vintage ferraris you said the cossacks had a ferrari out in front of their house maybe the kings men never went dormant and courys bunking in courys home address is listed in tarzana but could be he said and guess what i was wrong about nicholas dale hansen not living up to his capabilities drives a bmw and lives in beverly hills on north roxbury guess he just didnt want a bio modest i said or he shuns the limelight he said because who knows what too much attention can do what about luke chapman nothing on him never owned a car in california meaning he hasnt lived in california for a while i said maybe the family moved out of state after high school or its another disappearing act voluntary or otherwise if he was as dull as his picture implies he wouldve been considered another weak link snipping off loose ends he said that makes me think of two other ends both apparent accidents bowie ingalls hitting that tree and pierce schwinn hitting that rock oh your imagination he said so howd the boys get the parents to stash caroline shed been the problem child for years if she poisoned that dog her parents probably had a sense the problem was serious if the boys came to them feigning horror at something terrible caroline had done they might very well have believed it the boys he said bunch of sleazes and that boy scout hes the one who interests me merit badge for murder i said what a concept walking back to the seville he said something that smells of evidence im starting to feel like a reallife detective gee whiz the question is where to take it cant exactly march into the boardroom at cossack development and accuse the brothers of being scumbag killers cant confront john g broussard either a working cop never mentions john g broussard in polite company did you see that piece in the paper about him this morning no the mayor approved him for a raise but the police commission has the authority and they say no way last few weeks the times has printed a few other lessthancomplimentary comments about john gs management style broussards on the way out i said good chance he mustve finally annoyed the wrong people as we neared the parking structure his cell phone squawked and he slapped it to his ear hello hey hows it what when where are you okay just stay right there no just stay put im with alex over at the u well be there in ten he hung up and sped up to a jog that was rick someone stole the porsche where i said matching his pace right out of the doctors lot at cedars you know how he loves that car he sounded shook up cmon lets go i broke speed laws and made it to the cedarssinai complex in fifteen minutes rick was waiting at the corner of beverly boulevard and george burns avenue wearing a long white coat over blue scrubs except for surgeons fingers that never ceased flexing he was motionless as i pulled to the curb milo bounded out of the seville rushed to ricks side and listened as rick talked at a casual glance they appeared to be two middleaged men exhibiting no obvious physical affection but the bond between them was obvious to me and i wondered if anyone else could see it wondered about something else too hot dog heaven where paris bartlett had accosted milo was only a block away and the fastfood stands picnic tables afforded a full frontal view of the hospital sometimes milo dropped in at cedars to have lunch with rick or just to say hi had he been watched and if so for how long then i thought about the two cops gabbing in the er cubicle supposedly unaware of ricks presence in the next booth but maybe the chat about the hiv detective forced to retire had been for his benefit throw in bartletts little display the call from lapd personnel and a stolen car and it added up to psychological warfare as milo and rick talked i sat in the drivers seat and looked around all i saw was a flood of anonymous faces and cars the usual la ratio of one pedestrian to five hundred vehicles rick stopped talking slumped a bit milo patted his back and eyed the seville rick got in back and milo returned to the front passenger seat hey alex said rick sorry about the car he grimaced an alarm and a steering lock and its gone milo glanced back at him his eyes were cold his neck cords were taut and his mandible jutted like that of a fighting cur straining to enter the pit i said when did it happen rick said i got to work at am didnt come out until pm so sometime in between he thinks he mightve been followed said milo driving to work it was probably nothing said rick but that early you dont expect too many cars on the street and there was a set of headlights behind me when i pulled out to san vincente and it stayed with me until i got to third street and you have no idea exactly when that started said milo rick sighed i told you no i had an emergency splenectomy at six my focus was on getting psyched up ricks voice was steady his fingers kept flexing i really dont think it was anything milo probably some other early bird how many other cars do you usually see when you hit the early shift rick usually none but sometimes one or two as i said i dont pay attention if the porsche hadnt been ripped off if you hadnt asked me about being tailed id never have given it a thought give it a thought said milo weve both got to think about what watching our backs maybe even a temporary change of address oh come on said rick im serious silence rick said well first things first i need a rental car alex would you be so kind as to drive me over to ill take you said milo drop us off a block from our house alex to rick you wait while i check out the premises ill pick you up in the taurus and drive you to budget no lets use another company just to play it safe i want to minimize any links between us you cant be serious said rick drive alex minimize links said rick sorry said milo right now putting a layer of separation between you and me is the nicest thing i can do for you chapter alex dropped rick and milo around the corner and drove off milo left rick waiting under a brazilian floss tree and walked to his house with his eyes on high beam the rental taurus sat alone in the driveway and he gave it a cursory onceover nothing weird slipping behind the car he made his way up the driveway unholstered his gun and unlatched the back door feeling foolish the alarm buzzed a positive sign he disarmed the system covered each room as if stalking a suspect playing robocop in his own domicile jesus nothing had been disturbed that he could see and the junk in the spare bedroom closet was stacked just as hed left it on top of the movable floorboards that concealed the safe still the prickly heat of paranoia coursed up and down his back he hadnt relaxed a bit by the time he got in the taurus and drove back to rick rick said everything okay i assume seems to be milo the porsche probably had nothing to do with anything maybe you dont think so i dont know what to think well given that said rick lets not get overly dramatic after i get a rental im going back to work and afterward im coming home milo started up the taurus but kept it in park rick cleared his throat the way he did when he got impatient milo said whatd you do this morning workwise why how many surgeries did you perform three was i there in the or telling you which scalpel to use listen said rick then he went silent milo tapped the steering wheel rick said fine i accede to your superior knowledge of the rotten side of life but expertise doesnt mean infallibility milo if someone wanted to intimidate you why steal my car because thats the way they think milo didnt answer rick said it was a car theft plain and simple you always told me if a pro wanted the porsche he could get it no matter what i did there are pros and there are pros said milo meaning what meaning i dont know what really happened to the porsche but i do know that i want you away from my mess so stop giving me a hard time even though you think im being melodramatic worse comes to worst i was an idiot and you were inconvenienced what kind of rental car do you want rick frowned doesnt matter he tapped the tauruss dashboard one of these will be fine anything but one of these said milo i dont want you in something that could be confused with mine how about an suv this city thats like joining the ant swarm as if i care said rick folding his arms across his chest sure an suv maybe ill go hiking not a bad idea take some time away from the city ricks head whipped around youre serious you really want me gone i want you safe forget it big guy just dismiss the thought ive got a solid week of shift plus builtin overtime weve got bills to pay get real said milo whens the last time we worried about making the bills not since the porsche was paid up but now ill probably need a new car and thatll mean new monthlies and we were talking about taking some time off and going to europe this summer so i need to stockpile revenue milo didnt answer rick said you were serious about europe ive been organizing my entire schedule with an eye toward taking a month off i was serious maybe we should travel right now milo shook his head why not said rick if youre right why stick around and be a target the weather said milo if i bother to lay out bucks for europe i want sunny weather now youre a meteorologist rick took hold of milo s arm what if your anxiety doesnt level off am i supposed to go into longterm exile its not a matter of anxiety its my finely honed sense of threat that stupid rumor those cops were talking about ive been thinking about that for all you know there is an hivpositive detective in your division someone deep in the closet or those cretins were just flapping their gums the way cops do i know i see them all the time when they bring in suspects standing around drinking coffee and gabbing while we sew the poor devils up another west la gay detective said milo sure thats likely who says hes gay and what only you can be a celebrity yeah thats me a star rick its more than the rumor that old case i know maybe it was shunted aside all these years precisely because no one gives a hoot what if youve just built it up in your head milo with alexs help whats that supposed to mean it means that you and alex have this bizarre chemistry the two of you put your heads together and strange ideas start to pour out ive found alex to be right more often than hes wrong and whats the murder book a schoolboy prank its possible milo was silent fine said rick lets not talk about this anymore get me a rental milo drove melrose west to doheny then north to santa monica boulevard past the clubs he and rick no longer patronized rick said where exactly are you going beverly hills the hertz office at the beverly hilton as a wellknown companion of mine always says hoohah maybe ill rent a rolls forget it weve got bills to worry about rick stared at him and he stared back and they both broke into laughter milo knew it was temporary tension relief more bandaid than cure but that was fine milo watched rick drive away in the rental volvo the counter agent had been a goodlooking blond woman and shed taken one look at rick flirted outrageously and upgraded him no meeting of the minds about where rick would stay and for how long milo agreed to let it ride until tonight alone he drove downtown to skid row the fleabags that vance coury senior had owned twenty years ago had all been situated on a twoblock stretch of main street the chance that any personnel from that era remained was nil but what did he have to lose the moment he drove by each of the hotels the iota of optimism vanished the spots where the excelsior and the crossley had stood were now parking lots and the grande royale was the shining light mission he made his way back to the hall of records and pulled property tax records on all three parcels the parking lots were leased to a nevada corporation but the land was owned by concourse elegance inc which traced to concourse auto restoration on van nuys boulevard vance courys shop junior had inherited the buildings torn two of them down and converted to lowhassle incomechurning asphalt the shining light mission was interesting though the shining light foundation was a nonprofit run by the reverends fred and glenda stephenson a pair milo knew because back in his uniform days hed transported bums to their soup kitchen on san pedro hed found the couple to be saints who put in twentyhour days serving the poor coury probably donated the third lot as part of some sort of tax deal in order to end up with the other two free and clear feeling like don quixotes dumber brother he moved on to death records sucked in his breath when he encountered unexpected success luke matthew chapman had died in a drowning accident twenty years ago at the age of twentytwo date of death december six months after janie ingallss murder eight days prior to caroline cossacks final day at achievement house and nine days prior to boris nemerovs execution he phoned the coroners office got hold of one of the few friendly voices at his disposal a morgue assistant whod come out of the closet after learning about milos travails milo was uncomfortable being viewed as inspirational but the guy had come in handy from time to time today darren asked no questions and went to pull the file milo wouldnt have been surprised to encounter another vanished folder but a few minutes later he had the relevant data jotted down in his notepad luke chapman had parked his car on pch and gone nightswimming at zuma beach an illegal dip because state sand was offlimits after dark and chapman had had to scale a high link fence chapmans alcohol level was twice the legal limit which made milo wonder about his ability to climb the fence but the coroners theory was that this young white wellnourished male had been caught in a riptide and lost coordination due to intoxication water in the lungs confirmed drowning the corpse had washed up at the far end of zuma where public sand abutted broad beach multiple contusions and abrasions consistent with battery by surf and sand had been apparent but no obvious signs of foul play no obvious signs unless you were prepared to interpret the bruises on chapmans arms and legs and back evidence of his having been forced down into the water knew zuma had been one of the kings mens party spots milo recalled chapmans vacant expression the dumb kid in the group participating in janie ingallss murder and sitting on the horror for months but unable to get over it maybe hed gotten loaded and blubbered the wrong thing to his buddies and made himself an extreme liability bought himself the big blue kiss on the other hand accidents happened bowie ingalls man versus tree pierce schwinn man versus rock luke chapman man versus water what was left fire suddenly milos head filled with images of caroline cossack and wilbur burns roasted alive bodies charred beyond recognition the perfect obliteration of the past the kings men a nasty bunch of spoiled rich party animals cleaning up after themselves and earning a nice cushy twenty years more than cushy ferraris and chauffeurs cribs in holmby dabbles in the film biz private dinners with politicos and power brokers theyd gotten away with it these kings men wouldve jumped at the chance to stomp humpty dumptys skull the cossack brothers specs larner coury and the smart one nicholas dale hansen what was he about he looked the guy up in the property files nothing what did that mean he was leasing the house on north roxbury he found himself a quiet corner in the basement of the building hidden between stacks of old plot maps made sure no one was around and took the risk of an ncic call using the id of a west valley di named korn a punk hed supervised two years ago low on initiative high on attitude wasted risk nicholas dale hansen had no criminal history the only thing left to do was go home and play with his laptop or take a shortcut and ask alex to do it his friend initially a computer luddite resistant to the whole notion of the internet had become quite the websurfing whiz he began the twoblock walk to the city lot where hed left the taurus melting in with the afternoon pedestrian throng dialing up his cell phone like every other lemming on the street probably giving himself ear cancer or something but those were the breaks faking normal felt good alex picked up on the first ring and milo thought he sounded disappointed waiting for a call from robin what was up with that milo asked him about running a search on nicholas hansen and alex said funny you should ask oh yeah i forgot said milo im dealing with nostradamus no just a guy with spare time said alex hansen wasnt hard to find at all guess what he does for a living he looked kinda corporate in high school so some hoohah financial thing with a bad smell to it hes an artist a painter quite a good one if the images posted by the new york gallery that handles him are accurate an artist and he leases in beverly hills and drives a big beemer a successful artist said alex his prices range from ten to thirty thousand a canvas and what he churns them out doesnt look like it i phoned the gallery pretending to be an interested collector and hes sold out they described his style as postmodern old masters hansen mixes his own pigments makes his own frames and brushes lays down layer after layer of paint and glaze its a timeconsuming process and the owner said hansen finishes four five pictures a year she implied shed love to have more four five a year at his top fee means max said milo a years lease on a house in the flats could be more than that by itself plus galleries usually take around thirty percent said alex so no it doesnt add up he paused i hope you dont mind but i drove by his house its a nice one big old spanish thing that hasnt been made over the bmws in the driveway freshly polished dark green almost the exact shade as my seville milo laughed do i mind would it make a difference no its fine unless you knocked on the door and accused the bastard of murder which id love to do because guess what the plot curdles he told alex about luke chapmans drowning death another accident said alex normally id say ah but youve been crankier than usual say it ill give you novocaine before i start drilling alex let out an obligatory chuckle i also got a brief look at hansen or someone whos living at the same address while i was driving by a man came out the front door went to the bmw and removed a sheet of wood from the trunk nicholas hansen paints on mahogany an artist said milo with independent income ambling out to his driveway in comfy clothes doing whatever the hell he pleases lifes sure fair aint it there were things milo wanted to do after dark so he thanked alex told him to stay out of trouble hed call in the morning anything else i can do for you big guy milo quashed the impulse to say stay out of trouble no not right now okay said alex he sounded disappointed milo wanted to ask about robin but he didnt instead he hung up thinking about janie ingalls and how some lives are so short so brutish that it was a wonder god bothered he slogged through yet another rushhour mess from downtown wondering what to do with rick and deciding that a nice hotel for a few days was the best solution rick would be profoundly unhappy but he wouldnt scream rick never screamed just tucked himself in psychologically and grew quiet and unreachable it wouldnt be fun but in the end rick would agree all these years together and theyd both learned to pick their battles he made it home by five oclock midway up his block he stopped something white was stationed in his driveway the porsche he looked around saw no strange cars on the block gunned the taurus and swung it behind the pearly from what he could tell the car was intact no joyriding wounds or missing parts more than intact shiny and clean as if it had been freshly washed rick kept it spotless but milo couldnt remember when hed last scrubbed it down last weekend for most of the week rick had garaged the car but the last two days hed left it out to be ready when he hit the er early two days dirt would have shown itself easily on the white paint someone had detailed the damn thing he surveyed the block put his hand on his gun got out cautiously walked over to the porsche and touched the cars convex flank glossy washed and waxed a peek through the window added freshly vacuumed to the picture he could see the tracks in the carpet even the steering wheel lock had been put back then he saw something on the drivers seat a brown paper bag he gave the block another upanddown then kneeled down and examined the porsches underside no ticking toys or tracers popping the trunk revealed an intact rear engine hed worked on the car himself had rustproofed the belly for all those coldweather trips that had never materialized he knew the porsches guts well nothing new he unlocked the drivers door took a closer look at the bag the paper mouth was open and the content was visible a blue binder not shiny leather like alexs little gift your basic blue cloth the same kind of binder the department used to employ before the switch to plastic he took hold of the top of the bag with his fingertips and carried it inside the house sat down in the living room heart racing hands icy because he knew exactly what would be inside knew also that despite the certainty hed be shocked his jaw hurt and his back ached as he opened the book to janie ingallss case file very thin file milos own notes on top followed by the official death shots and yes schwinn had lifted the photo out of this set body drawings with every wound delineated autopsy summary not originals nice clean photocopies then nothing else no tox screens or lab tests no investigative reports by the metro boys whod supposedly taken over so either that had been a lie or pages had been left out he flipped to the postmortem summary no mention of semen of anything much this had to be the sketchiest autopsy synopsis hed ever read this white adolescent wellnourished females wounds were accomplished by sharp singlebladed thanks a heap no sign of the toxicology screen hed requested he didnt need official confirmation melinda waters had said janie began the evening stoned no semen no foreign blood types forget dna but one detail in the autopsy summary did catch his eye ligature marks around janies ankles wrists and throat same pattern of restraints as in the hotel vance coury spotting janie and going for an encore this time adding his buddies to the mix he reread the file nothing revelatory but someone wanted to make sure milo saw it he settled his head with vodka and grapefruit juice checked the mail punched the phone machine one message from rick whod made it easy for him by taking on an extra shift i wont be through until tomorrow morning probably crash in the doctors room maybe go for a drive afterward take care of yourself i love you me too milo muttered to the empty house even alone he had trouble saying it chapter i opened the door for milo at am doing my best impression of awake and human last night id woken up every couple of hours thinking the kind of thoughts that erode your soul three calls to robin had gone unanswered her hotel refused to say if shed checked out guest security next stop denver i pictured her on the bus spike sleeping in her lap gazing out the window thinking of me or anything but milo handed me the blue binder i thumbed through it and led him into my office your typing wasnt any better back then i said any theories about who delivered it someone with a talent for grand theft auto same messenger who sent me the deluxe version could be doesnt sound like schwinns secret girlfriend i said or maybe im being sexist i suppose women can steal cars too this was no amateur i printpowdered the wheel and the door handles nada nothing on the book other than my paws they put the crooklock back on picked it didnt slice it same question i said a criminal pro the department or a rogue cop a rogue cop would mean schwinn had a buddy back then or made a new one i never saw him hang with anyone the other detectives seemed to shun him any idea why at first i figured it was his charming personality but maybe everyone knew about his bad behavior could see he was ready for a fall everyone except me i was a dumbass rookie caught up in my own paranoia at the time i wondered if id been paired with him because i was seen as a pariah too now im sure of it not that much of a pariah i said they got rid of him and transferred you to west la or i hadnt accrued enough time on the job to accumulate embarrassing information or to develop street sources like the one who cued schwinn right to janie he fingered the edge of the blue cloth binder another burnout cop maybe but why send this to me a week after the deluxe version more covering of the rear i said pacing himself he couldnt be sure youd be seduced you started investigating and qualified for the next installment more installments coming could be he got up circled the room returned to the desk but remained on his feet id kept the drapes drawn and a razor edge of light ran across his torso diagonally a luminous wound i said heres yet another theory the ia man who interrogated you along with broussard poulsenn any idea what happened to him lester poulsenn he said been trying to recall his first name and it just came to me no never heard of him again why because the real target of renewing interest in the case could be broussard john g built his career on an upright reputation exposure of a coverup would destroy him lester poulsenn could have a good reason to resent broussard think about it a black man and a white man are partnered but the black man is put in charge then the black man ascends to the top of the department ladder and the white mans never heard from again was poulsenn also drummed out due to bad behavior or maybe he wasnt good at keeping secrets either way we could be talking about one disgruntled gentleman and poulsenn wouldve known about schwinns resentment yeah itd be interesting to know what happened to his career i cant exactly waltz into parker center and stick my nose in the files he frowned called dmv and identified himself as someone named lt horacio batista a few minutes later he had statistics on three lester poulsenns living in california but all were too young to be the man whod played second fiddle to john g broussard he couldve moved out of state i said meaning hes probably not our man or hes yet another disappearing act he got to his feet again and paced the light razor bounced returning to the book he touched a blue cover installments hey folks join the murder book club we divided up the workload this way id try to learn what i could about lester poulsenn check newspaper microfilms for twenty to twentyfiveyearold stories about misbehaving cops and chase down whatever details i could find about the disposition of their cases a long shot because the department kept corruption stories quiet just as it had with pierce schwinn unless as in the rampart scandal or the hollywood division burglary case of ten years ago the stink got too strong to mask milo would go off to do his thing not telling me what or where or when the search on my computer revealed no lester poulsenns who fit the bill i made another futile call to vancouver comforted myself with selfpity and drove to the u it took three hours to go through five years of microfilm and i came up with several instances of felonious police officers a pair of west valley detectives had offered their services as contract killers both were serving life sentences in protective isolation at the state penitentiary at pelican bay a glendale traffic officer had been arrested for having sex with a thirteenyearold babysitter ten years of jail this prince was out by now but an alliance with schwinn and a child molester seemed unlikely a female pasadena gang officer had slept with several minorage gang members and two van nuys uniforms had been caught burglarizing pawnshops on their patrol route convictions and incarceration for all in each instance a hookup with schwinn seemed improbable i copied down all the names anyway punched lester poulsenns name into the periodicals index and felt my pupils dilate as a single reference popped into view twentyyearold reference poulsenn ll veteran lapd detective found murdered in watts the sacramentobee i located the spool jammed it into the machine twirled like mad until i came to the story associated press wire service piece the la papers hadnt picked it up the bee had run it in a side column at the back of the main section titled elsewhere in the state sandwiched between the account of a dead black rhinoceros at the san diego zoo and a berkeley bank robbery the date was january fourteen days after caroline cossack had checked out of or had been taken from achievement house i did an instant photocopy on the machine then read the text ap los angeles police are investigating the shooting death of one of their own in what appears to be a homicide and attempted coverup by arson the body of lester louis poulsenn formerly a detective with the departments internal affairs unit and recently appointed to the metro major crimes unit was found inside a burning house in watts poulsenn a thirteenyear lapd veteran was discovered by firefighters dispatched to put out a blaze at the private residence on west street a police spokesman said poulsenn had been shot twice in the head in what appeared to be an executionstyle killing this is a rough neighborhood with lots of gang activity said the source who neither confirmed nor denied reports that poulsenn had been in watts on official business the structure a singlefamily dwelling that had been vacant for some time was described as a total loss i kept spooling in search of a followup nothing which was crazy nothing mobilizes a police department faster than a cops murder yet local press coverage of poulsenns death had been suppressed and no further official statements had been issued recently transferred to metro translation poulsenn had taken over the ingalls case twenty years ago a pair of ia men had interrogated milo one had merited success the other was dead seven months later a white man shot to death in a black neighborhood just like boris nemerov dispatched executionstyle just like boris nemerov arson coverup milo had wondered out loud about fire beleaguered or not he had perfect pitch i called him got no answer at any of his numbers thought about what to do nice mild morning time to wash the car two hours later the seville was as shiny as a seville could be and i was hurtling over the glen to the valley mere cleanliness hadnt satisfied me id waxed and handbuffed the chesterfield green paint added detail spray scrubbed the tires the hubcaps the beige vinyl top and matching upholstery wiped down those crafty little simulated wood insets vacuumed and shampooed the rugs i bought the car fifteen years ago from the proverbial little old lady a heavyfooted retired schoolteacher from burbank not pasadena and had pampered it since still miles had taken its toll and one day id be forced to decide between an engine rebuild or something new no decision at all no more changes of heart concourse auto restorers was one of the many caroriented businesses lining van nuys boulevard between riverside and oxnard modest setup not much more than a double tinroofed garage behind an open lot filled with chrome and lacquer a sign above the garage done up in red dayglo gothic lettering advertised custom paint plating and bodyoff restoration above a cartoonish rendering of an equally red priapic ferrari coupe i parked on the street and made my way among muscle cars hot rods and one very white stretch mercedes with its roof hacked off and a blue tarp spread across its interior years ago the state had passed laws restricting outdoor spray painting but the air above concourse auto was chemically ripe midway up the lot two men in greasy tshirts and baggy cutoffs were inspecting the doors of a seventies stutz blackhawk done up in the same copper finish as a gourmet frypan both were young and husky and hispanic with shaved heads and mustaches face masks hung around their necks their arms and the back of their necks were brocaded with tattoos the inkwork was dusky blue squareedged and crude prison handiwork they barely raised their eyes as i passed but both were paying attention my nod evoked squints vance coury i said in there said the heavier of the two curling a thumb toward the garage his voice was highpitched and a teardrop tattoo dripped under one eye thats supposed to mean youve murdered someone but some people brag this fellow had a hunched posture and flat eyes and boasting didnt seem his style i moved on as i got closer to the garage i saw that my first impression of a small lot had been wrong a driveway ran to the left of the building and it led to a rear half acre of chainlinked dirt piled high with tires and fenders bumpers and broken headlights and random garbage two spray booths were affixed to the rear outer wall of the garage and a few intact cars were parked in the dirt but most of the land was dumping ground i returned to the front of the structure the garage door to the left was shut and bolted a wall of corrugated iron in the open righthand bay sat a red white and blue corvette stingray the vettes windows were tinted amethyst its nose had been lengthened a foot a rear spoiler arced over the trunk and twentyinch chromereversed wheels extended several inches wider than the body primer spots blemished the passenger side and another shavedhead latino crouched at one of them handsanding yet another tattooboy sat at a workbench to the rear of the bay arcwelding the decor was raw walls cement floor bare bulbs gasoline reek tacked to the wall beams were autoparts calendars and foldouts of naked women with an emphasis upon luxuriant pubic hair and angles that bespoke an interest in amateur gynecology a scattering of hardcore shots was dispersed among the collection someone had a thing for skinny crouching supplicant blondes with dopeeyes performing oral sex the sander ignored me as i edged behind the vette avoided the sparks from the welding gun and stepped into the sealed section of the garage half a black porsche roadster occupied this bay a racer sliced neatly in half so that the number on the door had been bisected and turned into a at the rear of the room behind the truncated torso a broadshouldered man sat at a metal desk phone nestled under his chin fingers busy at a calculator fortyish he had long thick silver hair slicked straight back and tucked behind his ears incongruous tooblack eyebrows and an equally inky goatee the bulb hanging above the desk greened an already olive complexion dark brooding eyes were bottomed by pouches his neck was creased and soft and his face had long surrendered to flab remnants of the goodlooking high school kid were hard to find and i didnt want to stare because vance coury had his eyes on me as he continued talking and calculating i walked over to the desk coury gave off a strong whiff of musky aftershave his shirt was black silk crepe with blousy sleeves rolled to the elbows and a high stiff collar that nearly reached his earlobes a gold chain flashed around his neck a gold rolex the size of a pizza banded a thick hirsute wrist he studied me without acknowledging my presence stayed on the phone listening talking listening some more adjusting the instrument in the crook of his neck never ceasing the tapping of the calculator keys the desk top was littered with papers a halfempty bottle of corona served as a paperweight i left him and strolled over to the demiporsche the car retained no internal organs was just half a shell the edges had been smoothed and painted finished product no one was intending to put this one back together again all the kings horses hey said a raspy voice behind me i turned coury said what do you want alert yet disinterested one hand rested on the calculator the other was cupped and aimed at me as if ready to collect something im thinking of some custom work what kind of car seville seventynine are you mr coury he looked me over who referred you read your name in an auto magazine i said from what i could tell you seem to work on a lot of contest winners it happens he said seventynine seville a box they built em on chevy two nova chassis i know what do you want done to it im not sure he smirked cant think of any contest youd enter that in unless its one of those aids things aids things theyre trying shows now to raise money for aids some little fruit came in wanted me to cherry up his bmw take the job i said the cupped hand waved off the question seventynine seville he said as if offering a diagnosis its still gonna be a box unless we get radical and then theres the engine it sucks its been good to me no problems in fifteen years any rust on the belly nope i take care of it right he said i said its here if you want to see it he glanced down at the calculator punched numbers as i stood there wheres here out in front he snickered in front he stood to sixthree his upper body was massive with meaty shoulders and a swelling gut outsized for the narrow hips and long stalky legs that supported it tight black plainfront slacks slimmed the legs further and accentuated the effect on his feet were black crocodile boots with silver straps banding the shins he came around the desk jangling walked right past me and out of the garage out at the curb he laughed tell you what we wreck it give you four hundred bucks call it a day i laughed back like i said its been good to me then leave it the hell alone what the hell would you want to do with this i was thinking about turning it into a convertible figures he said what chainsaw the roof off only car you can do that with is a rolls silver cloud i said not enough tensile strength in any other chassis i was figuring take the roof off strengthen the frame install an automatic softcover with a mohair liner rechrome and do a customcolor you guys still doing lacquer illegal he said listen man you want a convertible go buy yourself one of those little mazdas i want this car converted he turned his back i said too complicated for you he stopped caught his lower lip between his teeth and bit down the pouches beneath his eyes rode up and obscured the bottom half of the irises the two homeboys working on the stutz looked our way coury kept his lip between his teeth and rotated his jaw yeah thats it he said too complicated he left me standing there and walked back toward the lot but he only made his way halfway through paused by the stutz as i drove away he was watching chapter milo stared into his coffee cup pretended the soilcolored liquid was a bog and he was sinking if this was a normal case hed have gotten himself backup as much as he hated meetings and personalities and all the other crap that went with teamwork multiple suspects demanded it an army of suspects on janie six with luke chapman dead and then there was afterburn walt obey and germ bacilla and diamond jim and the glue that held it all together jg broussard and now yet another unknown alexs theory about a rogue cop milo d spent some time thinking about that trying to come up with a possible name but all he could conjure was an abstraction some asshole doing pierce schwinns postmortem bidding playing games and yanking his strings someone with the gall to rip off ricks car and return it detailed with a nice little gift vance coury was in the car biz and wasnt that a coincidence but coury sure wouldnt have delivered the real murder book so maybe the use of the car meant someone was pointing him toward coury or was he really getting overly complicated now the anger that had percolated within him since the first murder book had surfaced kept rising in his gorge coury the bastard shaped up as a sadist and a rapist and a control freak maybe the dominant one in the group if he and his rich buds were cornered theyd be likely to ambush the enemy cut his throat and burn his body one army deserved another and all he had was alex he laughed silently or maybe hed let out sound because the old lady in the second booth over looked up startled and stared at him with that antsy expression that takes hold of people when they confront the weird milo smiled at her and she retracted her head behind her newspaper he was back at dupars in farmers market trying to sort things out vance coury had stayed in his head because it had been coury whod raped janie the first time and maybe initiated the scene that led to janies murder normally hed have investigated the hell out of the guy but then something hit him maybe there was a safe way to learn more he threw money on the table and left the coffee shop the old womans stare followed his path to the door the shining light mission was five stories of brickfaced stucco painted corn yellow and sided by rusting gray fire escapes no friezework no moldings not the slightest nod to design it reminded milo of one of those drawings little kids do when asked to render a building one big rectangle specked with little window squares the place even tilted as a hotel the grande royale had been anything but old men with collapsed jaws and runny eyes years past selftorment loitered in front and every one of them greeted milo with the excessive amiability of the habitual miscreant knowing exactly what he was no way could he be taken for anything else as he entered the mission he wondered if the cop aura would stick after he left the department which might be sooner rather than later going up against the chief wasnt a formula for career longevity even an unpopular chief who might be leaving soon himself milo had been scouring the papers for broussard stories and this morning hed found yet another one in the times pontification on the chiefs rejected raise by two members of the police commission defying the mayor whod appointed them which meant they were serious chief broussard represents a longentrenched police culture that contributes to intracommunity tension politicoblab for update your résumé jg broussard had come into office in the aftermath of the rampart scandal and the commission had offered no hint at new corruption the chiefs problem was his personality arrogance as he bucked the commission at every turn in that sense the chief still thought like a cop civilian meddling was the enemy but broussards imperious nature had alienated the wrong people well past the point where even pals like the mayor and walt obey could help him then again maybe broussard didnt care about losing his job because he had something waiting in the wings converting his unpaid position as security consultant to obeys esperanza project into a nice fat corporate gig that would guarantee him longterm status and bucks keep the wife in cadillacs and whatever else floated her canoe if so what was obey getting out of the deal the cossacks participation as refinancers fit perfectly they owed broussard bigtime for the ingalls coverup would go with the flow could alex be right about obey getting himself into a financial bind needing the brothers as white knights any way you turned it milo knew he was a flea what the hell safety and security were for wimps he entered the mission lobby the vaulted space had been converted to a tv room where a dozen or so bums sat slumped on folding chairs staring at a movie on bigscreen the scene featured actors and actresses in long hair and beards and camelcolored robes wandering through a desert that looked like palm springs despite the camels some biblical epic that asked you to buy the hebrews as blond and blueeyed milo shifted his attention to the reception desk maybe the very desk where vance coury had obtained the key to his rape den the counter was topped by several plastic screwtop cookie jars and the bookcase behind it was jammed with redbound bibles with crosses on their spines off to the left were two brownpainted elevator doors a metalrailed staircase ran straight back and hooked sharply to the right the place smelled of soup why did so many places dedicated to salvation smell of soup an old black guy more cleaned up than the others got up from his chair and limped over im edgar may i help you sir big bass voice but a little bandylegged fellow wearing pressed khakis a bluegray plaid shirt buttoned to the neck and sneakers bald except for tufts of kinky white cotton above his ears whitewhite dentures made for smiling the total effect was clownlike benign milo said are reverend fred or reverend glenda in reverend freds at the city of orange mission but reverend glendas upstairs who shall i say is calling the guy had a refined way of enunciating and his eyes were clear and intelligent milo could see him doing butler time at some country club kissing up to rich folk using perfect grammar different skin color and maybe hed have been the one getting served milo sturgis and this is about mr sturgis personal the old man regarded him with compassion one moment mr sturgis he made his way slowly up the stairs and returned a few minutes later reverend glendas waiting for you mr sturgis next floor up second door to the right sitting behind a small oak desk in a small nearly empty office fitted with an ancient radiator and masked by yellowed venetian blinds glenda stephenson looked exactly as she had ten years ago fifty pounds overweight way too much makeup a teasedup meringue of brunette waves atop a broad welcoming face same kind of clothes too pink dotted swiss dress with a frothy collar every time milo d seen her shed worn something frilly and inappropriate in that same soapbar pink he didnt expect her to remember him but right away she said detective s its been so long why havent you brought me anyone in so long dont hang out much with the living these days rev said milo been working homicide for a long time oh dear said glenda stephenson well how have you been with that it has its moments ill just bet it does hows the soulsaving business reverend glenda grinned theres never a lack of work ill bet sit down said glenda stephenson cup of coffee milo saw no urn or pot just an alms box on the desk next to a neat stack of what looked to be government forms impulsively he reached into his pocket found a bill dropped it in oh thats not necessary said glenda im catholic said milo put me in a religious environment and i have an urge to donate glenda giggled little girls giggle for some reason it wasnt as foolish coming out of that dinnerplate face as it shouldve been well then come by often theres never a lack of need either so edgar said this is personal in a way said milo work and personal what i mean is it needs to be kept confidential glenda sat forward and her bosoms brushed the desk top of course whats the matter dear its not about me said milo not directly but i am involved in a case thats ticklish a name came up and i traced a connection to the mission vance coury glenda sat back her chair creaked the son or the father the son what has he done you dont sound surprised in repose glendas customary face was unlined nothing filled wrinkles as well as fat but now worry lines appeared at the periphery etching the corners of her mouth her eyes her brow oh dear she said could this reflect in any way on the mission not that i can see i certainly wouldnt do anything to put you in a bad position reverend oh i know that milo you were always the kindest taking time from your patrol to deliver sad souls the way you held their arm the way you ministered to them i was trying to clean up the streets and you were there im afraid theres nothing pastoral in my makeup oh i think youre wrong said glenda i think you wouldve made a wonderful priest milos face went hot blushing for gods sake glenda stephenson said coury the son when fred and i accepted the building we had our reservations because you know were grizzled old veterans of this neighborhood knew darn well what his father had been like everyone on skid row knew about his father slumlord slumlord and a mean man never gave us a dime and milo we asked thats why we were shocked when a few months after he died we received a letter from the sons lawyer letting us know he was donating the hotel to the mission im afraid our immediate response was to harbor uncharitable thoughts as in whats the catch said milo exactly the father no i wont speak ill of the dead but suffice it to say that charity didnt appear to be his strong point and then there were the people he employed theyd always made the lives of our men difficult and the son had kept them on what people angry young men from east la said glenda which gang said milo she shook her head you hear talk eighteenth street the mexican mafia nuestra familia i really dont know but whoever they were when they showed up on the street they intimidated our men swaggering by driving by sometimes theyd get out and demand money become threatening physically once in a while someone got punched or pushed mostly it was psychological intimidation looks threats verbal bullying i suppose they felt entitled territorial mr coury the father had used them as rent collectors when the son offered us the building the first request we made on him was that he ask his crew to stay away from the men because we thought he was going to hold on to the other hotels and we didnt want to be geographically close to that kind of environment his lawyer said thered be no problem coury was going to tear the buildings down and pave them for parking lots it ended up being a very smooth transition our lawyer talked to his lawyer papers were signed and that was it fred and i kept waiting for some ulterior motive but the way our lawyer explained it the son was in an inheritance tax bind and the grand royale could be appraised in a manner that would serve his best interests inflated appraisal no said glenda fred and i wouldnt be party to that in fact we demanded to look at the most recent county assessments and everything was in line the grand royale was worth approximately twice what the other hotels were so apparently it fit the sons tax needs it wasnt the only thing he sold mr coury the father had owned many properties but the three hotels had been acquired as a package through some sort of government housing deal so by donating the royale everything worked out coury aiding the lords work said milo funny isnt it the father acquired filthy lucre by oppressing the poor and now at least some of those profits have served to elevate the poor happy ending reverend doesnt happen very often oh it does milo you just have to know where to look he talked to her a bit longer stuffed more money in the alms box over her protests and left vance coury had made good on his promise to keep the gangbangers away from the mission and now that the two other hotels had been torn down for parking lots his need for rent collectors had disappeared but the gang thing intrigued milo and when he drove by the lots and took a look at the attendants he saw shaved heads and skulking posture tattoos conspicuous enough to be visible from the curb chapter what id seen of vance courys demeanor synched with the profile of a domination rapist surly hypermacho eager not to please the supercharged ambience in which he operated fit too big engines flashy paint the photos of submissive fellatrices tacked to the walls of the garage the mutilated porsche a corrupt father completed the picture coury had been raised to take what he wanted throw in some likeminded buddies and janie ingalls had been a rabbit in a dog pit junior hadnt been interested in my patronage did he really regard the seville as a hunk of junk or did those parking lots pay the bills and the autocustomizing business was recreational or a front all those gang boys i headed for the city and thought about the bisected porsche evisceration on display the joy of destruction maybe i was interpreting too much but the few minutes id spent with coury had left me wary and creepedout and i kept checking the rearview mirror well past mulholland back at home i imagined the party scene twenty years ago janies encounter with coury amid the noise and the dope the flash of recognition pleasure for coury horror for janie he moves in and takes over the kings men join in including a kings man who seemed different than the others the images nicholas hansens gallery had posted on its website were stilllifes lush luminously tinted assemblages of fruit and flowers rendered meticulously hansens work seemed galaxies away from the ruined sculpture assembled on the beaudry onramp from any brutality but art was no immunization against evil caravaggio had slain a man over a tennis game and gauguin had slept with young tahitian girls knowing hed be infecting them with syphillis still nick hansen seemed to have taken a different path than the others and deviance has always fascinated me it was nearly three maybe past the new york gallerys closing time but i phoned anyway and got a young female voice on the other end the first time id contacted the gallery id talked to an older woman and hadnt left my name so here was a chance for some new dissembling i shifted into artspeak and presented myself as a collector of old masters drawings whod run out of the sunlightfree space such treasures demanded and was considering switching to oils old masters oils said the young woman a bit beyond my budget i said but i have been impressed by some of the contemporary realism thats managed to assert itself among all the performance pieces nicholas hansen for example oh nicholass wonderful hes certainly not daunted by tradition i said could you tell me more about his background is it rigidly academic well she said he did go to yale but weve always felt nicholas transcends academic painting theres something about his sensibilities and the way he uses light yes quite i like his sense of composition that too hes simply firstrate unfortunately we have no paintings by him in stock at this time if you could give me your name i always research an artist before i take the plunge would you happen to have some biographical information on hansen that you could fax me yes of course she said ill get that right out to you and about the academic aspect nicholas is well schooled but please dont hold that against him despite his meticulousness and his way with paint as matter theres a certain primal energy to his consciousness youd need to see the pictures in person to really appreciate that no doubt i said theres nothing like in person five minutes later my fax machine buzzed disgorging nicholas hansens curriculum vitae education awards group and individual exhibitions corporate collections museum shows the man had accomplished plenty in two decades and unlike his old pal garvey cossack he hadnt recounted any of it in a pumpedup biography no mention of high school at all nicholas hansens account of his education began with college columbia university where hed received a ba in anthropology summers filled with painting fellowships a masters of fine arts at yale and two years of postgraduate work at an atelier in florence italy learning classical painting technique among his museum shows were group spots at the art institute of chicago and the boston museum of fine arts prominent names figured among those who collected his work an accomplished man a polished man hard to fit that with vance courys garage or the cossacks vulgar lifestyle a gangrape murder i went over the dates on hansens résumé saw something else that didnt fit milo still wasnt answering any of his phones so i tried to dispel my restlessness with a beer then another i carried the bottle down to the pond thought about kicking back decided to net leaves instead for the next hour or so i pruned raked busied myself with mindless chores i was just about to allow myself a moment of repose when the phone rang up in the house robin i ran up the stairs grabbed the kitchen extension heard dr bert harriss voice alex bert whats up it was nice to see you he said after all this time just checking to see how youre doing did i look that bad oh no not bad alex perhaps a bit preoccupied so everythings rolling along rolling along no thats a lie bert i screwed up with robin silence i said i shouldve followed your advice instead i brought up the past more dead air i see she reacted just as youd imagine maybe i wanted her to youre saying i really dont know what im saying bert listen i appreciate your calling but things are kind of i dont feel like talking about it forgive me he said apologizing again nothing to forgive i said you gave me good advice i screwed up you made a mistake son mistakes can be remedied some robins a flexible woman hed met robin twice i said is that your natural optimism speaking no its an old mans intuition alex ive made my share of mistakes but after a few years one does get a sense for people id hate to see you misled about robin about anything he said another reason im calling is that im planning to travel perhaps for a while cambodia vietnam some places ive been to others i havent sounds great bert i didnt want you to try to reach me and not find me here i appreciate that had i come across that needy that sounds presumptuous doesnt it he said to think youd call but just in case i appreciate your telling me bert yes well then good luck when are you leaving i said soon as soon as final arrangements are complete bon voyage i said when you get back give a call id love to hear about the trip yes may i offer one bit of advice son please dont sure try to season each day with a new perspective okay i said bye now alex i placed the receiver back in its cradle what had that been about the more i thought about the conversation the more it sounded like goodbye bert going somewhere hed sounded sad those comments hed made about senility all the apologies bert was a firstrate therapist wise enough to know i hadnt wanted advice but he offered a parting shot anyway try to season each day with a fresh perspective last words from an old friend facing deterioration taking a trip a final journey there i was again off on some worstcase tangent keep it simple the old man had always traveled loved to travel no reason to think his destination was anywhere but southeast asia the phone rang again i switched it to speaker and milo s voice distant and flecked with static filled the kitchen any new insights how about an actual fact i said nicholas hansen couldnt have been involved in janies murder early in june he was finishing up his last year at columbia after he graduated he went to amsterdam and spent the summer at a lifedrawing course at the rijksmuseum that assumes he didnt come home for the weekend new york to la for the weekend these were rich kids he said anythings possible but i just dont see it hansens different from the other kings men his life took a whole different turn and unless you can uncover some presentday dealings with coury and the cossacks and brad larner my bet is he distanced himself from the group and maintained that distance so hes no use to us on the contrary he might be able to provide insights we just drop in and say we want to chat about his old pals the sexkillers any other promising leads at the moment i said he didnt answer i said so whatd you do today nosed around about coury junior his daddy was the nasty piece of work the papers made him out to be used gangbangers to collect the rent and looks like juniors continued the relationship the dubious citizens working his parking lots have that homeboy thing going on funny about that i told him about my visit to the garage chopping the seville as a cover story he said did it ever occur to you coury didnt want to do the job cause he wasnt buying your story jesus alex why wouldnt he buy it i said because maybe someone in the enemy camp knows weve been snooping around the ingalls case you got the goddamned murder book in the first place because someone knew we worked together alex that was goddamned stupid coury wasnt suspicious just apathetic i said with more confidence than i felt my take is that he doesnt need the money was he doing other chop jobs yes i admitted meaning he works but he just didnt want to work with you alex no more improvisation fine i said gang connections would have given coury ready personnel for odd jobs like taking care of luke chapman and possibly willie burns and caroline cossack maybe lester poulsenn too i located him safely all computer work and guess what he died less than two weeks after caroline left achievement house shot in the head in a house in watts then the house was burned down hed just been transferred from ia to metro meaning maybe he was working on janies case right burned to death he said his voice was tight what was he doing in watts the paper didnt say sacramento paper by the way a detective got murdered in la but the la papers didnt print a word about it the article say where in watts i read off the address no answer you still there yeah okay meet me in beverly hills in an hour time for art appreciation chapter nicholas hansens green bmw sat in the cobbled driveway of the house on north roxbury drive the street was lined with struggling elms a few trees had given up and their black branches cast ragged shadows on the sparkling sidewalks the street was quiet but for a beverly hills symphony teams of gardeners pampering the greenery of mansions up the block milo was parked in a new rental car a gray oldsmobile sedan six houses north of hansens vanilla hacienda by the time id switched off the engine he was at my window new wheels i said varietys the spice his face was pallid and sweaty something else happen to make you switch contacting hansen is a risk and maybe not a smart one if hes still in touch with the others everything hits the fan if hes not there may be no real payoff but youre going ahead anyway he yanked out a handkerchief and sopped moisture from his brow the alternative is doing nothing and who says im smart when we reached hansens property he scowled and peered through a window of the bmw clean meticulous as he stepped up to the door and stabbed the bell he looked ready to tear something apart nicholas hansen answered wearing faded black sweats white nikes and a distracted look brown and red paint stains on his fingers were the only clues to his occupation he was tall and spare with an oddly fleshy face looked closer to fifty than forty soft neck basset eyes the color of river silt grayish mouth stitched with wrinkles a bald blueveined scalp ringed by a beige buzz a middleaged crisis stoop rounded his shoulders id have guessed a burntout lawyer taking a day off milo flashed the badge and hansens muddy eyes came alive but his voice was low and mumbly police about what i was standing behind milo but not so far that i couldnt smell the alcohol breeze hansen had let forth milo said high school his voice was rough and he didnt use hansens name hadnt even offered a cops patronizing sir high school hansen blinked and the paintstained fingers of one hand capped his bald head as if hed been afflicted by a sudden migraine the kings men said milo hansen dropped the hand and rubbed his fingers together dislodging a fleck of paint inspecting his nails i really dont understand im working milo said this is important hed kept the badge in hansens face and the artist took a step backward the kings men said hansen that was a very long time ago milo filled the space hansen had vacated those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it and all that hansens hand floundered some more ended up on the doorjamb he shook his head youve lost me gentlemen his breath was ninety proof and his nose was a relief map of busted capillaries be happy to clarify said milo he flicked his wrist and sunlight bounced off the badge i assume you dont want to talk out here in full view hansen shrank back some more milo was only an inch or so taller than hansen but he did something with his posture that increased the gap im a painter im in the middle of a painting hansen insisted im in the middle of a homicide investigation hansens mouth slackened revealing uneven yellowed teeth he shut his mouth quickly looked at his watch then over his shoulder im a big art fan said milo especially german expressionism all that anxiety hansen stared at him stepped back farther milo remained in the dance positioned himself inches from hansens worried eyes hansen said i hope this doesnt take long the house was cool and dim saturated with the geriatric reek of camphor the chipped terracotta tiles of the entry hall floor continued up the steps of a narrow brassrailed staircase thirteenfoot ceilings were crossed by carved oak beams the wood was wormholed and aged nearly black the walls were handtroweled plaster two shades deeper than the external vanilla and dotted with empty niches smallish leaded windows some with stainedglass insets picturing new testament scenes constricted the light the colored panes projected rainbow dust beams the furniture was heavy and dark and clumsy no art on the walls the place felt like some illattended church nicholas hansen motioned us to a sagging fringed sofa upholstered in a scratchy tapestry fabric sat down facing us in a bruised leather chair and folded his hands in his lap i really cant imagine what this could be about lets start with the kings men said milo you do remember them hansen gave his watch another glance cheap digital thing with a black plastic band busy day said milo hansen said i may have to interrupt if my mother wakes up shes dying of colon cancer and the day nurse took the afternoon off sorry said milo with as little sympathy as id ever heard him offer shes eightyseven said hansen had me when she was fortyfive i always wondered how long id have her he plucked at a cuff of his sweatshirt yes i remember the kings men why would you connect me to them after all these years your name came up in the course of our investigation hansen showed yellow teeth again his eyes creased in concentration my name came up in a murder investigation a very nasty murder something recent milo crossed his legs this will go more quickly if i ask the questions another man mightve bristled hansen sat in place like an obedient child yes of course im just the kings men was just a stupid high school thing slight slur in his voice his eyes shot to the ceiling beams a pliable man the addition of booze made milo s job easier milo pulled out his notepad when he clicked his pen open hansen was startled but he remained in place lets start with the basics you were a member of the kings men id really like to know how you never mind lets do this quickly said hansen yes i was a member for my last two years at uni i arrived as a junior my father was an executive with standard oil we moved around a lot had lived on the east coast during my junior year father was transferred to la and we ended up renting a house in westwood i was pretty disoriented its a disorienting time anyway right i guess i was irritated at my parents for uprooting me id always been obedient an only child overly adult i guess when i got to uni i figured id rebel and the kings men seemed a good way to do it why because they were a bunch of goofoffs said hansen rich kids who did nothing but drink and dope they got the school to recognize them as a legitimate service club because one of their fathers owned real estate and he let the school use his empty lots for fundraisers car washes bake sales that kind of thing but the men werent about service just partying a dad with real estate said milo vance coury yes vances father hansens voice rose at the word father and milo waited for him to say more when hansen didnt he said whens the last time you saw vance coury high school graduation said hansen i havent been in touch with any of them thats why this whole thing is rather odd another glance upward hansen had never boned up on the body language of deception you havent seen any of them since graduation said milo not once by the time we graduated i was moving in another direction they were all staying here and id been accepted at columbia my father wanted me to go to business school but i finally accomplished a genuine rebellion and majored in anthropology what i was really interested in was art but that wouldve caused too much tumult as is father was far from amused but mother was supportive a third look at his watch then a glance toward the stairs only child hoping for maternal reprieve milo said you didnt really answer the question have you seen any of the other kings men since graduation hansens muddy irises took yet another journey upward and his mouth began to tremble he tried to cover it with a smile crossed his legs as if imitating milo the result was contortive not casual i never saw vance or the cossacks or brad larner but there was another boy luke chapman though were talking twenty years ago for gods sake luke was what is it you want to know exactly milos jaw tightened his voice turned gentle and ominous luke was what hansen didnt answer milo said you do know hes dead hansen nodded very sad what were you going to say about him that he wasnt very bright when after graduation did you see him look said hansen you need to understand the context he luke was no genius honestly he was dull despite that id always thought of him as the best of them thats why does this have to do with lukes drowning when did you see chapman just once said hansen when my first year in grad school what month winter break december so just weeks before chapman drowned hansen blanched and brought his eyes back to the carved beams he sank in his chair and looked small incompetent liar painting had been a better choice than the corporate thing milo slapped his pad shut shot to his feet strode to hansen and placed his hand on the back of hansens chair hansen looked ready to faint tell us about it said milo youre saying luke was murdered all those years ago who do you suspect tell us about the meeting with chapman i this is hansen shook his head i could use a drink may i get you something as well no but feel free to fortify yourself hansen braced himself on the arms of his chair and rose milo followed him across the tiled entry across an adjoining dining room and through double doors when the two of them returned hansen had both his hands wrapped around a squat cutcrystal tumbler halffilled with whiskey when he sat down milo resumed his stance behind the chair hansen twisted and looked up at him drained most of the whiskey rubbed the corners of his eyes start with where right here in the house hansen emptied the glass luke and i hadnt been in contact high school was long out of my consciousness they were stupid kids stupid rich kids and the thought that id found them cool was laughable i was an east coast nerd scared witless about making yet another lifestyle switch thrown into a whole new world tanned bodies loud smiles social castes it was a sudden overdose of california luke and i had world history together he was flunking he was this big blond lunk who could barely read or spell i felt sorry for him so i helped him gave him free tutoring he was dull but not a bad kid built like a fridge but he never went out for sports because he preferred drinking and smoking dope that was the essence of the kingers they made a big point of not engaging in anything but partying and at that specific time in my life that kind of abandon seemed attractive so when luke invited me to join the group i jumped at it it was somewhere to belong i had nothing else were you welcomed by the others not with open arms but they werent bad said hansen tested me out i had to prove myself by drinking them under the table that i could do but i never really felt comfortable with them and maybe they sensed it because toward the end they got distant also there was the economic thing theyd figured i was rich thered been a rumor circulating that father owned an oil company when i told them the truth they were clearly disappointed hansen passed the tumbler from hand to hand stared at his knees listen to me going on about myself he took a deep breath thats the sum total i hung out with them for the second half of my junior year and a bit into my senior year then it tapered off when i got into columbia that put them off they were all planning to live off their parents money in la and keep partying milo said so you were home on break and luke chapman just dropped in yes it was out of the blue said hansen i was spending my time holed up in my room drawing luke showed up unannounced and mother let him in hansen hefted the empty tumbler what did he want said milo hansen stared at him what was the topic nicholas he looked terrible said hansen disheveled unwashed smelled like a barn i didnt know what to make of it then he said nick man you were the only one who ever helped me and i need you to help me now my first thought was hed gotten some girl pregnant needed guidance about where to get an abortion something like that i said what can i do for you and thats when he broke down just fell apart rocking and moaning and saying everything was fucked up he held up the tumbler i could use a refill milo turned to me the bottles on the counter nicholas and i will wait here i entered the kitchen and poured two fingers from the bottle of dalwhinnie singlemalt on the counter taking in details as i made my way back yellow walls old white appliances bare stainlesssteel counters empty dish drainers i opened the refrigerator carton of milk package of sweating bacon something in a bowl that looked like calcified gruel no food aromas just that same mothball stink the whiskey bottle had been threequarters empty nicholas hansen cared little for nutrition was a solitary drinker back in the living room milo was ignoring hansen and flipping the pages of his notepad hansen sat paralytically still i handed him the drink and he took it with both hands and gulped milo said luke fell apart i asked him what was wrong but instead of telling me he pulled out a joint and started to light up i grabbed it out of his hand and said what do you think youre doing i guess i sounded irritated because he shrank back and said oh nick we really fucked up and thats when he let it all out hansen finished the second scotch milo said go on hansen regarded the empty glass seemed to be considering another shot but placed the tumbler on a side table he told me thered been a party a big one some place in bel air an empty house whose house he didnt say and i didnt ask said hansen i didnt want to know why not said milo because id moved on they were long gone from my consciousne what did chapman tell you about the party said milo hansen was silent looked anywhere but at us we waited him out he said oh my oh my indeed said milo hansen snatched up the tumbler i could use a milo said no a girl got killed at the party i really need another drink what was the girls name i dont know hansens irises were wet boggy mud you dont know said milo all luke said was thered been a party and things had gotten wild and theyd been fooling around with a girl and things got even wilder and all of a sudden she was dead fooling around no answer all of a sudden said milo thats how he put it said hansen milo chuckled hansen recoiled nearly dropped the tumbler how was this sudden death brought about nick hansen bit his lip milo barked come on hansen jumped in his chair and fumbled the glass again please i dont know what happened luke didnt know what had happened that was the point he was confused disoriented what did he tell you about the girl he said vance tied her up they were partying with her then all of a sudden it was bloody a bloody scene like one of those movies we used to watch in high school slasher movies worse than that nick its much worse when its real i got sick to my stomach said what the hell are you talking about luke just babbled and blubbered and kept repeating that theyd fucked up who all of them the kingers no name for the girl he said hed never seen her before she was someone vance knew and vance noticed her and picked her up literally slung her over his shoulder and carried her down to the basement she was stoned in the basement of the party house thats where they fooled with her fooled with her said milo im trying to be accurate thats how luke put it did chapman take part in the rape hansen mumbled whats that demanded milo he wasnt sure but he thought he did he was stoned too everyone was he didnt remember kept saying the whole thing was like a nightmare especially for the girl said milo i didnt want to believe him said hansen id come home from yale for ten days the last thing i needed was this dropping in my lap i figured it had been a dream some sort of drug hallucination back when id known luke he was always on something you said he wanted help from you what kind of help he wanted to know what to do i was a twentytwoyearold kid for christs sake what position was i in to give him advice hansens fingers tightened around the tumbler he couldnt have picked a worse time to drop it on me people were telling me i had talent i was finally standing up to father the last thing i needed was to get sucked into some horror it was my right not to get sucked in and i dont know why you feel you have a right to so you just dropped it said milo whatd you tell chapman no said hansen thats wrong i didnt drop it not completely i told luke to go home and keep all of it to himself and when i figured things out id get back to him he listened to you hansen nodded it was what he wanted to hear he thanked me after he left i kept telling myself it had been the drugs talking i wanted to drop it but something happened to me that year a painting class id taken the teacher was an austrian expatriate a holocaust survivor hed told me horror stories of all the good citizens whod claimed to know nothing about what was going on what liars they were how vienna had cheered when hitler took power and everyone had turned a blind eye to atrocities i remembered something hed said the austrians have convinced themselves that hitler was german and beethoven was austrian that stuck with me i didnt want to be like that so i went over to the library and checked out the newspapers for the time period luke said the murder had taken place but there was nothing not an article not a single word about any girl being murdered in bel air so i decided luke had been freaking out hansens shoulders dropped he allowed himself a weak smile trying to relax milo played the silence and hansen tightened up again so youre saying there really did you ever call chapman back like you said you would i had nothing to tell him so whatd you do next i went back to yale chapman ever try to reach you at yale no when were you in la next not for years the next summer i was in france avoiding la no said hansen looking for other things such as painting opportunities when did you move back to la three years ago when mother became ill where were you living before that new york connecticut europe i try to spend as much time as i can in europe umbria the light what about austria said milo hansens face lost color so youre here to take care of your mother thats the only reason when she passes ill sell the house and find myself somewhere peaceful meanwhile said milo you and your old buddies are neighbors theyre not my bud ever make you nervous your being a semipublic figure and having a bunch of murderers knowing youre back in town im not semipublic said hansen im not any kind of public i paint finish one canvas and start another i never truly believed anything happened what did you think when you learned about chapman drowning that it was an accident or suicide why suicide because hed seemed so upset suicide out of remorse said milo hansen didnt answer you believed chapman had been hallucinating but you left town without trying to convince him there was nothing to worry about it wasnt my what is it you want from me details about what the murder i dont have any more details why would chapman feel remorse for something that never happened i dont know im not a mind reader this whole thing is insane not a word in the papers for twenty years and all of a sudden someone cares milo consulted his pad howd you learn about chapmans death mother included it in her weekly letter howd you feel about it what do you think i felt terrible said hansen how else could i feel you felt terrible then just forgot about it hansen rose out of his chair spittle whitened the corners of his lips what was i supposed to do go to the police and repeat some farfetched stonedout story i was twentytwo for christs sake milo flashed him a cold stare and hansen slumped back down its easy to judge lets go over the details said milo the girl was raped in the basement whered chapman say they killed her hansen shot him a miserable look he said there was a big property next door to the party house an estate no one living there they brought her over there he said she was unconscious they took her into some wooded area and started talking about how they needed to make sure she didnt turn them in thats when it got bloody hansen covered his face and exhaled noisily whos they said milo all of them hansen said through his fingers the kingers who exactly was there names vance and luke garvey and bob cossack brad larner all of them the kingers said milo guys you dont see anymore guys youre not worried about being your neighbors hansens hands dropped should i be worried it does seem odd said milo for three years youve been living in la but youve never run into them its a big city said hansen big as you want it to be you dont run in the same social circles i dont have any social circle i rarely leave the house everythings delivered groceries laundry painting and taking mother to the doctor thats my world i thought prison milo said have you followed the others lives i know the cossacks are builders of some kind you see their names on construction signs thats it no idea what vance courys been up to no brad larner no milo wrote something down so your buddies took the nameless girl to the property next door and things just kind of got bloody they werent my buddies who did the actual killing luke didnt say what about the rape who initiated that he my impression was they all joined in but chapman wasnt sure if he participated or not maybe he was lying or in denial i dont know said hansen luke wasnt cruel but i can see him getting carried along but without the others he never wouldve done anything like that he told me hed felt immobilized as if his feet were stuck thats the way he phrased it my feet were stuck nick like in quicksand can you see the others doing something like that on their own i dont know i used to think of them as clowns maybe all im saying is luke was a big softie a big baby huey type of guy and the others the others werent soft so said milo the murder started out as a way to silence the girl hansen nodded but it progressed to something else nicholas if youd seen the body youd know that it was something you wouldnt want to paint oh lord said hansen did luke chapman make any mention at all of who initiated the murder hansen shook his head how about taking a guess said milo from what you remember about the kingers personalities vance said hansen without hesitation he was the leader the most aggressive vance was the one who picked her up if i had to guess id say vance was the first to cut her milo slapped his pad shut his head shot forward who said anything about cutting nicholas hansen turned white you said it you said it was ugly chapman told you theyd cut her didnt he maybe he couldve milo stood and stomped his way slowly toward hansen on echoing tiles came to a halt inches from hansens terrified face hansens hands rose protectively what else are you holding back nicholas nothing im doing my best do better said milo im trying hansens voice took on a whine its twenty years ago youre making me remember things i repressed because they disgusted me i didnt want to hear details then and i dont want to now because you like pretty things said milo the wonderful world of art hansen clapped his hands against his temples and looked away from milo milo got down on one knee and spoke into hansens right ear tell me about the cutting thats it he just said they started cutting her hansens shoulders rose and fell and he began weeping milo gave him a moment of peace then he said after they cut her what they burned her they burned her with cigarettes luke said he could hear her skin sizzle oh god i really thought he was making it up hansen sniffed wiped his nose with his sleeve let his head fall the back of his neck was glossy and creased like canned tallow milo said they burned her then what thats all that really is all luke said it was like it became a game he had to think of it as a game in order not to freak out completely he said hed watched and tried to pretend she was one of those inflatable dolls and they were playing with her he said it seemed to go on forever until someone i think it was vance i cant swear to it but probably vance said she was dead and they needed to get her out of there they bundled her up in something put her in the trunk of vances jaguar and dumped her somewhere near downtown pretty detailed for a hallucination said milo hansen didnt respond especially pressed milo for a dull guy like chapman you ever know him to be that imaginative hansen remained mute whered they take her nicholas i dont know where why the hell wasnt it in the papers hansen balled a hand into a fist and raised it chest high making a stab at assertiveness milo remained crouched but somehow increased his dominance hansen shook his head and looked away and cried some more whatd they do afterward had coffee said hansen some place in hollywood coffee and pie luke said he tried eating but threw up in the bathroom what kind of pie i didnt ask why wasnt there anything in the paper what would your theory be about that nicholas what do you mean said hansen given what you know about your buddies whats your theory i dont see what youre getting at milo got up stretched rolled his neck walked slowly to a leaded window turned his back on hansen think about the world you inhabit nicholas youre a successful artist you get thirty forty thousand dollars for a painting who buys your stuff thirty thousand isnt bigtime in the art world said hansen not compared to its a lot of money for a painting said milo who buys your stuff collectors but i dont see what that has to yeah yeah people of taste and all that but at forty grand a pop not just any collectors people of means said hansen milo turned suddenly grinning people with money nicholas he cleared his throat hansens muddy eyes rounded youre saying someone was bribed to keep it quiet something that horrible could be then for gods sake why didnt it stay quiet why is it coming to light now give me a theory about that too i dont have one think its in someones best interests to go public said hansen he sat up bigger moneys come into play is that what youre getting at milo returned to the sofa sat back comfortably flipped his pad open bigger money said hansen meaning im a total ass for talking to you you caught me off guard and used me he brightened suddenly but you screwed up you were obligated to offer me the presence of an attorney so anything ive told you is inadmissable you watch too much tv nicholas were obligated to offer you a lawyer if we arrest you any reason we should arrest you nicholas no no of course not milo glanced at me i suppose we could exercise the option obstruction of justice is a felony back to hansen charge like that whether or not you got convicted your life would change but given that youve cooperated hansens eyes sparked he pawed at the scant hair above his ears i need to be worried dont i about what them jesus what have i done im stuck here cant leave not with mother with or without mother leaving would be a bad idea nicholas if youve been straight really told us everything well do our best to keep you safe as if you give a damn hansen got to his feet get out leave me alone milo stayed seated how about a look at your painting what i meant what i said said milo i do like art my studios private space said hansen get out never show a fool an unfinished work hansen tottered laughed hollowly youre no fool youre a user how do you live with yourself milo shrugged and we headed for the door he stopped a foot from the knob by the way the pictures on your gallery website are gorgeous what is it the french call stilllifes nature morte dead nature now youre trying to diminish me milo reached for the door and hansen said fine take a look but i only have one painting in progress and it needs work we followed him up the brassrailed staircase to a long landing carpeted in defeated green shag three bedrooms on one end a single closed door off by itself on the north wing a breakfast tray was set on the rug a teapot and three plastic bowls bloodcolored jello softboiled egg darkened to ochre something brown and granular and crusted wait here said hansen i need to check on her he tiptoed to the door cracked it open looked inside returned still sleeping okay cmon his studio was the southernmost bedroom a smallish space expanded by a ceiling raised to the rafters and a skylight that let in southern sun the hardwood floors were painted white as was his easel whitelacquered flat file white paint box and brush holders glass jars filled with turpentine and thinner dots of color squeezed on a white porcelain palette fluttered in the milky atmosphere like exotic butterflies on the easel was an elevenbyfourteen panel hansen had said his current painting needed work but it looked finished to me at the center of the composition was an exquisitely bellied blueandwhite ming vase rendered so meticulously that i longed to touch the gloss a jagged crack ran down the belly of the vase and brimming over its lip were masses of flowers and vines their brilliance accentuated animated by a burnt umber background that deepened to black at the edges orchids and peonies and tulips and irises and blooms i couldnt identify hot colors luminous striations voluptuous petals vaginal leaves vermiform tendrils all interspersed with ominous clots of sphagnum the fissure implied incipient explosion flowers what could be prettier hansens blooms gorgeous and boastful and flamevivid as they were said something else gleam and hue fraying and wilting at the edges from the shadows the black inexorable progress of rot conditioned air blew through a ceiling vent flat artificial filtered clean but a stink reached my nostrils the painting gave off the moist squalid seduction of decay milo wiped his brow and said you dont use a model hansen said its all in my head milo stepped closer to the easel you alternate paint and glaze hansen stared at him dont tell me you paint cant draw a straight line milo got even nearer to the board and squinted kind of a flemish thing going on or maybe someone with an appreciation of flemish like severin roesen but youre better than roesen hardly said hansen unmoved by the compliment im a lot less than i was before you barged into my life you have diminished me ive diminished myself will you really protect me ill do my best if you cooperate milo straightened did luke chapman mention anyone else being present at the murder any of the other partygoers hansens fleshy face quivered not here please last question said milo no he mentioned no one else hansen sat down at the easel and rolled up his sleeves youll protect me he said in a dead voice he selected a sable brush and smoothed its bristles im going back to work there are some real problems to work out chapter when we were back on roxbury drive milo said believe his story i do so do i he said as we walked to our cars i also believe im a hypocrite what do you mean playing grand inquisitor with hansen making him feel like shit because he repressed twentyyearold memories i did the same damn thing with less of an excuse whats his excuse i said hes weak cut him open youll find a silly putty spine you sensed the weakness right away i said you noticed that huh yup moved right in on ol nicky got a nose for weakness doesnt that make me pleasant company when we reached the gray olds i said i know youre going to tell me im laying more shrink stuff on you but i dont believe your situations comparable to hansens he had access to firsthand information about the murder and kept it to himself for twenty years in order to do that he convinced himself chapman had been hallucinating but those details cigarette burns the way they moved janie say he knew better hansen engaged in two decades of selfdelusion and who knows what it did to his soul you tried to do your job and were ordered off the case following orders he gazed up the block absently fine i said torment yourself hansen paints i dont he said we all need our hobbies listen thanks for your time but i need to sort things out figure which way to go with this what about the main point we got from hansens story i said which is what you were getting at with that final question in the studio about anyone else being at the murder chapman spilled his guts to hansen but made no mention of caroline cossack or willie burns meaning they probably werent there despite that the cossacks stashed caroline at achievement house for six months and had her tagged with a behavioral warning burns returned to the streets got busted for dope took a big risk by getting himself a job at achievement house maybe he skipped on boris nemerov because of what hed seen at the party if he went to jail on the drug beef hed be a sitting duck burns as a witness maybe he followed the kings men because he figured thered be more doping and he could peddle more merchandise caroline couldve just been hanging with him or she wanted to hang out with her brothers the odd little sister whod always gotten shunted to the background the initial motive for janies murder was to silence her luke chapman may have died for the same reason caroline and burns wouldve been extreme liabilities victims not murderers he said and all the more likely to be dead those two photos preceding janies death shot a dead black guy and a mangled white female mental patient maybe whoever sent the book was trying to tell you about two other dbs except as you pointed out the dead black guy was in his forties which would be burnss age now not twenty years ago he took hold of the door handle i need to develop a few migraines over this ciao thats it what he said you go your way i go mine i said is there something you arent telling me his half second hesitation belied his answer i wish i had something not to tell alex look i appreciate your effort but we can go over theories till the second coming and it wont move me any closer to solving janie what will like i said i need to do some thinking alone sometimes he said alone helps i drove away wondering what he was keeping from me peeved at being shut out thinking about what didnt await me at home turned irritation to dread and before i knew it i was hunched over the wheel driving too fast going nowhere fast nothing worse than a big house when youre alone and i had no one to blame but myself id screwed things up royally despite bert harrisons wise counsel like most expert therapists the old man wasnt one for offering unsolicited advice but during my visit hed made a point of warning me off the paranoia trail when it came to robin sounds like small things have been amplified this is the girl for you had he sensed something sniffed out nuances of my impending stupidity why the hell hadnt i listened to him a blast of honks jolted me id been sitting at the green light at walden and sunset for who knew how long and the cute young woman in the vw golf behind me thought that justified a snarl and a stiff finger i waved at her and sped off she passed me stopped talking on her cell phone long enough to flip me off again nearly collided with the curb as her vw struggled with the winding road i wished her well and returned to thoughts of bert harrison the other opinions the old man voiced that day outwardly casual remarks tossed out at the tail end of my visit coincidence or the old therapists trick of harnessing the power of the parting word id used it myself hundreds of times berts parting shot had been to bring up caroline cossack out of context well after wed stopped discussing the ingalls case that girl so monstrous alex if its true you seem skeptical i do find it hard to believe that a young female would be capable of such savagery then bert had gone on to express doubts about willie burns as a lust murderer a junkie in the strict sense heroin opiates are the great pacifiers ive certainly never heard of a junkie acting out in such a sexually violent manner now it looked as if bert had been right on was all that the intuition of an exceptionally insightful man or did bert know had schwinn continued to work the ingalls case for years after leaving the department had he told bert about what hed unearthed bert had admitted knowing schwinn but claimed the relationship was casual chance meetings in theater lobbies what if it was anything but casual schwinn had fought his way out of drug addiction and perhaps hed done so on his own but that kind of progress wouldve been helped along by treatment and bert harrison had trained in addiction treatment at the federal hospital in lexington schwinn as berts patient psychotherapy where all kinds of secrets tumbled out if any of that was true bert had lied to me and that could explain all those apologies hed tendered his contrition so puzzling at the time that id wondered about berts deteriorating mental state bert had encouraged my suspicions one regresses loses ones sense of propriety forgive me theres nothing to forgive i remembered how hed wiped away tears is everything okay bert everything is as it should be seeking forgiveness because he knew he had to lie to me protecting schwinn because of patient confidentiality but schwinn had been buried seven months ago and any privilege had died along with his body perhaps bert held himself to higher standards or maybe he was protecting a living patient in drug treatment the kind of intensive treatment bert wouldve prescribed for a longterm addict like schwinn family members were included and marge was all the family schwinn had had left bert shielding marge it made sense i strained to recall anything in our conversation that pointed to that and came up with one quickly bert had deflected any suggestion marge couldve mailed the murder book protecting her or had bert been the messenger a doctor honoring his patients last wishes what if janies murder had eaten at schwinn corroded his lateinlife serenity to the point where he felt impelled to stir up the ashes because even though the department had booted him out and outwardly hed made major life changes pierce schwinn had held on to a detectives bulldog sensibilities janie wasnt only a cold case shed been schwinns last case one massive overdose of unfinished business perhaps schwinn had connected the unsolved murder with his breakdown bert would have wanted to help him with that the more i thought about it the better it fit schwinn came to trust bert showed bert the murder book eventually bequeathed the album to his psychiatrist knowing bert would do the right thing berts involvement would also explain why the bluebound horror had been mailed to me hed met milo a couple of times but he knew me much better and was well aware of my relationship with milo for bert my handing over the book to milo would have been a certainty fingerprints wiped clean i could see the old man doing that what i couldnt see was him driving down to la stealing ricks porsche and returning the car with the original ingalls file on the front seat the gta combined with the hiv detective rumor and that weird encounter with the man who called himself paris bartlett had big blue written all over it someone in the department or once associated with the department maybe even the cop buddy id hypothesized stepping in once the wheels had begun to turn theories bert had just called to let me know he was leaving town a few days ago hed mentioned nothing about travel plans escaping because of my visit bert and i werent everyday acquaintances thered be no reason for him to notify me of his itinerary unless he was trying to distance himself from the fallout or call me off by the time i made it to the bridle path that leads to my property my head ached with conjecture i pulled up in front of my house our house the damn thing looked cold white foreign i sat in the seville with the engine running turned the car around and drove back toward the glen you could go home again but what was the point my nerves were exposed wire sizzling with impulse maybe a long pretty drive would help cool them down alone milo was right about that chapter milo drove out of beverly hills mulling over the interview with nicholas hansen the guy was pathetic a mommas boy and a drunk no big challenge browbeating him into spilling but would hansen change his story once he had time to stew maybe call an attorney even if he did hold fast his tale amounted to thirdparty hearsay still milo knew what he had to do go home transcribe his notes of the interview making sure he got all the details down then stash the transcription with all the other good stuff he kept to himself the floor safe in his bedroom closet he took palm drive to santa monica then the diagonal shortcut to beverly driving like a gangsters chauffeur slower than usual checking the scenery all around scoping out the drivers sitting two three four car lengths behind the rented olds taking a different route than usual past la cienega then doubling back on rosewood as far as he could tell everything clear one thing the hansen interview had accomplished milo knew now that he couldnt let go of janie all these years hed coped with department bullshit and propped up his selfimage with secret little pep talks the psychobabble hed never share with anyone youre different noble heroic nonstereotypic gay warrior traversing a goddamn heterosexual universe rebel with a lost cause maybe all that selfdelusional swill was what had helped him conveniently forget janie but the moment alex had shown him that death shot his heartbeat and his sweat glands told him hed lived nearly half his life as the worst kind of chump conning himself was that insight if so it sucked he laughed out loud because cursing lacked imagination he and hansen were two peas in the same cowardly asscovering pod alex ever the shrink ever the friend had tried to spin it differently thank you very much doctor but that dont change the facts yeah old nicholas was a moral mollusk but meeting him had solidified things as he cruised through quiet west hollywood streets he formalized the next risky step get closer to the murder by leaning on someone whod actually been there the choice of targets was brad larner because twenty years after high school larner was low man among the kings men a loser whod worked for daddy then regressed to lackeying for his buddies one of those walkingaround guys a jerk a follower if vance coury and the cossacks were sharks larner was a remora ready to be plucked off the body corrupt milo ached to get the bastard in a quiet little room but larner wasnt living at his own home might very well be bunking with the cossacks the challenge was to snag him alone away from the others ahunting we will go normally even with his cop sensibilities he might not have noticed the navy blue saab heading his way down his own block west hollywood parking laws kept the streets fairly clear but permit parking was allowed and homeowners could grant guest passes so it was by no means weird to see an unfamiliar vehicle stationed near the curb but today hed mainlined adrenaline instead of vodka and was noticing everything so when the blue saab sped by him and he caught a half second eyeful of the driver he knew hed have to confirm what his brain was telling him he lowered his speed watched in his rearview as the saab turned onto rosewood and disappeared from view then he hooked a sharp u and went after it thank god for the brandnew rental hed picked up on the way home the gray dodge polaris had sagging bumpers and poorly camouflaged dings all over its abused chassis but with power to spare and windows tinted way past the legal limit it was exactly what he needed for this one hed forsaken hertz and avis and budget and patronized a guy he knew who ran a yard full of clunkers on sawtelle and olympic out past the south budget wheels for the spikyhaircutandskinnylapeledblacksuit types arriviste thespians and screenwriters and wouldbe dotcom gajillionaires who thought it way cool to tool around la in something outdated and ugly milo stomped the gas and the polaris responded laying down a nice little patch of vertebrarattling speed he followed the saabs trajectory making sure he didnt get too close when he spotted his quarry turning north on san vicente a mediumcongestion traffic flow allowed him to settle five lengths behind the saab and do a little creative swerving so he could keep his eye on the vehicle from what he could tell just the one male at the wheel now it was time to confirm the rest of his first impression the saab continued past melrose and santa monica turned left on sunset and got stuck in a serious jam caused by orange caltrans cones blocking off the righthand lane cones only no work or workers in sight the road agency was run by sadists and fools but this time milo blessed their mean little hearts as the congestion allowed him to jockey to the right catch sight of the saabs plates copy them down traffic moved fifty feet milo cell phoned dmv lied lord he was getting good at it liked it the plates came back to a oneyearold saab owned by craig eiffel bosc address on huston street in north hollywood no wants or warrants the chrome sludge oozed another few yards and milo did some more rude maneuvering and managed to close the gap between the dodge and the saab to three cars three more stopandgos and a smooth but slow flow resumed and he was alongside the saab passing on the right hoping the dodge wouldnt register in his quarrys memory and if it did that the blackened glass would cover him another half a second was all he needed mission accomplished the face was one hed seen before mister smiley the asshole whod accosted him at the hot dog stand claiming to be paris bartlett craig eiffel bosc eiffelparis cute boscbartlett stymied him for a moment then he got it two varieties of pears how imaginative sell it to the networks boscbartlett was moving his head in time to music oblivious and milo sped up got two cars ahead of the saab used the next red light to peer through the intervening toyota with its two little chicklets also bopping to some bassheavy hiphop thing he tried to get another look at craig eiffel bosc but caught only the girls hyperactivity and the toyota s windshield glare the right lane opened up and he eased back into it allowed the toyota and the saab to pass glancing to the left without moving his head as smiley pear zipped by then catching up and keeping pace with the saab just long enough to take a mental snapshot smiley was in shirtsleeves deep blue shirt with his skycolored tie loosened one paw on the wheel the other wrapped around a big fat cigar the saabs windows were untinted but shut and the interior was clouded with smoke not thick enough though to obscure the smile on craig eiffel boscs saghandsome countenance such a happy fellow toking tobacco and cruising and grooving in his zippy little swedish car on a sunny california day on top of the world well see about that craig bosc took coldwater canyon into the valley medium traffic made the tail easy not that bosc would be looking out for him the guy was no motorpro a real ninny for showing himself in plain view on milo s block the cigar and his grin said he couldnt even imagine the tables turning at ventura the saab turned right and drove into studio city where it pulled into the parking lot of a twentyfourhour yuppie gym on the south side of the boulevard craig bosc got out with a blue bag and half jogged to the front one good arm push and he was through the door and gone milo looked around for a vantage point a seafood restaurant across ventura offered a perfect view of the gym and the saab the surfandturf special sounded enticing he was hungry ravenous he indulged himself with an upgrade from the special extra big lobster alaskan crab legs sixteenounce top sirloin baked potato with sour cream and chives a mountain of fried zucchini all that washed down with cokes instead of beer because he needed his wits he ate slowly figuring bosc would be in there for at least an hour doing the old bodybeautiful thing by the time hed asked for the check and was working on his third coffee refill the saab was still in plain view he threw down money hazarded a trip to the mens room left the restaurant and sat in the dodge for another half hour before bosc emerged with wet hair back in his street clothes the blue shirt and black slacks minus the tie bosc bounced over to the saab disarmed the alarm but instead of getting in stopped to check his reflection in the side window fluffing his hair undoing the shirts second button milo watched the asshole show off that big smile for the glass audience bosc actually turned his head here and there appreciating his own damn face from multiple angles then bosc got in the saab and did an la thing drove less than a block before pulling into another parking lot a bar little cedarsided cube stuffed between a sushi bar and a bicycle shop a painted sign above the cedar door labeled the place as extras a banner to the right advertised the psychic benefits of happy hour half a dozen cars in the lot not too many happy people but craig bosc was grinning as he parked next to a tenyearold datsun z got out checked his teeth in the side mirror rubbed them with his index finger went inside extras milo d never enjoyed the ambience but he knew the bar by reputation watering hole for smalltime actroids pretty people whod arrived in la with a couple years of stanislavski or summer stock or college theater under their belts fueled by oscar fantasies but settling a thousand cattle calls later for the occasional walkons and crowd scenes and nonunion commercials that comprised percent of movie work craig eiffel bosc master thespian time for a bad review bosc stayed in the bar for another hour and a half and emerged alone walking a little more slowly and tripping once when the guy resumed driving west on ventura hed slowed to ten miles under the limit and was doing that dividing line nudge that made it clear he was under the influence a stop would offer the opportunity for a facetoface with bosc but pulling the turkey over for a deuce was the last thing milo wanted being off duty the most he could pull off would be a citizens arrest that meant holding on to bosc while calling a patrol car then having the blues take over and losing any hope of private time with mr smiles so he continued tailing the saab and hoped bosc wouldnt attract law enforcement attention or run someone over another short ride two blocks to a strip mall near coldwater where bosc went shopping for groceries at a ralphs deposited two paper bags in the saabs trunk made a fiveminute stop at a mailbox rentals place and returned to the car with a stack of envelopes under his arm mail drop same setup as the west hollywood pob where hed registered as playa del sol the tail resumed with milo two lengths behind as bosc turned right on coldwater traveled north past moorpark and riverside then east on huston quiet street apartments and small houses that made it a tough followalong even with the quarry oblivious and slightly intoxicated milo waited at the corner of coldwater and huston and kept his eye on the saab the blue car traveled one block then another before hooking left hoping bosc didnt live in some security building with a subterranean garage milo waited half a minute wheeled his way up a block and a half parked got out and continued on foot toward the spot where hed estimated the saab had come to rest luck was with him the blue car was out in the open sitting in the driveway of a onestory white stucco bungalow the house had a cement lawn and no fence a couple of scraggly palms brushing the front façade were the only concessions to green the driveway was twenty feet of cracked slab barely long enough for a single vehicle and it ended at the houses left side no backyard the bungalow sat on a fractional lot a sliver that had escaped teardown and development and behind the tiny house on the rearneighboring property loomed a fourstory apartment complex the glamour of hollywood milo returned to the dodge and drove twenty feet past the bungalow plenty of parked cars here but he managed to find a spot between a van and a pickup that afforded him a clean diagonal view boscs gymbarshopping excursion had taken up most of the afternoon and the sun was beginning to drop milo sat there his mm resting on his hip the weapon substantial and cool and comforting and he felt better than he had in a long time maybe bosc was in for the evening because by pm he hadnt shown himself and lights had gone on in the white bungalows front rooms lacy curtains obscured the details but the fabric was sheer enough for milo to make out flashes of movement bosc shifting from room to room then at nine a window on the right side of the house went cathodeblue tv quiet night for master thespian milo climbed out of the polaris stretched the stiffness from his joints made his way across the street he rang the bell and bosc didnt even bother to shout out a whos there just opened it wide the actor had changed into khaki shorts and a tight black tshirt that hugged his actorly physique one hand gripped a bottle of coors light the other held a cigarette casual loose eyes bloodshot and droopy until milos face registered and boscs wellformed mouth dropped open the actor didnt react to the roust like an actor would like any kind of civilian would his legs spread slightly and he planted his feet the beer bottle jabbed at milos chin and the cigarettes glowing tip headed for milos eyes splitsecond reaction tight little martial arts ballet milo was mildly surprised but hed come ready for anything and retracted his head the vicious kick he aimed at boscs groin landed true as did the chop to the back of boscs neck and the guy went down putting an end to any debate by the time bosc had stopped writhing on the floor and the green had gone out of his complexion his hands were cuffed behind him and he was panting and struggling to choke out words and milo was kicking the door shut he lifted bosc by the scruff and dumped him on the black leather couch that took up most of the living room the rest of the decor was a white beanbag chair a huge digital tv expensive stereo toys and a chromeframed poster of a wound red lamborghini countach bosc sprawled on the sofa moaning his eyes rolled back and he retched and milo stepped back from the expected projectile puke but bosc just dry heaved a couple of times got his eyes back on track looked up at milo and smiled and laughed something funny craig said milo boscs lips moved a bit and he struggled to talk through the grin sweat globules as big as jelly beans beaded up his forehead and rolled down his sculpted nose he flicked one away with his tongue laughed again spit at milos feet coughed and said oh yeah youre in big trouble chapter i sped up highway sucking in the grasssweet air of ojai thinking about bert harrison living here for decades lightyears from la for all that the old man had been unable to avoid the worst the city had to offer as i approached the bank of shops that included oneill chapin i eased up on the gas pedal the stationery shop was still shuttered and a closed sign was propped in the window of the celestial café midway through town i turned onto the road that led up to berts property drove a hundred feet from his driveway and parked behind a copse of eucalyptus berts old station wagon was parked out in front which told me nothing perhaps hed left for his overseas trip and had been driven to the airport or his departure was imminent and id enter to find him packing third choice hed lied about the journey wanting to discourage me from returning i admired bert wasnt eager to examine the possibilities returning to the seville i swung back onto the highway ready to tap the source directly the entry to mecca ranch was latched but unlocked i freed the arm drove through closed the gate behind me and motored up under the gaze of circling hawks maybe the same birds id seen the first time the corral floated into view glazed by afternoon sun marge schwinn stood in the center of the ring wearing a faded denim shirt tight jeans and riding boots her back to me talking to a big stallion the color of bittersweet chocolate nuzzling the animal stroking its mane the sound of my tires crunching the gravel made her turn by the time i was out of the seville shed left the enclosure and was heading toward me well hello there dr delaware i returned the greeting smiling and keeping my voice light the first time id met her milo hadnt introduced me by name or profession suddenly i felt good about the trip she pulled a blue bandana from her jeans pocket wiped both hands offered the right one for a firm hard shake what brings you up here followup she pocketed the bandana and grinned someone think im crazy no maam just a few questions i was looking into the sun and turned my head marges face was well shaded but she squinted and her eyes receded into a mesh of wrinkles the denim shirt was tailored tight her breasts were small and high that same combination of girlish body and old womans face what kind of questions doctor for starts have you thought of anything new since detective sturgis and i visited about anything your husband mightve said about that unsolved murder we discussed nope she said nothing about that her eyes drifted to the corral id love to chat but im kind of in the middle of things just a few more things including a sensitive topic im afraid she clamped both hands on hard lean hips what topic your husbands drug addiction did he overcome his habit by himself she dug a heel into the dirt and ground it hard like i told you by the time i met him pierce was past all that did he have any help getting there a simple question but she said what do you mean shed maintained the squint but her eyes werent shut tight enough to conceal the movement behind the lids quick shift down to the ground then a sidelong journey to the right another bad liar thank god for honest people did pierce have any drug treatment i said was he ever under the care of a doctor he really didnt talk about those days not at all he was past it i didnt want to rake things up didnt want to upset him i said she glanced over at the corral again i said how did pierce sleep pardon was pierce a sound sleeper or did he have trouble settling down at night he was pretty much a she frowned these are strange questions dr delaware pierce is gone what difference does it make how he slept just general followup i said what im interested in specifically is the week or so before the accident did he sleep well or was he restless her breath caught and the hands on her hips whitened what happened sir is what i told you pierce fell off akhbar now hes gone and im the one has to live with that and i dont appreciate your raking all this up im sorry i said you keep apologizing but you dont stop asking well i said heres the thing maybe it was an accident but you did ask for a drug scan on akhbar paid the coroner quite a bit of money to do it she took a step away from me then another shook her head plucked a piece of straw out of her hair this is ridiculous another thing i said detective sturgis never introduced me by name but you know who i am and what i do i find that kind of curious her eyes widened and her chest heaved he said you might do this who did no answer i said dr harrison she turned her back on me mrs schwinn dont you think we need to get to the bottom of things isnt that what pierce wouldve wanted something was keeping him up at night wasnt it unfinished business wasnt that the whole point of the murder book i dont know about any book dont you her lips folded inward she shook her head again clenched her jaw swiveled and caught a faceful of sun a tremor jogged through her upper body her legs were planted and they absorbed the motion she turned heel and half ran toward her house but i followed her inside she didnt try to stop me we sat in the exact same spots wed occupied a few days ago me on the living room couch she in the facing chair the last time milo had done all the talking as he usually does when i tag along but now it was my game and god help me despite the anguish of the woman sitting across from me i felt cruelly elated marge schwinn said you guys are spooky mind readers we guys head doctors dr harrison and i i said she didnt answer and i went on dr harrison warned you i might be back dr harrison does only good i didnt argue she showed me her profile yes he was the one who told me who you were after i described you and that big detective sturgis he said your being here might mean things would be different different he said you were persistent a good guesser youve known dr harrison for a while a while the living room windows were open and a whinny from out in the corral drifted in loud and clear she muttered easy baby your relationship with dr harrison was professional i said if youre asking was he my doctor the answer is yes he treated us both pierce and me separately neither of us knew it at the time with pierce it was the drugs with me it was i was going through a depression a situational reaction dr harrison called it after my mother passed she was ninetythree and id been taking care of her for so long that being alone was all the responsibility started bearing down on me i tried to go it alone then it got to be too much i knew what dr harrison was had always liked his smile so one day i got up the courage to talk to him the admission the confession of weakness clenched her jaws i said was dr harrison the one who introduced you to pierce i met pierce at the end of by the time i was better able to take care of things again i was still talking to dr harrison from time to time but was off the antidepressants just like he said id be she leaned forward suddenly do you really know dr h well enough to understand what kind of man he is when we first started talking he used to come over every day to see how i was doing every day one time i came down with the flu and couldnt do my chores and he did them for me everything vacuumed the house washed and dried the dishes fed the horses cleaned up the stables he did that for four days running even made trips into town for supplies if id paid him by the hour id be dead broke i knew bert was a good man and a master therapist but her account astonished me i pictured him tiny aged purpleclad sweeping and hosing horse stalls and wondered what id have done in the same situation knew damn well id have fallen far short of that degree of caring what i was doing right now had nothing to do with caring not for the living how much was owed to the dead i said so you met pierce when things had smoothed out sounding wooden formulaic shrinky she nodded dr h told me i should get back into my old routine said my old habits had been good ones before mama got terminal i used to drive into oxnard and shop at randalls for feed old lady randall used to work the counter and she and mama were old friends and i used to like going in there and talking to her hearing the way things used to be then mrs randall took sick and her boys started working the counter and i had nothing to say to them that and my energies were flagging so i switched to a mailorder feed outfit that delivered when dr harrison said it would be good for me to get out i started going to randalls again thats where i met pierce she smiled maybe it was all part of his plan dr harrisons knowing pierce and me both figuring thered be some kind of chemistry there he always said no but maybe he was being modest like he always is whatever the truth there was a chemistry mustve been cause the first time i saw pierce he looked like nothing but an overthehill hippie and im an old republican ranch girl shook ronald reagans hand wouldnt normally be attracted to that type but something about pierce he had a nobility i know your detective friend probably told you stories about the way pierce used to be but he became a different man i said people change thats something i didnt learn till late in life when pierce finally got up the courage to ask me out for coffee he was so shy about it it was almost cute she shrugged maybe we met at just the right time the planets moving perfectly or something tiny smile or maybe dr harrisons a tricky one when did you tell dr harrison you were seeing pierce pretty soon after he said i know pierce told me he feels the same way about you margie thats when he told me hed known pierce for some time had been doing volunteer psychiatry at oxnard doctors hospital counseling sick and injured people burnt people after the montecito fire they put in a burn unit and he was their psychiatrist pierce wasnt any of those things he came into the emergency room having terrible seizures from his addiction dr harrison detoxified him then took him on as a patient he told me all this because pierce asked him to pierce had strong feelings about me but was deeply ashamed of his past depended on dr harrison to clear the air i still remember the way dr h phrased it hes a good man margie but hell understand if this is too much baggage for you to carry i said these hands have been hauling hay for forty years i can carry plenty after that pierces shyness mostly left him and we got close her eyes misted i never thought id find anyone and now hes gone she fumbled for the bandana and spit out laughter look at me what a sissy and look at you i thought you guys were supposed to make people feel better i sat there as she cried silently and wiped her eyes and cried some more a sudden shadow streaked the facing wall then vanished i turned in time to see a hawk shoot up into the blue and vanish foot stomping and snorting sounded from the corral redtails she said theyre good for the vermin but the horses never get used to them i said mrs schwinn what did pierce tell you about the unsolved case that it was an unsolved case what else nothing else he didnt even tell me the girls name just that she was a girl who got torn up and it was his case and hed failed to solve it i tried to get him to open up but he wouldnt like i said pierce always wanted to shelter me from his old life but he talked to dr harrison about the case youd have to ask dr harrison about that dr harrison never spoke to you about it he just said she trailed off and twisted so that all i could see was the outline of her jaw mrs schwinn the only reason it came up in the first place was because of pierces sleep hed started having dreams nightmares she turned suddenly and faced me howd you know about that what was it a real good guess pierce was a good man and good men dont take well to corruption i dont know about any corruption her voice lacked conviction when did the nightmares start i said a few months before he died two three months anything happen to bring them on not that i saw i thought we were happy dr harrison told me hed thought so too but turns out pierce had never stopped being plagued thats the word he used plagued by the case by failure dr harrison said pierce had been forced to walk away from the case when they railroaded him off the department he said pierce had fixed it in his mind that giving up had been some kind of mortal sin hed been punishing himself for years the drugs abusing his body living like a bum dr h thought hed helped pierce get past it but hed been wrong the nightmares came back pierce just couldnt let go she gave me a long hard stare pierce broke rules for years always wondered if hed have to pay one day he loved being a detective but hated the police department didnt trust anyone including your friend sturgis when he got railroaded he was sure sturgis had something to do with it when i was here with detective sturgis you said pierce had spoken kindly of him was that true not strictly she said pierce never breathed a word to me about sturgis or anyone else from his old life these are all things he told dr harrison and i was trying to keep dr harrison out of all this but yes pierce had changed his opinion about sturgis followed sturgiss career and saw he was a good detective found out sturgis was homosexual and figured he had to have a lot of courage to stay in the department what else did dr harrison tell you about the case just that walking away had stuck in pierces brain like a cancer thats what the nightmares were all about chronic nightmares i said chronic enough sometimes theyd hit pierce three four times a week other times hed be okay for a stretch then boom all over again you couldnt predict and that made it worse because i never knew what to expect when my head hit the pillow things got to a point where i was scared to go to bed started waking up at night myself her smile was crooked kind of funny id be lying there all wound up unable to sleep and pierced be snoring away and id tell myself it was finally over then the next night did pierce say anything during the nightmares not a word he just moved thrashed thats how id know a fit was coming on the bed would start moving thumping like an earthquake pierces feet kicking the mattress lying on his back kicking with his heels like he was marching somewhere then his hands would shoot up she stretched her arms toward the ceiling like he was being arrested then his hands would slam down fast start slapping the bed and waving around wild and soon hed be grunting and punching the mattress and kicking his feet never stopped then hed arch his back and freeze like he was paralyzed like he was building up steam to explode and you could see his teeth gnashing and his eyes would pop real wide but they werent looking at anything he was somewhere else some hell only he could see hed hold that frozen pose for maybe ten seconds then let go and start punching himself in the chest on the stomach on the face sometimes the next morning hed be bruised i tried to stop him from hurting himself but it was impossible his arms were like iron rods it was all i could do to jump out of the bed to avoid getting hit myself so id just stand there and wait for him to finish just before he was finished hed let out a howl this loud howl that would wake up the horses theyd start mewling and sometimes the coyotes would chime in that was something to hear coyotes screaming from miles away ever hear that when a pack of them goes at it its not like a dog barking its a thousand creatures gone crazy ululations the name for it theyre supposed to do it only when theyre killing or mating but pierces howling would get them going shed squeezed the bandana into a blue ball now she studied her fingers as they uncurled those coyotes were scared witless by the sound of pierces fear she offered me a drink that i declined got up and filled herself a glass of water from the kitchen tap when she sat back down i said did pierce have any memory of the nightmares nope when the fit was over hed just go back to sleep and thered be no mention of it the first time that happened i let it pass the second time i was shook up but still said nothing the third time i went to see dr harrison he listened and didnt say much and that evening he came by paid a visit to pierce alone in pierces darkroom after that pierce started seeing him for regular sessions again about a week in dr h had me over to his house and thats when he told me about pierce struggling to live with failure so you and pierce never talked about the case directly thats right i said nothing she said i know its hard for you to understand but thats what we were like close as two people can be but there were sides to each of us that we didnt get into i realize its not fashionable to hold on to privacy anymore everyone talks about everything to everyone else but thats phony isnt it everyones got secret parts of their mind pierce and i were just honest about admitting it and dr harrison said if thats the way we really wanted it that was our choice so bert had tried to edge husband and wife toward more openness and theyd resisted marge schwinn said it was the same with pierces drug problem he was too proud to expose himself to me so he used dr harrison as a gobetween we were content with that it kept things pleasant and positive between us did you ever ask dr harrison about the unsolved murder strong headshake i didnt want to know i figured for it to plague pierce it had to be really bad did the nightmares ever clear up after pierce started seeing dr harrison regularly again they faded to maybe two three times a month also pierces photography hobby seemed to help got him out of the house got him some fresh air was that dr harrisons idea she smiled yes he bought pierce the camera insisted on paying for it he does that gives people things there was a gal used to live in town marian purveyance ran the celestial café before aimee baker took charge of it marian came down with a muscle disease that wasted her away and dr harrison was her main comfort i used to visit marian during her final days and she told me dr harrison decided she needed a dog for companionship but marian was in no physical state to take care of a dog so dr harrison found one for her an old halflame retriever from the shelter that he kept at his house fed and bathed he brought it over to marians for a few hours each day that sweet old dog used to stretch out on marians bed and marian would lie there stroking it toward the end marians fingers wouldnt work and the dog mustve known because it rolled over right next to marian and put its paw on marians hand so shed have something to touch marian died with that old dog next to her and a few weeks later the dog passed on her eyes were fierce do you get what im saying young man dr harrison gives people things he gave pierce that camera and gave me a bit of peace by letting me know the nightmares had nothing to do with me because i was wondering if they did maybe pierces being cooped up here with an old spinster after all those years on his own was having a bad effect on him and lord forgive me when i watched pierce thrash around i couldnt help wonder if hed somehow backslid into drug use im ashamed to admit it but yes thats exactly what i wondered because it was drug seizures that brought him into the hospital in the first place and to my ignorant eye these looked like seizures but dr harrison assured me they werent said they were just bad nightmares that it was pierces old life rearing its ugly old head that i was nothing but good for pierce and shouldnt ever think otherwise that was a great relief so the nightmares thinned to two or three times a month that i could live with when the thumping started id just roll out of bed go to the kitchen for a glass of water walk outside to calm the horses and when id return pierced be snoozing away id hold his hand and warm it up the nightmares always turned his hands icy wed lie there together and id listen to his breathing slow down and hed let me hold him and warm him up and the night would pass another hawks swoop striated the wall she said those birds they must smell something the nightmares thinned i said but they returned the last few days before pierces death yes she said nearly choking on the word and this time i started getting worried because pierce didnt look so good in the morning he was wornout kind of clumsy slurring his words thats why i blame myself for letting him take akhbar he was in no shape to ride i shouldnt have allowed him to go off by himself maybe that time he did have some kind of seizure whyd you test akhbar for drugs that was just me being stupid what i really wanted to do was have pierce tested because despite what dr harrison had said when the nightmares came back i let myself lose faith in pierce again but after he died i couldnt bring myself to come out and admit my suspicions not to dr h or the coroner or anyone else so instead i laid them on poor akhbar figuring maybe once the subject of drugs came up someone would catch on and test pierce too and id know once and for all they did test pierce i said its standard procedure the drug screen came back negative i know that now dr harrison told me it was an accident plain and simple though sometimes i still cant help thinking pierce shouldnt have been riding alone because he wasnt looking good any idea why that last week was rough for him no and i dont want to know i need to put all this behind me and this isnt helping so could we please stop i thanked her and stood how far from here did the accident occur just a ways up the road id like to see the spot what for to get a feel for what happened her gaze was level do you know something you havent told me no i said thanks for your time dont thank me it wasnt a favor she leaped up walked past me to the door i said the spot get back on heading east and take the second turnoff to the left its a dirt path that leads up a hill then starts swooping down toward the arroyo thats where it happened pierce and akhbar tumbled from the rocks that look down into the arroyo and ended up at the bottom its a place pierce and i rode together from time to time when we did i used to lead about pierces photography no she said please no more questions i showed you pierces darkroom and his pictures and everything else the first time you were here i was going to say he was talented but one thing struck me there were no people or animals in his shots is that supposed to be some big psychological thing no i just found it curious did you well i didnt didnt bother me one bit those pictures were beautiful she reached around me and shoved the door open and when i asked pierce about it he had a very good answer said margie im trying to picture a perfect world chapter she stood by the seville waiting for me to leave i turned the ignition key and said did dr harrison mention taking a vacation him a vacation he never leaves why he told me he might be doing some traveling well hes certainly entitled to travel if he wants why dont you ask him youre going there right now arent you to check up on my story im going to talk to him about the unsolved case whatever she said doesnt bother me being checked up on because im not hiding anything thats the thing about not letting yourself get involved in hopeless things less to worry about the shame about my pierce was he never really learned that the turnoff shed described led to an oakshielded path barely wide enough for a golf cart branches scraped the seville s flanks i backed out left the car on the side of the road and hiked the spot where pierce schwinn had died was half a mile in a dry gully scooped out of a granite ledge and backed by mountainside a sere corridor that would fill during rainy seasons and transform to a green rushing stream now it was bleached the color of old bones and littered with silt rocks and boulders leathery leaves snarls of windsnapped branches the largest rocks tended toward ragged and knifeedged and glinted in the sun up against them a mans head wouldnt fare well i walked to the edge and stared down into the arroyo and listened to the silence wondering what had caused a welltrained horse to lose its footing contemplation and the warmth of the day lulled me into something just short of torpor then something behind me skittered and my heart jumped and the tip of my shoe curled over into open space and i had to jump back to avoid pitching over i regained my bearings in time to see a sandcolored lizard scurry into the brush stepping back from the ledge i cleared my head before turning and walking away by the time i reached the car my breathing had nearly returned to normal i drove back to the center of ojai cruised to signal street past the fieldstonelined drainage ditch and parked in the same eucalyptus grove where i peered through blue shaggy leaves at bert harrisons house thinking about what id say to bert if i found him thinking about pierce schwinns nightmares the demons that had come back to haunt him during the days before his death bert knew why bert had known all along no movement from the old mans house the station wagon was parked right where it had been after a quarter hour i decided it was time to make my way to the front door and deal with whatever i found or didnt just as i got out of the seville the door squeaked open and bert stepped out onto his front porch in full purple regalia cradling a large brown paper shopping bag in one arm i grabbed the seville s door before it clicked shut hurried back behind the trees and followed the old mans descent down the wooden staircase he loaded the bag on the station wagons passenger seat got behind the wheel stalled a couple of times finally fired the engine backing away from the house with excruciating slowness he took a long time to complete a threeway turn battling with the wheel manual steering a small man face intent hands planted at oclock oclock just the way they teach you in drivers ed sitting so low his head was barely visible above the door crouching low i waited until he drove past the old chevys tired suspension wasnt up to the semipaved road and it creaked and whined as it bounced by bert stared straight ahead didnt notice me or the seville i waited till hed passed from view then jumped in my own chariot power steering gave me an edge and i caught up in time to spot the wagon lurching east on i sat at the intersection as the chevy diminished to a dust mote on the horizon the empty road made following too risky i was still wondering what to do when a pickup truck loaded with bags of fertilizer came to a rolling stop behind me two hispanic men in cowboy hats farmworkers i motioned them around and they passed me and turned left interposing themselves between bert and me i set out behind the truck lagging a good ways behind a few miles later at the intersection the truck kept going south and bert managed a torturous overcautious right onto i stayed with him but increased my distance barely able to keep the wagon in sight he drove another couple of miles past private campgrounds and a trailer park and signs announced the impending arrival of lake casitas the public reservoir doubled as a recreational facility for all i knew the paper bag was filled with bread crumbs and bert was planning to feed the ducks but he veered off the road well before the lake swinging north at a corner that housed a singlepump filling station and a oneroom bait shop and grocery another unmarked trail this one dotted thinly with unpainted cabins set well back from the road a handpainted sign at one of the first properties advertised homemade berry cobbler and firewood after that no messages the underbrush grew thick here nurtured by a shadecanopy of ancient oaks and pittosporum and sycamores so twisted they seemed to writhe bert bounced along for another two miles oblivious to my presence before slowing and turning left keeping my eye on the spot where hed disappeared i pulled over and waited for two minutes then followed hed gone up a gravel drive that continued for two hundred feet then angled to the left and vanished behind an unruly hedge of agave the same spiky plants that fronted his own house no building in sight once again i parked and continued on foot hoping the wagons destination was measured in yards not miles staying off the gravel for quiets sake and walking on the bordering greenery i spotted the chevy another hundred feet up stationed haphazardly in the dirt lot of a tinroofed greenboarded house larger than a cabin maybe three rooms with a sagging front porch and a stovepipe chimney i edged closer found myself a vantage point behind the continuing agave wall the house was nestled by forest but sat on a drydirt clearing probably a firebreak diminishing sunlight spattered the metal roof a poorly shaped apricot tree grew near the front door ungainly and ragged but its branches were gravid with fruit i stayed there for nearly half an hour before bert reemerged pushing a man in a wheelchair i recalled the chair in his living room keeping it for a friend hed said dr harrison gives despite the mildness of the afternoon the man was wrapped in a blanket and wore a widebrimmed straw hat bert pushed him slowly and his head lolled bert stopped and said something to him if the man heard he gave no indication bert locked the chair went over to the apricot tree picked two apricots he handed one to the man who reached for it very slowly both of them ate bert held his hand to the mans mouth and the man spit the pit into his palm bert examined the seed placed it in his pocket bert finished his own apricot pocketed that pit too he stood there looking up at the sky the man in the wheelchair didnt budge bert unlocked the chair pushed it a few feet farther angled the chair and allowed me to catch a glimpse of the passengers face huge mirrored sunglasses below the straw hat dominated the upper half the bottom was a cloud of gray beard in between was skin the color of grilled eggplant i stepped out of the trees made no attempt to muffle the crunch of my footsteps on gravel bert turned abruptly locked eyes with me nodded resigned i came closer the man in the wheelchair said whos that in a low raspy voice bert said the fellow i told you about chapter craig bosc lay prone on his living room carpet smiling again plastic tiecuffs from milo s cop kit bound his ankles together and another set linked to the metal cuffs around his wrists secured him to a stout sofa leg not a hogtie milo had pointed out just a nice submissive position letting the guy know that any resistance would result in something more painful bosc offered no comment hadnt uttered a word since telling milo he was in big trouble now his eyes were closed and he kept the smile pasted on his face maybe acting but not a drop of sweat on his movie star face one of those psychopaths with a low arousal rate despite milos having the upper hand bosc looked too damn smug and milo felt moisture running down his own armpits he began searching the house bosc opened his eyes and laughed as milo walked around the kitchen opening cabinets and drawers checking boscs bachelor fridge beer wine piña colada mix three jars of salsa an open can of chiliconwhatever as milo checked the freezer bosc chuckled again but when milo turned to look at him the guys eyes were shut tight and his body had gone loose and he mightve been napping nothing hidden behind the ice trays milo moved to the bedroom found a closet full of designer duds too many garments for the space everything crammed together on cheap wire hangers some stuff crumpled on the floor among two dozen pairs of shoes on the top shelf were three tennis rackets a hockey stick an old deflated basketball and a fuzzy blackened leather thing that had once been a football joe jocks sentimental memories a pair of thirtypound ivanko dumbbells sat in the corner next to a sixtyinch tv vcrdvd combo a mockwalnut video case held action thrillers and a few runofthemill porno tapes in lurid boxes busty blondes playing orificebingo boscs threedrawer dresser offered up rumpled underwear and socks and tshirts and gym shorts it wasnt till milo hit the bottom drawer that things got interesting buried beneath a collection of gap sweatshirts were three guns a mm identical to milo s department issue a sleek black glock complete with german instructions and a silver derringer in a black leather carrying case all three loaded additional ammo was stored at the rear of the drawer next to the guns was a small cache that added up to boscs personal history a north hollywood high yearbook fifteen years old revealed that craig eiffel bosc had played tight end for the varsity football squad pitched relief for the baseball team and served as a basketball point guard three letters boscs grad shot showed him to be cleancut and gorgeous flashing that same cocky smile next came a black leatheroid scrapbook with stickon letters that spelled out sir craig on the cover inside were plasticsheathed pages that made milo flash to the murder book but nothing bloody here the first page held a certificate from valley college attesting that bosc had earned a twoyear associate degree in communications from north hollywood high to valley both were within a bicycle ride to boscs house valley boy hadnt moved around much next came boscs honorable discharge from the coast guard hed been stationed at avalon on catalina island probably earned himself a nice golden tan while discharging his duty in scuba gear at the back of the album were five pages of polaroids showing bosc screwing a variety of women all young and blonde and buxom the emphasis upon closeup insertion and boscs grinning face as he kneaded breasts and pinched nipples and rearended his companions the girls all wore sleepy expressions none seemed to be playing for the camera stoned cuties caught unawares all appeared to be in their early to midtwenties with big bleached hair and outoffashion dos that made milo think smalltown cocktail waitress a few plain ones one or two real lookers for the most part an averagelooking bunch not up to the level of the babes in the porno videos but the same general type another indication bosc had a limited range milo searched for the hidden camera figuring it would be focused on the bed and found it quickly little pencillens gizmo concealed in the vcr box sophisticated bit of apparatus it stood out among the general shoddiness of boscs apartment and made milo wonder also stashed in the box were several tightly rolled joints and half a dozen tabs of ecstasy kiss the girls and make them stoned naughty naughty he returned to the scrapbook flipped to the next page wasnt really surprised at what he found but still the confirmation was unsettling and sweat gushed from every pore certificate of boscs graduation from the la police academy ten years ago then a group shot and an individual photo of bosc in his probationers uniform cleancut madefortv cop that same obnoxious grin the subsequent paperwork recounted boscs lapd progress a couple years of north hollywood patrol before promotion to detectivei and transfer to valley auto theft where hed spent three years as an investigator and left as a dii cars fasttrack promotion for a hotwire cowboy bastard probably had a collection of master keys to every known make and model hidden somewhere with that kind of knowhow and equipment boosting ricks porsche and returning it vacuumed and wiped clean of prints wouldve been a sleepwalk for detective bosc after cartime the guy had been moved downtown to parker center records then administration then a year with internal affairs finally a kick up to diii and his current assignment administrative staff at chief broussards office the bastard was an executive aide to john g milo disconnected the pencil camera brought it and the homemade pornos and the dope back to the living room bosc was still working on maintaining his mellow but milos footsteps opened his eyes and when he saw what milo was showing him he flinched then he recovered smiled gee you must be a detective milo held an etab under boscs nose bad boy craig im supposed to be worried pocketful of felonies georgie porgie another country heard from said bosc you think john gs gonna protect you something tells me the chief doesnt know about your film career boscs eyes got hard and cold offering a glimpse of the meanness that lurked beneath the prettyboy façade he said what i think is youre fucked laughter in the ass then again milo hefted the camera and the drugs bosc said you think youre seeing something but youre not none of that exists he shook his head and chuckled you are so fucked milo laughed along with him stepped forward placed his foot on one of boscs shins and bore down bosc cried out in agony tears filled his eyes as he struggled to twist away milo lifted his shoe you assholefuck bosc panted you stupid faggot fuck scuse me craigo go ahead said bosc catching his breath youre only digging your own grave milo was silent boscs smile returned you just dont get it do you this is lfuckinga its not what you do its who you know connections said milo got yourself an agent yet if you had a brain youd be an ape said bosc you gain access to my premises with a clear b ekidnap combo then add assault were talking major felony prison time to the next millennium you think any of that shit youre holdings going to stand up evidentiarywise ill say you planted it milo fanned the photos its not my dick in these thats for sure said bosc yours would be half the size and packed in fudge milo smiled youre out of it man said bosc have been from the beginning always will be no matter how many s you close no good deed goes unpunished man the longer you keep me here the more screwed you are and so is your shrink buddy what does he have to do with it bosc smiled and closed his eyes again and for a moment milo thought the guy would revert to silence but a few seconds later bosc said its a game you and the shrink are pawns whose game kings and bishops john g and walter obey and the cossack brothers boscs eyes opened cold again colder stick your head up your ass and get yourself a clue now let me go and maybe ill help you out snapping out the order milo placed the contraband on a table paced the room as if considering compliance suddenly he hurried back to boscs side kneeled down next to bosc placed the tip of his finger on boscs shin precisely on the spot where his shoe had dug in bosc began to sweat chess analogy said milo how erudite bobby fischer now tell me why you ripped off my car and put on that show at the hot dog stand and rented a postoffice box under playa del sol and were snooping around my house today all in a days work said bosc at john gs request bosc didnt answer milo pulled out his gun and pressed the barrel into the soft tan flesh under boscs chin details he demanded boscs lips jammed shut milo retracted the weapon as bosc laughed milo said your problem craig is you think youre a knight but youre a shiteating pawn he rapped the butt of the gun against boscs shin hard enough to evoke an audible crack he waited for bosc to stop crying then raised the gun again boscs panicked eyes followed the weapons ascent and he scrunched his eyes and sobbed out loud milo said craig craig and began to lower the weapon bosc yelled please please no began jabbering within minutes milo had what he wanted good old pavlovian conditioning would alex be proud chapter bert harrison placed a hand on the shoulder of the man in the wheelchair the man rolled his head and hummed i saw my image doubled in his mirrored lenses a pair of grim strangers i said my names alex delaware mr burns willie burns smiled and rolled his head again orienting to my voice the way a blind man does the skin between his white beard and the huge lenses was cracked and scored stretched tight over sharp bones his hands were long and thin purplish brown the knuckles lumped arthritically the nails long and yellowed and seamed across his legs was a soft white blanket not much bulk beneath the fabric pleased to meet you he said to bert am i doc he wont hurt you bill he will want to know things things said burns once upon a time he hummed some more highpitched voice offkey but somehow sweet i said bert im sorry i had to follow you as you said you had to it was alex he said quieting me with a soft palm against my cheek when i found out you were involved i thought this might happen found out you sent me the murder book bert shook his head you didnt i said then who i dont know son pierce sent it to someone but never told me who he never told me about the book at all until the week before he died then one day he brought it to my house and showed it to me i had no idea hed gone that far collecting mementoes collecting nightmares said bert as he turned the pages he cried willie burns stared sightlessly at the treetops humming whered schwinn get the photos bert some were his own cases others he stole from old police files hed been a thief for quite some time his characterization not mine he shoplifted habitually took jewelry and money and drugs from crime scenes consorted with criminals and prostitutes he told you all this over a very long period confessing i said im no priest but he wanted salvation did he get it bert shrugged last time i checked there were no hail marys in the psychiatric repertoire i did my best he glanced at willie burns how are you feeling today bill im feeling real good said burns considering he shifted his face to the left nice breeze coming in from the hills can you hear it that plunking of the leaves like a nice little mandolin like one of those boats in venice i listened saw no movement among the trees heard nothing bert said yes it is pretty willie burns said you know its getting kinda thirsty out here maybe i could have something to drink please bert said of course i wheeled burns back into the green board house the front room was barely furnished one couch along the window and two bright green folding chairs pole lamps guarded two corners framed magazine prints garden scenes painted in giverny colors hung askew on plasterboard walls between the chairs a wide pathway had been left for the chair and the rubber wheels had left gray tracks that led to a door at the rear no knob just a kickplate push door wheelchairfriendly the kitchen was an arbitrary space to the right pine cabinets sheetmetal counters a twoburner stove upon which sat a copperbottomed pot bert took a diet lemon snapple from a bulbous white refrigerator wrestled with the lid finally got it loose and handed the bottle to willie burns burns gripped the bottle with both hands and drank down half adams apple rising and falling with each gulp then he placed the glass against his face rolled it back and forth along his skin and let out a long breath thanks dr h my pleasure bill bert looked at me you might as well sit i took one of the folding chairs the house smelled of hickory chips and roasted garlic a string of dried cloves hung above the stove along with a necklace of dried chilies i spotted other niceties jars of dried beans lentils pasta a handpainted bread box gourmet touches in the vestpocket galley i said so you have no idea how the murder book got to me bert shook his head i never knew you had anything to do with it until marge told me you and milo had been to visit and talked to her about an unsolved murder he began to lower himself onto the second folding chair but straightened and stood lets get some air youll be okay for a few minutes bill burns said more than okay well be right outside enjoy the view we walked into the shade of the surrounding trees bert said you need to know this bill doesnt have much longer nerve damage brittle diabetes serious circulation problems hypertension theres a limit to how much care i can give him and he wont go to a hospital the truth is no one can really help him too many systems down he stopped and smoothed a purple lapel hes a very old man at fortythree how long have you been taking care of him i said a long time nearly twenty years id guess he didnt answer we walked some more in slow aimless circles no sound issued from the forest not a trace of the music willie burns had heard howd you meet him i said at a hospital in oxnard same place you met schwinn his eyes widened i said i was just over at marges place ah once a shrink well thats true he said but pierces being there wasnt really a coincidence hed been tracking bill for a while not very successfully and not very consistently because his amphetamine habit had rendered him pretty much incapacitated occasionally hed grow lucid convince himself he was still a detective make a stab at investigating then hed binge and drop out of sight somehow over the years through his criminal contacts he managed to figure out that bill had come up the coast he knew bill would need medical care and eventually he pinpointed the hospital though not until well after bill had been discharged but he began hanging around checking himself in for spurious reasons they had him tagged as an addicted hypochondriac he was trying to get access to burnss records bert nodded the hospital staff thought he was just another downattheheels junkie out to steal drugs as it turns out he was really ill an oncall neurologist who didnt know him ordered some testing and found a lowlevel seizure disorder petit mal mostly some temporal symptoms all due to drug toxicity they prescribed anticonvulsants with mixed results admitted him for shortterm care several times but i was never on duty during those periods one day he had a grand mal seizure out in the parking lot and they brought him into the er and i was on call one thing led to another willie burns needed medical care because he was burned in a house fire bert sighed youre as skillful as ever alex a house on street in watts a neighborhood where a black man would be comfortable hiding out where a white face would stand out a white police detective named lester poulsenn was assigned to guard burns and caroline cossack and one night he was shot and the house was torched as cover a highranking cop murdered but lapd kept it quiet interesting dont you think bert he remained silent i went on its a safe bet poulsenn got ambushed by the people sent to get rid of caroline and willie people whod pulled off an ambush before and murdered a bail bondsman named boris nemerov burnss bondsman did he tell you about that nod it came out in therapy bill felt guilty about causing nemerovs death he would have liked to come forward to come clean about what he saw but that would have put him in mortal danger whats his version of the ambush he phoned nemerov for help because nemerov had always been kind to him he and nemerov arranged a meeting but nemerov was followed and murdered and stuffed in the trunk of his car bill was hiding nearby saw it all knew nemerovs death would be blamed on him why was burns offered a police guard in the first place he had contacts in the police department hed worked as an informant but after poulsenns and nemerovs murders the department let him dangle contacts alex not friends the house was set on fire but burns and caroline got away how severe were their injuries she wasnt hurt his were severe he neglected the wounds didnt seek care until months later his feet had been scorched almost down to the tendons multiple infections set in at the time of admission the wounds were suppurating gangrenous flesh falling off the bone both feet were amputated immediately but sepsis had spread up into the long bones and additional amputation was necessary you could actually smell it alex like barbecue the marrow had been cooked we had some marvelous surgeons and they managed to preserve half of one femur a third of another created skin flaps and grafted them but bills lungs had also been burned as had his trachea and his esophagus he formed fibroid scars internally and removing the damaged tissue required additional multiple surgeries were talking years alex he bore the agony in silence i used to sit by the whirlpool as the skin sloughed off not a whimper how he tolerated the pain ill never know was it the fire that blinded him no that was the diabetes hed been ill for a while had never been diagnosed made matters worse by indulging an addicts sweet tooth and the nerve damage heroin a bad batch of heroin he scored it the day of the fire slipped away from poulsenn and walked down the block to meet his supplier thats how they traced him something else he feels guilty for howd he escape on burnt feet they stole a car the girl drove they managed to get out of the city found themselves on highway hid out in a remote canyon in the hills above malibu at night she sneaked into residential neighborhoods and scrounged in garbage cans she tried to take care of him but his feet got worse and the pain caused him to shoot up that last hit of heroin he lost consciousness stayed that way for two days somehow she cared for him at the end she was trying to feed him grass and leaves gave him water from a nearby creek that added an intestinal parasite to his miseries when i saw him in the burn ward he weighed ninetyeight pounds all that and hed withdrawn cold turkey his survivals nothing short of a miracle so you became his doctor i said and schwinns and eventually the two of them connected was that by design i listened to bills story then pierces eventually put it all together of course i never told either of them about the other pierce still thought of himself as a detective looking for bill eventually after much work i got bills permission and confronted pierce it wasnt easy but eventually they both came to understand that their lives were interwined matchmaking just as hed done with schwinn and marge the grand physician giving you waited until it was clear burns had nothing to fear from schwinn i said meaning you learned the details of janie ingallss murder but all of you agreed not to pursue it you became part of the coverup thats why you offered me all those apologies alex he said some decisions are these are shattered lives i couldnt see any other way schwinn changed things i said changed his mind about keeping the secret any idea why he grew agitated about the murder during the weeks before his death why he sent out the murder book ive asked myself all that so many times and the best i can come up with is the poor man felt he was going to die and had an urge to make peace was he sick nothing i could diagnose but he came to me and complained about feeling weak shaky out of focus a month before his death he began experiencing crushing headaches the obvious possibility was a brain tumor and i sent him up to the sansum clinic for an mri negative but the consulting neurologist did find some abnormal eeg patterns but you know eegs so crude hard to interpret and his bloodwork was normal i wondered about some lateterm amphetamine sequelae hed been drugfree for years but perhaps the selfabuse had taken its toll then a week before the night terrors began he blacked out did marge know about any of this pierce insisted on keeping everything from her even hid his headache medication in a locked box in his darkroom i tried to convince him to communicate with her more openly but he was adamant their entire relationship was like that alex each of them talked to me and i translated in that sense she was the perfect woman for him stubborn independent fiercely private he could be a profoundly unmovable man part of what made him a good detective i suppose do you think the night terrors were neurological or unfinished business come back to haunt him maybe both he said nothing unusual was found at his autopsy but that means nothing ive seen postmortem brain tissue that looks like swiss cheese and turns out the patient was functioning perfectly then you come across perfectly healthy cerebral cortexes in people who fall apart neurologically at the core we humans defy logic isnt that why we both became doctors of the soul is that what we are we are son alex i am sorry for concealing things from you at the time i believed it was the right thing to do but that girl the killers still out there tears filled his eyes one sets out to heal and ends up being complicit i placed a hand on his narrow soft shoulder he smiled therapeutic touch friendship i said the purchase of friendship he said cynics coined the term to demean what we do sometimes i wonder about the direction my own life has taken we strolled toward the gravel pathway i said what kind of relationship did schwinn and burns develop once i knew pierce could be trusted i brought him out here they began talking relating pierce ended up helping bill hed come out from time to time clean the house wheel bill around and now pierce is gone burns remains as the last living witness to the ingalls murder bert stared at the earth and kept walking i said you call him bill whats his new surname is that important its going to come out eventually bert is it he said lacing his hands behind his back he steered me toward the open space at the front of the house yes i suppose it is alex i know you need to talk to him but as i told you he has very little time left and like most exaddicts his selfassessment is brutal ill be mindful of that i know you will when we spoke earlier i said you made a point of mentioning that heroin addicts were unlikely to be violent you were trying to steer me away from burnss trail caroline cossacks as well by pointing out to me that females were unlikely to be involved in that kind of sexual homicide all true but howd they end up witnessing the murder bill came upon the scene once the poor girl was dead saw what had been done to her was caroline with him he hesitated yes they were together at the party she was allowed to be at the party because he was supervising her supervising keeping an eye on her her brothers paid him for that drug pusher babysitting the strange little sister i said bert nodded i said so she tagged along with burns followed her brothers and their pals to the neighboring estate came upon the kill spot the killers saw them had to be worried theyd unravel caroline because her psychiatric history made her unreliable burns because he was a junkie but instead of eliminating caroline they hospitalized her probably because even though the cossacks had participated in murder they couldnt quite bring themselves to murder their sister they wouldve killed burns but he disappeared into the ghetto and being rich white kids they had no easy way to find him burns was scared tried to make a big score took too many risks and got arrested made quick bail thanks to lapd connections and boris nemerovs goodwill and vanished again but then a few months later he surfaced got himself a job at achievement house so he could see caroline the boys found out and decided the big step had to be taken but before they could arrange the hit burns was gone again he and caroline managed to remain in contact eventually he got her out of achievement house and the two of them hid out in watts how am i doing so far aplus alex as always but something doesnt make sense bert why would burns put himself in terrible jeopardy by wangling a job at achievement house why in the world would he risk his life bert smiled irrational wasnt it thats what i mean about human beings being hard to categorize whyd he do it bert very simple alex he loved her still does present tense i said theyre still together where is she theyre very much together and youve met her he brought me back into the house the front room was empty and the push door remained shut bert held it open and i stepped into a corn yellow bedroom not much bigger than a closet tiny bathroom off to one side in the sleeping area were two single beds placed side by side each made up with thin white spreads a stuffed bear sat atop a low dresser painted hospital green the wheelchair was positioned at the foot of the nearer bed and the man who called himself bill remained seated the nearly empty snapple bottle in one hand the other grasped by the pudgy white fingers of a heavyset woman wearing an oversize royal blue tshirt and gray sweatpants her downturned eyes were aimed at the bedspread and my appearance didnt cause them to shift she had a pasty acnescarred face raw bread dough pocked by airholes and her flat nose nearly touched her upper lip faded brown hair striped with silver was tied back in a stub of a ponytail aimee the cook at the celestial café shed prepared my crepes doubled my portion without charging me extra remained virtually mute just as id finished my meal bert had come in nice coincidence now i knew it had been anything but marian purveyance had owned the café until aimee baker took over he gives people things i said didnt know you were a restaurateur dr harrison bert flushed nearly as purple as his jumpsuit i used to fancy myself an investor bought up a few local properties including the land this house stands on i said you even transplanted agaves he kicked one foot with the other that was years ago youd be amazed at the appreciation if you ever sold anything well the time has to be right sure i said and i found myself throwing my arms around the old man aimee turned and said youre nice bill said which one you talking about baby both she said everyones nice the whole world is nice chapter detective iii craig bosc whimpered vomit flecked his wellformed lips milo said ill be right back dont think of leaving lad bosc watched with panic as milo collected the homemade videos and the dope and left milo brought the stash out to the rental polaris locked them in the trunk and moved the car directly in front of boscs house when he returned the former auto cop hadnt budged he undid the leg restraint and hauled bosc to his feet pressed his gun in the small of boscs back making sure not to grow overconfident of his own dominance bosc was a fool and hed lost more than a bit of selfconfidence but he was also an athlete young and strong and desperate when he took hold of boscs arm he felt iron musculature now what said bosc now we take a ride boscs body grew limp and milo had to struggle to maintain his grip maybe a ploy no bosc was really frightened hed passed wind and the stench filled the room and milo eased him back on the couch let him sit putting on the stone face but he felt ashamed what had he sunk to come on bosc pleaded i told you everything just let it be what do you take me for craig i take you for smart youre supposed to be smart said bosc exactly you cant be serious this is crazy genuine terror enflamed boscs eyes imagining the worst because he himself was sorely lacking in the conscience department and if the tables were turned the truth was milo hadnt come up with a clear idea of what to do with the idiot but that was no reason to allay boscs fears in a creepy regretful voice he said theres really no choice craig jesus said bosc were both on the same team look were both outsiders that so you know what i mean man youre on the outside because you know and i dont judge you for that live and let live even when other guys put you down i stood up for you said look at the dudes solve rate who the fuck cares what he does when hes i kept telling them its the job that counts and you do your job man i respect that theres been talk of promoting you youve got a future man so dont blow it no way you can get away with this why would you want to get involved in shit like this youve involved me said milo come on what did i really do followed a few orders and played some head games okay it was wrong sucked granted sorry but no big deal it was all just to even that whole hiv rumor shit man and that wasnt my idea i was against that but all of it was just to you know to get me focused exact well im nice and focused now craig get up milo backed up the command with a wave of the mm wondering what hed do if bosc complied because walking the guy outside to the rental car even that short distance would be risky in full daylight even in la where a block was likely to be as devoid of people as one of schwinns nature photos please said bosc dont do this were both outsiders yeah yeah how are you an outsider craig im artistic into different stuff than the typical morons in the department cinematography said milo drama acting i was in a rock video a few years back the zombie nannies played a highway patrol chippie before that i did a nonunion commercial for the transit authority and art paintings i like art man your typical department moron is into riding harleys and pumping iron and drinking beer im hitting the museums i dig classical music went to austria couple of summers ago to the salzburg festival mozart beethoven all that good stuff you see what im trying to say its because i understand the art community that i get where youre coming from im an artist in a sense you are without the people in your community art would go dead it would be a fucked world man come on dont do this this is stupid were both worthwhile we both have lots to live for do we sure said bosc voice smoothing at the nuance of calm in milo s reply just think about it theres lots of good stuff waiting for both of us why said milo do i think youve taken a hostage negotiation course bosc smiled uneasily youre dissing me but im being real with you fine i can dig that i dissed you played with your head youre entitled but focus on this at this very moment im being realer than anyone youll ever meet milo approached the sofa from one side took hold of boscs tshirt get up or ill shoot you in the kneecap boscs smile dropped like a stone down a glacier hole you take me out there and i scream then youll die screaming he yanked and bosc stumbled to his feet and milo marched him toward the door bosc said i give you credit man switching wheels the way you did i thought i knew all the tricks but you were too quick for me i give you credit give you full credit only theres something you dont know theres plenty i dont know craig said milo figuring the guy was bargaining for time another negotiation trick if only he knew he was expending needless energy because eventually hed be let loose what choice did milo have the question was where and when and bosc would reward the largesse with instant hatred and an overpowering bloodlust for revenge given boscs position in the department hed be very likely to do serious damage and milo knew he was screwed in big trouble just as bosc had gloated but what choice had there been continue flopping around as others yanked the strings mr meat puppet he shoved bosc toward the door bosc said no i mean something you should know right now specifically for your own sake whats that youve gotta let me go first right i mean it man at this point ive got nothing to lose so you can do what the fuck you want to me and im not gonna tell you because why would i squander my last chip come on make it easy for both of us and ill tell you and save your friends ass and well both forget any of this happened and be square my friend said milo thinking rick jesus it had been rick bosc tailed initially ricks car bosc boosted all these years hed managed to keep rick out of this world and now he jammed the gun hard into the small of boscs back bosc gasped but kept his voice cool your shrink friend delaware you switched cars but he didnt still driving round in that green caddy i put a satellite tracer on it days ago know exactly where the dude goes it feeds into a computer and i get the data i know where the feed is and let me tell you man hes been a traveling fool did he tell you he was gonna improvise whered he go long silence milo poked even harder used his other hand to clamp the back of boscs neck uhuh no way bosc gasped you can fucking blow out my spine do whatever bad stuff you want but im not giving up my trump card and something else and this is the main issue im not the only one knows where the dude is other people know by now or they will real soon the bad guys cause the plan was to tell them leave them one of those anonymous phone calls we fucking set up your buddy man not to hurt him necessarily just to use him to get everyone together converging you know it was supposed to be perfectly timed you were supposed to be in on it too thats what i was doing at your place today i was gonna have another try at tagging your car then youd be called too to motivate you but you werent home so i figured id try you later bullshit said milo you were settled in for the night work was the last thing on your mind bullshit yourself im a night owl fucking batmandracula come alive when the sun goes down the plan was perfect only you screwed it by being too smart and switching cars and now delawares out in the cold man and if you want to help him theres only one thing you can do and you better do it quick milo twirled bosc around clamped boscs gullet at arms length aimed the gun at boscs groin go ahead said bosc do your thing im gonna hold on to my dignity staring back defiantly sincere if the word could be applied to the bastard chapter bert said yes aimee the world is nice now how about you and i go over to the café see if we can bake up something aimee smiled kissed bill on the forehead and padded out of the room without a glance at me bert said well be back in a short while ill bring you a sugarless brioche bill alex what can i get you im fine ill get you something you may be hungry later i sat on the bed opposite the wheelchair good to meet you mr were the bakers now said bill it was as good a name as any and it made aimee smile because one thing she could always do was cook and bake bill baker he grinned and rolled his head sounds like a rich white man huh bill baker attorney bill baker businessman it does have a ring to it i said it does indeed he grew serious before we start i need you to know something my aimee shes like a kid always been different always been scorned i used to scorn her like everyone else back when i was pushing dope and her brothers used to buy product from me i liked selling to them because it was a nice change of pace for a south central junkie id meet them up in the hills above bel air and it was so gorgeous nothing like my usual transaction locales i used to call it the scenic route make some quick money and get a tour of the way the other side lives the same hills where bowie ingalls had died in a singlecar encounter with a tree the boys agreeing to meet him in a familiar spot i said did you have lots of clients on the westside enough anyway thats how i met aimee once in a while the boys would bring her along when their parents were in europe or somewhere which was a lot of the time those parents were always gone when they did bring her theyd leave her in the car and make cruel comments embarrassed to be seen with her to be related to her i went along with the program back then i had not an atom of compassion in my soul was hollow cold manipulative thinking only of me me me and not very much of myself at that cause if id really thought a lot about myself i wouldnt have done the things i did he raised his arms with effort compressed his face and pressed his palms together i was a very bad person sir i cant say that im a good person now and i dont give myself any credit for changing because it was life that changed me a slow smile split his head how much sin can a blind man with no feet get into id like to think i wouldnt be bad even with eyes and legs but i can never be sure i dont really feel sure of myself here one hand lowered laboriously and touched his belly he laughed eye for an eye leg for a leg i ruined lots of lives and now im paying for it almost ruined aimees life too gave her dope big dose of lsd blotter acid her brothers idea but i didnt have to be talked into it we forced her to swallow it big joke hahaha she hollered and fussed and cried and i stood around laughing with them he drew a hand over sightless eyes poor little thing hallucinated for four straight days i think it mightve changed her nervous system slowed her down even further made her life even more difficult and believe me life had never been easy for that girl next time i saw her was her fourth day of freaking out garvey and bobo wanted to score some mushrooms and i was the candy man and i met them up in the hills the way we always did and there she was sitting in the back of the car but not still like usual she was rocking and moaning and crying her little eyes out garvey and bobo just laughed said shed been tripping heavy since we blotted her tried to plunge her hand in boiling water had almost jumped out of a secondstory window theyd finally tied her down to the bed she hadnt had a bath or eaten laughing about it but they were worried because their parents were coming home and even though their parents didnt like her they wouldnt have approved so i brought her down with barbiturates her parents didnt like her i said not one bit she was different looked it acted it and they were a nouveau riche family that made a big thing of looking good all the time country club and all that those boys were bad to the core but they dressed well and combed their hair and used the right aftershave and that made everyone happy aimee didnt know how to do any of that couldnt be taught to fake it she was less than a dog in that family sir and garvey and bobo took advantage of it did stuff and blamed it on her what kind of stuff i said anything that could get em in trouble stealing money peddling dope on the secondary market to other rich kids setting fires for fun they killed a dog once bobo did neighbors dog said it barked too much annoyed him so he tossed some poison meat at it and after it died he and garvey had caroline walk by the dogs gate a bunch of times when they were sure the neighbor was watching so the neighbor would assume stuff like that they bragged to me about it thought it was funny they talked about her like she was dirt i dont know why i started feeling sorry for her cause really i was no better than them but somehow i did something about her i just felt sorry for her cant explain it obviously you werent like them kind of you to say so but i know what i was he removed the mirrored sunglasses revealed sunken black discs split by commashaped slits scratched the bridge of his nose replaced the glasses you felt sorry for her and started babysitting her i said no i did it for the money he said told the boys id hang with her when the parents were out of town if theyd pay me they laughed and said you could turn her out you should pay us bro figuring i wanted to do sexual things to her or maybe i was going to pimp her and that was agreeable to them i started coming by the house in my old mercury cougar and taking her places she just went along she was happy to be getting out and she was like that easygoing she wasnt in school not since fifth grade severe learning problems she was supposed to be tutored but never really was she still cant really read much or do numbers all she can do is cook and bake but man does she do that good thats her godgiven talent whered you take her i said everywhere the zoo the beach parks shed keep me company when i did deals sometimes wed just ride around and listen to music id be high but i never gave her anything again not after i saw what that blotter did to her mostly id talk trying to teach her stuff about street signs the weather animals life she knew nothing i never met anyone who knew less about the world i was no intellectual just a stupid junkiepusher but i had plenty to teach her which tells you how pathetic her situation was he craned his neck could i trouble you for another diet snapple sir always thirsty sugardiabetes i brought him another open bottle and he finished it within seconds and handed me the empty thank you much the thing you should know is i never did anything sexual to her not once never not that i get any credit for that i was a junkie and you being a doctor knows what that does to your sex urge then the diabetes took over and the plumbing went south so i havent been much for sex in a long time still id like to think it wouldnt have made a difference respecting her you know not taking advantage of her sounds like you respected her from the beginning id like to think so you sound just like dr h trying to tell me something good about myself anyway thats the story with my aimee i like that name for her chose it for her her family gave her the old name and they treated her like dirt so she deserved a new beginning aimee means friend in french and ive always wanted to go to france and thats what shes been to me my only real friend outside of dr h he managed to place his hands on the wheels of the chair rolled back an inch and smiled as if the merest movement was pleasure im going to die soon and its nice knowing dr harrison will be here to take care of my aimee he will the smile dissipated course hes old have you and he made plans it hasnt come to that yet said bill we better do it soon ive chewed your ear off and you dont want to know about my personal problems youre here to find out what happened to the ingalls girl yes i said poor janie he said i can see her face as clear as day right here tapping a mirrored lens didnt know her but id seen her around thumbing on sunset she and this friend she was always with this goodlooking blonde i figured the two of them were hooking because the only girls still thumbing were hookers and runaways looking to be hookers turns out they were just careless girls the night i found them i was driving to the party ready to do some heavy business saw them standing around on sunset all confused not on the strip bel air cross the street from the u they were just a walk from the party but had no idea so i gave em a lift i still think about that what if i hadnt you brought them to the party then what he smiled move it right along yeah i brought em tried to get em high janie smoked some weed dropped some pills drank the blonde one just drank we hung around together a little it was a lunatic scene rich kids and crashers everyone high and horny doing their thing in that big old empty house then aimee showed up attaching to me like she always did she was there in the first place because id agreed to watch her the parents were off in india or some place had just bought a bigger house and the boys decided to give themselves a little goodbye bash anyway janie and her friend i think her name was melissa something like that were getting into the scene melinda waters i said he cocked his head like a guard dog on alert so you know plenty i dont know how it happened how it happened is janie got noticed by one of the brothers buddies a mean kid you know his name too vance coury thats the one he said sweet piece of work he wasnt any older than the others but he had this seasoned bad guys way about him he noticed janie and thats the reason she died because hed had her before wanted her again had her how i said he picked her up when she was thumbing took her to some hotel his old man owned downtown tied her up did her whatever he bragged about it to you to all of us the brothers were with him coupla other buddies too theyd come over to me to score when coury spotted janie she was off dancing by herself tank top halfoff pretty much in dreamland coury spots her and gives out this big grin this big wolfy grin and says look at that the slut and the other boys check out janie and nod cause they know who she is heard the story before but coury tells it again anyway how easy it was like it was some safari and hed bagged big game then he tells me not only did he do the slut but so did his old man and the other guys crack up and tell me their daddies did her too seems janies own dad was a lowlife scum whod been selling her since she was twelve fighting revulsion i said the other guys daddies do you remember which ones the brothers for sure garvey and bobos old man and this other creep this nasty nerd named brad somethingorother he piped up and said his daddyd had her too laughing about it proud brad larner never knew his last name skinny pale nerd mean mouth any other buddies in the group that night one other this big doofus this surfer type luke luke the nuke was my name for him cause he always looked bombed would eat anything i sold him luke chapman i said had his father had sex with janie he thought i dont recall his saying so no i dont think so cause when the others were going on about it he looked a little uneasy multigenerational rape michael larners assault on allison gwynn had been more than a passing fancy garvey cossack sr had harbored similar tastes and i was willing to bet slumlord coury played in that league too like father like bowie ingalls had primed his only child by abusing her then trafficking in her flesh i thought about milos description of janies nearly empty room a place she didnt wouldnt think of as home ingalls had been evil and calculating but stupid showing up at the meeting with his blackmail targets drunk and overconfident i said what happened when they finished bragging coury made some crack about honor thy father went after janie just grabbed her and threw her over his shoulder the others followed she resist not much like i said she was pretty much out of it i took aimee and got out of there not because i was a good man but all that talk about ganging up on a girl taking sloppy seconds from their daddies made me feel uncomfortable also aimee had to go to the bathroom had been pulling at my arm for a while complaining she needed to go but finding a bathroom wasnt so easy in that place every toilet was being used for getting high or having sex or throwing up or doing what a toilets for so i took her out of the house over to the backyard all the way in back to the bushes and trees told her to go in there id keep watch he shrugged the movement caused him pain and he winced i know it sounds crude but wed done that before aimee and me id be driving her somewhere far from the city we used to like to go up into the mountains out in the san gabriels or over in the west valley near thousand oaks or up on mullholland highway or rambla pacifica top of malibu anywhere we could find empty space and just enjoy the quiet and no matter how many times id tell her to go to the bathroom before we set out wouldnt you believe shed have to go where there was no facilities big smile like a kid so i was used to leading her into the bushes and keeping watch and thats what i did out in the backyard and when we were heading back to the house we heard voices over the wall her brothers voice garvey whooping and laughing then the others they were outside too going to the nextdoor property i knew that because theyd taken me there it was this huge place acres this estate the owner was some rich european who was never there and most of the time the house was empty they used to go there to party because no one would bother them they had a way of getting in this side gate up toward the back with a bolt that was easy to wiggle loose and once you were back there you were so far from the house no one could spot you party spot i partied with them there he said like i said i was the candy man anyway aimee wanted to tag along and go over there like she always did anything those boys did she thought was cool no matter how they treated her shed want to be with them i tried to talk her out of it brought her back inside the party house and sat down and tried to groove on some music cause while aimee was in the bushes id shot up was feeling mellow but when i opened my eyes she was gone and i knew where shed gone and i was responsible for her so i went after her and found her looking from behind some trees into a clearing she was shaking really bad teeth chattering and when i saw what she was looking at i dug why how much time had passed since coury had made a move for janie i said hard to say it felt like a long time but i was going in and out weaving you know ever been on opiates when i was a kid i split myself open and they gave me demerol to stitch me up like it i liked it fine i said everything slowed down and pain turned into a warm glow so you know he rolled his head its like the best kiss the sweetest kiss straight from gods lips all these years even knowing what it did to my life i still think about it about the idea of doing it and lord help me sometimes i pray that when i do die and if by some miracle i end up upstairs therell be this big syringe waiting for me what was aimee looking at janie his voice cracked on the name and he rocked gently in his wheelchair oh lord it was bad someone was holding a flashlight on her luke the nuke and the others were standing around staring they had her spread out on the ground with her legs apart and her head was nothing but blood and she was all cut up and burned and dead cigarettes and blood was all over the ground did you see a weapon coury and bobo cossack were holding knives big hunting knives like youd get in an army surplus store garvey had the pack of cigarettes kools trying to be hip what about brad larner he was just standing and staring and the other one this big dumblooking dude was behind him freaked out dead scared you could see it all over his face the others were more frozen like theyd done something and now it was sinking in then coury said we need to get the bitch outta here and he told brad to go to his car get out these blankets he kept there then aimee started retching out loud and they all turned toward us and garvey said oh shit you fucking moron and i grabbed aimee and tried to get the hell out of there but garvey had got hold of her arm and wouldnt let go and i just wanted to be as far from there as i could so i left her with him and ran as fast as i could and got in my car and drove the hell out of there i drove like a maniac its a miracle no cop pulled me over went over to the marina then east on washington sped all the way east to la brea then south into the ghetto he smiled into the highcrime neighborhood watts thats when i finally felt safe then what then nothing i kept a low profile ran out of money and smack did what i knew how to do and got busted you never thought about reporting the murder sure he said rich kids from bel air and a black junkie felon tells the cops he just happened to see a white girl get carved up cops used to stop me for driving while black run my license and reg pull me out have me do the spread for no reason even in my old mercury cougar which was a piece of junk appropriate for a black junkie felon that night i said you had better wheels latemodel white cadillac you know that he said you already know stuff something new crept into his voice an aftertone of menace hint of the man hed once been you having me go through the motions youre the first eyewitness weve found i know about the caddy because we located melinda waters and she mentioned it but she split from the party before the murder his head rolled slowly and he canted it away from me the caddy was a borrowed car i maintained the merc the way a junkie would and finally it broke down and i sold it for dope money next day i realized that without wheels i was nothing good old junkie planning i planned on boosting some wheels but hadnt gotten around to it too stoned so that night i borrowed from a friend nice car like that i said mustve been a good friend i had a few and dont ask me who was it the same friend who helped you escape the mirrored shades tilted toward me some things i cant say itll all going to come out i said maybe he said if it happens by itself its not my responsibility but some things i cant say he turned his head sharply toward the front of the house somethings wrong he said aimees coming but thats not her usual walk i heard nothing then a faintest crunch footsteps on gravel footsteps stopping and starting as if someone was stumbling but for the panic on his face it wouldve floated right past me i left him and stepped into the front room parted the drapes on a small cloudy window and looked out at the filmy amber light of impending dusk up the drive maybe a hundred feet from the house two men were walking aimee and bert toward us aimee and berts hands were up in the air as they marched forward reluctantly bert looked terrified aimees pasty face was expressionless she stopped suddenly and her escort prodded her with something and she winced and resumed walking crunch one of the men was large and beefy the other a head shorter and wiry both were hispanic and wore cowboy hats id seen them half an hour ago in the pickup loaded with fertilizer that had interposed itself between berts car and mine then dropped away at the intersection lucky break id thought at the time enabling me to use the truck for cover as i tailed bert bill called out whats happening i rushed back to him two cowboys have them at gunpoint under the bed he said waving his arms helplessly get it now barking the order sounding like anything but a junkie chapter the computer gizmo that read out the trace on alex was right in craig boscs saab hooked up to the dash a cute little thing with a bright blue screen and a printer it sputtered to life after bosc punched a few keys nineties guy everything he needed close at hand milo hadnt found any printouts in boscs house meaning bosc had left those at his office or at someone elses as bosc kept typing the screen filled with readout columns of numbers in a code that bosc explained with no prodding bosc pushed another key and the columns were replaced with what looked like blueprints vectors and loci computerized map lines everything loading at warp speed bosc was sitting in the saabs passenger seat hands free to work but milo had rebound his ankles first kept the gun at the back of boscs neck promising to let him go when hed done his bit for humanity bosc thanked him as if he was santa claus with a bag full of goodies the guy stank of fear but youd never know it from looking at him smiling smiling smiling gabbing technotalk as he worked killing time and filling space keep those psych tactics going his fingers rested thats it amigo look at the capital x and youve got him milo studied the map thats the best you can do thats pretty damn good said bosc offended within a hundredyard radius print it his pocket filled with paper milo yanked bosc out of the saab and walked him to the rear of the car okay milo were just gonna forget this happened right right could i have my legs back please milo the easy repetitive use of his name filled milo s head with enraged buzzing he looked up and down the street now graying during the time bosc had played with the computer a single car had driven by young woman in a yellow fiero blond and bighaired enough to be one of boscs unwitting home movie costars but she sped by fast went two blocks disappeared never returned now the street was empty again thank god for la alienation milo popped the saabs trunk gave bosc a swift hard kick behind one knee and as bosc collapsed predictably shoved him inside slammed the lid and walked away to the muffled drumbeat of bosc thumping and screaming all that noise someone would find him soon enough he hurried to the polaris checked the gas gauge fired up sped toward the freeway driving like a typical socal idiot way too fast steering with one hand the other gripping his mobile phone as if it was a life preserver chapter a husky voice from outside the cabin bellowed everyone out hands up a second later no fucking around or we kill the retard and the old guy i crouched closer to the window were coming out i have to get him in the chair do it i returned to the bedroom clamped my hands around the grips of bills wheelchair id put a bright white stocking cap on his bald head and had covered him with two soft blankets despite the heat or maybe it wasnt that hot i was sweatdrenched but he the diabetic remained freakishly dry a moment before hed prayed silently lips quivering hands hooked in the blankets he said my my my as i wheeled him forward when we reached the door the footrests of his chair nudged it open and we stepped out into an amethyst twilight the pair of cowboys holding aimee and bert were twenty or so yards up the gravel drive off center closer to the western edge of the pathway where the forest began the sky was slate and the foliage had deepened to olive drab flesh tones remained vivid i saw the fear on berts face the bigger cowboy was positioned slightly in front of his partner the pickups driver midforties fiveeleven with a potbelly that strained his iceblue shirt thick thighs that turned his blue jeans into sausage casing a complexion the color of dirty copper and a bristling graying mustache his hat was broadbrimmed brown felt bored demeanor but even at this distance i could see the edgy movement around his eyes he towered over bert held the old man by the scruff just behind him to the right the smaller intruder maintained a grip on aimee clutching her sweatshirt from behind stretching the fabric over the rolls and bulges of her torso younger fivefive midtwenties he wore a baggy black tshirt and saggy black jeans too urban for his straw headpiece the hat looked cheap a hurried addition he had a round face bottomed by wispy goatee dull distracted eyes a mass of tattoos ran up his arms one of the car restorers at vance courys garage the sun didnt move but bert harrisons complexion grayed aimee said billy whats happening she made a move toward the chair but the small cowboy cuffed the back of her head she flapped her arms clumsily he said cool it retard bill bill said everythings cool babe well work it out sure we will said the big cowboy in the husky voice that had brought us out a pack of cigarettes swelled one of the pockets of his shirt western shirt with a contrasting white yoke pearl buttons still boxcreased he and his pal had dressed for the occasion he said get the fuck over here willy over where said bill over here stevie wonder glancing at me you asshole wheel him over here real slow take your hands off the fucking chair and ill blow your fucking head off then what said bill then we take yall somewhere where shut the fuck up to the smaller man well load em in back with the shit under them tarps like i showed you small said why dont we just do em here in a nasal voice the big mans chest swelled taking a deep breath thats the plan mijo what about the wheelchair big laughed you can have the chair okay give it to that kid of yours to play with to me wheel him wheres the truck i said shut up and wheel him is there a truck i said or are we just taking a little walk stalling because thats what you did in situations like that because what was there to lose the big man yanked berts hair and berts face creased with pain ill just do this old payaso right here you keep talking blow out his eyes and make you fuck the sockets i rolled the wheelchair forward the tires caught in the gravel kicked up rocks that pinged the spokes i pretended to be stuck my hands stayed wrapped around the grips big maintained his hold on bert and watched me closely his companions attention span wasnt as good and i saw him glance off into the darkening trees bill said aimee bill mimicked big thats what you call yourself now willie hes bill baker i said who do you think he is bigs eyes slitted was i talking to you asshole shut the fuck up and get the fuck over here hey said bill cheerfully what do you know i thought i recognized that voice ignacio vargas long time nacho hey man recognition didnt trouble the big man he smirked long time no see nigger real long time nacho doc i used to sell this vaquero product he was smart never tasted just distributed to his homeboys hey nacho didnt you go off somewhere for a vacation lompoc or did you make it to quentin nigger said vargas before i went away i tried to party with you and the retard over at that house in niggertown but you got away now here we are after all those years one a those reunions who said you dont get a second chance his mouth opened displaying rows of broken brown teeth two decades of sanctuary and id brought the enemy to the gates you know what they say amigo said bill if you dont succeed at first but hey let the old guy go hes just a doctor happens to treat me got a bad heart gonna kick soon anyway why bother bert had been staring at the gravel now his eyes climbed very gradually came to rest on me dispirited bill said let her go too she cant hurt anybody bert shifted his weight and nacho vargas cuffed him again no squirming around grampa yeah i think i heard that one before if you dont succeed at first make sure you kill the fucker dead the second time then go out for a good meal come on whitebread keep moving then when i tell you to stop let go the wheel and slowly put your hands up then get down on the ground and put your hands behind your head and eat dirt i edged the chair another foot forward got stuck again freed the wheels bill said nacho was intelligento selling but never using i couldve learned from you nacho you couldnta learned nothing you were stupid i closed the space between us and vargas to ten yards i dont see any truck i said theres a fucking truck said small vargas shot a disgusted look intended for his partner but kept his eyes on me he began tapping his boot impatiently shiny needletoed black boots that had never known stirrups the jeans looked fresh too big shopping spree a oneday costume because you could never really wash out the blood bill said nacho my man be smart i got nothing to look forward to put me out of my misery but leave the old guy and aimee and everyone else alone take me off in that truck of yours and do what you want with like i need your fucking permission said vargas bills head rolled no you dont no ones saying you do its just why not be smart like i said hes got a heart condition maybe i should have him run around in circles till he drops dead save on bullets vargas laughed kept his gun hand behind bert lifted the other arm and jacked bert up effortlessly the old mans toes barely grazed the gravel hed gone deathly pale a rag doll vargas said hey this is like playing puppet his gun hand shifted upward too just an inch or so nacho man yeah sure well let everyone go maybe well let you go too hey thats a good idea lets all go out and have a beer he snorted she aint the only retard the boot tapped faster cmon cmon move it i closed the gap to twenty feet fifteen exerted downward pressure that tipped the chair slightly got stuck again what the fu you playing with me whitebread sorry i said in tremulous voice you told me to keep my hands just a sec before vargas could reply bert sagged in his grip cried out in pain clutched his chest vargas laughed too clever to be taken in by an obvious ruse but bert kept thrashing gave his head a hard shake and the sudden movement tugged vargass arm down and bert struggled to twist away as vargas tried to contain him his gun hand rose and the weapon was visible sleek black automatic aimed at the sky behind him small was cursing his attention directed at the struggle aimee stared too not resisting the moment bert had shown distress id pushed the chair faster got within five feet of vargas stopped vargas continued to grope for bert i gave a low grunt bill groped under the folds of the top blanket and pulled out the shotgun old but clean mossberg mariner eightshot mini combo with pistol grip and speedfeed extreme sawoff barely any barrel left id found it under the bed where hed said it would be stored in a black canvas case coated with dust bunnies lying next to two rifles in similar housing and half a dozen boxes of ammo use the big shells he said id loaded the weapon then handed it over to a stifffingered blind man vargas got a firm grip on bert but bert saw the shotgun turned and bit down on vargass arm and when vargas bellowed and let go of him he dropped to the ground and rolled away i muttered now and bill yanked the trigger the explosion boxed my ears and the recoil shoved the wheelchair into my groin as bills head snapped backward and connected with my midriff nacho vargas was blown away as if caught in a personalized tornado the bottom half of his face turned to smoky bloody dust and a giant ruby pink orchid blossomed where his gullet and chest had once been as he fell whiteflecked red broth shot out through his back spattering aimee and the small cowboy who looked stunned i threw myself at him swung one fist upward connected under his nose got hold of his groin with my other hand and twisted hard the whole thing had taken five seconds the small man went down landed on his back cried out in pain his black tshirt was grimed with what looked like steak tartare and bone bits and gobbets of something graypink and spongy i knew to be lung tissue his gun shiny and silver remained entwined in his fingers and i stomped his hand and kicked the weapon loose the gun rolled away and i dived for it slid into gore and skidded and went facedown into the gravel feeling the buzz of impact then searing pain along one half of my face both elbows and knees id fallen atop the weapon felt it biting into my chest now the damned thing would go off and blow a hole through me what a dignified demise i rolled away grabbed the gun sprang to my feet hurried back to the small man he lay there immobile and i felt under his filthencrusted jaw got a slow steady pulse the hand id stomped looked like a dead crab and when i lifted his eyelids all i saw was white a few feet away what had once been nacho vargas was an exhibit for the forensic pathology texts aimee said careful talking to bill not me she was behind the chair now had removed his watch cap was stroking his head bert was on his feet tottering holding vargass weapon with two hands staring at it with revulsion his color made me unsure if the chest pains had been a total ruse i kept the silver gun trained on the unconscious man heartbeat racing way beyond optimal muscles pumped head boiling up close he looked barely twenty give it to that kid of yours to play with a young man with one kid maybe a new father would he have helped vargas dispatch all of us then gone home and played with junior he moaned and my fingers tightened around the trigger another moan but he didnt move i trained the gun on him had to work at releasing the pressure in my fingers slowing my breathing struggling to think clearly sort things out the clearing around the house deepened to a sickening syrupy gray bill sat there in the chair the shotgun across his lap aimee and bert stood by silently the small man didnt move silence settled around us from somewhere off in the forest a bird peeped a plan id tie up the unconscious man put him and the wheelchair in the trunk of the seville drive us all to some safe place id figure out where along the way no first id call milo from the house i had to get them all in the house the bloody gravel the corpse with its yield of shredded body parts would be dealt with later do you have any rope i asked bill his mirrored glasses were off and aimee was dabbing at the gray hollows with a corner of the top blanket unmindful of the porridge that splotched her clothing and her face he said no sorry nothing to tie him with sorry the other ones alive out cold but alive i thought with that arsenal the arsenal was my baggage never really thought id use it the shotgun had been clean freshly oiled he mustve read my mind said i taught my aimee how to take care of it aimee recited ream the barrel wipe it down oil it up but no rope said bill aint that a hoot maybe we can shred some clothing tired one hand caressed the truncated shotgun aimee mumbled whats that sugar there is rope kind of there is he said twine i use it for my rolled roast not strong enough baby oh she said it holds in the roast bert come here and keep a close aim on him i said pocketing the silver gun and pulling the small man to his feet he was pounds tops but deadweight and the noradrenaline cooldown made dragging him to the house an ordeal i got him to the door looked back no one had followed nighttime turned the others to statuary inside i said lets take a look at that twine chapter bill was right about the cooking twine too flimsy i used it anyway sitting the small man in a chair in the front room and using both rolls to create a macramé mummy he looked out of it hopefully for a while my heart started racing again i searched the small kitchen found a crushed nearly empty roll of duct tape beneath the sink unspooled enough to run two tight bands around his body and the chair at nipple and waist levels what was left i used to bind his ankles together he offered no resistance how old was his kid i said wheres the phone bert shuffled over to a corner bent behind another chair retrieved an old black dial phone and handed it to me he hadnt said a word since the shooting i lifted the receiver no dial tone dead bert took the phone jabbed the receiver button dialed o shook his head do you generally have phone problems no sir said bill not that we use it much maybe he frowned i know that smell what smell i said the concussion came from behind from the rear of the house the impact of something striking wood followed by a loud sucking swoosh then the xylophone glissando of broken glass bill turned toward the sound bert and i stared only aimee seemed unconcerned suddenly daylight a false orange daylight brightened the bedroom followed by a rush of heat and the cellophanesnap of flames fire licked the curtains a zipper of it running up to the ceiling and down to the floor i ran for the bedroom door slammed it shut over the spreading inferno smoke seeped from under the panel the odor hit metallic acrid the chemical bitterness of a flash storm ripping open a polluted sky the smoke from beneath the door fattened from wisp to wormy coil to clouds relentless and oily white to gray to black within seconds i could barely make out the forms of the other people the room grew furnacehot the second firebomb hit again from behind someone was stationed out back in the forest where the phone wires ran i grabbed hold of bills chair waved frantically to bert and aimees smokeobscured silhouettes get out knowing that what i was sending them to was unlikely to be safety but the alternative was roasting alive no answer and now i couldnt see them at all i rolled bill toward the front door from behind came roaring protest the door collapsed and flames shot forward as i shoved the wheelchair groping the air for aimee and bill screaming with clogged lungs someones out there stay low my words were choked off by convulsive coughing i made it to the door reached for the knob and the hot metal broiled my hand handicapped push door idiot i shouldered it hard shoved bills chair lurched outside eyes burning retching coughing running into the darkness and aiming the chair to the left as a bullet impacted against a front window smoke billowed out of the house a smothering curtain of it good cover but poisonous i ran as far from the gravel drive as possible into the underbrush that formed at the houses eastern border racing with the chair struggling to manipulate the contraption over rocks and vines getting caught in the underbrush unable to free the chair jammed i lifted bill out of the chair slung him over my shoulder and ran adrenalinestoked again but his weight bore down and i could barely breathe and after ten steps i was on the verge of collapse my legs buckled i visualized them as iron rods forced them straight lost my breath completely stopped shifted the load panted and coughed feeling the dangle of bills ruined legs knocking against my thighs the dry skin of one palm against the back of my neck as he held on tight he said something i felt it rather than heard it and i resumed carrying him into the forest pulled off ten more steps counted each one twenty thirty stopped again to force air into my lungs i looked back at the house none of the halloween glare of fire just smoke funnels of it so dark it bled easily into the night sky then the spot where the little green house had stood was suddenly engulfed by a crimson ball haloed in lime green the kerosene stink of a stale campground something igniting the kitchen stove the explosion threw me to the earth bill landed on top of me no sign of aimee or bert i stared back at the house wondering if the fire would spread to the forest not good for the forest but maybe good for us if it attracted attention nothing but silence no spread the firebreak serving its purpose i rolled bill off me and propped myself up on my elbows his glasses had come loose his mouth moved soundlessly i said you okay i yeah wheres lets keep moving where is she shes fine bill come on i need to i got hold of his shoulder leave me here he said let me go ive had enough i began lifting him please he said my burned hand began to throb everything throbbed a raspy voice behind me said dead end mr cadillac chapter vance courys silver hair caught moonlight a black leather headband held it in place the musk of his aftershave managed to seep through the scorched air he shined the flashlight in my face shifted the beam to bill lowered it and held it at an angle that brightened the forest floor as the white spots cleared from my eyes i made out the rectangle in his right hand columnar snout machine pistol he said up businesslike tying up loose ends he wore lightcolored greasestained mechanics overalls outfitted for messy work something flashed around his neck probably the same gold chain id seen at the garage i got to my feet my head still rang from the explosion walk he motioned to his right back to the clearing what about him i said oh yeah him he leveled the pistol downward peppered bills frame with a burst that nearly cut the blind man in two the fragments of bills corpse bucked and flopped and were still coury said any more questions he marched me out of the forest a pile of cinders snarls of electrical conduit random stacks of bricks and twisted metal chairs were the remnants of the little green house that and something contorted and charred lashed and ducttaped to a chair playing with matches i said bet you liked that as a kid walk i stepped onto the gravel path keeping my head straight but moving my eyes back and forth nacho vargass corpse remained where it had fallen no sign of aimee or bert a cloud of musk hit my nostrils sickly sweet as a sacher torte coury walking close behind me where we going i said walk walk where shut up where are we going silence ten steps later i tried again where we going he said you are really stupid think so i said reaching into my pocket and pulling out the short mans silver gun and wheeling fast inertia caused him to pitch forward and we nearly collided he tried to step back free the machine pistol but couldnt get enough room to maneuver stumbled he hadnt bothered to pat me down overconfident rich kid whod never grown up all those years of getting away with bad stuff the little silver gun shot forward as if of its own accord courys goatee spread as his mouth opened in surprise i focused on his tonsils shot three times hit with every bullet i took his machine pistol and pocketed the silver gun scurried off the gravel found refuge behind a sycamore waited nothing stepping on greenery to muffle my footsteps i inched forward heading toward the road wondering who and what awaited me there id been overconfident too thinking vargas and the small man had made up the entire army too important a job for a pair of thugs coury had been a precise man who specialized at deconstructing highpriced machines and reconstituting them as works of art a good planner send in the b team while the a team waits sacrifice the b team and attack from the rear another ambush coury had come himself to take care of bill bill was a living witness and eliminating him was the primary goal the same went for aimee had he taken care of her and bert first i hadnt heard gunfire as i carried bill away but the firebombs and the kerosene blast had filled my head with noise i walked five steps stopped repeated the pattern the mouth of the gravel drive came into view choice point none of the options good i found nothing just the seville all four tires slashed flat hood open distributor cap gone tire tracks two sets both deep and heavily treaded said the pickup and another working vehicle had departed the nearest house was a quarter mile up the road i could barely make out yellow windows i was bloodstained and bloodied one side of my face scraped raw and my burnt hand hurt like hell one look and the residents would probably bolt their doors and call the police which was fine with me i almost made it before the rumble sounded big engine heading my way from highway loud enough close enough for visibility but no headlights i ran into the bushes crouched behind a flurry of ferns watched as the black suburban sped past and slowed fifty feet before the entrance to bill and aimees property it came to a halt rolled forward twenty feet stopped again a man got out big very big then another slightly smaller but not by much he gave some kind of hand signal and the two of them pulled out weapons and hurried toward the entrance anyone at the wheel the suburbans tinted windows augmented the night and made it impossible to tell now i knew that a run for the neighbors house would be risky and wrong courys shooting of bill resonated in my head coury had pulled the trigger but id been the angel of death couldnt justify extending the combat to more innocents i crouched and waited tried to read my watch but the crystal was shattered and the hands had been snapped off i counted off seconds had reached three thousand two hundred when the pair of big men returned shit said the shorter one goddammit i stood and said milo dont shoot me chapter aimee and bert sat in the third row of the suburban aimee clutched berts sleeve berts eyes lacked focus i got in next to milo in the second row at the wheel was stevie the samoan the bounty hunter georgie nemerov called yokuzuna next to him sat red yaakov crewcut head nearly brushing the roof howd you find us i said the seville car got tagged and i got hold of the tagger tagged satellite locating device one of courys car gadgets his hand on my shoulder was eloquent well talk later stevie drove to highway and pulled over just short of the intersection into a treeshaded turnaround where three vehicles sat toward the rear halfhidden by the night was the pickup truck front end facing the road still loaded with fertilizer a few feet away was a dark lexus sedan another black suv a chevy tahoe blocked both other vehicles stevie dimmed his lights and two men stepped from behind the tahoe a muscular shavedhead hispanic wearing a black muscle tshirt baggy black cargo pants and a big leather chest holster and georgie nemerov in a sport coat opennecked white shirt rumpled slacks the muscular mans tshirt read bail enforcement agent in big white letters he and nemerov approached the suburban milo lowered his window and nemerov peered in saw me raised an eyebrow wheres coury milo said with his ancestors nemerov tongued the inside of his cheek you couldnt save him for me it was over by the time we got there georgie nemerovs eyebrow arched higher as he turned to me im impressed doc want a job the hours are long and the pay sucks yeah said yaakov but de people you got to meet are deezgusting stevie laughed nemerovs smile widened reluctantly i guess results are what counts was there anyone else i said besides coury sure said nemerov two other party animals brad larner said milo that lexus is his he and coury arrived in it larner was driving he was parked near the house waiting for coury when we spotted him behind the truck dr harrison and caroline were tied up in the truck bed another guy was at the wheel who nemerov said paragon of virtue named emmet cortez i wrote a few tickets for him before he went away on manslaughter worked in the auto industry painting hot rods i said chroming wheels nemerovs grin was sudden mirthless icy now hes in that big garage in the sky rendered inorganic said stevie steel organic said yaakov long as deyr someting left he steel organic right georgie youre being technical said stevie lets change the subject said nemerov chapter pancakes said milo it was am the next morning and we were at a coffee shop on wilshire near crescent heights a place where old people and gaunt young men pretending to write screenplays congregated one half mile west of the cossack brothers offices but that hadnt been what drew us there wed both been up all night had returned to la at am stopped at my house to shower and shave dont wanna wake rick hed explained isnt rick up by now why complicate things hed emerged from the guest bathroom toweling his head and squinting wearing last nights clothes but looking frighteningly chipper breakfast he proclaimed i know the place they make these big monster flappers with crunchy peanut butter and chocolate chips thats kid food i said maturity is highly overrated i used to go there all the time believe me alex this is what you need used to go there back when i wasnt watching my figure our endocrine systems are shot so we need sugar my maternal grandfather ate pancakes every day washed them down with three cups of coffee sweeter than cola and he lived till ninetyeight woulda gone on a few more years but he tumbled down a flight of stairs while ogling a woman he pushed an errant thatch of black hair out of his face unlikely to be my fate but there are always variants youre uncommonly optimistic i said pancakes he said cmon lets get going i changed into fresh clothing thinking about aimee and bert all the unanswered questions thinking about robin shed called last night from denver left a message at pm i phoned back at figuring to leave a message at her hotel but the tour had moved on to albuquerque now here we were facing two stacks of peanut butter hotcakes the size of frypans breakfast that smelled eerily of thai food i corroded my gut with coffee watched him douse his stack with maple syrup and begin sawing into it then took hold of the syrup pitcher in my unburnt hand the er doctor at oxnard hospital had pronounced the burn firstdegree plus a little deeper and you wouldve made second as if id missed a goal hed administered salve and a bandage swabbed my face with neosporin wrote me a scrip for antibiotics and told me to avoid getting myself dirty everyone at the hospital knew bert harrison he and aimee were given a private room near the emergency admissions desk where they stayed for two hours milo and i had waited finally bert came out and said were going to be here for a while go home youre sure i said very sure he pressed my hand between both of his gave a hard squeeze returned to the room georgie nemerov and his crew drove us to the spot at the entrance to ojai where milo had left his rental dodge then disappeared milo had joined up with the bounty hunters formulated a plan lots of questions i tipped the pitcher followed the syrups drizzle watched it pool and spread picked up my fork milo s cell phone chirped he clicked in said yeah listened for a while hung up stuffed his face with a wad of pancake melted chocolate frosted his lips i said who was that georgie whats up he cut loose another triangle of hotcake chewed swallowed drank coffee seems there was an accident late last night eightythird street off sepulveda rental buick hit a utility pole at high speed driver and occupant rendered inorganic driver and occupant two dbs he said you know what highspeed impact does to the human body garvey and bobo i said thats the working hypothesis pending verification of dental records eightythird off sepulveda on the way to the airport funny you should mention that they did find tickets in the wreck pair of firstclass passages to zurich hotel reservations at some place called the bal du lac sounds pretty no lovely i said maybe a ski vacation could be is there snow there right now dont know i said its probably raining in paris he motioned for a coffee refill got a new pot poured and drank slowly just the two of them i said seems that way odd dont you think theyve got a fulltime chauffeur and choose to drive themselves to the airport own a fleet of wheels and use a rental car he shrugged also i went on what would they be doing on a side street in inglewood that far south youre heading for the airport you stay on sepulveda he yawned stretched emptied his coffee cup want anything else is it on the news yet nope but georgie knows no answer georgie has the inside track i said being a bail bondsman and all that that must be it he said he brushed crumbs from his shirtfront i said youve got syrup on your chin thanks mom he threw money on the table and got up how bout we take a little digestive stroll east on wilshire i said up to museum row you are nailing those hypotheses professor time for vegas we walked to the pink granite building where the cossack brothers had once played executive milo studied the façade for a long time finally entered the lobby stared down the guard left and returned to the front steps where id been waiting pretending to feel civilized happy i said as we headed back to the coffee shop ecstatic we retraced our walk to the coffee shop got into milos rental of the day a black mustang convertible drove through the miracle mile and across la brea and into the clean open stretch of wilshire that marked hancock park s northern border milo steered with one finger no sleep for two days but beyond alert i had to fight to keep my eyes open the seville had been towed to a shop in carpenteria id phone in later today get a report meanwhile id drive robins truck if i could stand the sweet smell of her permeating the cab he turned on rossmore drove south to fifth street hooked back to irving and pulled over to the curb six houses north of sixth on the other side was chief broussards cityfinanced mansion an immaculate white cadillac sat in the driveway a single plainclothesman stood guard looking bored milo stared at the house same hostility as when hed eyezapped the guard in the cossacks lobby before i could ask what was up he uturned headed south then west to muirfield where he cruised slowly to the end of the block and stopped at a property concealed behind high stone walls walt obeys place he said before i could ask stone walls just like the loetz estate that neighbored the party house the kill spot build walls and you could get away with plenty janie ingalls abused by two generations of men a closedcircuit camera atop one gatepost rotated milo said say cheese waved jammed the mustang into drive and sped away he dropped me back home and i slept until pm woke in time to turn on the news the cossack brothers deaths missed the network affiliate broadcasts but was featured an hour later on a local stations six oclock spot the facts were just as georgie nemerov had reported singlecar accident probably due to excessive speed thirty seconds of bio identified garvey and bobo as wealthy westside developers whod built some controversial projects no identifying photos no suspicion of foul play another death occurred that night but it never hit the la news because it went down ninety miles north santa barbara newspress item forwarded to me by email with no accompanying message the sender sloppysloothsturgiscom that was a new one the facts were straightforward the body of a sixtyeightyearold real estate executive named michael larner had been found two hours ago slumped in the front seat of his bmw the car had been driven into a wooded area just north of the cabrillo exit off the on the outskirts of santa barbara a recently fired handgun sat in larners lap hed died of an apparent single wound to the head consistent with selfinfliction larner had come to santa barbara to identify the body of his son bradley fortytwo the recent victim of a heart attack whod also irony of ironies succumbed in a car bradleys vehicle a lexus had been discovered just a few miles away on a quiet street on the north end of montecito the grieving father had left the morgue just after noon and investigators had come up with no accounting of his whereabouts during the three hours leading up to his suicide a homeless man had discovered the body i was going in there to take a nap reported the vagrant identified as langdon bottinger fiftytwo knew something was wrong right away nice car like that pushed up against a tree i looked inside and knocked on the windows but he was dead i was in vietnam i know dead when i see it chapter after dropping alex off milo turned on the mustangs radio and dialed to klos classic rock van halen doing jump kicky little thing the stang something with a little zip used to be owned by tom cruises gardener the multipierced girl at the alternative rental yard had told him night owl she worked the midnighttoeight shift great said milo pocketing the keys maybe itll help on auditions the girl nodded knowingly you go out for character roles nah said milo heading for the car not enough character he returned to john g broussards digs on irving sat and watched for hours the chiefs wife emerged at pm escorted to the driveway by a lady cop who held open the drivers door of the white caddy mrs b drove toward wilshire and was gone leaving john g alone in the house milo was fairly certain broussard wasnt in the office hed phoned the chiefs headquarters impersonated a honcho from walt obeys office was told very politely that the chief wouldnt be in today no surprise there yet another antibroussard piece had run in the morning times the police protective league griping about poor morale dumping it all in broussards lap commentary by some law prof psychoanalyzing broussard the clear implication was that the chiefs temperament was a poor fit for modernday policing whatever the hell that meant add all that to the events of last night and craig boscs report to the chief and broussard had to know the walls were closing in john g had always been the most cautious of men so what was he doing now upstairs in his bedroom closet picking out a cool suit from a rack of dozens it was almost as if he didnt care maybe he didnt milo kept watching the tudor digs stretched his legs ready for the long haul but five minutes later a dark green sedan an unmarked ford blackwalls pure lapd backed out of the driveway solitary driver a tall man rigid at the wheel the unmistakable outline of the chiefs noble profile broussard turned south just like his wife had stopped at wilshire and sat there for a long time with his leftturn signal blinking what a good example waited for the traffic to thin before swinging smoothly onto the boulevard heading east so maybe he was going to work toughing it out show the bastards one way to find out broussard stuck precisely to the speed limit gliding in the center lane signaling his right turn on western well within dmv parameters he drove south past washington boulevard picked up the east and engineered a textbook entry into the afternoon flow freeway traffic was moderately heavy but steady perfect tail situation and milo had no trouble keeping an eye on the ford as it passed through the downtown interchange stayed on the and exited at soto in east la the coroners office and broussard did drive to the clean cream morgue building on the west end of the county hospital complex but instead of turning in to park among the vans and the cop cars he kept going continued for another two miles made a perfect stop at a narrow street called san elias turned right and did a mph cruise through a residential neighborhood of tiny bungalows packaged by chain link three blocks up san elias then the street deadended and the green ford pulled over the terminus was marked by twentyfoothigh iron double gates rich with flourishes and topped by gothic arches above the peaks the iron had been bent into lettering milo was a block away couldnt make out what they spelled john g broussard parked the ford got out locked it tugged his suit jacket in place not dressed for the office the chief never showed up at parker center out of uniform lintfree all those razorpresses his chest festooned with ribbons during ceremonial occasions he wore his hat thinking he was a fucking general or something said the scoffers today broussard wore a navy suit tailored snugly to his trim physique a tv blue shirt and a gold tie so bright that it gleamed like jewelry from a block away perfect posture accentuated the chiefs height as he walked to the big iron gates with a martial stride as if presiding at some ceremony broussard paused turned a handle stepped through milo waited five minutes before getting out looked over his shoulder several times as he covered the block on foot feeling antsy despite himself something about broussard when he was halfway to the gates he made out the lettering sacred peace memorial park the cemetery was bisected by a long straight pathway of decomposed granite pinkbeige against a bordering hedge of variegated boxwood hollywood junipers formed high green walls on three sides too bright under a sickly gray sky no orange trees in sight but milo could swear he smelled orange blossoms twenty feet in he came upon a statue of jesus benevolent and smiling then a small limestone building marked office and fringed with beds of multicolored pansies a wheelbarrow blocked half the path an old mexican man in khaki work clothes and a pith helmet stooped in front of the flowers he turned briefly to look at milo touched the brim of the helmet returned to weeding milo circumvented the wheelbarrow spotted the first row of gravestones kept going oldfashioned markers upright carved of stone a few of them tilting a handful decorated by sprigs of desiccated flowers milos parents had been buried in a very different ambience huge place not far from indianapolis a suburban city of the dead bordered by industrial parks and shopping malls mockcolonial buildings with all the authenticity of disneyland endless rolling green turf fit for a championship golf course the markers in his parents cemetery were brass plaques embedded flat in the bluegrass invisible until you got close even in death bernard and martha sturgis had been loath to offend this place was flat and tiny and treeless except for the bordering junipers two naked acres if that full up with gravestones too an old place nowhere to hide and finding broussard was easy enough the chief was standing off in a corner in the lower left quadrant of the cemetery secondtolast row a snug shady place his back was to milo as he faced a marker big dark hands laced behind his ramrod back milo walked toward him making no effort to squelch the sound of his footsteps broussard didnt turn when milo got to the gravesite the chief said what took you so long the stone that had occupied broussard was charcoal granite edged with salmon pink and carved beautifully with a border of daisies jane marie ingalls may she find peace in eternity entry and exit dates spelled out a sixteenyearthreemonth life span a tiny smiling teddy bear had been chiseled above janies name a grayblue juniper berry had lodged in the bevel that created the bears left button eye john g broussard stooped and plucked it out and placed it in a pocket of his jacket the suit was doublebreasted blue with a maroon chalk stripe suppressed waist high side vents working buttonholes on the sleeves look ma im custommade milo remembered broussards terrific threads and poreless skin during the interrogation twenty years ago the thousandth time hed thought about that day up close the chief hadnt changed much the graying hair a bit of crease at the corner of his lips but his complexion glowed with health and his huge hands looked strong enough to crack walnuts milo said you come here a lot when i invest in something i like to keep an eye on it invest i bought the marker detective her father didnt care she was going to end up in a potters field guilt offering said milo broussard remained still then he said detective sturgis im going to examine you for listening devices so relax sure said milo stifling the yes sir on the tip of his tongue no matter how hard he tried broussard made him feel small he drew himself up as the chief turned faced him did an expert patdown that figured an exia man would have experience with wires finished broussard dropped his hands and maintained eye contact so what is it you want to tell me i was hoping youd have things to tell me broussards lips didnt move but a glint of amusement brightened his eyes youd like some sort of confessional statement if thats whats on your mind said milo whats on your mind detective i know about willie burns do you the tax rolls say the place where he hid out on th where your partner poulsenn got nailed was owned by your wifes mother the night willie took janie ingalls to the party he was driving a borrowed car brandnew white cadillac beautifully maintained your wife likes those has owned six caddies in the last twenty years all white including the one shes driving at this very moment broussard stooped and brushed dust off janie ingallss headstone burns was family said milo was said broussard very much was it went down last night just like you choreographed broussard straightened there are limits to protection even for family what was he a cousin nephew said the chief son of my wifes eldest brother his siblings were all respectable everyone in the family went to college or learned a trade willie was the youngest something went wrong sometimes it works out that way said milo now youre sounding like that shrink friend of yours it rubs off does it said broussard yeah hanging around with the right people is good for the soul vice versa too musta been a burden you playing by the rules taking all that racist crap climbing the ranks meanwhile willies going on his merry way shooting and selling smack lots of potential for bad pr but you did your best to help him anyway thats why he never served much jail time you hooked him up with boris nemerov probably went his cash bonds and at first he came through for nemerov kept you looking good broussard remained impassive milo said musta been a strain associating with a known felon i never broke the law milo s turn to keep quiet broussard said theres always flexibility in the law detective yes i carried him my wife adored him remembered him as a cute little kid to the family he was still the cute little kid i was the only one seemed to realize hed metamorphosed into a reprobate junkie maybe i shouldve seen it sooner or let him deal with the consequences earlier the chiefs posture relaxed a bit bastard was actually slumping milo said then willie got himself in a whole new level of trouble witnessed a very nasty and got paranoid and told you they were going to pin it on him not paranoia said broussard reasonable apprehensiveness he gave a cold smile black junkie with a felony record versus rich white boys no one intended to bring willie to trial the plan was to float rumors plant evidence have willie od somewhere call in an anonymous tip and close the case so willie skipped on boris but you paid boris off then you got poulsenn assigned to the case to cover it and control it and meanwhile he could guard willie and his girlfriend that was temporary we were regrouping assessing contingencies none of which included going after the real killers said milo surprised at the fury in his own voice maybe schwinn and i wouldnt have solved it on the other hand maybe we wouldve pulled it off well never know will we cause you stepped in and sabotaged the whole goddamned thing and dont tell me that was just because of willie someone put the fix in for those rich kids someone you had to listen to broussard swiveled and faced him youve got it all figured out i dont thats why im here who was the fixer walt obey janie was pimped by that piece of shit who called himself her father and used by two generations of rich scrotes and whos richer than old walt is that what doomed the investigation john kindly churchgoing uncle walt worried about having his nasty habits aired broussards ebony face remained still he stared past milo let out a low grumbling laugh happy to entertain john said milo his hands were shaking and he rolled them into fists im going to educate you detective about matters you dont understand ive spent a lot of time in the company of rich folk and its true what they say the rich are different lifes little bumps get smoothed out for them no one has the temerity to deny them anything more often than not their kids become monsters malignant entitlement but there are exceptions and mr obeys one of them hes exactly what he claims to be religious straightforward ethical good father faithful husband mr obey grew rich through hard work and vision and luck hed be the first to emphasize the luck component because hes also a humble man so understand this he had nothing to do with any coverup you mention the name janie ingalls and hell stare at you blankly maybe ill try that said milo broussards jaw set stay away from that gentleman is that an official order chief its sound advice detective then who said milo who the hell fixed it broussard ran a finger under his collar full sun had brought the sweat out on his brow and his skin glistened like a desert highway it wasnt like that he finally said no one ordered the ingalls investigation stopped per se the directive and it was a departmental directive straight from the top the very top was to effect damage control on pierce schwinns many years of felonious conduct because schwinn was spinning out of control heavily addicted to amphetamines taking extreme risks he was a ticking time bomb and the department decided to defuse him you just happened to get the wrong partner it couldve been worse for you you were spared because you were a rookie and had never been observed participating in schwinns transgressions except for one instance when you were observed picking up a known prostitute in your onduty car and chauffering her and schwinn around but i chose to overlook that detective i had you transferred to greener pastures rather than drummed out in disgrace is this the dramatic moment where im supposed to thank you milo cupped a hand to his ear wheres the goddamn drumroll broussards mouth curled downward in disgust suit yourself and be dense i didnt need your largesse john when i picked that hooker up i had no idea what was going to happen figured her for an informant broussard smiled i believe you detective i had a pretty good notion that you wouldnt participate in any backseat calisthenics with a woman milo s face grew hot broussard said dont get all indignant on me i wont pretend to understand what you are but it doesnt bother me lifes too short for intolerance i know what its like to be on the outside and ive given up on the whole idea of changing the way people feel let bigots feel any way they want to as long as they dont misbehave youre a paragon of tolerance not tolerance constructive apathy i dont care about your amusements dont care about you period as long as you do your job when doing the job suits your interests said milo broussard didnt reply youre an outsider huh said milo for an outsider you scampered up the ladder pretty quickly hard work and persistence said broussard sounding as if hed recited it a million times before and good luck plus a good deal of yassuhmastah posteriorkissing he unbuttoned his collar and loosened his tie aiming for casual just one of the guys his bearing said otherwise back when i worked patrol i used to tape pictures in my locker photographs of men i admired frederick douglass george washington carver ralph bunche one day i opened my locker and the pictures were ripped to shreds and the walls were decorated with die nigger and other genial messages i pasted every one of those photos together and if you go into my office today youll see them hanging behind my desk ill have to take that on faith said milo dont expect to be invited to your office anytime soon unlike that other worthy soul craig bosc im disappointed in you john choosing a lowlife like that to run your errands broussard worked his lips craig has his talents he went too far this time what was the idiots assignment spook me into focusing on the ingalls case the old reverse psychology just in case sending delaware the murder book wasnt enough to kick me in gear the idiots directive said broussard was to aim you at the case and keep you focused i thought youd be interested but for a while things seemed to be lagging it has been twenty years so you steal my partners car float hivretirement rumors have bosc hit on me and make sure i get aimed at a pob that directs me to the larners then you trail dr delaware and set coury on his trail he couldve died last night you manipulative sonofabitch he didnt said broussard and i dont deal in theoreticals as i said craig grew overzealous end of story milo cursed caught his breath bent and caressed the top of janies grave broussards shoulders tensed as if the gesture was insulting you buy a gravestone and think youre absolved john this poor little girl molders for two decades and youve allowed yourself to grow righteous schwinn sent you the book and you made me part of the chain letter via dr delaware why it sure wasnt the search for justice the chiefs face returned to wooden milo visualized him wiping the murder book clean of prints contemplating the contingencies finally deciding to forward the death shots to someone sure to pass them along using alex to spook him throw him off wanting him to have to fight to regain his bearings convince himself it was a noble quest and if milo hadnt bitten broussard wouldve found another way thered never been any real choice youve got a reputation said broussard as a contrarian i thought it was wise to harness that he shrugged and the easy gesture turned milo feverish he locked his hands together struggled not to hit broussard finally found his voice whyd you want the case solved now times change what changed were your personal circumstances milo jabbed a finger at the gravestone you never gave a shit about janie or the truth nailing coury and the others became important because it was in your best interest and boy did you succeed bunch of dead guys in ojai couple more in sb the cossacks bite it in inglewood and theres no reason to connect any of them now youre free to go about your merry way with walt obeys buildacity game thats what its all about isnt it john the old mans money fucking esperanza broussard stiffened esperanza what horseshit said milo it means hope and youre hoping itll make you filthyrich because you know youre a failure as chief gonna have to leave the department soon under lessthanamiable circumstances and uncle walt just happened to come up with an offer thatll make your pension seem like chump change whats the deal john chief of security for an entire city maybe augmented by some bullshit corporate vice presidency hell obeys probably tossing in preferred shares of the project that could shoot you into a whole new fiscal galaxy augmenting what hes already gifted to your wife and daughter man of color as coowner of a city aint old walt liberal everything was looking rosy until some nasty competition cropped up because obeys grand scheme includes comprehensive recreational facilities aka finally bringing the nfl back to la the old man pulls that off and esperanza land values skyrocket and youre lunching at the country club and pretending the stiffs over there like you but the cossacks had other ideas wanted to rejuvenate the coliseum or some other downtown venue had germ bacilla and diamond jim horne on their side brought those two clowns to dinner at that stupid restaurant they own did the whole privateroom thing with uncle walt trying to convince uncle walt to cash in his chips and go along with them once upon uncle walt mighta blown off bullshit like that but maybe this time he was willing to listen the fact that he showed up at sangre de leon and didnt invite you says he was openminded and that had to spook you john because even though the cossacks had never pulled off anything close to that scope this time theyd lined up decent financing and city council support and most important obeys losing steam because hes getting old and his wifes sick really sick aint that a hoot john youve come this far and it could all come crumbling down broussards eyes turned to cracks in asphalt his lower jaw jutted forward and milo knew the chief was struggling not to hit him you dont know what youre talking about detective john he said i watched a portable dialysis van pull up early this morning on muirfield mrs os seriously not well old barbara needs a machine to survive hubbys initiative is being sapped broussards hand flew to the knot of his tie he tugged it down farther stared off into nowhere milo said obeys owned the land for years so even with his mortgages he can sell at a huge profit he woulda tossed you a consolation prize but basically youd have been a controversial exchief forced out and looking around for a gig maybe some drugstore chain would hire you to oversee security broussard didnt answer all those years of posteriorkissing said milo all that upright behavior what said broussard very softly do you want milo ignored the question you shrug off that twentyyearold directive to shaft schwinn as the reason the case got sidelined but thats crap handing janies case to lester poulsenn was a dodge an ia spook like you what the hell would poulsenn know about a sex homicide les worked homicide wilshire division for how long two years milo applauded silently a whole twentyfour months chasing gangbang shootings and suddenly hes the oneman squad on a nasty like janie his main gig was guarding willie and caroline in watts because your family loved willie broussard said i walked on eggshells with that with willie the family always pushed for him i bought my wife a spanking new sedan de ville and she lent it to him an ia mans car at the scene of a murder a trace of whine had crept into the chiefs voice suspects defensiveness the bastards discomfort flooded milo with joy he said whatd you tell the family when willie disappeared that hed burned up in the house i wanted to put an end to it broussard cocked his head to the right two rows over far as theyre concerned hes here we had a quiet family ceremony whos in the coffin i burned papers in my office put the ashes in an urn and we buried it i believe you said milo i believe youd do that as far as i knew willie really was dead lester died in that fire and the russian got ambushed and i knew it all had to do with willie so why wouldnt willie be dead then he calls me a week later sounding halfdead telling me hes burnt and sick send him money i hung up on him id had enough i figured hed last what a few months he had a serious addiction so you made him dead he did that to himself no john vance coury did that to him last night sliced him in half with a mac i buried him with my own hands hey if you want ill retrieve whats left of him you can dig up that urn and well make everything right broussard shook his head very slowly i thought you were smart but youre stupid milo said were a good team you and me john between the two of us we get everything tied up nice and neat so who pushed schwinn off that horse did you do it yourself or send a messenger like old craig my guess is a messenger because a black face in ojai would be conspicuous no one pushed him he had an epileptic seizure and fell down a gully took the horse with him you were there craig was there ah said milo thinking alex would laugh if hed reached the stage where he could laugh believe what you want said broussard thats what happened what i believe is schwinns sending you the book loosened your bowels all these years you thought the guy was just a speedfreak burnout and he turns out to have a long memory and pictures broussards smile was patronizing think logically a few moments ago you constructed an elaborate theory about my desire to eliminate competition if thats true why would schwinns reactivating the ingalls murder bother me on the contrary if the cossacks could be implicated except that schwinn knew youd put the original fix in once he was out of the way you figured out a way to make everything work for you youre nothing if not adaptable john broussard sighed now youre being obstinate as i told you the directive was related to schwinns so what john if walt obeys half as righteous as you claim he likes you because youve convinced him youre a choirboy schwinn comes forward makes noises sullies your rep its a threat to your executive wet dream so he had to go too its like bowling isnt it human tenpins set em up knock em down no said broussard i sent craig to talk to schwinn to find out exactly what he knew why would i kill him he couldve been useful to me without him i turned to you a seizure broussard nodded craig was driving to schwinns ranch saw schwinn ride his horse out the gates and followed along there was a there was contact and craig introduced himself and schwinn got hostile hed wanted me to respond personally not send a delegate the man was presumptuous craig tried to reason with him to get the facts of the case schwinn denied hed had anything to do with the book then he started to rave about dna finding semen samples solving everything overnight except there were no samples said milo everything had been destroyed schwinn wouldve loved hearing that he was irrational tried to charge craig on horseback but the horse wouldnt cooperate craig did his best to calm schwinn down but schwinn started to dismount and suddenly his eyes rolled back in his head and he began salivating and convulsing the horse mustve panicked and lost its footing it tumbled into the gully schwinn had one foot caught in the stirrup got dragged his head collided with a rock craig ran to help him but it was too late so craig left the scene broussard didnt answer terrific story said milo forget building cities john write a screenplay maybe i will said broussard one day when its no longer raw when what isnt the pain none of this has been easy for me broussards left cheek ticked he sighed injured nobility milo hit him chapter the blow connected square with the chiefs nose and knocked him flat on his rear broussard sat in the dust fronting janies grave blood streaming from his nostrils striping his italian shirt the beautiful golden tie crimson deepening to rust as it met the pinstripe of his custommade lapel he said its good i already have a broad nose smiling taking hold of the silk foulard in his breast pocket and wiping away the blood making no attempt to get to his feet youre immature detective thats your problem always has been reducing everything to blackandwhite the way a child does maybe its tied in with your other problem generally arrested development maturitys highly overrated said milo mature people act like you i survive said broussard my grandfather never learned to read my father went to college then to music school learned classical trombone but couldnt get a job so he worked his whole life as a porter at the ambassador hotel your problem can be concealed you were born with unlimited opportunities so spare me the pious lectures about morality and dont even think about hitting me again if you raise your hand to me ill shoot you and make up a plausible story to justify it he patted his left hip revealed the bulge under the pinstripe just a few subtle inches afforded by great tailoring you could shoot me anyway said milo sometime when im not expecting it i could but i wont said broussard unless you make it necessary he pressed silk to his nose blood continued to flow if you act reasonably i wont even send you the cleaning bill meaning meaning youve gotten it all out of your system and are prepared to return to work under new circumstances such as we forget about this youre promoted to lieutenant assigned to a division of your choosing why would i want to push paper said milo no paper youll be a lieutenant detective said broussard continue to work cases challenging cases but you pull a lieutenants salary enjoy a lieutenants prestige thats not the way it works in the department im still the chief broussard got to his feet pretended to accidentally spread a flap of his doublebreasted jacket offered a full view of the mm nestled in a tooledleather holster the color of fine brandy you toss me a bone and i go away said milo why not said broussard everythings been done that needs to be done you solved the case the bad guys are out of the picture we all move on whats the alternative ruining both our lives because the worse you hurt me the more pain you bring on yourself i dont care how righteous you think you are thats the way the world works think about nixon and clinton and all those other paragons of virtue they got libraries and all the people around them went down hard broussard stepped closer milo could smell his citrus aftershave and his sweat and the coppery tang of the blood that had finally begun to dry above his mouth ive kept records said milo a paper trail hidden where even youll never find it something happens to me oh please look whos talking about screenplays said broussard you want to throw around threats think about dr silverman dr delaware dr harrison broussard laughed sounds like a medical convention you can be damaged beyond your wildest dreams and to what end whats the point he flashed a smile winners smile a cold damp wave of futility washed over milo sapped the blow to broussards nose had taken more out of him than it had out of its recipient winners and losers the patterns were probably set in place back in nursery school he said what about bosc craig has resigned from the department with substantial compensation effective one week ago hell never go near you that i can promise you he does hes a dead man he realizes that hes relocating to another city another state broussard wiped away blood checked his handkerchief found a clean corner and made sure it showed when he tucked the silk square back in his breast pocket buttoning his shirt and knotting his tie he advanced even closer to milo breathing slowly evenly the bastard had sweet breath mintyfresh no more sweat on his ebony face his nose had started to swell looked a little off kilter but nothing youd notice once he got cleaned up so he said lieutenant said milo fasttrack promotion detective sturgis once you choose your division you can take some vacation time or jump right into work think of it as mutually constructive adaptation milo stared into the flat black eyes hating broussard and admiring him oh great guru of selfdeception teach me to live as you do he said fuck your promotion ill drop everything but i dont want anything from you how noble said broussard as if you had a choice he turned and walked away milo remained by the grave let his eyes wander over janies stone goddamn teddy bear knowing there was nothing he could do if he wanted to stay in the department hed take the offer and why the hell not because anyone who mattered was dead and he was tired so tired and what was the alternative making a choice not sure of what it would do to him to his soul someone else might have convinced himself that was courage someone else wouldnt feel this way chapter bert harrisons call came at am id been sleeping and tried to push the fatigue out of my voice but bert knew hed woken me up sorry alex ill call back no i said howre you doing im fine he said aimee is shell eventually come to grips with the loss wed begun dealing with it because bill didnt have long and i was trying to prepare her despite that of course the shock was traumatic for her sake im emphasizing the quickness of it his feeling no pain i can back you up on that it was instantaneous you saw it you must be im fine bert alex i shouldve been honest with you all along you deserved better from me you had your obligations i said patientdoctor confidentiality no i its all right bert he laughed listen to us alex alphonse gaston alphonse gaston youre really okay son i really am because you bore the brunt of it as i stood by like a its over i said firmly yes he said several seconds passed i need to tell you this alex youre such a good young man i find myself calling you son from time to time because if id oh this is silly i just called to see how you were getting on and to let you know were coping the human spirit and all that indomitable i said whats the alternative milo had come by last night and wed talked through sunrise id been thinking a lot about alternatives thanks for calling bert lets get together when things settle down yes absolutely we must he sounded old and weak and i wanted to help him and i said soon youll be getting back to your instruments pardon oh yes definitely as a matter of fact i did get online early this morning came upon an old portuguese gitarra on ebay that looks intriguing if it can be restored tuned differently than a guitar but you might be able to get some sound out of it if i get it at the right price ill let you know and you can come up here and well make music sounds like a plan i said happy to have any chapter the next few days degraded to a blur of solitude and missed opportunity i took a long time to muster the energy to call robin never found her in she didnt call back not once and i wondered if a new level had been descended i tried not to think about janie ingalls or any of the others did a pretty decent job of cutting myself off knew it was unlikely allison gwynn had read about michael larners death in the santa barbara newspress and that i should tell her i couldnt dredge up the initiative for that either i buried myself in housecleaning yardwork clumsy jogs tv hypnosis obligatory tasteless meals perusals of the morning paper not a word of print about the bloody night in ojai the larners the cossacks continued sniping at john g broussard by politicians and pundits were the only links to what had been my reality since receiving the murder book on an uncommonly mild tuesday i took an afternoon run and came back to find robin sitting in the living room she had on a black tshirt black leather jeans and the pair of lizardskin boots id given her two birthdays ago her hair was long and loose and she was made up and lipsticked and looked like a beautiful stranger when i went over to kiss her i kept the bruised side of my face out of view she offered me her lips but kept them closed her hand rested briefly on the back of my neck then dropped off i sat down beside her tour over early i took a day off she said flew in from omaha hows it going she didnt answer i took her hand her fingers were cool and limp as they brushed against my burnt palm before we get into anything she said im going to tell you about sheridan he knew to bring a milkbone because hed met spike before has dogs of his own robin im please alex just listen i let go of her hand sat back sheridan comes on strong she said and his job puts him in close proximity to me so i suppose i can understand your suspicions but just for the record hes a bornagain christian married has four kids under the age of six he brings his entire family on tour with him its kind of a running joke with the rest of the crew his wifes name is bonnie and she used to be a backup singer before she and sheridan found religion both of them are what youd expect from new converts way too joyful zealous upright quoting scripture its annoying but everyone puts up with it because sheridan s a nice person and hes about the best tour coordinator in the business when he does try to influence me its in the form of notsosubtle little asides about accepting christ into my life not sleazy little ploys to get in my pants and yes i know religious observance doesnt necessarily prevent bad behavior but this guy means it hes never come within a mile of anything remotely sexual most of the time when hes in my room bonnies right there with him im sorry i said i wasnt after an apology alex i just wanted to tell you in person so you wouldnt torture yourself thank you what happened to your hand and your face long story the same story she said i suppose thats the other thing the other reason i came by our situation its not simple is it i missed you i said i missed you too still do but there has to be a but dont be angry im not im sad i am too if i didnt care about you id have spared myself seeing you still im not staying alex a car is coming by to take me back to the airport and im rejoining the tour and remaining till the end which may stretch longer weve been doing great raising a bundle for the cause theres been talk of a european extension paris i said she began to cry i wouldve liked to join in but there was no juice left in me we held hands for the rest of the hour not moving from the couch except for the time when i got her a wad of tissues to wipe her eyes when the taxi arrived she said this isnt over lets see how it plays out sure i walked her to the door stood on the terrace and waved three days later i phoned allison gwynns office and told her about larner she said oh my its going to take me some time to integrate this im glad you told me it was good of you to tell me i thought i should are you okay im fine if you ever need someone to talk to ill bear that in mind do that she said i mean it jonathan kellerman jonathan kellerman is one of the worlds most popular authors he has brought his expertise as a child
