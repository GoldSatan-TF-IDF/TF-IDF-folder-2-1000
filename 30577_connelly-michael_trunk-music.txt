michael connelly trunk music the fifth book in the harry bosch series part i as he drove along mulholland drive toward the cahuenga pass bosch began to hear the music it came to him in fragments of strings and errant horn sequences echoing off the brown summerdried hills and blurred by the white noise of traffic carrying up from the hollywood freeway nothing he could identify all he knew was that he was heading toward its source he slowed when he saw the cars parked off to the side of a gravel turnoff road two detective sedans and a patrol car bosch pulled his caprice in behind them and got out a single officer in uniform leaned against the fender of the patrol car yellow plastic crimescene tapethe stuff used by the mile in los angeleswas strung from the patrol cars sideview mirror across the gravel road to the sign posted on the other side the sign said in blackonwhite letters that were almost indistinguishable behind the graffiti that covered the sign lafd fire control mountain fire district road no public admittanceno smoking the patrol cop a large man with sunreddened skin and blond bristly hair straightened up as bosch approached the first thing bosch noted about him other than his size was the baton it was holstered in a ring on his belt and the business end of the club was marred the black acrylic paint scratched away to reveal the aluminum beneath street fighters wore their battlescarred sticks proudly as a sign a not so subtle warning this cop was a headbanger no doubt about it the plate above the cops breast pocket said his name was powers he looked down at bosch through raybans though it was well into dusk and a sky of burnt orange clouds was reflected in his mirrored lenses it was one of those sundowns that reminded bosch of the glow the fires of the riots had put in the sky a few years back harry bosch powers said with a touch of surprise when did you get back on the table bosch looked at him a moment before answering he didnt know powers but that didnt mean anything boschs story was probably known by every cop in hollywood division just did bosch said he didnt make any move to shake hands you didnt do that at crime scenes first case back in the saddle huh bosch took out a cigarette and lit it it was a direct violation of department policy but it wasnt something he was worried about something like that he changed the subject whos down there edgar and the new one from pacific his soul sister rider whatever bosch said nothing further about that he knew what was behind the contempt in the uniform cops voice it didnt matter that he knew kizmin rider had the gift and was a topnotch investigator that would mean nothing to powers even if bosch told him it was so powers probably saw only one reason why he was still wearing a blue uniform instead of carrying a detectives gold badge that he was a white man in an era of female and minority hiring and promotion it was the kind of festering sore better left undisturbed powers apparently registered boschs nonresponse as disagreement and went on anyway they told me to let emmy and sid drive on down when they get here i guess theyre done with the search so you can drive down instead of walking i guess it took a second for bosch to register that powers was referring to the medical examiner and the scientific investigation division tech hed said the names as if they were a couple invited to a picnic bosch stepped out to the pavement dropped the half cigarette and made sure he put it out with his shoe it wouldnt be good to start a brush fire on his first job back with the homicide table ill walk it he said what about lieutenant billets not here yet bosch went back to his car and reached in through the open window for his briefcase he then walked back to powers you the one who found it that was me powers was proud of himself howd you open it keep a slim jim in the car opened the door then popped the trunk why the smell it was obvious wear gloves nope didnt have any what did you touch powers had to think about it for a moment door handle the trunk pull thatd be about it did edgar or rider take a statement you write something up nothing yet bosch nodded listen powers i know youre all proud of yourself but next time dont open the car okay we all want to be detectives but not all of us are thats how crime scenes get fucked up and i think you know that bosch watched the cops face turn a dark shade of crimson and the skin go tight around his jaw listen bosch he said what i know is that if i just called this in as a suspicious vehicle that smells like theres a stiff in the trunk then you people wouldve said what the fuck does powers know and left it there to rot in the sun until there was nothing left of your goddamn crime scene that might be true but see then that would be our fuckup to make instead weve got you fucking us up before we start powers remained angry but mute bosch waited a beat ready to continue the debate before dismissing it can you lift the tape now please powers stepped back to the tape he was about thirtyfive bosch guessed and had the longpracticed swagger of a street veteran in la that swagger came to you quickly as it had in vietnam powers held the yellow tape up and bosch walked under as he passed the cop said dont get lost good one powers you got me there the fire road was one lane and overgrown at its sides with brush that came as high as boschs waist there was trash and broken glass strewn along the gravel the trespassers answer to the sign at the gate bosch knew the road was probably a favorite midnight haunt for teenagers from the city below the music grew louder as he went further in but he still could not identify it about a quarter mile in he came to a gravelbedded clearing that he guessed was a staging point for firefighting apparatus in the event that a brush fire broke out in the surrounding hills today it would serve as a crime scene on the far side of the clearing bosch saw a white rollsroyce silver cloud standing near it were his two partners rider and edgar rider was sketching the crime scene on a clipboard while edgar worked with a tape measure and called out measurements edgar saw bosch and gave an acknowledging wave with a latexgloved hand he let the tape measure snap back into its case harry where you been painting bosch said as he walked up i had to get cleaned up and changed put stuff away as bosch stepped closer to the edge of the clearing the view opened below him they were on a bluff rising above the rear of the hollywood bowl the rounded music shell was down to the left no more than a quarter mile and the shell was the source of the music the la philharmonics endoftheseason labor day weekend show bosch was looking down at eighteen thousand people in concert seats stretching up the opposite side of the canyon they were enjoying one of the last sunday evenings of the summer jesus he said out loud thinking of the problem edgar and rider walked over whatve we got bosch asked rider answered one in the trunk white male gunshots we havent checked him out much further than that weve been keeping the lid closed weve got everybody rolling though bosch started walking toward the rolls going around the charred remnants of an old campfire that had burned in the center of the clearing the other two followed this okay bosch asked as he got close to the rolls yeah we did the search edgar said nothing much got some leakage underneath the car thats about it though cleanest scene ive been at in a while jerry edgar called in from home like everybody else on the team was wearing blue jeans and a white tshirt on the left breast of the shirt was a drawing of a badge and the words lapd homicide as he walked past bosch harry saw that the back of the shirt said our day begins when your day ends the tightfitting shirt contrasted sharply with edgars dark skin and displayed his heavily muscled upper body as he moved with an athletic grace toward the rolls bosch had worked with him on and off for six years but they had never become close outside of the job this was the first time it had dawned on bosch that edgar actually was an athlete that he must regularly work out it was unusual for edgar not to be in one of his crisp nordstroms suits but bosch thought he knew why his informal dress practically guaranteed he would avoid having to do the dirty work nextofkin notification they slowed their steps when they got close to the rolls as if perhaps whatever was wrong here might be contagious the car was parked with its rear end facing south and visible to the spectators in the upper levels of the bowl across the way bosch considered their situation again so you want to pull this guy out of there with all those people with their wine and box lunches from the grill watching he asked how do you think thats going to play on the tv tonight well edgar replied we thought wed kind of leave that decision to you harry you being the three edgar smiled and winked yeah right bosch said sarcastically im the three bosch was still getting used to the idea of being a socalled team leader it had been almost eighteen months since he had officially investigated a homicide let alone headed up a team of three investigators he had been assigned to the hollywood division burglary table when he returned to work from his involuntary stress leave in january the detective bureau commander lieutenant grace billets had explained that his assignment was a way of gradually easing him back into detective work he knew that explanation was a lie and that she had been told where to put him but he took the demotion without complaint he knew they would come for him eventually after eight months of pushing papers and making the occasional burglary arrest bosch was called into the cos office and billets told him she was making changes the divisions homicide clearance rate had dipped to its lowest point ever fewer than half of the killings were cleared she had taken over command of the bureau nearly a year earlier and the sharpest decline she struggled to admit had come under her own watch bosch could have told her that the decline was due in part to her not following the same statistical deceptions practiced by her predecessor harvey pounds who had always found ways of pumping up the clearance rate but he kept that to himself instead he sat quietly while billets laid out her plan the first part of the plan was to move bosch back to the homicide table as of the start of september a detective named selby who barely pulled his weight would go from homicide to boschs slot on the burglary table billets was also adding a young and smart detective transfer she had previously worked with in the pacific division detective bureau kizmin rider next and this was the radical part billets was changing the traditional pairing of detectives instead the nine homicide detectives assigned to hollywood would be grouped into three teams of three each of the three teams would have a detective third grade in charge bosch was a three he was named team leader of squad one the reasoning behind the change was soundat least on paper most homicides are solved in the first fortyeight hours after discovery or they arent solved at all billets wanted more solved so she was going to put more detectives on each one the part that didnt look so good on paper especially to the nine detectives was that previously there had been four pairs of partners working homicide cases the new changes meant each detective would be working every third case that came up instead of every fourth it meant more cases more work more court time more overtime and more stress only the overtime was considered a positive but billets was tough and didnt care much for the complaints of the detectives and her new plan quickly won her the obvious nickname anybody talk to bullets yet bosch asked i called rider said she was up in santa barbara for the weekend left a number with the desk shes coming down early but shes still at least an hour and a half from us she said she was going to have to drop the hubby off first and would probably just roll to the bureau bosch nodded and stepped to the rear of the rolls he picked up the smell right away it was faint but it was there unmistakable like no other he nodded to no one in particular again he placed his briefcase on the ground opened it and took a pair of latex gloves from the cardboard box inside he then closed the case and placed it a few feet behind him and out of the way okay lets take a look he said while stretching the gloves over his hands he hated how they felt lets stand close we dont want to give the people in the bowl more of a show than they paid for it aint pretty edgar said as he stepped forward the three of them stood together at the back end of the rolls to shield the view from the concertgoers but bosch knew that anybody with a decent pair of field glasses would know what was going on this was la before opening the trunk he noticed the cars personalized license plate it said tna before he could speak edgar answered his unasked question comes back to tna productions on melrose t and a no the letters tna just like on the plate where on melrose edgar took a notebook out of his pocket and looked through the pages the address he gave was familiar to bosch but he couldnt place it he knew it was down near paramount the sprawling studio that took up the entire north side of the fiftyfivehundred block the big studio was surrounded by smaller production houses and ministudios they were like sucker fish that swam around the mouth of the big shark hoping for the scraps that didnt get sucked in okay lets do it he turned his attention back to the trunk he could see that the lid had been lightly placed down so it would not lock closed using one rubbercoated finger he gently lifted it as the trunk was opened it expelled a sickeningly fetid breath of death bosch immediately wished he had a cigarette but those days were through he knew what a defense lawyer could do with one ash from a cops smoke at a crime scene reasonable doubts were built on less he leaned in under the lid to get a close look careful not to touch the bumper with his pants the body of a man was in the trunk his skin was a grayish white and he was expensively dressed in linen pants sharply pressed and cuffed at the bottom a pale blue shirt with a flowery pattern and a leather sport coat his feet were bare the dead man was on his right side in the fetal position except his wrists were behind him instead of folded against his chest it appeared to bosch that his hands had been tied behind him and the bindings then removed most likely after he was dead bosch looked closely and could see a small abrasion on the left wrist probably caused by the struggle against the bindings the mans eyes were closed tightly and there was a whitish almost translucent material dried in the corners of the sockets kiz i want you taking notes on appearance right bosch bent further into the trunk he saw a froth of purged blood had dried in the dead mans mouth and nose his hair was caked with blood which had spread over the shoulders and to the trunk mat coating it with a coagulated pool he could see the hole in the floor of the trunk through which blood had drained to the gravel below it was a foot from the victims head and appeared to be evenly cut in the metal underlining in a spot where the floor mat was folded over it was not a bullet hole it was probably a drain or a hole left by a bolt that had vibrated loose and fallen out in the mess that was the back of the mans head bosch could see two distinct jaggededged penetrations to the lower rear skullthe occipital protuberancethe scientific name popping easily into his mind too many autopsies he thought the hair close to the wounds was charred by the gasses that explode out of the barrel of a gun the scalp showed stippling from gunpowder pointblank shots no exit wounds that he could see probably twentytwos he guessed they bounce around inside like marbles dropped into an empty jelly jar bosch looked up and saw a small spray of blood splattered on the inside of the trunk lid he studied the spots for a long moment and then stepped back and straightened up he appraised the entire view of the trunk now his mind checking off an imaginary list because no blood drips had been found on the access road into the clearing he had no doubts that the man had been killed here in the trunk still there were other unknowns why here why no shoes and socks why were the bindings taken off the wrists he put these questions aside for the time being you check for the wallet he asked without looking at the two others not yet edgar replied recognize him for the first time bosch looked at the face as a face there was still fear etched on it the man had closed his eyes he had known what was coming bosch wondered if the whitish material in the eyes was dried tears no do you nope its too messy anyway bosch gingerly lifted the back of the leather coat and saw no wallet in the back pockets of the dead mans pants he then opened the jacket and saw the wallet was there in an inside pocket that carried a fred haber mens shop label on it bosch could also see a paper folder for an airline ticket in the pocket with his other hand he reached into the jacket and removed the two items get the lid he said as he backed away edgar closed it over as gently as an undertaker closing a coffin bosch then walked over to his briefcase squatted down and put the two items down on it he opened the wallet first there was a full complement of credit cards in slots on the left side and a drivers license behind a plastic window on the right the name on the license said anthony n aliso anthony n aliso edgar said tony for short tna tna productions the address was in hidden highlands a tiny enclave off mulholland in the hollywood hills it was the kind of place that was surrounded by walls and had a guard shack manned twentyfour hours a day mostly by offduty or retired lapd cops the address went well with the rollsroyce bosch opened the billfold section and found a sheaf of currency without taking the money out he counted two onehundreddollar bills and nine twenties he called the amount out so that rider could make a note of it next he opened the airline folder inside was the receipt for a oneway ticket on an american airlines flight departing las vegas for lax at friday night the name on the ticket matched the drivers license bosch checked the back flap of the ticket folder but there was no sticker or staple indicating that a bag had been checked by the ticket holder curious bosch left the wallet and the ticket on the case and went to look into the car through the windows no luggage none rider said bosch went back to the trunk and raised the lid again looking in at the body he hooked a finger up the left sleeve of the jacket and pulled it up there was a gold rolex watch on the wrist the face was encircled with a ring of tiny diamonds shit bosch turned around it was edgar what you want me to call ocid why wop name no robbery two in the back of the head its a whack job harry we oughta call ocid not yet ill tell you right now thats what bullets is gonna wanna do well see bosch appraised the body again looking closely at the contorted bloodied face then he closed the lid bosch stepped away from the car and to the edge of the clearing the spot offered a brilliant view of the city looking east across the sprawl of hollywood he could easily pick up the spires of downtown in the light haze he saw the lights of dodger stadium were on for the twilight game the dodgers were dead even with colorado with a month to go and nomo due to pitch the game bosch had a ticket in his inside coat pocket but he knew that bringing it along had been wishful thinking he wouldnt get anywhere near the stadium tonight he also knew edgar was right the killing had all the aspects of a mob hit the organized crime intelligence division should be notifiedif not to take over the investigation entirely then at least to offer advice but bosch was delaying that notification it had been a long time since hed had a case he didnt want to give it up yet he looked back down at the bowl it looked like a sellout to him the crowd seated in an elliptical formation going up the opposite hill the seating sections furthest away from the music shell were the highest up the hill and at an almost even level with the clearing where the rolls was parked bosch wondered how many of the people were watching him at that moment again he thought of the dilemma he faced he had to get the investigation going but he knew that if he pulled the body out of the trunk with such an audience watching there likely would be hell to pay for the bad public relations such a move would cause the city and the department once again edgar seemed to know his thoughts hell harry they wont care at the jazz festival a few years back there was a couple up on this spot doing the nasty for half an hour when they were done they got a standing ovation guy stands up buck naked and takes a little bow bosch looked back at him to see if he was serious i read it in the times the only in la column well jerry this is the philharmonic its a different crowd know what i mean and i dont want this to end up in only in la okay okay harry bosch looked at rider she hadnt said much of anything yet what do you think kiz i dont know youre the three rider was small five feet and no more than a hundred pounds with her gun on she would never have made it before the department relaxed the physical requirements to attract more women she had light brown skin her hair was straightened and kept short she wore jeans and a pink oxford shirt beneath a black blazer on her small body the jacket did not do much to disguise a mm glock holstered on her right hip billets had told him that she had worked with rider in pacific rider had worked robbery and fraud cases but was called out on occasion to work homicides in which there were overlying financial aspects billets had said rider could break a crime scene down as well as most veteran homicide detectives she had pulled strings to get riders transfer approved but was already resigned to the fact that she wouldnt stay long in the division rider was marked for travel her double minority status coupled with the facts that she was good at what she did and had a guardian angelbillets wasnt sure whoat parker center practically guaranteed her stay in hollywood would be short it was a bit of final seasoning before she headed downtown to the glass house what about the opg bosch asked held up on that rider said thought wed be here a while before we moved the car bosch nodded it was what he expected her to say the official police garage was usually last on the callout list he was just stalling trying to make a decision while asking questions he already knew the answers to finally he made his decision on what to do okay go ahead and call he said tell them to come now and tell them to bring a flatbed okay even if theyve got a hook in the neighborhood make em turn around tell em its gotta be a flat theres a phone in my briefcase got it rider said why the flatbed harry edgar asked bosch didnt answer were moving the whole show rider said what edgar asked rider went to the briefcase without answering bosch held back a smile she knew what he was doing and he began to see some of the promise billets had talked about he got out a cigarette and lit it he put the burnt match into the cellophane around the pack and replaced it in the pocket of his coat he noticed as he smoked that the sound at the edge of the clearing where he could look directly down into the bowl was much better after a few moments he was even able to identify the piece being played sheherazade he said whats that harry edgar asked the music its called sheherazade ever heard it im not sure im hearing it now all the echoes man bosch snapped his fingers out of the blue a thought had pushed through in his mind he saw the studios arched gate the replica of the arc de triomphe in paris that address on melrose bosch said thats near paramount one of those feederfish studios right nearby i think its archway yeah i think youre right rider walked up then we got a flat on the way she said eta is fifteen i checked on sid and me also on the way sid has somebody just wrapped up a home invasion in nichols canyon so they should be right over good bosch said either of you go over the story with the swinging stick yet not since the preliminary edgar said not our type thought wed leave him for the three the unspoken meaning of this was that edgar had sensed the racist animosity powers radiated toward himself and rider okay ill take him bosch said i want you two to finish the charting then do another sweep of the immediate area take different areas this time he realized he had just told them things he didnt need to tell them sorry you know what to do all im saying is lets take this one by the numbers ive got a feeling its going eight by ten on us what about ocid edgar asked i told you not yet eight by ten rider said a confused expression on her face eight by ten case edgar told her celebrity case studio case if thats a hotshot from the industry in that trunk somebody from archway were going to get some media on this more than some a dead guy in the trunk of his rolls is news a dead industry guy in the trunk of his rolls is bigger news archway bosch left them there as edgar filled her in on the facts of life when it came to murder the media and the movie business in hollywood bosch licked his fingers to put the cigarette out and then put it with the used match in the cellophane wrapper he slowly began walking the quarter mile back to mulholland once again searching the gravel road in a backandforth manner but there was so much debris on the gravel and in the nearby brush that it was impossible to know if anythinga cigarette butt a beer bottle a used condomwas related to the rolls or not the one thing he looked closest for was blood if there was blood on the road that could be linked to the victim it could indicate that he was killed elsewhere and left in the clearing no blood probably meant the killing had taken place right there he realized as he made the fruitless search that he was feeling relaxed maybe even happy he was back on the beat and following his mission once again mindful that the man in the trunk had to have perished for him to feel this way bosch quickly wrote that guilt off the man would have ended up in the trunk whether bosch had ever made it back to the homicide table or not when bosch got to mulholland he saw the fire trucks there were two of them and a battalion of firefighters standing around them seemingly waiting for something he lit another cigarette and looked at powers youve got a problem the uniform cop said what before powers answered one of the firefighters stepped up he wore the white helmet of a battalion chief you in charge he asked thats me chief jon friedman he said weve got a problem thats what i hear the show down in the bowl is supposed to end in ninety minutes after that weve got the fireworks problem is this fellow says you got yourself a dead body up there and a crime scene thats the problem if we cant get up there to set up a safety position for the fireworks there isnt going to be any fireworks we cant allow it if were not in position we could see the whole down slope of these hills go up with one errant missile know what i mean bosch noticed powers smirking at his dilemma bosch ignored him and returned his attention to friedman chief how long do you need to set up ten minutes max we just got to be there before the first one goes up ninety minutes about eightyfive now theres gonna be a lot of angry people down there if they dont get their fireworks bosch realized he wasnt as much making decisions as having them made for him chief hold here well be out in an hour and fifteen dont cancel the show you sure about that count on it detective what chief youre breaking the law with that cigarette he nodded toward the graffiticovered sign sorry chief bosch walked out to the road to stamp out the smoke while friedman headed back to his people to radio in that the show would go on bosch realized the danger and caught up to him chief you can say the show will go on but dont put anything out on the air about the body we dont need the media out here helicopters swooping over i gotcha bosch thanked him and turned his attention to powers you cant clear a scene in an hour and fifteen powers said the me isnt even here let me worry about that powers you write something up yet not yet been dealing with these guys wouldve helped if one of you folks had a twoway with you up there then why dont you run it down for me from the start what about them powers asked nodding in the direction of the clearing why isnt one of them talking to me edgar and rider because theyre busy you want to run it down for me or not i already told you from the start powers you told me what you did once you checked the car out what made you check it theres nothin much to tell i usually make a pass by here each watch chase away the dirtbags he pointed across mulholland and up to the crest of the hill there was a line of houses most on cantilevers clinging to the crestline they looked like mobile homes suspended in air people up there call the station all the time say they got campfires going down here beer parties devil worship who knows what guess it ruins their view and they dont want nothin to spoil that milliondollar view so i come up and sweep out the trash mostly bored little pissants from the valley fire department used to have a lock on the gate here but a deuce plowed through it that was six months ago takes the city at least a year to repair anything round here shit i requisitioned batteries for my mag three weeks ago and im still waiting for them if i didnt buy them myself id be working the fuckin night watch without a flashlight city doesnt care this ci so what about the rolls powers lets stay on the subject yeah well i usually make it by after dark but because of the show in the bowl i swung by early today saw the rolls then you came on your own no complaint from up the hill no today i just cruised it on my own on account of the show i figured there might be some trespassers were there a fewpeople waiting to hear the music not the usual crowd though thats refined music i guess youd call it i chased em out anyway and when they were gone the rolls was what was left but there was no driver for it so you checked it out yeah and i know the smell man popped it with the slim and there he was the stiff then i backed out and called the pros there was a note of sarcasm in the way he said the last word bosch ignored it the people you chased you get any names no like i told you i chased them then noticed that nobody got in and drove away in the rolls it was too late by then what about last night what about it did you make it by here i was off im on tuesdaysaturday but i switched with a buddy last night cause he had something to do tonight so then what about friday night he shook his head three watch is always busy friday i had no time for free cruising and we didnt get a complaint as far as i knowso i never made it by just chasin the radio i had calls backed up on me all night i didnt even get a tenseven no dinner break thats dedication powers whats that supposed to mean bosch saw he had made a mistake powers was consumed by job frustrations and he had pushed him too far powers turned crimson again and slowly took off his raybans before speaking let me tell you something big shot you got in while the getting was good the rest of us we get shit weive been trying for so many years i cant count to get a gold shield and ive got about as much chance of getting one as whoevers in the trunk of that rollsroyce but im not laying down im still out here five nights a week chasin the radio says protect and serve on the car door and im doin it man so dont give me any shit about dedication bosch hesitated until he was sure powers was done look powers i didnt mean to give you shit okay you want a cigarette i dont smoke okay lets try this again he waited a beat while powers put the mirrors back on his eyes and seemed to calm down you always work alone im the z car bosch nodded zebra unit an officer of many stripes meaning he handled a variety of calls usually trash calls while cars with two officers aboard handled the hotshotsthe prime possibly dangerous calls zebras worked patrol alone and often had free rein of the entire division they were in the supervisory level between the sergeants and the grunts who were assigned to patrol geographic slices of the division known as basic car areas how often you chase people outta here once or twice a month cant say what happens on the other shifts or with the basic cars but shit calls like this usually go to the z car you got any shakes shakes were threebyfive cards formally called field interview or fi cards cops filled them out when they stopped suspicious people but did not have enough evidence to arrest them or when making such an arrestin this case for trespassingwould be a waste of time the american civil liberties union called such stops shakedowns and an abuse of police powers the name stuck even with the cops ive got some yeah at the station good wed like to have a look if you could dig them out also think you could ask the cops in the basic car if theyve noticed the rolls here the last few days is this where im supposed to thank you for letting me have a part in the big bad investigation and ask you to put in a good word for me with the deputy chief of dicks bosch stared at him a few moments before answering no this is where i tell you to have the cards ready for us by nine tonight or ill put in a word about that with the patrol skipper and never mind the basic car people well go ahead and talk to them ourselves dont want you to miss your tenseven two shifts in a row powers bosch started back toward the crime scene moving slowly again and checking the other side of the gravel road twice he had to step off the gravel and into the brush to let the official police garage truck pass and then the scientific investigation division van by the time he got to the clearing he again had come up with nothing during his search and was sure the victim had been murdered in the trunk while the rolls was parked in the clearing he saw art donovan the sid tech and roland quatro the photographer who came with him starting their work bosch walked up to rider anything she asked no you nothing i think the rolls mustve been driven in with our guy in the trunk then the doer gets out opens the lid and pops him twice he closes the trunk and walks out somebody picks him up out on mulholland clean scene back here bosch nodded him well im going with the percentages for now bosch walked over to donovan who was bagging the wallet and airline ticket in a clear plastic evidence envelope art weve got a problem youre telling me i was just thinking i can rig some tarps over light tripods but i dont think youll be able to block the view for everybody in the bowl some of them are going to get a show all right i guess it will make up for canceling the fireworks that is unless youre just planning to sit tight with it until after the show nah we do that and some defense lawyer will tear us new assholes in court for delaying things every lawyer went to school on oj art you know that so then what do we do just do what youve got to do here with some speed and then well take the whole thing to the print shed you know if anybodys in there right now no it should be free donovan said slowly you mean youre talking about the whole thing the body too bosch nodded besides you can do a better job with it in the shed right absolutely but what about the me theyve got to sign off on something like this harry ill deal with that before we put it on the flatbed though make sure you guys have got stills and video in case things shift during transit also run a print card off the guy and give it to me you got it while donovan went to quatro to explain the drill bosch huddled with edgar and rider okay for now were going to run with this one if you had plans for the rest of the night make your calls its going to be a long one this is how i want to break it up he pointed up to the homes on the crestline first kiz i want you to go up there and do a housetohouse you know the routine see if anybody remembers seeing the rolls or knows how long its been here maybe somebody heard the shots they mightve echoed up the side of the hill we want to try to pin down the time this happened after that iyou got a phone no i have a rover in the car no i want to keep everything about this off the air i can use a phone in somebodys house okay call me when youre done or ill page you when im done depending on how things shake out you and i will either do next of kin or his

whining and appraised both his partners ill stay with the body if i get tied up kiz you go on to check out the office address and ill handle next of kin okay everybody know whats what rider and edgar nodded bosch could tell edgar was still annoyed about something kiz you head out now she walked away and bosch waited until she was out of earshot before speaking okay jerry whats the problem i just want to know if thats how its going to be on this team am i going to get the shit work while the princess skates no jerry its not going to be like that and i think you know me well enough not to ask whats the real problem i dont like your choices on this harry we should be on the phone with organized crime right now if anything looks like an oc case this is it i think you should call em but i think cause youre fresh back on the table and been waiting for a case so long youre not making the call thats the problem edgar held his hands out as if to indicate how obvious this was you know youve got nothing to prove here harry and theres never going to be a shortage of bodies to come along this is hollywood remember i think we should just turn this one over and wait for the next one bosch nodded you may be right he said you probably are about all of it but im the three so we do it my way for now im going to call bullets and tell her what weve got then im going to call ocid but even if they roll out were going to keep a part of this you know that so lets do it good okay edgar nodded reluctantly look bosch said your objection is noted for the record okay sure harry bosch saw the blue mes van pull into the clearing then the tech behind the wheel was richard matthews it was a break matthews wasnt as territorial as some of the others and bosch figured he could convince him to go along with the plan to move the whole package to the print shed matthews would understand that it was the only choice stay in touch bosch said as edgar walked off edgar sullenly waved without looking back for the next few moments bosch stood alone in the midst of the activities of the crime scene he realized he truly reveled in his role the start of a case always seemed to jazz him this way and he knew how much he had missed it and craved it during the last year and a half finally he put his thoughts aside and walked toward the mes van to talk to matthews there was a burst of applause from the bowl as sheherazade ended the print shed was a world war ii quonset hut that sat in the city services equipment yard behind the police headquarters at parker center it had no windows and a doublewide garage door the interior was painted black and every crack or crevice where light might come in was taped over there were thick black curtains that could be pulled closed after the garage door was shut when they were pulled the interior was as black as a loan sharks heart the techs who worked there even referred to the place as the cave while the rolls was being unloaded from the opg truck bosch took his briefcase to a workbench inside the shed and got the phone out the organized crime investigation division was a secret society within the greater closed society of the department bosch knew very little about ocid and was acquainted with few detectives assigned to the unit the ocid was a mysterious force even to those within the department not many knew exactly what it did and this of course bred suspicions and jealousies most ocid detectives were known in detective services as bigfooters they swooped down to take investigations away from detectives like bosch but they didnt often make cases in return bosch had seen many investigations disappear under their door with not many prosecutions of oc wise guys resulting they were the only division in the department with a black budgetapproved in closed session by the chief and a police commission that largely followed his lead from there the money disappeared into the dark to pay for informants investigations and hightech equipment many of their cases disappeared in that netherworld as well bosch asked the communications operator to connect his call to the ocid supervisor on call for the weekend as he waited for the patch through he thought again about the body in the trunk anthony alisoif that was who it washad seen it coming and closed his eyes bosch hoped it wouldnt be that way for himself he didnt want to know hello a voice said yes this is harry bosch im the dthree on a homicide call out in hollywood who am i speaking with dom carbone ive got the weekend call out you going to spoil it maybe bosch tried to think the name was vaguely familiar but he could not place it he was sure they had never worked together thats why im calling you might want to take a look at this run it down for me sure white male found in the trunk of his silver cloud with two in the back of the head probably twentytwos what else car was on a fire road off mulholland doesnt look like a straight robbery at least not a personal robbery i got cards and cash in the wallet and a presidential on his wrist diamonds at every hour on the hour youre not telling me who the stiff is whos the stiff nothing confirmed yet but just give it to me bosch had trouble not being able to put a face with the voice over the phone it looks like the id is going to be anthony n aliso fortyeight years old lives up in the hills looks like he has some kind of company with an office at one of the studios down on melrose near paramount tna productions is the name of his outfit i think its over at archway studios well know more in a little while he only got silence in return mean anything anthony aliso yeah right anthony aliso carbone repeated the name slowly as if it were a fine wine he was tasting before deciding whether to accept the bottle or spit it out he was then quiet for another long moment nothing hits me right away bosch he finally said i can make a couple calls where you going to be the print shed hes here with us and ill be here a while what do you mean you got the guys body there in the shed its a long story when do you think you can get back to me as soon as i make the calls you been over to his office not yet well get there sometime tonight bosch gave him the number of his cellular phone then closed it and put it in his coat pocket for a moment he thought about carbones reaction to the victims name he finally decided he could not read anything into it after the cloud was rolled into place in the shed and the doors shut donovan pulled the curtains closed there was fluorescent lighting overhead which he left on while he got his equipment ready matthews the coroners tech and his two assistantsthe body movershuddled over a workbench getting the tools they would need out of a case harry im going to take my time with this okay first ill laser the trunk with the guy in it then we take him out then we glue it and laser it again then we worry about the rest of it your show man whatever time you need ill need your help with the wand when i shoot pictures roland had to go to shoot another scene bosch nodded and watched as the sid tech screwed an orange filter onto a nikon camera he put the camera strap over his head and turned on the laser it was a box about the size of a vcr with a cable attachment that led to a footlong wand with a hand grip on it from the end of the wand a strong orange beam was emitted donovan opened a cabinet and took out several pairs of orangetinted safety glasses which he handed to bosch and the others he put the last pair on himself he gave bosch a pair of latex gloves to put on as well ill do a quick run around the outside of the trunk and then open her up donovan said just as donovan moved to the switch box to cut off the overheads the phone in boschs pocket buzzed donovan waited while bosch answered it was carbone bosch were taking a pass harry didnt say anything for a moment and neither did carbone donovan hit the light switch and the room plunged into complete blackness youre saying you dont have this guy bosch finally spoke into the dark i checked around made some calls nobody seems to know this guy nobodys working him clean as far as we know you said he was put in his trunk and capped twice huhbosch you there yeah im here yeah capped twice in the trunk trunk music what its a wise guy saying outta chicago you know when they whack some poor slob they say oh tony dont worry about tony hes trunk music now you wont see him no more but the thing is bosch this doesnt seem to fit we dont know this guy people i talked to they think maybe somebodys trying to make you think its oc connected know what i mean bosch watched as the laser beam cut through the blackness and bombarded the rear of the trunk with searing light with the glasses on the orange was filtered out and the light was a bright intense white bosch was ten feet away from the rolls but he could see glowing patterns on the trunk lid and the bumper this always reminded him of those national geographic shows in which a submersible camera moved through the oceans black depths putting its light on sunken ships or aircraft it was somehow eerie look carbone he said you arent even interested in coming out to take a look not at this time of course give me a call back if you come across anything you know that shows different than what i told you and ill do some more checking tomorrow i got your number bosch was secretly pleased that he wasnt going to get bigfooted by the ocid but he was also surprised at the brushoff the quickness with which carbone had dismissed the case seemed unusual any other details you want to give me bosch were just starting but let me ask you you ever hear of a hitter takes the vics shoes with him also he unties the body afterward takes his shoesunties him uh not offhand no nobody specific but like i said ill ask around in the morning and ill put it on our box anything else cute about this one bosch didnt like what was happening carbone seemed too interested while saying he wasnt he said tony aliso wasnt connected yet he still wanted the details was he just trying to be helpful or was there something more to it thats about all we got at the moment bosch said deciding not to give up anything else for free like i said were just getting going here okay then give me the morning and ill do some more checking ill call if i come up with anything okay right check you later but you know what i think you have there bosch youve got a guy he was probably making sandwiches with somebodys wife lotta times things look like pro hits that arent you know what i mean yeah i know what you mean ill talk to you later bosch walked to the rear of the rolls up close he could see the pattern swirls he had noticed in the laser light before appeared to be swipe marks made with a cloth it looked like the whole car had been wiped down but when donovan moved the wand over the bumper the laser picked up a partial shoe print on the chrome did anybody no bosch said nobody put their foot there okay then hold the wand on the print bosch did so while donovan bent over and took several photos bracketing the exposure settings to make sure he had at least one clear shot it was the forward half of the foot there was a circle pattern at the ball of the foot with lines extending from it like the rays of a sun there was a crosscut pattern through the arch and then the print was cut off by the edge of the bumper tennis shoe donovan said maybe a work shoe after he photographed it he moved the wand around the trunk again but there was nothing but wipe marks okay donovan said open it using a penlight to guide his way bosch made it to the drivers door and bent in to pull the trunk release shortly afterward the smell of death flooded the shed it looked to bosch as though the body had not shifted during the transport but the victim took on a ghoulish look under the harsh examination of the laser his face almost skeletal like the monsters painted in dayglo in funhouse hallways the blood seemed blacker and the bone chips in the jagged wound were luminescent in bright counterpoint on his clothes small strands of hair and tiny threads glowed bosch moved in with a pair of tweezers and a plastic vial like the kind made to hold a stack of silver half dollars he carefully picked these pieces of potential evidence off the clothing and collected them in the vial it was painstaking work and there was nothing much there he knew this kind of material could be found on anybody at anytime it was common when he was done he said to donovan the tail of the jacket i flipped it up to check for a wallet okay pull it back down bosch did so and there on alisos hip was another footprint it matched the footprint on the bumper but was more complete on the heel was another circle pattern with offshooting lines in the lower arch was what looked like a brand name but it was unreadable regardless of whether they could identify the shoe bosch knew it was a good find it meant that a careful killer had made a mistake at least one if nothing else it gave rise to the hope that there might be other mistakes that they might eventually lead him to the killer take the wand bosch did so and donovan did his thing with the camera again im just shooting this to document it but well take the jacket off before the body goes he said next donovan moved the laser up around the inside of the trunk lid here the laser illuminated numerous fingerprints mostly thumbprints where a hand would have been placed to prop the lid open while loading things in or out many of the prints overlapped each other a sign that they were old and bosch knew right away they probably belonged to the victim himself ill shoot these but dont count on anything donovan said i know when he was done donovan put the wand and the camera on top of the laser box and said okay why dont we take this fellow out of there lay im out and scan im real quick before hes outta here without waiting for an answer he flipped the fluorescents back on and everybody put their hands to their eyes as the harsh light blinded them a few moments later the body movers and matthews went to the trunk and started transferring the corpse to a black plastic body bag they had unfolded on a gurney this guy is loose matthews said as they put the corpse down yeah bosch said what do you think fortytwo to fortyeight but let me do some stuff and see what weve got but first donovan put out the lights again and moved the wand over the body from the head down the tear pools in the eye sockets glowed white in the light there were a few hairs and fibers on the dead mans face and bosch dutifully collected them there was also a slight abrasion high on the right cheekbone which had been hidden when the body was lying on its right side in the trunk he couldve been hit or it mighta been from being shoved into the trunk donovan said as the beam moved down over the chest donovan got excited well lookee here glowing in the laser light were what looked like a complete handprint on the right shoulder of the leather jacket and two smudged thumbprints one on each of the lapels donovan bent down very close to look this is treated leather it doesnt absorb the acids in the prints we caught a major break here harry this guy wears anything else and forget it the hand is excellent these thumbs didnt takei think we can raise them up with some glue harry bend one of the lapels over bosch reached for the left lapel and carefully turned the cloth over there on the inside of the crease were four more fingerprints he turned the right lapel and saw four more there it appeared that someone had grabbed tony aliso by the lapels donovan whistled this looks like two different people look at the size of the thumbs on the lapel and the hand on the shoulder id say the hand is smaller harry maybe a woman i dont know but the hands that grabbed this guy by the lapels were big donovan got scissors from a nearby toolbox and carefully cut the sport coat off the body bosch then held it as donovan went over it with the laser wand nothing else came up besides the shoe print and the fingerprints they had already sighted bosch carefully hung the jacket over a chair at the counter and came back to the body donovan was moving the laser over the lower extremities what else donovan said to no one except maybe the body come on now tell us a story there were more fibers and some old stains on the pants nothing that stood out as possibly significant until they reached the cuffs bosch pulled open the cuff on the right leg and in the crease was a large buildup of dust and fibers also five tiny pieces of gold glitter glowed in the laser beam bosch carefully tweezered these into a separate plastic vial from the left cuff he recovered two more similar pieces what is it he asked got me looks like glitter or something donovan moved the wand over the bare feet they were clean which indicated to bosch that the victims shoes had probably been removed after he was forced into the trunk of the rolls okay thats it donovan said the lights came back on and matthews went to work with the corpse rotating joints opening the shirt to look at the lividity level of the blood opening the eyes and swiveling the head donovan paced around waiting for the coroners tech to finish so he could continue the laser show he walked over to bosch harry you want the swag on this swag scientific wild ass guess yeah bosch said amused give me the swag well i think somebody gets the drop on this guy ties him up dumps him in the trunk and drives him to that fire road hes still alive okay then our doer gets out opens the trunk puts his foot on the bumper ready to do the job but cant get all the way in there to put the muzzle against the bone you know that was important to him to do the job right so he sticks his big foot on this poor guys hip leans further in and bam bam out go the headlights what do you think bosch nodded i think you are on to something he had already been thinking along the same lines but was past those deductions to the problem then how does he get back he asked back to where if this guy was in the trunk the whole time then the doer drove the rolls if he drove there in the rolls then hows he get back to wherever he intercepted tony the other one donovan said weve got two different prints on the jacket somebody couldve followed behind the rolls the woman the one who put her hand on the vics shoulder bosch nodded he had already been puzzling with this but didnt like something about the scenario donovan had woven he wasnt sure what it was okay bosch matthews interrupted you want to hear this tonight or you want to wait for the report tnight bosch said okay then listen up lividity was fixed and unchanged the body was never moved once the heart stopped pumping he referred to a clipboard lets see what else weve got ninety percent rigor mortis resolution cornea clouding and weve got skin slippage i think you take all of that and its fortyeight hours maybe a couple hours less let us know if you come up with any markers and we might do better will do bosch said by markers he knew matthews meant that if he traced the victims last day and found out what he had eaten last and when the me could get a better fix on time of death by studying the digestion of food in the stomach hes all yours bosch said to matthews any idea on the post you caught the tail end of a holiday weekend thats bad luck for you last i heard weve run on twentyseven homicides in the county so far we probably wont cut this one until wednesday if youre lucky dont call us well call you yeah ive heard that one before but the delay didnt really bother bosch this time in cases like this the autopsy usually held few surprises it was pretty clear how the victim died the mystery was why and by whom matthews and his assistants wheeled the corpse out leaving bosch and donovan alone with the rolls donovan stared at the car silently contemplating it the way a matador looks at the bull he is going to fight were going to get her secrets harry boschs phone buzzed then and he fumbled getting it out of his jacket and open it was edgar we got the id harry it is aliso you got this off the prints yeah mosslers got a fax at home i sent him everything and he eyeballed it mossler was one of the sids latentprint men this is with the dl thumbprint right also i pulled a full set of tonys prints from an old pop for soliciting mossler had those to look at too its aliso okay good work what else you got like i said i ran this guy hes pretty clean just the soliciting arrest back in seventyfive few other things though his name comes up as a victim on a burglary up at his house in march and on the civil indexes ive got a few civil actions against the guy breachofcontract stuff it looks like a trail of broken promises and pissedoff people harry good motive stuff what were the cases about thats all ive got for now just the abstracts in the civil index ill have to pull the actual cases when i can get into the courthouse okay did you check missing persons yeah i did he was never reported you got anything there maybe we mightve gotten lucky looks like we are going to get some prints off the body two sets off the body thats very cool off the leather jacket bosch could tell edgar was excited both detectives knew that if the prints were not those of a suspect then they would surely be fresh enough to belong to people who had seen the victim in the time shortly before his death you call ocid bosch was waiting for him to ask yeah theyre taking a pass what thats what they said at least for now until we find something they might be interested in bosch wondered if edgar even believed he had made the call that doesnt figure harry yeah well all we can do is our job you hear from kiz not yet whod you talk to over at organized crime guy named carbone he was on call never heard of him well neither had i i gotta go jerry let me know what you know as soon as bosch hung up the door to the shed opened and in stepped lieutenant grace billets she quickly scanned the room and saw donovan working in the car she asked bosch to step outside and that was when he knew she was unhappy she closed the door after he stepped out she was in her forties and had as many years on the job as bosch give or take a couple but they had never worked together before her assignment as his commanding officer she was of medium build with reddishbrown hair she kept short she wore no makeup she was dressed entirely in blackjeans tshirt and blazer she also wore black cowboy boots her only concession to femininity was the pair of thin gold hoop earrings her manner was no concession to anything whats going on harry you moved the body in the car had to it was either that or dump it out of the car with about ten thousand people watching us instead of the fireworks they were supposed to see bosch explained the situation in detail and billets listened silently when he was done she nodded im sorry she said i didnt know the details it looks like it was your only choice bosch liked that about her she wasnt always right and she was willing to admit it thanks lieutenant so what do we have when bosch and billets stepped back into the shed donovan was at one of the worktables working with the leather jacket he had hung it on a wire inside an empty onehundredgallon aquarium and then dropped in a hard evidence packet the packet when broken open emitted cyanoacrylate fumes which would attach to the amino acids and oils of fingerprints and crystallize thereby raising the ridges and whorls and making them more visible and photoready hows it look bosch asked real good were going to get something off this howdy lieutenant hello there billets said bosch could tell she didnt remember donovans name listen art he said when you get those together get them over to the print lab and then call me or edgar and tell us well get somebody over there to do them code three code three was a patrol response code meaning lights and siren authorized bosch needed the prints to be handled quickly so far they were the best lead will do harry what about the rolls can i get in it yet well im not quite through with it you can go in just be careful bosch began searching the interior of the car checking the door and seat pockets first and finding nothing he checked the ashtray and found it empty not even an ash he made a mental note that the victim apparently didnt smoke billets stood nearby watching but not helping she had risen to detective bureau commander primarily on the success of her skills as an administrator not as an investigator she knew when to watch and not get in the way bosch checked under the seats and found nothing of interest he opened the glove compartment last and a small square piece of paper fell out it was a receipt for an airport valet company holding it by the corner bosch walked it over to the workbench and told donovan to check it for prints when he got the chance he went back to the glove compartment and found the lease agreement and registration of the car its service records and a small tool kit with a flashlight there was also a halfused tube of preparation h a hemorrhoid medication it seemed like an odd place to keep it but bosch guessed that maybe aliso kept the tube handy for long drives he bagged all of the items from the compartment separately and while doing so noticed an extra battery in the tool kit it struck him as odd because the flashlight obviously took two batteries having one extra would not do much good he pressed the flashlights onoff switch it was dead he unscrewed the cap and one battery slid out looking into the barrel bosch saw a plastic bag he used a pen to reach in and pull the bag out it contained about two dozen brown capsules billets stepped closer poppers bosch said amyl nitrate supposed to help you get it up and keep it there you know improve your orgasm he suddenly felt the need to explain his knowledge was not based on personal experience its come up in other cases before she nodded donovan walked over with the valet ticket in a clear plastic envelope a couple smudges nothing we can work with bosch took it back he then carried the various plastic evidence bags he had to the counter art im taking the receipt the poppers and the cars service records okay you got it ill leave you the plane ticket and the wallet you are also going to put some speed on the prints from the jacket and what else oh yeah those sparkles what do you think hopefully tomorrow the rest of the fiber stuff ill take a look at but its probably going to be exclusionary that meant most of the material they had collected would sit in storage after a quick examination by donovan and come into play only if a suspect was identified it would then be used either to tie that suspect to the crime scene or to exclude him bosch took a large envelope off a shelf over the counter put all the pieces of evidence he was taking into it then put it in his briefcase and snapped it closed he headed for the curtain with billets good to see you again art she said likewise lieutenant you want me to call opg to come get the car bosch asked nah im going to be here a while donovan said gotta use the vac and i might think of something else to do ill take care of it harry okay man later bosch and billets stepped through the curtain and then through the door outside he lit a cigarette and looked up at the dark starless sky billets lit one of her own where to she asked next of kin you want to come its always a fun thing she smiled at his sarcasm no i think ill pass on that but before you leave whats your gut on this harry i mean ocid passing without taking a look that kind of bothers me me too he took a long drag and exhaled my gut is that this ones going to be tough unless something good comes out of those prints thats our only real break so far well tell your people that i want everybody in at eight for a roundtable on what weve got so far lets make it nine lieutenant i think by then we should have something back from donovan on the prints okay nine then ill see you then harry and from now on when were talking like this you know informally call me grace sure grace have a nice night she expelled her smoke in a short burst that sounded like the start of a laugh you mean whats left of it on the way up to mulholland drive and hidden highlands bosch paged rider and she called back from one of the houses she was visiting she said it was the last of the houses overlooking the clearing where the rolls was parked she told him the best she could come up with was a resident who remembered seeing the white rollsroyce from the back deck of his home on saturday morning about ten the same resident also believed the car was not there on friday evening when he was out on the deck to watch the sunset that fits with the time frame the mes looking at and the plane ticket i think were zeroing in on friday night sometime after he got in from vegas probably on his way home from the airport nobody heard any shots not that ive found theres two houses where i got no answer i was going to go back and try them now maybe you can catch them tomorrow im heading up to hidden highlands i think you should go with me they made arrangements to meet outside the entrance to the development where aliso had lived and bosch closed the phone he wanted kiz along when he told alisos next of kin he was dead because it would be good for her to learn the grim routine and because the percentages called for whoever that next of kin was to be considered a possible suspect it was always good to have a witness with you when you first spoke to the person who later could become your quarry bosch looked at his watch it was nearly ten taking care of the notification meant they probably wouldnt be getting to the victims office until midnight he called the communications center and gave the operator the address on melrose and had her look it up in the cross directory it came back to archway pictures as bosch had guessed he knew they had caught a bit of a break archway was a midsize studio that largely rented offices and production facilities to independent filmmakers as far as bosch knew it hadnt made its own films since the s the break was that he knew someone in security over there chuckie meachum was a former robberyhomicide bull who had retired a few years earlier and taken a job as assistant director of security at archway he would be useful in smoothing their way in bosch considered calling ahead and arranging for chuckie meachum to meet them at the studio but decided against it he decided he didnt want anyone to know he was coming until he got there he got to hidden highlands fifteen minutes later riders car was parked on the shoulder off mulholland bosch pulled up and she got in his car then he pulled into the entrance lane next to the gatehouse it was a small brick structure with a single guard inside hidden highlands was maybe a little richer but not that different from many of the other small wealthy and scared enclaves nestled in the hills and valleys around los angeles walls and gates guardhouses and private security forces were the secret ingredients of the socalled melting pot of southern california a guard in a blue uniform stepped out of the gatehouse carrying a clipboard and bosch had his badge wallet out and open the guard was a tall thin man with a worn gray face bosch didnt recognize him though he had heard in the station that most of the guards working here were offduty uniforms from hollywood division in the past he had seen postings for parttime jobs on the bulletin board outside the roll call room the guard gave bosch a onceover in a laconic manner avoiding a look at the badge on purpose kenahepyou he finally said i need to go to the home of anthony aliso he gave the address on hillcrest that had been on the victims drivers license your names detective harry bosch lapd says it right here this is detective kizmin rider he proffered the badge wallet but it was still ignored the guard was writing on his clipboard bosch saw his name tag said nash he also saw that the tin badge said captain across it they expecting you at the aliso place i dont think so its police business okay but ive got to call ahead its the developments rules you know i prefer you didnt do that captain nash bosch hoped his use of the security guards title would win him over nash thought a moment tell you what he said you go on ahead and ill come up with a reason for delaying making the call a few minutes ill just say im up here by myself tnight and i got kind of busy if theres a complaint he stepped back and reached in the open door of the gatehouse he pressed a button on the inside wall and the crossguard went up thanks captain you work out of hollywood bosch knew he didnt he could tell nash wasnt even a cop he didnt have the cold eyes of a cop but bosch was playing to him just in case he became a useful source of information later on nah nash said im fulltime thats why they made me captain of the watch everybody else is parttime out of hollywood or west hollywood sheriffs i run the schedule then howd you get stuck on the night shift on sunday night everybody can use some ot now and then bosch nodded youre right about that hillcrest wheres that oh yeah forgot take your second left thats hillcrest the aliso place is about the sixth house on the right nice view of the city from the pool did you know him rider asked leaning down so she could see nash through boschs window aliso nash said bending further to look in at her he thought a moment not really just like i know people when they come through here im just the same to them as the pool man i guess i notice you asked did i know him am i not going to get the chance smart man mr nash rider said she straightened up finished with the conversation bosch nodded his thanks and drove through the gate to hillcrest as he passed the broad manicured lawns surrounding houses the size of apartment buildings he filled rider in on what he had learned at the print shed and from edgar he also admired the properties they were passing many of them were surrounded by walls or tall hedges that looked as though they were trimmed into sharp edges every morning walls within walls bosch thought he wondered what the owners did with all of their space besides fearfully guard it it took them five minutes to find the aliso house on a culdesac at the top of the hill he passed through the open gates of an estate with a tudorstyle mansion set behind a circular driveway made of gray paver stones bosch got out with his briefcase and looked up at the place it was intimidating in its size but its style was not much to speak of he wouldnt want it even if he had the money after getting to the door and pushing the doorbell button he looked at rider you ever done this before no but i grew up in south la a lot of drivebys i was around when people got the news bosch nodded not to belittle that experience but this is different what is important is not what you hear said its what you observe bosch pushed the lighted button again he could hear the bell sound from inside the house he looked at rider and could tell she was about to ask a question when the door was opened by a woman mrs aliso bosch asked yes mrs aliso im detective harry bosch with the lapd this is my partner detective kizmin rider we need to speak with you concerning your husband he held out his badge wallet and she took it from his hand usually they didnt do that usually they recoiled from it or looked at it like it was some strange and fascinating object not to be touched i dont under she stopped when the sound of a phone ringing began somewhere behind her in the big house would you excuse me a moment i have to thats probably nash at the gate he said he had to call ahead but there was a lineup of cars behind us i guess we beat him here we need to come in to talk to you maam she stepped back in and opened the door wide for him she looked about five to ten years younger than her husband had been she was maybe forty attractive with dark straight hair and a trim build she wore a lot of makeup on a face bosch guessed had been sculpted at times by the surgeons knife still through the makeup she looked tired worn he could see her face was flushed pink as though she might have been drinking she wore a light blue dress that showed off her legs they were tan and the muscles still taut bosch could see she had been considered very beautiful at one time but was sliding into that stage when a woman believes her beauty may be leavingeven if it isnt maybe that was why she had all the makeup on bosch guessed or maybe it was because she was still expecting her husband to show up bosch closed the door after they entered and they followed the woman into a large living room with an incongruous mix of modern prints on the walls and french antiques on the thick white carpet the phone was still ringing she told bosch and rider to sit down and then walked through the living room into another hallway which she crossed to what looked like a den he heard her answer the phone tell nash that the delay was all right and hang up she came back into the living room then and sat on a couch with a muted flower print bosch and rider took nearby chairs with a matching pattern bosch took a quick look around and saw no photographs in frames only the artwork it was always one of the first things he looked for when he had to quickly judge a relationship im sorry he said i didnt get your name veronica aliso what about my husband detective is he hurt bosch leaned forward in his chair no matter how many times he did this he never got used to it and he was never sure he was doing it the right way mrs alisoi am very sorry but your husband is dead he was the victim of a homicide i am sorry to have to tell you this he watched her closely and she said nothing at first she instinctively crossed her arms in front of her and brought her face down in a pained grimace there were no tears not yet in his experience bosch had seen them come either right awayas soon as they opened the door and saw him and knewor much later when it sank in that the nightmare was reality i donthow did this happen she asked her eyes staring down at the floor he was found in his car hed been shot in las vegas no here not far it looks like he was coming home from the airport whenwhen he was somehow stopped by somebody were not sure yet his car was found off mulholland drive down by the bowl he watched her a little more she still had not looked up bosch felt a sense of guilt pass over him guilt because he was not watching this woman with sympathy he had been in this place too many times for that instead he watched her with an eye for false mannerisms in these situations his suspicion outweighed his compassion it had to can i get you anything mrs aliso rider asked water do you have coffee do you want something stronger no im fine thank you its just a terrible shock do you have any children in the house rider asked no weno children do you know what happened was he robbed thats what were trying to find out bosch said of coursecan you tell me was there much pain no there was no pain bosch said he thought of the tears welled in tony alisos eyes he decided not to tell her about that it must be hard your job she said telling people this sort of thing he nodded and looked away for a moment he thought of the old squad room joke about the easiest way to do nextofkin notification when mrs brown opens the door you say are you the widow brown he looked back at the widow aliso why did you ask if it happened in las vegas because that was where he was how long was he supposed to be there i dont know he never scheduled it with a return he always bought openended tickets so he could come back when he wanted to he always said hed be back when his luck changed for the worse we have reason to believe he came back to los angeles on friday night his car wasnt found until this evening thats two days mrs aliso did you try to call him in las vegas during that time no we usually didnt speak when he was over there and how often was it that he went once or twice a month for how long each time anywhere from two days to once he spent a week like i said it all depended on how he was doing and you never called him there rider asked rarely not at all this time was it business or pleasure that took him there bosch asked he always told me it was both he said he had investors to see but it was an addiction thats what i believed he loved to gamble and could afford to do it so he went bosch nodded but didnt know why this last time when did he go he went thursday after leaving the studio you saw him last then thursday morning before he went to the studio he left for the airport from there its closer and you had no idea when to expect him back he said it as a statement it was out there for her to challenge if she wanted to to be honest i was just beginning to wonder tonight it usually doesnt take long for that place to separate a man from his money i thought it was a little long yes but i didnt try to track him down and then you came what did he like to play over there everything but poker the most it was the only game where you werent playing against the house the house took a cut but you were playing against the other players thats how he explained it to me once only he called the other players schmucks from iowa was he always alone over there mrs aliso bosch looked down at his notebook and acted as if he was writing something important and that her answer wasnt he knew it was cowardly i wouldnt know did you ever go with him at all i dont like to gamble i dont like that city that city is a horrible place they can dress it up all they want its still a city of vices and whores not just the sexual kind bosch studied the cool anger in her dark eyes you didnt answer the question mrs aliso rider said what question did you ever go to las vegas with him at first yes but i found it boring i havent been in years was your husband in any kind of serious debt bosch asked i dont know if he was he didnt tell me you can call me veronica you never asked if he was getting into trouble rider asked i just assumed that he would tell me if he was she turned the hard dark eyes on rider now and bosch felt a weight lift off him veronica aliso was challenging them to disagree i know this probably makes me some kind of a suspect but i dont care she said you have your job to do it must be obvious to you that my husband and ilets just say we coexisted here so as to your questions about nevada i couldnt tell you whether he was a million up or a million down who knows he couldve beaten the odds but i think he would have bragged about it if he had bosch nodded and thought about the body in the trunk it didnt seem like that of a man who had beaten any odds where did he stay in las vegas mrs aliso always at the mirage i do know that you see not all of the casinos have poker tables the mirage has a classy one he always said that if i needed to call call there ask for the poker pit if there is no answer in the room bosch took a few moments to write this down he found that often silence was the best way to get people to talk and reveal themselves he hoped rider realized that he was leaving holes of silence in the interview on purpose you asked if he went there alone yes detectives in the course of your investigation i believe you will undoubtedly learn that my husband was a philanderer i ask only one thing of you please do your best to keep that information from me i simply dont want to know bosch nodded and was silent a moment while he composed his thoughts what kind of woman wouldnt want to know he wondered maybe one who already did he looked back at her and their eyes connected again aside from gambling was your husband in any other kind of trouble as far as you know he asked workrelated financial as far as i know he wasnt but he kept the finances i could not tell you what our situation is at the moment when i needed money i asked him and he always said cash a check and tell him the amount i have a separate account for household expenses without looking up from the notebook bosch said just a few more and well leave you alone for now did your husband have any enemies that you know of anybody who would want to harm him he worked in hollywood back stabbing is considered an art form there anthony was as skilled at it as anyone else who has been in the industry twentyfive years obviously that means there could always be people who were unhappy with him but who would do this i dont know the carthe rollsroyce is leased to a production company over at archway studios how long had he worked there his office was there but he didnt work for archway per se tna productions is hiswas his own company he simply rented an office and a parking spot on the archway lot but he had about as much to do with archway as you do tell us about his production company rider said did he make films in a manner of speaking you could say he started big and ended small about twenty years ago he produced his first film the art of the cape if you saw it you were one of the few bullfight movies are not popular but it was critically acclaimed played the film festival circuit and then the art houses and it was a good start for him she said that aliso had managed to make a couple more films for general release but after that his production and moral values steadily declined until he was producing a procession of exploitative dreck these films if you want to call them that are notable only for the number of exposed breasts in them she said in the business its called straighttovideo stock in addition to that tony was quite successful in literary arbitrage what is that he was a speculator mostly scripts but he did manuscripts books on occasion and how would he speculate on them hed buy them wrap up the rights then when they became valuable or the author became hot hed go to market with them do you know who michael st john is the name sounded familiar but bosch could not place it he shook his head rider did the same hes one of the screenwriters of the moment hell be directing studio features within a year or so hes the flavorofthemonth so to speak okay well eight years ago when he was in the usc film school and was hungry and was trying to find an agent and trying to catch the attention of the studios my husband was one of the vultures who circled overhead you see my husbands films were so lowbudget that hed get students to shoot them direct them write them so he knew the schools and he knew talent michael st john was one he knew had talent once when he was desperate he sold anthony the rights to three of his student screenplays for two thousand dollars now anything with st johns name on it goes for at least six figures what about these writers how do they take this not well st john was trying to buy his scripts back you think he could have harmed your husband no you asked me what he did and i told you if you are asking who would kill him i dont know bosch jotted a couple of notes down you mentioned that he said that he saw investors when he went to las vegas rider said yes can you tell us who they were schmucks from iowa i would assume people he would meet and persuade to invest in a movie youd be surprised how many people jump at a chance to be part of a hollywood movie and tony was a good salesman he could make a twomillion budget flick sound like the sequel to gone with the wind he convinced me how so he talked me into being in one of his movies once thats how i met him made it sound like i was going to be the new jane fonda you know sexy but smart it was a studio picture only the director was a coke addict and the writer couldnt write and the movie was so bad it was never released that was it for my career and tony never made a studio picture again he spent the rest of his life making video garbage looking around the tallceilinged room at the paintings and furniture bosch said doesnt look like he did too badly at it no he didnt she responded i guess we have those people from iowa to thank for that her bitterness was stifling bosch looked down at his notebook just so he could avert his eyes from her all this talk she said then i need some water do either of you want something water would be fine bosch said were not going to be much longer detective rider im fine thank you ill be right back while she was gone bosch stood up and looked around the living room in a manner that suggested he wasnt really interested he said nothing to rider he was standing near a side table looking at a carved glass figurine of a nude woman when veronica aliso came back in with two glasses of ice water i just want to ask you a few more questions about this past week bosch said fine he sipped from his glass and remained standing what would your husband have taken with him to las vegas as far as luggage went just his overnighter what did it look like it was a hanging bag that you know folded over it was green with brown leather trim and straps he had a name tag on it did he take a briefcase or any work with him yes his briefcase it was one of those aluminum shell kind you know they are lightweight but impossible to break into or something is the luggage missing were not sure do you know where he kept the key to the briefcase on his key chain with the car keys there had been no car keys in the rolls or on alisos body bosch realized that the reason they might have been taken was to open the briefcase he put the glass down next to the figurine and looked at it again he then began writing the descriptions of the briefcase and hanging bag in his notebook did your husband wear a wedding ring no he did wear quite an expensive watch though it was a rolex i gave it to him the watch was not taken oh bosch looked up from his notebook do you remember what your husband was wearing on thursday morning when you last saw him um just clothesuh he had on his white pants and a blue shirt and his sport coat his black leather sport coat yes mrs aliso do you remember if you hugged him or kissed him goodbye this seemed to fluster her and bosch immediately regretted the way he had phrased the question im sorry what i meant was that we found some fingerprints on the jacket on the shoulder and if you might have touched him there on the day he left it could explain this piece of evidence she was quiet a moment and bosch thought that she was finally going to begin to cry but instead she said i might have but i dont remember i dont think i did bosch opened his briefcase and looked for a print screen he found one in one of the pockets it looked like a photo slide but the center was a doublesided screen with ink between the screens a thumb could be pressed on the a side and a fingerprint would be imprinted on a card held against the b side i want to take your thumbprint so we can compare it to the print taken off the jacket if you did not touch him there then it might be a good lead for us she stepped over to him and he pressed her right thumb down on the print screen when he was done she looked at her thumb no ink yes thats nice no mess we just started using these a few years ago the print on the jacket did it belong to a woman he looked at her and held her eyes for a moment we wont know for sure until we get a match as he put the card and the print screen back in the briefcase he noticed the evidence bag containing the poppers he took it out and held it up for her to look at do you know what these are she narrowed her eyes and shook her head no amyl nitrate poppers some people use them to enhance sexual performance and satisfaction do you know if your husband ever used these you found them with him mrs aliso id rather that youd just answer my questions i know this is difficult but there are some things i cant tell you yet i will when i can i promise no he didnt use themwith me im sorry that i have to be so personal but we want to catch the person who did this we both want that now your husband was about ten or twelve years older than you he was being charitable here did he have problems performing sexually is there any chance he might have been using poppers without your knowledge she turned to go back to her chair when she was seated again she said i wouldnt know now bosch narrowed his eyes what was she trying to say his silence worked she answered before he had to ask but as she spoke she looked directly at rider the unspoken message being that as a woman rider might sympathize detective i havent hadi guess sexual relations is the way it is said in these matters my husband and inot in almost two years bosch nodded and looked down at his notebook the page was blank but he couldnt bring himself to write this latest piece of information down with her watching them he folded the notebook closed and put it away you want to ask me why dont you he just looked at her and she answered with a measure of defiance in her face and voice he had lost interest are you sure he told me that to my face bosch nodded mrs aliso im sorry for the loss of your husband im also sorry for the intrusion and the personal questions im afraid though that there will be more as the investigation progresses i understand there is one other thing id like to cover yes what is it did your husband have a home office yes could we take a quick look at it she stood up and they followed her down the second hallway to the office they both stepped into the room and bosch looked around it was a small room with a desk and two file cabinets there was a tv on a cart in front of a wall of shelves half were filled with books and the rest stacked with scripts the titles written with magic markers on the edges of the pages there was a golf bag leaning in the corner bosch walked over and studied the desk it was spotless he came around and saw that the desk contained two file drawers he opened these and found one empty and one containing several files he quickly looked through the file tabs and saw that they apparently were files containing personal finance records and tax documents he closed the drawers deciding that a search of the office could probably keep its late he said this is not the time i want you to understand though that investigations like this often shoot off into many directions but we have to follow up on everything were going to need to come in here tomorrow and go through your husbands things well probably take a lot with us well have a warrant so everything will be perfectly legal yes of course but cant i just give you permission to take what you need you could but it would be better this way im talking about check books savings account records credit card statements insurance everything well probably need the records on your household account too i understand what time i dont know yet ill call first or someone will do you know did your husband leave a will yes both of us made wills theyre with our attorney how long ago was that the will oh a long time years in the morning id like you to call the attorney and tell him well need a copy of it are you up to doing that of course what about insurance yes we have policies the attorney neil denton in century city will have them also okay well worry about that tomorrow i need to seal this room now they stepped back into the hallway and bosch closed the door from his briefcase he took a sticker that said crime scene do not enter premises call lapd bosch pressed the sticker across the door jamb if anyone entered the room now they would have to cut the sticker or peel it off bosch would know detective veronica aliso said quietly from behind him bosch turned around i am the suspect arent i bosch put the two papers he had peeled off the back of the sticker in his pocket i suppose everyone and no one is a suspect at this point were looking at everything but yes mrs aliso were going to be looking at you i guess i shouldnt have been so candid before then rider said if youve got nothing to hide the truth shouldnt hurt you bosch knew from long experience never to say such a thing he knew the words were false before they were out of her mouth judging by the small thin smile on veronica alisos face she knew it as well are you new at this detective rider she asked while looking at bosch with that smile no maam ive been a detective for six years oh and i guess i dont have to ask detective bosch mrs aliso bosch asked veronica there is one last thing you could clear up for us tonight we do not know yet exactly when your husband was killed but it would help us concentrate on other matters if we could quickly eliminate routine avenues of you want to know if i have an alibi is that it we just want to know where you were the last few days and nights its a routine question nothing else well i hate to bore you with my lifes details because im afraid thats what they are boring but other than a trip to the mall and supermarket saturday afternoon i havent left the house since i had dinner with my husband wednesday night youve been here alone yesbut i think you can verify this with captain nash at the gate they keep records of who comes in as well as out of hidden highlands even the residents also on friday our pool man was here in the afternoon i gave him his check i can get you his name and number that wont be necessary right now thank you and again im sorry for your loss is there anything we can do for you right now she seemed to be withdrawing into herself he was not sure she had heard his question im fine she finally said he picked up his briefcase and headed down the hallway with rider it ran behind the living room and took them directly to the front door all the way along the hallway there were no photographs on the wall it didnt seem right to him but he guessed nothing had been right in this house for a while bosch studied dead peoples rooms the way scholars studied dead peoples paintings at the getty he looked for the hidden meanings the secrets of lives and deaths at the door rider went out first bosch then stepped out and looked back down the hall veronica aliso was framed at the other end in the light he hesitated for a beat he nodded and walked out they drove in silence digesting the conversation until they got to the gatehouse and nash came out howd it go it went hes dead isnt he mr aliso yeah nash whistled quietly captain nash you keep records here of when cars come in and out rider asked yes but this is private property youd need a search warrant bosch said yes we know but before we go to all that trouble tell me something say i come back with a warrant are your gate records going to tell me when exactly mrs aliso came in and out of here the last few days nope itll only tell you when her car did gotcha bosch dropped off rider at her car and they drove separately down out of the hills to the hollywood division station on wilcox on the way bosch thought about veronica aliso and the fury she seemed to hold in her eyes for her dead husband he didnt know how it fit or if it even fit at all but he knew they would be coming back to her rider and bosch stopped briefly in the station to update edgar and pick up cups of coffee bosch then called archway and arranged for the security office to call in chuckie meachum from home bosch did not tell the duty officer who took the call what it was about or what office inside the studio they would be going to he just told the officer to get meachum there at midnight they went out the rear door of the station house past the fenced windows of the drunk tank and to boschs car so what did you think of her bosch finally asked as he pulled out of the station lot the embittered widow i think there wasnt much to their marriage at least at the end whether that makes her a killer or not i dont know no pictures on the walls yeah i noticed that bosch lit a cigarette and rider didnt say anything about it although it was a violation of department policy to smoke in the detective car what do you think rider asked im not sure yet theres what you said the bitterness you could almost put in a glass if you ever ran out of ice couple other things im still thinking about like what like all the makeup she had on and the way she took my badge out of my hand nobodys ever done that before its likei dont know like maybe she was waiting for us when they got to the entrance of archway pictures meachum was standing under the halfsize replica of the arc de triomphe smoking a cigarette and waiting he was wearing a sport coat over a golf shirt and had a bemused smile on his face when he recognized bosch pulling up bosch had spent time with meachum in the robberyhomicide division ten years before never partnered but they worked a few of the same task forces meachum had gotten out when the getting out was good he pulled the pin a month after the rodney king tape hit the news he knew he told everybody it was the beginning of the end archway hired him as the assistant director of security nice job nice pay plus he was pulling in the twentyyear pension of half pay he was the one they talked about when they talked about smart moves now with all the baggage the lapd carriedthe king beating the riots the christopher commission oj simpson and mark fuhrmana retiring dick would be lucky if a place like archway hired him to work the front gate harry bosch meachum said leaning down to look in what it is what it is the first thing bosch had noticed was that meachum had gotten his teeth capped since hed last seen him chuckie long time this is my partner kiz rider rider nodded and meachum nodded and studied her a moment black female detectives were a rarity in his day even though he hadnt been off the job more than five years so whats shaking detectives whyd you want to go and pull me out of the hot tub he smiled showing off the teeth bosch guessed he knew that they had been noticed we got a case we want to take a look at the vics office its here whos the stiff anthony n aliso tna productions meachum crinkled his eyes he had the deep tan of a golfer who never misses his saturday morning start and usually gets away for at least nine once or twice during the week doesnt do anything for me harry you sure he look it up chuck hes here was all right tell you what park the car over in the main lot and well go back to my office grab a cup and look this guy up he pointed toward a lot directly through the gate and bosch did as instructed the lot was almost empty and was next to a huge soundstage with an outside wall painted powder blue with puffs of white clouds it was used for shooting exteriors when the real sky was too brown with smog they followed meachum on foot to the studio security offices entering the suite they passed by a glasswalled office in which a man in a brown archway security outfit sat at a desk surrounded by banks of video monitors he was reading the times sports page which he quickly dropped into a trash can next to the desk when he saw meachum bosch saw that meachum didnt seem to notice because he had been holding the door open for them when he turned he casually saluted the man in the glass office and led bosch and rider back to his office meachum slid in behind his desk and turned to his computer the monitor screen depicted an intergalactic battle among assorted space ships meachum hit one key and the screen saver disappeared he asked bosch to spell alisos name and he punched it into the computer he then tilted the monitor so bosch and rider couldnt see the screen bosch was annoyed by this but he didnt say anything after a few moments meachum did youre right he was here tyrone power building had one of the little cubbyholes they rent to nonplayers threeoffice suite three losers they share a secretary who comes with the rent how longs he been here that say yeah almost seven years what else you got there meachum looked at the screen not much no record of problems he complained once about somebody dinging his car in the parking lot says here he drove a rollsroyce probably the last guy in hollywood who hadnt traded in his rolls on a range rover thats tacky bosch lets go take a look well ill tell you what why dont you and detective riley go out there and grab a cup of joe while i make a call about that im not sure what our procedure is for this first of all chuck its rider not riley and second were running a homicide investigation here whatever your procedures are we are expecting you to allow us access youre on private property here buddy youve got to keep that in mind i will bosch stood up and when you make your call the thing you should keep in mind is that so far the media havent gotten wind of any of this i didnt think it would be good to pull archway into this sort of thing especially since we dont know for sure whats involved here you can tell whoever youre calling that ill try to keep it that way meachum smirked and shook his head still the same old bosch your way or the highway something like that while waiting bosch had time to gulp down a cup of lukewarm coffee from a pot that had been on a warmer in the outer office for the better part of the night it was bitter but he knew the cup hed had at the station would not take him through the night rider passed on the coffee instead drinking water from a dispenser in the hallway after nearly ten minutes meachum came out of his office okay you got it but ill tell you right now that me or one of my people gotta be in there the whole time as observers that going to be a problem for you bosch no problem okay lets go well take a cart on the way out he opened the door to the glass room and stuck his head in peters whos roving uh serrurier and fogel okay get on the air and tell serrurier to meet us at tyrone power hes got keys right right okay do it meachum made a motion to close the door but stopped and peters leave the sports page in the trash can they took a golf cart to the tyrone power building because it was on the other side of the lot from the security offices along the way meachum waved to a man dressed entirely in black who was coming out of one of the buildings they passed weve got a shoot on new york street tonight otherwise id take you through there youd swear you were in brooklyn never been bosch said me neither rider added then it doesnt matter unless you wanted to see them shooting the tyrone power building will be just fine fine when they got there another uniformed man was waiting serrurier at meachums instructions he first unlocked a door to reception area that served the three separate offices of the suite then the door to the office aliso had used meachum then told him to go back out on roving patrol of the studio meachums calling it a closet was not too far off alisos office was barely large enough for bosch rider and meachum to stand in together without having to smell each others breath it contained a desk with a chair behind it and two more close in front of it against the wall behind the desk was a fourdrawer file cabinet the left wall was hung with framed onesheets advertising two classic films chinatown and the godfather both of which had been made down the street at paramount aliso had countered these on the right wall with framed posters of his own efforts the art of the cape and casualty of desire there were also smaller frames of photos depicting aliso with various celebrities many of the shots taken in the same office with aliso and the celebrity of the moment standing behind the desk smiling bosch first studied the two posters each one carried the imprimatur along the top anthony aliso presents but it was the second poster for casualty of desire that caught his attention the artwork beneath the title of the film showed a man in a white suit carrying a gun down at his side a desperate look on his face in larger scale a woman with flowing dark hair that framed the image looked down on him with sultry eyes the poster was a ripoff of the scene depicted in the chinatown poster on the other wall but there was something entrancing about it the woman of course was veronica aliso and bosch knew that was one reason why nicelooking woman meachum said from behind him his wife i see that second billing only i never heard of her bosch nodded at the poster i think this was her shot well like i said nicelooking gal i doubt she looks like that anymore bosch studied the eyes again and remembered the woman he had seen just an hour ago the eyes were still as dark and gleaming a little cross of light at the center of each bosch looked away and began to study the framed photos he immediately noticed that one of them was of dan lacey the actor who had portrayed bosch eight years earlier in a miniseries about the search for a serial killer the studio that had produced it had paid bosch and his then partner a lot of money to use their names and technical advice his partner took the money and ran retired to mexico bosch bought a house in the hills he couldnt run he knew the job was his life he turned and took in the rest of the small office there were shelves against the wall near the door and these were piled with scripts and videotapes no books save for a couple of directories of actors and directors okay bosch said chuckie you stand back by the door and observe like you said kiz why dont you start with the desk and ill start with the files the files were locked and it took bosch ten minutes to open them with the picks he got out of his briefcase it then took an hour just to make a cursory study of the files the drawers were stocked with notes and financial records regarding the development of several films that bosch had never heard of this did not seem curious to him after what veronica aliso had said and because he knew little about the film business anyway but it seemed from his understanding of the files he was quickly scanning that large sums of money had been paid to various film services companies during the production of the films and what struck bosch the most was that aliso seemed to have financed a hell of a nice lifestyle from this little office after he was finished going through the fourth and bottom drawer bosch stood and straightened his back his vertebrae popping like dominoes clicking together he looked at rider who was still going through the drawers of the desk anything a few things of interest but no smoking gun if thats what you mean alisos got a flag here from the irs his corporation was going to be audited next month other than that there is some correspondence between tony aliso and st john the flavorofthemonth mrs aliso mentioned heated words but nothing overtly threatening ive still got one drawer to go theres a lot in the files financial stuff were going to have to go through it all id like you to be the one you going to be up for it no problem what im seeing so far is a lot of routine if not sloppy business records it just happens to be the movie business here im going outside to catch a smoke when youre done there why dont we switch and you take the files ill take the desk sounds like a plan before going out he ran his eyes along the shelves by the door and read the titles of the videotapes he stopped when he came to the one he was looking for casualty of desire he reached up and took it down the cover carried the same artwork as the movie poster he stepped back and put it on the desk so it would be gathered with things they would be taking rider asked what it was its her movie he said i want to watch it oh me too outside bosch stood in the small courtyard by a bronze statue of a man he guessed was tyrone power and lit a cigarette it was a cool night and the smoke in his chest warmed him the studio grounds were very quiet now he walked over to a trash can next to a bench in the courtyard and used it to tip his ashes he noticed a broken coffee mug at the bottom of the can there were several pens and pencils scattered in the can as well he recognized the archway insignia the arc de triomphe with the sun rising in the middle of the arch on one of the fragments he was about to reach into the trash can to pick out what looked like a gold cross pen when he heard meachums voice and turned around shes going places isnt she i can tell he was lighting his own cigarette yeah thats what i hear its our first case together i dont really know her and from what i hear i shouldnt try shes going to the glass house as soon as the time is right meachum nodded and flicked his ashes onto the pavement bosch watched him glance up toward the roofline above the second floor and give another one of his casual salutes bosch looked up and saw the camera moored to the underside of the roof eave dont worry about it bosch said he cant see you hes reading about the dodgers last night spose youre right cant get good people these days harry i get guys who like driving around in the carts all day hoping theyre going to be discovered like clint eastwood or something had a guy run into a wall the other day cause he was so intent on talking with a couple creative execs walking by theres one of them oxymorons for you creative executive bosch was silent he didnt care about anything that meachum had just said you ought to come work here harry youve gotta have your twenty in by now you should pull the pin and then come work for me your lifestyle will rise a couple of notches i guarantee it no thanks chuck somehow i just dont see myself tooling around in one of your golf carts well the offers there anytime buddy anytime bosch put his cigarette out on the side of the trash can and dropped the dead butt inside he decided that he didnt want to go picking through the can with meachum watching he told meachum he was heading back in bosch i gotta tell you something bosch looked back at him and meachum raised his hands were going to have a problem if you want to take anything out of that office without a warrant i mean i heard what you said about that tape and now shes in there stacking stuff on the desk to go but i cant let you take anything then you are going to be here all night chuck there are a lot of files in there and a lot of work to do itd be a lot easier for us to haul it all back to the bureau now i know that ive been there but this is the position ive been instructed to take we need the warrant bosch used the phone on the receptionists desk to call edgar who was still in the detective bureau just beginning the paperwork the case would generate bosch told him to drop that work for the moment and start drawing up search warrants for all financial records in alisos home and the archway offices and any being held by his attorney you want me to call the duty judge tonight edgar asked its almost two in the morning do it bosch said when you have em signed bring them out here to archway and bring some boxes edgar groaned he was getting all the shit work nobody liked waking up a judge in the middle of the night i know i know jerry but its got to be done anything else going on no i called the mirage talked to a guy in security the room aliso used was rebooked over the weekend its open now and hes got a hold on it but its spoiled probably okay man next time youll eat the bear get on those warrants in alisos office rider was already looking through the files bosch told her edgar was working on a warrant and that they would have to draw up an inventory for meachum he also told her to take a break if she wanted but she declined bosch sat down behind the desk it had the usual clutter there was a phone with a speaker attachment a rolodex a blotter a magnetic block that held paper clips to it and a wood carving that said tna productions in script there was also a tray stacked with paperwork bosch looked at the phone and noticed the redial button he lifted the handset and pushed the button he could tell by the quick procession of tones that the last call made on the phone had been long distance after two rings it was answered by a female voice there was loud music in the background hello she said yes hello whos this she

in bosch said nothing come on harry youre supposed to say help me rhonda help help me rhonda she sang the line from the old beach boys song actually rhonda there is something you can help me with bosch said im looking for a buddy of mine tony aliso he been in there lately havent seen him this week havent seen him since thursday or friday i was wondering how you got the dressing room number yeah from tony well layla isnt here tonight so tony wouldnt be coming in anyway i dont think but you can come on out he dont have to be here for you to have a good time okay rhonda ill try to swing by bosch hung up he took a notebook out of his pocket and wrote down the name of the business he had just called the directions to it and the names rhonda and layla he drew a line under the second name what was that rider asked a lead in vegas he recounted the call and the inference made about the person named layla rider agreed that it was something to pursue then went back to the files bosch went back to the desk he studied the things on top of it before going to the things in it hey chuckie he asked meachum leaning against the door with his arms folded in front of him raised his eyebrows by way of response hes got no phone tape what about when the receptionist isnt out there do phone calls go to the operator or some kind of a phone service uh no the whole lots on voice mail now so aliso had voice mail how do i get into it well youve got to have his code its a threedigit code you call the voice mail computer punch in the code and you pick up your messages how do i get his code you dont he programmed it himself theres no master code i can break in with nope its not that sophisticated a system bosch i mean what do you want its phone messages bosch took out his notebook again and checked the notes for alisos birthday whats the voice mail number he asked meachum gave him the number and bosch called the computer after a beep he punched in but the number was rejected bosch drummed his fingers on the desk thinking he tried the numbers corresponding with tna and a computer voice told him he had four messages kiz listen to this he said he put the phone on speaker and hung up as the messages were played back bosch took a few notes but the first three messages were from men reporting on technical aspects of a planned film shoot equipment rental and costs each call was followed by the electronic voice which reported when on friday the call had come in the fourth message made bosch lean forward and listen closely the voice belonged to a young woman and it sounded like she was crying hey tone its me call me as soon as you get this i almost feel like calling your house i need you that bastard lucky says im fired and for no reason he just wants to get his dick into modesty im soi dont want to have to work at the palomino or any of those other places the garden forget it i want to come out there to la be with you call me the electronic voice said the call had come in at am on sundaylong after tony aliso was dead the caller had not given her name it was therefore obviously someone aliso would have known bosch wondered if it was the woman rhonda had mentioned layla he looked at rider and she just shook her shoulders they knew too little to judge the significance of the call bosch sat in the desk chair contemplating things a few moments he opened a drawer but didnt start through it his eyes traveled up the wall to the right of the desk and roamed across the photos of the smiling tony aliso posed with celebrities some of them had written notes on the photos but they were hard to read bosch studied the photo of his celluloid alter ego dan lacey but couldnt read the small note scrawled across the bottom of the photo then he looked past the ink and realized what he was looking at on alisos desk in the photo was an archway mug crammed with pens and pencils bosch took the photo off the wall and called meachums name meachum came over somebody was in here bosch told him what are you talking about when was the trash can emptied outside how the hell would i know what are the surveillance camera out there on the roof how long you keep the tapes meachum hesitated a second but then answered we roll em over every week wed have seven days off that camera its all stop action ten frames a minute lets go take a look bosch didnt get home until four that left him only three hours to sleep before an agreedupon breakfast meeting with edgar and rider at seventhirty but he was too strung out on coffee and adrenaline to even think about shutting his eyes the house had the sour tang of a freshpaint smell and he opened the sliders onto the back deck to let in the cool night air he checked out the cahuenga pass below and watched the cars on the hollywood freeway cutting through he was always amazed at how there were always cars on the freeway no matter what the hour in la they never stopped he thought about putting on a cd some saxophone music but instead just sat down on the couch in the dark and lit a cigarette he thought about the different currents running through the case going by the preliminary take on the victim anthony aliso had been a financially successful man that kind of success usually brought with it a thick insulation from violence and murder the rich were seldom murdered but something had gone wrong for tony aliso bosch remembered the tape and went to his briefcase which he had left on the dining room table inside it there were two video cassettes the archway surveillance tape and the copy of casualty of desire he turned on the tv and put the movie in the video player he began watching in the dark after viewing the tape it was obvious to bosch that the movie deserved the fate it had received it was badly lit and in some frames the end of a boom microphone hovered above the players this was particularly jarring in scenes shot in the open desert where there should have been nothing above but blue sky it was basic filmmaking gone wrong and added to the amateurish look of the film were the poor performances of the players the male lead an actor bosch had never seen before was woodenly ineffective in portraying a man desperate to hold on to his young wife who used sexual frustration and taunting to coerce him into committing crimes eventually including murder all for her morbid satisfaction veronica aliso played the wife and was not much better an actor than the male lead when lighted well she was stunningly beautiful there were four scenes in which she appeared partially nude and bosch watched these with a voyeuristic fascination but overall it was not a good role for her and bosch also understood why her career like her husbands had not moved forward she might blame her husband and harbor resentment toward him but the bottom line was that she was like thousands of beautiful women who came to hollywood every year her looks could put a pause in your heart but she could not act to save her life in the climactic scene of the film in which the husband was apprehended and the wife cut him loose with the cops she delivered her lines with the conviction and weight of a blank page of typing paper it was him hes crazy i couldnt stop him until it was too late then i couldnt tell anyone because itit would look like i was the one who wanted them all dead bosch watched all the way through the credits and then rewound the tape by using the remote he never got off the couch he then turned the tv off and put his feet up on the couch looking through the open sliders he could see the light of dawn etching the ridgeline across the pass he still wasnt tired he kept thinking about the choices people make with their lives he wondered what would have happened if the performances had been at least passable and the film had found a distributor he wondered if that would have changed things now if it would have kept tony aliso out of that trunk the meeting at the station with billets didnt start until ninethirty though the squad room was deserted because of the holiday they all rolled chairs into the lieutenants office and closed the door billets started things off by saying that members of the local media apparently having picked up on the case by checking the coroners overnight log were already beginning to take a more than routine interest in the aliso murder also she said the department weight all the way up the line was questioning whether the investigation should be turned over to the elite robberyhomicide division this of course grated on bosch earlier in his career he had been assigned to rhd but then a questionable onduty shooting resulted in his demotion to hollywood and so it was particularly upsetting to him to think of turning over the case to the big shots downtown if ocid had been interested that would have been easier to accept but bosch told billets that he could not accept turning the case over to rhd after his team had spent almost an entire night without sleep on it and had produced some viable leads rider jumped in and agreed with him edgar still riding his sulk over being put on the paperwork remained silent your point is well taken billets said but when were done here i have to call captain levalley at home and convince her weve got a handle on this so lets go over what we have you convince me ill convince her shell then let them know how we feel about it downtown bosch spent the next thirty minutes talking for the team and carefully recounting the nights investigation the detective squads only televisionvcr was kept in the lieutenants office because it wasnt safe to leave it unlocked even in a police station he put in the tape meachum had dubbed off the archway surveillance tape and queued up the part that included the intruder the surveillance camera this was shot from turns a frame every six seconds so its pretty quick and jerky but weve got the guy on it bosch said he hit the play button and the screen depicted a grainy black and white view of the courtyard and front of the tyrone power building the lighting made it appear to be late dusk the time counter on the bottom of the screen showed the time and date to be eightthirteen the evening before bosch put the machine on slow motion but still the sequence he wanted to show billets was over very quickly in six quick frames they showed a man go to the door of the building hunch over the knob and then disappear inside actual time at the door was about thirty to thirtyfive seconds rider said it may look from the tape like he had a key but thats too long to open a door with a key the lock was picked somebody good and fast okay here he comes back out bosch said when the time counter hit eightseventeen the man was captured on the video emerging from the doorway the video jumped and the man was in the courtyard heading toward the trash can then it jumped and the man was walking away from the trash can then he was gone bosch backed the tape up and froze it on the last image of the man as he walked from the trash can it was the best image it was dark and the mans face was blurred but still possibly recognizable if they ever found someone to compare it to he was white with dark hair and a stocky powerful build he wore a golf shirt with short sleeves and the watch on his right wrist visible just above one of the black gloves he wore had a chrome band that glinted with the reflection of the courtyard light above the wrist was the dark blur of a tattoo on the mans forearm bosch pointed these things out to billets and added that he would be taking the tape to sid to see if this last frame the best of those showing the intruder could be sharpened in any way by computer enhancement good billets said now what do you think he was doing in there retrieving something bosch said from the time he goes in until he comes out weve got less than four minutes not a lot of time plus he had to pick the interior door to alisos office whatever he is doing in there he knocks an archway mug off the desk and it breaks on the floor he does what he was there to do then gathers up the broken mug and the pens and dumps them in the trash can on his way out we found the broken mug and the pens in the can last night any prints billets asked once we figured there was a breakin we backed out and had donovan come on out when he was done with the rolls he got prints but nothing we can use he got alisos and mine and kizs as you can see on the video the guy wore gloves okay bosch involuntarily yawned and edgar and rider followed suit he drank from the cup of stale coffee he had brought into the office with him he had long had the caffeine jitters but knew if he stopped feeding the beast now he would quickly crash and the theory on what this intruder was retrieving billets asked the broken mug puts him at the desk rather than the files rider said nothing in the desk seemed disturbed no empty files nothing like that we think it was a bug somebody put a bug in alisos phone and couldnt afford to let us find it the phone was right next to the mug in the pictures on alisos walls the intruder somehow knocked it over funny thing is we never checked the phone for a bug if whoever this guy was had left well enough alone we probably would have never tumbled to it ive been to archway billets said its got a wall around it its got its own private security force hows this guy get in or are you suggesting an inside job two things bosch said there was a film shooting in progress at the studio on the new york street set that meant a lot of people in and out of the front gate maybe this guy was able to slip through with part of the shooting crew the direction in which he walks off in the video is to the north thats where new york street is the gate is to the south also the north side of the studio butts up against the hollywood cemetery youre right there is a wall but at night after the cemetery is closed its dark and secluded our guy couldve climbed the wall there whatever way he did it he had practice what do you mean if he was taking a bug out of tony alisos phone it had to have been planted there in the first place billets nodded who do you think he was she asked quietly bosch looked at rider to see if she wanted to answer when she didnt speak he did hard to say the timing is the catch alisos probably been dead since friday night his bodys not found till about six last night then this breakin comes at eightthirteen thats after alisos been found and after people start finding out about it but eightthirteen thats before you talked to the wife right so that kind of threw a wrench into it i mean i was all set to say lets go full speed on the wife and see what we get now im not so sure see if shes involved this breakin doesnt make sense explain well first youve got to figure out why he was being bugged and whats the most likely answer the wife put a pi or somebody on tony to see if he was screwing around okay okay now saying thats the case if the wife was involved in putting her husband down into that trunk why would she or her pi or whoever wait until last nightthis is after the bodys been foundto pull the bug out of there it doesnt make sense it only makes sense if the two things were not related if the killing and the bug are separate understand i think so and thats why im not ready to chuck everything and just look at the wife personally i think she might be good for this but theres too much we dont know right now it doesnt feel right to me theres something else running through all of this and we dont know what yet billets nodded and looked at all the investigators this is good i know there isnt a lot that is solid yet but its still good work anything else what about the prints art donovan pulled off the victims jacket last night for now weve struck out he put them on afis ncic the whole works and got blanked damn theyre still valuable we come up with a suspect the prints could be a clincher anything else from the car no bosch said yes rider said billets raised her eyebrows at the contradiction one of the prints donovan found on the inside lip of the trunk lid rider said it came back to ray powers hes the p who found the body he overstepped when he popped the trunk he obviously left his print when he opened it we caught it and no harm no foul but it was sloppy work and he should have never opened the trunk in the first place he shouldve called us billets glanced at bosch and he guessed she was wondering why he hadnt brought this to her attention he looked down at her desk okay ill take care of it billets said i know powers hes been around and he should certainly know procedure bosch could have defended powers with the explanation the cop had given the day before but he let it go powers wasnt worth it billets went on so where do we go from here well weve got a lot of ground to cover bosch said i once heard this story about a sculptor and somebody asked him how he turned a block of granite into a beautiful statue of a woman and he said that he just chips away everything that isnt the woman thats what we have to do now weve got this big block of information and evidence weve got to chip away everything that doesnt count that doesnt fit billets smiled and bosch suddenly felt embarrassed about the analogy though he believed it was accurate what about las vegas she asked is that part of the statue or the part we need to chip away now rider and edgar were smiling well weve got to go there for one thing bosch said hoping he didnt sound defensive right now all we know is that this victim went there and was dead pretty soon after he came back we dont know what he did there whether he won lost whether somebody tailed him back here from there for all we know he couldve hit a jackpot there and was followed back here and ripped off weve got a lot of questions about las vegas plus theres the woman rider said what woman billets asked right bosch said the last call made on tony alisos office line was to a club in north las vegas i called it and got the name of a woman i think he was seeing over there layla there was layla like that song i guess there also was a message from an unnamed woman on his office line i think it might have been this layla weve got to talk to her billets nodded made sure bosch was done and then laid down the battle plan all right billets said first off all media inquiries are to be directed to me the best way to control information on this is to have it come from one mouth for the moment well tell the reporters it is obviously under investigation and we are leaning toward a possible carjacking or robbery scenario its innocuous enough and will probably appease them everyone okay with that the three detectives nodded okay im going to make a case with the captain to keep the case here with us it looks to me like we have three or four avenues which need to be pursued vigorously granite that we have to chip away at as harry would say anyway it will also help me with the captain if we are already scrambling on these things so harry i want you to get on a plane as soon as possible and get to vegas i want you on that end of it but if theres nothing there i want you to get in and get out well need you back here okay bosch nodded it would have been his choice if he were the one making the decisions but he felt a pang of discomfort that she was doing it kiz you stick with the financial trail i want to be in a position of knowing everything about this guy anthony aliso by tomorrow morning youre also going to have to go up to the house with the search warrant so while you are there take another shot at the wife see what else you can get about the marriage when youre picking up the records i dont know if you get a chance sit down with her try to get a hearttoheart i dont know rider said i think were past the hearttoheart shes a smart woman smart enough to already know were taking a look at her i almost think that to be safe weve got to advise her next time any of us talk to her it was pretty close last night use your judgment on that billets said but if you advise shes probably going to call her lawyer ill see what i can do and jerry you i know i know ive got the paper it was the first time he had spoken in fifteen minutes bosch thought he was carrying his sulk to the limit yes you have the paper but i also want you on the civil cases and this screenwriter guy who was having the dispute with aliso it sounds to me to be the longest shot but weve got to cover everything get that cleared up and it will help narrow our focus edgar mocksaluted her also she said while harrys putting together the trail in vegas i want you to put it together from the airport here weve got his parking stub i think you should start there when i talk to the media ill also give a detailed description of the carcant be that many white clouds aroundand say were looking for anyone who mightve seen it friday night ill say were trying to recreate the victims ride from the airport maybe well get lucky and get some help from the john qs out there maybe edgar said okay then lets do it billets said the three of them stood up while billets stayed seated bosch took his time taking the tape out of the vcr so that the other two were out of the office when he was done and he was alone with billets id heard that you didnt have any actual time on a homicide table while you were coming up he said to her thats true my only job as an actual detective was working sexual crimes in valley bureau well for what its worth i would have assigned things just the way you just did but did it annoy you that i did it instead of you bosch thought a moment ill get over it part ii bosch fell asleep a few minutes after belting himself into a window seat on the southwest shuttle from burbank to las vegas it was a deep dreamless sleep and he didnt wake until the clunk of the landing gear hitting the tarmac jolted him forward as the plane taxied to its gate he came out of the fog and felt himself reenergized by the hourlong rest it was high noon and degrees when he walked out of the terminal as he headed toward the garage where his rental car was waiting he felt his newfound energy being leached away by the heat after finding his car in its assigned parking stall he put the airconditioning on high and headed toward the mirage bosch had never liked las vegas though he came often on cases it shared a kinship with los angeles both were places desperate people ran to often when they ran from los angeles they came here it was the only place left beneath the veneer of glitz and money and energy and sex beat a dark heart no matter how much they tried to dress her up with neon and family entertainment she was still a whore but if any place could sway him from that opinion it was the mirage it was the symbol of the new las vegas clean opulent legit the windows of its tower glinted gold in the sun and inside no money had been spared in its rich casino design as bosch walked through the lobby he was first mesmerized by the white tigers in a huge glassedin environment that any zookeeper in the world would salivate over next as he waited in line to check in he eyed the huge aquarium behind the front desk sharks lazily turned and moved back and forth behind the glass just like the white tigers when it was boschs turn to check in the desk clerk noticed a flag on his reservation and called security a dayshift supervisor named hank meyer appeared and introduced himself he said that bosch would have the complete cooperation of the hotel and casino tony aliso was a good and valued customer he said we want to do what we can to help but its highly unlikely that his death had anything to do with his stay here we run the cleanest ship in the desert i know that hank bosch said and i know it is a reputation you dont want blemished im not expecting to find anything inside the mirage but i need to go through the motions so do you right right did you know him no i didnt ive been on day shift the entire three years ive been here from what i understand mr aliso primarily gambled at night meyer was about thirty and had the cleancut image that the mirage and now all of las vegas wanted to present to the world he went on to explain that the room aliso had last stayed in at the hotel was sealed and was being held that way for boschs inspection he gave bosch the key and asked that he return it as soon as he was finished with the room he also said the poker pit dealers and sports book clerks who worked the night shift would be made available for interviews all of them knew aliso because of his regular visits you have an eye in the sky over the poker tables uh yes we do you have video from thursday going into friday id like to see it if you do that wont be a problem bosch made arrangements to meet meyer at the secondfloor security office at four that was when the casino shifts changed and the dealers who knew aliso would report for work he could look at the surveillance tape from the poker pits overhead camera then as well a few minutes later alone in his room bosch sat on the bed and looked around the room was smaller than he had expected but it was very nice by far the most comfortably appointed room he had ever seen in las vegas he pulled the phone off the side table onto his lap and called the hollywood division to check in edgar picked up the line its bosch well the michelangelo of murder the rodin of homicide funny so whats going on over there well for one thing bullets won the battle edgar said nobody from rhd has come around to snatch the case thats good what about you you making any progress i almost have the murder book up to speed i have to put it aside now though the screenwriter is coming in at onethirty for a sitdown says he doesnt need a lawyer okay ill leave you to it tell the lieutenant i checked in yeah and by the way she wants another confab on how things are going at six you should call in and well put you on the speaker will do bosch sat on the bed a few moments wishing he could lie back on it and sleep but he knew he couldnt he had to drive the case forward he got up and unpacked his overnighter hanging his two shirts and one pair of pants in the closet he put his extra underwear and socks on the closet shelf then left the room and took an elevator to the top floor the room aliso had used was at the end of the corridor the card key meyer had given him worked without a problem and he stepped into a room about twice the size of his own it was a combination bedroom and sitting room and had an oval jacuzzi next to the windows that looked out across the expanse of the desert and the smooth cocoacolored mountain chain to the northwest of the city directly below was a view of the pool and the hotels porpoisehabitat attraction looking down he could see one of the gray fish moving beneath the shimmering water it looked as out of place as bosch felt in the suite he stood in dolphins in the desert he said out loud the room was plush by any standards in any city and obviously was kept for high rollers bosch stood by the bed for a few moments and just looked around there was nothing that seemed out of place and the thick carpet had the uniformed waves left by a recent vacuuming he guessed that if there had been anything of evidentiary value in the room it was gone now but still he went through the motions he looked under the bed and in the drawers behind the bureau he found a matchbook from a local mexican restaurant called la fuentes but there was no telling how long it had been there the bathroom was tiled in pink marble floor to ceiling the fixtures were polished brass bosch looked around for a moment but saw nothing of interest he opened the glass door to the shower stall and looked in and also found nothing but as he was closing the door his eyes caught on something on the drain he reopened the door and looked down then pressed his finger on the tiny speck of gold caught in the rubber sealant around the drain fitting he raised his finger and found the tiny piece of glitter stuck to his finger he guessed that it was a match to the pieces of glitter found in the cuffs of tony alisos pants now all he needed was to figure out what they were and where they had come from the metro police department was on stewart street in downtown bosch stopped at the front desk and explained he was an outoftown investigator wanting to make a courtesy checkin with the homicide squad he was directed to the thirdfloor detective bureau where a desk man escorted him through a deserted squad room to the commanders office captain john felton was a thicknecked deeply tanned man of about fifty bosch figured he had probably given the welcome speech to at least a hundred cops from all over the country in the last month alone las vegas was that kind of place felton asked bosch to sit down and he gave him the standard spiel detective bosch welcome to las vegas lucky for you i decided to come in on the holiday to take care of some of this paperwork that haunts me otherwise thered be nobody here anyway i hope you find your stay enjoyable and productive if there is anything you need dont hesitate to call i can promise you nothing but if you request something that is within my power to provide i will be more than happy to provide it so that out of the way why dont you tell me what brings you here bosch gave him a quick rundown on the case felton wrote down the name tony aliso and the last days he was known to have stayed in las vegas and where im just trying to run down his activities on the days he was here you think he was followed from here and then taken off in la i dont think anything at the moment we dont have evidence of that and i hope you wont find any thats not the kind of press we want to get in la what else you got bosch pulled his briefcase onto his lap and opened it ive got two sets of prints taken off the body we the body he was wearing a treated leather jacket we got the prints with the laser anyway we ran them on afis ncic california doj the works but got nothing i thought maybe youd run them through your own computer see what happens while the automated fingerprint identification system used by the lapd was a computer network of dozens of fingerprint databases across the country it didnt connect them all and most bigcity police departments had their own private databases in vegas they would be prints taken from people who applied for jobs for the city or the casinos they were also prints taken from people on the sly prints the department shouldnt legally have because their owners had simply fallen under the suspicion of the department but had never been arrested it was against this database that bosch was hopeful felton would check the sets from the aliso case well let me see what you have felton said i cant promise anything weve probably gotta few that the national nets dont but its a long shot bosch handed over print cards art donovan had prepared for him so you are starting at the mirage the captain asked after he put the cards to the side of his desk yeah ill show his picture around go through the motions see what i can come up with youre telling me everything you know right right bosch lied okay felton opened a desk drawer and took out a business card and handed it over to bosch thats got my office and pager on it call me if anything comes up ive got the pager with me at all times meantime ill get back to you about the prints one way or the other by tomorrow morning bosch thanked him and left in the lobby of the police station he called the sid office at lapd and asked donovan if hed had time to check out the tiny pieces of glitter they had found in the cuffs of tony alisos pants yeah but you arent going to like it donovan said its just glitter tinted aluminum you know like they use in costuming and in celebrations your guy probably went to a party or something they were throwing this stuff around maybe popping it out of party favors or something and some of it got on him he could brush off what he could see but he didnt see the particles that fell into the cuffs of his pants they stayed okay anything else uh no not on the evidence at least then on what well harry you know the guy from ocid that you were talking on the phone with last night while we were in the shed carbone yeah dominic carbone well he dropped by the lab today he was asking questions about what we found last night boschs vision darkened he said nothing and donovan continued he said he was here on something else and was just acting curious but harry i dont know it seemed more than just a passing interest if you know what i mean yeah i know what you mean how much did you tell him well before i caught on and started wondering what was going on i sort of let slip we pulled prints off the jacket sorry harry but i was proud its rare that we pull righteous prints off a dead guys jacket and i guess i was sort of braggin about it its okay you tell him we didnt get anything with them yeah i said they came back clean but thenthen he asked for a copy of the set said he might be able to do something with them whatever that means what did you do what do you think i gave him a set you what just kidding harry i told him to call you if he wanted a set good what else you tell him thats it harry okay art its cool ill check you later see you harry hey where are you anyway vegas really hey put down a five for me on seven on the roulette wheel do it one time ill pay you when you get back unless i win then you pay me bosch got back to his room fortyfive minutes before his appointment with hank meyer he used the time to shower shave and change into one of his fresh shirts he felt refreshed ready to go back into the desert heat meyer had arranged to have the sports book clerks and dealers who worked the poker pit on the previous thursday and friday evening shifts to be interviewed one at a time in his office there were six men and three women eight were dealers and one was the clerk aliso always placed his sports bets with during any shift the poker dealers rotated around the casinos six poker tables every twenty minutes this meant that all eight had dealt cards to aliso during his last visit to las vegas and by virtue of his regular trips to the casino they readily recognized him and knew him with meyer sitting by watching bosch quickly moved through the interviews with the poker dealers in an hour he was able to establish that aliso usually played the fivetoten table this meant each hand started with a fivedollar ante and each deal carried a minimum bet of five dollars and a maximum of ten three raises were allowed per deal since the game was seven card stud that meant there were five deals per hand bosch quickly realized that if a table was full with eight players each hand could easily result in several hundred dollars being at stake in the pot aliso was playing in a league far removed from the friday night poker games bosch had participated in with the dicks from the detective bureau according to the dealers aliso had played for about three hours on thursday night and had come out about even he played another two hours early friday evening and it was estimated that he left the tables a couple thousand short none of them recalled aliso ever being a big winner or loser during previous visits he always came out a few thousand light or heavy he seemed to know when to quit the dealers also noted that aliso was always quick with the gratuity his standard tip was ten dollars in chips for every win a twentyfive chip on particularly big pots it was that practice more than anything else that endeared him to their memories he always played alone drank gin and tonic and smalltalked with the other players in recent months the dealers said aliso had been in the company of a young blond woman barely into her twenties she never played but would work the slots nearby and come back to tony when she needed more money tony never introduced her to anybody and none of the dealers ever overheard her name in his notebook where bosch jotted this down he wrote layla after this entry after the dealers came alisos favorite sports book clerk she was a mousylooking bottleblonde named irma chantry she lit a cigarette as soon as she sat down and talked in a voice that indicated she had never gone long without a smoke she said that on both of the last two nights aliso had been in town he had bet on the dodgers he had a system she said he always doubled up until he won how do you mean well that first night he put a grand down on the dodgers to win they lost so the next day he comes in and puts down two big ones on them again they won so after you take out the casino vig he was almost a grand up for the trip except he never picked it up he didnt collect nope but thats not unusual his chit was good as long as he kept it he could come in anytime and wed stick it in the computer itd happened before hed win but he wouldnt collect until the next time he was in town how do you know he didnt take it to another clerk tony wouldnt do that he always cashed out with me that way he could tip me he always said i was his lucky charm bosch thought a moment he knew the dodgers had played at home friday night and alisos plane left las vegas at ten therefore it was a pretty safe bet that aliso had to be at mccarran international or already on his plane heading back to la before the game was over but there was no betting receipt found in his wallet or on his person harry considered the missing briefcase again would it have been in there could a betting slip worth four thousand dollars minus the vig be motive for his murder it seemed unlikely but still it was something to pursue he looked at irma who was drawing so hard on her cigarette that he could see the outline of her teeth on her cheeks what if somebody else cashed the bet with another clerk is there any way to tell that irma hesitated and meyer broke in theres a good chance he said each receipt is coded with a clerk number and time the bet was placed he looked at irma irma you remember taking very many twothousanddollar bets on the dodgers on friday nope not a one other than tonys well get on it meyer said to bosch well start going through the cashed receipts going back to friday night if mr alisos bet was cashed then well know when it was cashed and well have video of who cashed it bosch looked at irma again she was the only one of the casino employees he had talked to who had referred to aliso by his first name he wanted to ask her if there was something more than a gambling relationship between them but he knew that it was likely that employees were forbidden by the casino to date or fraternize with the guests he couldnt ask her in front of meyer and expect a straight reply he made a mental note to track irma down later and then excused her from the interview bosch looked at his watch and saw he had forty minutes until the conference call with billets and the others he asked meyer if hed had a chance to get the surveillance tapes from the eye in the sky over the poker pit for thursday and friday i just want to see the guy gambling he said i want to get a feel for him in life i understand and yes the tapes are ready for viewing i told you we wanted to cooperate completely they left the office and walked down a corridor to a tech room the room was dimly lit and very quiet except for the thrum of an air conditioner there were six consoles arranged in two lines where men in gray blazers sat and watched banks of six video monitors per console on the video screens bosch could see various overhead views of gambling tables each console had an electronic control board that allowed the operator to change focus or magnification of a particular camera view if they wanted to meyer whispered they could tell you what cards a player is holding at any black jack table in the house its amazing meyer led bosch to a supervisors office off the tech room there was more video equipment as well as a bank of tape storage units there was a small desk and another man in a gray blazer sat behind it meyer introduced him as cal smoltz the supervisor cal are we set up this screen here smoltz said pointing to one of the fifteeninch monitors well start with thursday i had one of the dealers come in and id your guy he shows up at eighttwenty on thursday and plays until eleven he started the tape it was grainy black and white similar to the quality of the archway surveillance tape but this one was filmed in real time no jerking movements it began with the man bosch recognized as aliso being led to an open chair at a table by a pit boss the pit boss carried a rack of chips which he put down on the table in front of alisos spot aliso nodded and exchanged smiles with the dealer a woman bosch had interviewed earlier and began to play how much in the rack bosch asked five hundred smoltz said ive already gone through this on fast speed he never buys another rack and at the end when he cashes out he looks like hes just shy of a full rack you want it on real time or fast speed speed it up bosch watched closely as the tape sped through the hours he saw aliso take four gin and tonics fold early on most of the deals win five big pots and lose six others it was pretty uneventful smoltz slowed the tape down when the time counter neared eleven and bosch watched as aliso called for the pit boss cashed out and left the frame of the camera okay smoltz said on friday we have two tapes how come bosch asked he played at two tables when he first showed up there wasnt a seat open at the fiveanddime table we only have one because there arent that many customers who want to play for those stakes so he played on a onetofive until something came open this tape is the onetofive the cheaper table another video began and bosch watched as aliso went through the same motions as in the other tape this time bosch noticed aliso was wearing the leather sports jacket he also noticed that while aliso exchanged the routine nod and smile with the dealer he thought he saw aliso nod at a player across the table it was a woman and she nodded back but the angle of the camera was bad and bosch could not see her face he told smoltz to keep it on realtime play and he watched the tape for a few minutes waiting to see if any other acknowledgment would pass between the two players it appeared that no further communication was occurring between the two but five minutes into the tape a dealer rotation occurred and when the new dealer sat down also a woman bosch had interviewed an hour earlier she acknowledged both aliso and the woman across the table from him can you freeze it there bosch asked without answering smoltz froze the image on the screen okay bosch said which dealer is that thats amy rohrback you talked to her right hank could you bring her back up here uh sure can i ask why this player bosch said pointing on the screen to the woman across from aliso she acknowledged aliso when he sat down amy rohrback just acknowledged her she must be a regular she knew aliso and rohrback i might want to talk to her and your dealer might know her name okay ill go get her but if shes in the middle of a dealing rotation ill have to wait thats fine while meyer went down to the casino bosch and smoltz continued to review the tapes on fast speed aliso played for twentyfive minutes at the onetofive table before the pit boss came around picked up his rack of chips and moved him to the more expensive fivetoten table smoltz put in the tape for that table and aliso played there losing miserably for two more hours three times he bought fivehundreddollar racks of chips and each time he quickly lost them finally he put the few remaining chips he had left down as a tip for the dealer and got up and left the table the tape was finished and meyer still hadnt returned with rohrback smoltz said he would spool up the tape with the mystery woman on it so it would be ready when it was bosch told him to fastforward it to see if there was ever a moment when her face was visible smoltz did so and after five minutes of straining to watch the quick movements of the people on the tape bosch saw the mystery woman look up at the camera there back it up and slow it down smoltz did so and bosch watched the screen as the woman took out a cigarette lit it and leaned her head back her face toward the ceiling camera and exhaled the discharged smoke blurred her image but before it had done so bosch thought he had recognized her he was frozen to silence smoltz backed the tape up to the moment her face was most clearly visible and froze the image on the screen bosch just stared silently smoltz was saying something about the image being the best they could hope for when the door opened and meyer came back in he was alone uh amy had just started a deal set so its going to be another ten minutes or so i gave her the message to come back up you can call down there and tell her never mind bosch said his eyes still on the screen really how come i know who she is who is she bosch was silent a moment he didnt know if it was seeing her light the cigarette or some pang of deeper anxiety but he dearly wanted a cigarette just somebody i knew her a long time ago bosch sat on the bed with the phone on his lap waiting for the conference call but his mind was far off he was remembering a woman he had long believed was out of his life what had it been now four five years his mind was such a rush of thoughts and emotions he couldnt remember for sure it had been long enough he realized it should be no surprise to him that she was out of prison by now eleanor wish he said out loud he thought of the jacaranda trees outside her townhouse in santa monica he thought of them making love and the small crescent scar barely visible on her jawline he remembered the question she had asked him so long ago when they were making love do you believe you can be alone and not be lonely the phone rang bosch jerked out of his reverie and answered it was billets okay harry were all here can you hear me all right its not good but it probably wont get any better right city equipment okay lets start by everybody kind of reporting on the days events harry you want to go first all right theres not a lot to tell he went over the details of what he had done so far stressing the missing betting receipt as something to watch for he told of his review of the surveillance tapes but left out mention of his recognizing eleanor wish he had decided that there was no definitive sign of a connection between her and aliso and that for the time being he would keep it to himself he ended his summary by telling the others of his plans to check out dollys the place aliso had last called from his office line at archway and the woman named layla who was mentioned when bosch called there next it was edgars turn he announced the flavorofthemonth screenwriter had been cleared through alibi and edgars own gut instinct that the young man might have rightfully hated aliso but was not of the personality type that would act on that hate with a twentytwo edgar said he had also interviewed the employees at the garage where aliso had his car washed and waxed while he went to las vegas part of the service was airport pickup and edgar said the man who picked aliso up said that tony was alone relaxed and in no hurry it was a routine pickup edgar said aliso took his car and went home gave the guy a twentybuck tip so whoever put him down they intercepted him on the way home my guess is it was somewhere up there on mulholland lot of deserted curves you could stop a guy if you did it quick probably two people what did the valet say about luggage bosch asked oh yeah edgar said he said that as near as he could remember tony had the two bags the wife described a silver briefcase and one of those hanging bags he hadnt checked either one for the flight bosch nodded though he was alone what about the media bosch said we put anything out yet its being handled billets said media relations is putting out a release first thing tomorrow it will have a picture of the rolls theyll also make the car available at the opg for video and ill be available for sound bites im hoping the stations will pick it up anything else jerry edgar concluded by saying he had the murder book up to speed and that he was halfway through the list of plaintiffs from the various lawsuits against aliso he said he would be setting up interviews for the next day with others who had allegedly been wronged by aliso lastly he said he had called the coroners office and the autopsy on aliso had not yet been scheduled okay billets said kiz what do you have rider broke her report into two parts the first was on her interview with veronica aliso which she covered quickly saying the woman had been extremely closemouthed during their morning interview in comparison to the night before when bosch and rider brought her the news of her husbands death the morning session consisted mostly of yes and no answers and a few added details the couple had been married seventeen years they had no children veronica aliso had been in two of her husbands films and never worked again you think she talked to a lawyer about talking to us bosch asked she didnt say so but i think thats exactly whats going on rider said just getting what i got was like pulling teeth okay what else billets said trying to keep the discussion moving rider went on to the second part of her days investigation which was the focus on the financial records of anthony aliso even listening on the poor conference line connection bosch could tell kiz was excited about what she had learned so far basically this guys financial portfolio shows an extremely comfortable standard of living hes got highfivefigure sums in his personal bank accounts zeroedout credit cards that house that has a sevenhundredthousand mortgage against a value of a million one thats it though as far as what i could find the rolls is leased his wifes lincoln is leased and the office we know is leased she paused a moment before going on incidentally harry if you have the time heres something you might want to check out over there both the cars are leased to his company tna productions through a dealership over there in vegas you might want to check it out if theres time its called ridealongone wordincorporated the address is two thousand and two industrial drive suite threethirty boschs jacket with his notebook inside it was on a chair on the other side of the room he wrote the name and address down on a little pad that was on the night table okay rider said so now we go on to his business and this is where it gets pretty interesting im really only halfway through the records we pulled out of his office but so far it looks like this guy was into a class a scam and im not talking about ripping off some schmucks student screenplays i think that was just his side hobby im talking about him running a laundry i think he was a front for somebody she waited a beat before going on bosch moved to the edge of the bed excitement tickling the back of his neck weve got tax returns production orders equipment rentals pays and owes from the making of several filmsmore than a dozen all of it straighttovideo stuff like veronica said its just this side of porno i looked at some of the tapes he had in his office and it was all pretty awful stuff not much in the way of narrative unless you count the buildup of tension waiting for the female lead to get naked the only problem is that the ledgers dont match whats on the film and most of the big checks paid by tna productions went to mail drops and companies that im finding out dont exist anywhere but on paper how do you mean billets asked im saying his business records show a million to a million five going into each of these socalled movies and you look at the tapes and im telling you there cant be more than a hundred maybe two hundred thousand involved my brother works in the business as an editor and i know enough to know that the kind of money alisos books show being spent on these movies is not being spent on these movies i think that what he was doing was using these flicks to launder money lots of money run it down kiz billets said just how would he do it okay start with his source well call him mr x for now mr x has a million bucks he shouldnt have whether its from drugs or whatever he needs to clean it up legitimize it so he can put it in the bank and spend it without drawing attention he gives it to tony alisoinvests it in tonys production company aliso then makes a cheap movie with it spending less than a tenth of it but when it comes to keeping the books he makes it look like hes used all of the money for production costs hes got checks going out almost weekly to various production companies prop companies movie equipment companies all the checks are in the eightto ninethousand range just under the government reporting limit bosch listened carefully as she spoke he had his eyes closed and concentrated he admired riders ability to cull all of this out of the records okay then at the end of production tony probably dubs a few thousand copies of the flick sells them or tries to sell them to independent video stores and distributorsbecause the chains wouldnt touch this crapand thats that end of show but what he has done is turned around and given back to mr x his original investor about eighty cents on the dollar in the form of payments to these dummy companies its a shell game whoever is behind these companies is being paid with his own money for services not rendered but now the moneys legit its clean and he can walk into any bank in america and deposit it pay taxes on it then spend it meantime tony aliso takes a nice production fee for his end of it and goes on to the next flick it looks like he was handling two or three of these productions a year and clearing half a million in fees himself they were all silent for a few moments before rider spoke again theres only one problem rider said hes got the irs on him bosch said riiiiiight she responded and he could visualize the smile on her face its a nice scam but it was about to go down the toilet the irs was going to take a look at tonys books later this month and there is a good chance that if i could come up with this in just one day the feds would pick up on it in an hour that would make tony a danger to mr x edgar said especially if he was going to cooperate with the audit rider added someone on the other end of the line whistled but bosch couldnt tell who it was he guessed it was edgar so whats next find mr x bosch asked for starters rider replied im working up a request ill fax to the state department of corporations tomorrow morning its got all the dummy companies on it maybe whoever he is he was foolish enough to put a real name or address on the incorporation forms im also working on another search warrant i have the canceled checks from tonys company i want the records of the accounts the checks were deposited to maybe find out where the money went after tony cleaned it up what about the irs bosch asked have you talked to them theyre closed for the holiday but according to the notice aliso got in the mail there is a criminal prefix on the audit number that makes me think this wasnt a random audit they were tipped somehow theres an agent assigned to it and ill be on the phone to him first thing in the morning you know edgar said this whole thing about ocid taking a pass is beginning to stink whether tony was hooked up with the eyetalians or not this shit is as organized as organized crime can get and id bet my last button that theyd heard somewhere along the line whether it was from the irs or not about our guy here i think youre right billets said i forgot to mention something bosch threw in today i was talking with art donovan he said the guy i talked to at ocid last night a supe named carbone well he just happens to show up over at sid today and starts asking art about the case art says the guys acting like hes not interested but hes very interested you know what i mean nobody said anything for a long moment so what do we do edgar asked bosch closed his eyes again and waited whatever billets said would determine the course of the case as well as affect his regard for her bosch knew what her predecessor would have done he would have made sure the case was dumped on ocid we dont do anything billets finally said its our case we work it but be careful if ocid is sniffing around after taking a pass then there is something going on here we dont know about yet another silence passed and bosch opened his eyes he was liking billets better all the time okay billets said i think we should be focusing on tonys company as a priority i want to shift most of our attention there harry can you wrap up vegas quickly and get back here unless i find something i should be out of here before lunch tomorrow but remember this last night mrs aliso told us that tony always told her he came to vegas to see investors maybe our mr x is right here could be billets said okay then again people its been good work lets stay on it they said their goodbyes and bosch put the phone back on the side table he felt invigorated by the advances of the investigation he just sat there a moment and reveled in the feeling of the adrenaline jazzing through his body it had been a long time coming he squeezed his hands into fists and banged them together bosch stepped out of the elevator and began moving through the casino it was quieter than most casinos he had been inthere wasnt any yelling or whooping from the craps table no begging of the dice to come up seven the people who gambled here were different bosch thought they came with money and theyd leave with money no matter how much they lost the smell of desperation wasnt here this was the casino for the wellheeled and thickwalleted he passed by a crowded roulette wheel and remembered donovans bet he squeezed between two smoking asian women put down a five and asked for a chip but was told it was a twentyfivedollarminimum table one of the asians pointed with her cigarette across the casino to another roulette table theyll take your five over there she said with distaste bosch thanked her and headed over to the cheap table he put a five chip down on the seven and watched the wheel turn the little metal ball bouncing over the numbers it did nothing for him he knew that trueblue gamblers said it wasnt the winning and losing it was the anticipation whether it was the next card the fall of the dice or the number the little ball stopped on it was those few seconds of waiting and hoping and wishing that charged them that addicted them but it did nothing for bosch the ball stopped on five and donovan owed bosch five bosch turned and started looking for the poker pit he saw a sign and headed that way it was early not yet eight and there were several chairs open at the tables he checked the faces and did not see eleanor wish though he wasnt really expecting to bosch recognized many of the dealers he had interviewed earlier including amy rohrback he was tempted to take one of the empty chairs at her table and ask how she had recognized eleanor wish but figured it wouldnt be cool to question her while she worked while he considered what to do the pit boss stepped up to him and asked if he was waiting to play bosch recognized him as the one from the video who had led tony aliso to his place at the tables no im just watching bosch said you got a minute while its slow a minute for what im the cop whos been interviewing your people oh yeah little hank told me about that he introduced himself as frank king and bosch shook his hand sorry i couldnt come up but i dont work on rotation i had to be here this is about tony a right yeah you knew him right sure we all knew him good guy too bad about what happened how do you know what happened bosch had specifically not told any of the dealers about alisos demise during the interviews little hank king said he said he got shot up or something in la what do you want i mean you live in la you take your chances i guess how long have you known him we go back years me and tony i used to be at the flamingo before the mirage opened tony stayed there back then hes been coming out here a long time you ever socialize with him outside the casino once or twice but that was usually by accident id be some place and tonyd just happen to come in or something wed have a drink be cordial but that was about it i mean he was a guest of the hotel and im an employee we werent buddies if you know what i mean i get it what places did you run into him oh jesus i dont know youre talkinghold on a sec king cashed out a player who was leaving amy rohrbacks table bosch had no idea how much the man had started with but he was leaving with forty dollars and a frown king sent him away with a betterlucknexttime salute and then came back to bosch like i was saying i saw him in a couple bars youre talking a long time ago one was the round bar at the stardust one of my buddies was the barkeep and i used to drop by there after work time to time i saw tony there and he sent over a drink this was probably three years ago at least i dont know what good it does you was he alone no he was with some broad young piece of fluff nobody i recognized all right what about the other time when was that that was maybe last year sometime i was with a bachelor partyit was for marty who runs the craps hereand we all went to get straightened out at dollys its a strip club on the north side and tony was in there too he was by hisself and he came over and had a drink in fact he bought the whole table a drink mustve been eight of us he was a nice guy that was it bosch nodded so aliso had been a regular at dollys going back at least a year bosch was planning to go there to get a line on the woman named layla she was probably a dancer bosch guessed and layla was more than probably not her real name you seen him more recently with anybody you mean a broad yeah some of the dealers said there was a blonde recently yeah i think i saw him a couple three times with the blonde he was giving her the dough to play the machines while he played cards i dont know who it was if thats what you mean bosch nodded that it king asked one more thing eleanor wish you know her she was playing the cheap table on friday night tony played for a while at the same table it looked like they knew each other i know a player named eleanor i never knew her last name she the looker brown hair brown eyes still in nice shape despite as they say the encroachment of time king smiled at his clever use of words bosch didnt that sounds like her she a regular yeah i see her in here maybe once a week maybe less shes a local as far as i know the local players run a circuit not all the casinos have live poker see it doesnt earn a lot for the house we have it as a courtesy to our customers but we hope they play a little poker and a lot of black jack anyway the locals run a circuit so they dont play against the same faces all the time so they maybe play here one night over to harrahs the next then its the flamingo then maybe they work the downtown casinos a few nights you know like that you mean shes a pro no i mean shes a local and she plays a lot whether shes got a day job or lives off poker i dont know i dont think i ever cashed her out for more than two bills thats not a lot the other thing is i heard she tips the dealers too well the pros dont do that bosch asked king to list all the casinos in the city that he knew offered live poker then thanked him you know i doubt youre going to find anything other than tony knowin her to say hello to thats all whys that too old shes a nice lookin gal but she was too old for tony he liked em young bosch nodded and let him go he then wandered through the casino in a quandary he didnt know what to do about eleanor wish he was intrigued by what she was doing and kings explanation about her being a onceaweek regular seemed to make her recognition of aliso innocent enough but while she most likely had nothing to do with the case bosch felt the desire to talk to her to tell her he was sorry for the way things had turned out for the way he had made them turn out he saw a bank of pay phones near the front desk and used one to call information he asked for a listing for eleanor wish and got a recording saying the phone number was unlisted at the customers request bosch thought a moment and then dug through the pocket of his jacket he found the card that felton the metro detectives captain had given him and paged him he waited with his hand on the phone so no one else could use it for four minutes before it rang felton yeah whos this bosch from earlier today right la i still havent gotten the prints back im expecting to hear something first thing no im not calling about that i was wondering if you or any of your people have enough juice with the phone company to get me a listing number and address its unlisted bosch felt like telling him that he wouldnt be calling if the account was listed but let it go yeah unlisted who is it a local somebody who was playing poker with tony aliso on friday night so so captain they knew each other and i want to talk to her if you cant help me fine ill find her some other way i was calling because you told me to call if i needed something this is what i need can you do it or not there was silence for a few moments before felton came back okay give it to me ill see what i can get where you going to be im mobile can i ring you back felton gave him his home number and told him to call back in a half hour bosch used the time to walk across the strip to harrahs to check out the poker room eleanor wish wasnt there he then went back out onto the strip and headed down to the flamingo he took his jacket off because it was still very warm out it would be dark soon and he hoped it would cool off then in the flamingo casino he found her she was playing at a onetofour table with five men the seat on her left was open but bosch didnt take it instead he hung back with the crowd around a roulette table and watched her eleanor wishs face showed total concentration on the cards as she played bosch watched as the men she was playing against stole looks at her and it gave bosch a weird thrill to know they secretly coveted her in the ten minutes he watched she won one handhe was too far away to see what she won withand bailed out early on five others it looked as though she was well ahead she had a full rack in front of her and six stacks of chips on the blue felt after he watched her win a second handthis time a massive potand the dealer began to push the pile of blue chips to her spot bosch looked around for a pay phone he called felton at home and got wishs home phone and address the captain told him that the address on sands avenue was not far off the strip in an area of apartment buildings mostly inhabited by casino employees bosch didnt tell him that he had already found her instead he thanked him and hung up when bosch got back to the poker room she was gone the five men were still there but there was a new dealer and no eleanor wish her chips were gone she had cashed out and he had lost her bosch cursed to himself you looking for someone bosch turned around it was eleanor there was no smile on her face just a slight look of irritation or maybe defiance his eyes fell to the small white scar on her jawline i uheleanoryeah i was looking for you you were always so obvious i picked you out one minute after you were there i wouldve gotten up then but i was bringing that guy from kansas along he thought he knew when i was bluffing he didnt know shit just like you bosch was tonguetied this was not how he had envisioned this happening and he didnt know how to proceed look eleanor i uh just wanted to see how you were doing i dont know i just right so you just flew out to vegas to look me up whats going on bosch bosch looked around they were standing in a crowded section of the casino players passing on both sides of them the cacophony of the slot machine din and whoops of success and failure created a blur of sight and sound around him ill tell you do you want to get a drink or something maybe something to eat one drink you know a place thats quiet not here follow me they left through the front doors of the casino and walked out into the dry heat of the night the sun was all the way down now and it was neon that lit the sky theres a bar in caesars thats quiet it doesnt have any machines she led him across the street and onto the people mover that delivered them to the front door of caesars palace they walked past the front desk and into a circular bar where there were only three other customers eleanor had been right it was an oasis with no poker or slot machines just the bar he ordered a beer and she ordered scotch and water she lit a cigarette you didnt used to smoke before he said in fact i remember you were that was a long time ago why are you here im on a case during the walk over hed had time to compose himself and put his thoughts in order what case and what does it have to do with me its got nothing to do with you but you knew the guy you played poker with him on friday at the mirage curiosity and confusion creased her brow bosch remembered how she used to do that and remembered how attractive hed found it he wanted to reach over and touch her but he didnt he had to remind himself that she was different now anthony aliso he said he watched the surprise play on her face and believed instantly that it was real he wasnt a poker player from kansas who couldnt read a bluff he had known this woman and believed from the look on her face she clearly did not know aliso was dead until he told her tony a she said and then let it trail off did you know him well or just to play against she had a distant look in her dark eyes just when id see him there at the mirage ive been playing there on fridays a lot of fresh money and faces come in id see him there a couple times a month for a while i thought he was a local too howd you find out he wasnt he told me we had a drink together a couple months ago there were no seats at the tables we put our names in and told frank hes the night man to come get us at the bar when there was an opening so we had a drink and thats when he told me he was from la he said he was in the movie business thats it nothing else well yeah he said other things we talked nothing that stands out though we were passing the time until one of our names came up you didnt see him again outside of playing no and whats it to you are you saying im a suspect because i had a drink with the guy no im not saying that eleanor not at all bosch got out his own cigarettes and lit one the waitress in a whiteandgold toga brought their drinks and they settled into a silence for a long moment bosch had lost his momentum he was back to not knowing what to say looked like you were doing pretty good tonight he tried better than most nights i got my quota and i got out quota whenever i get two hundred up i cash out im not greedy and i know luck doesnt last for long on any given night i never lose more than a hundred and if im lucky enough to get two hundred ahead then im done for the night i got there early tonight howd you he stopped himself he knew the answer howd i learn to play poker well enough to live off it you spend three and a half years inside and you learn to smoke and play poker and other things she looked directly at him as if daring him to say anything about it after another long moment she broke away and got out another cigarette bosch lit it for her so theres no day job just the poker thats right ive been doing this almost a year now kind of hard to find a straight job bosch you tell em youre a former fbi agent and their eyes light up then you tell them you just got out of federal prison and they go dead im sorry eleanor dont be im not complaining i make more than enough to get by every now and then i meet interesting people like your guy tony a and theres no state income tax here what do i have to complain about except maybe that it gets to be over a hundred degrees in the shade about ninety times a year too many the bitterness was not lost on him i mean im sorry about everything i know it doesnt do you any good now but i wish i had it to do all over again ive learned things since then and i wouldve played it all differently thats all i wanted to tell you i saw you on the surveillance tape playing with tony aliso and i wanted to find you to tell you that thats all i wanted she stubbed her halffinished smoke out in the glass ashtray and took a strong pull on her glass of scotch i guess i should be going then she said she stood up do you need a ride anywhere no i actually have a car thank you she started out of the bar in the direction of the front doors but after a few yards stopped and came back to the table youre right you know about what about it not doing me any good now with that she left bosch watched her push through the revolving doors and disappear into the night following the directions he had written down when he spoke with rhonda over the phone in tony alisos office bosch found dollys on madison in north las vegas it was strictly an uppercrust club twentydollar cover twodrink minimum and you were escorted to your seat by a large man in a tuxedo with a starched collar that cut into his neck like a garrote the dancers were uppercrust too young and beautiful they probably were just shy of having enough coordination and talent to work the big room shows on the strip bosch was led by the tuxedo to a table the size of a dinner plate about eight feet from the main stage which was empty at the moment a new dancer will be on stage in a couple minutes the man in the tuxedo told bosch enjoy the show bosch didnt know if he was supposed to tip the guy for seating him at such a closeup location as well as putting up with the tuxedo but he let it go and the man didnt hang around with his hand out bosch had barely gotten his cigarettes out when a waitress in a red silk negligee high heels and black fishnet stockings floated over and reminded him of the twodrink minimum bosch ordered beer while he waited for his two beers bosch took a look around business seemed slow it being the monday night tailend of a holiday weekend there were maybe twenty men in the place most of them were sitting by themselves and not looking at each other while they waited for the next nude woman to entertain them there were fulllength mirrors on the side and rear walls a bar ran along the left side of the room and cut into the wall in the back was an arched entrance above which a red neon sign that glowed in the darkness announced private dancers the front wall was largely taken up by a shimmering curtain and the stage a runway projected from the stage through the center of the room the runway was the focus of several bright lights attached to a metal gridwork on the ceiling their brightness made the runway almost glow in contrast to the dark and smoky atmosphere of the seating area a disk jockey in a sound booth at the left side of the stage announced the next dancer would be randy an old eddie money song two tickets to paradise started blaring over the sound system as a tall brunette wearing blue jeans cut off to expose the lower half of her bottom and a neon pink bikini top charged through the shimmering curtain and started moving to the beat of the music bosch was immediately mesmerized the woman was beautiful and the first thought he had was to question why she was doing this he had always believed that beauty helped women get away from many of the hardships of life this woman this girl was beautiful and yet here she was maybe that was the real draw for these men he thought not the glimpse of a naked woman but the knowledge of submission the thrill of knowing another one had been broken bosch began to think he had been wrong about beautiful women the waitress put down two beers on the little table and told bosch he owed fifteen dollars he almost asked her to repeat the price but then figured it came with the territory he handed her a twenty and when she started digging through the stack of bills on her tray for his change he waved it off she clutched his shoulder and bent down to his ear making sure that she was at an angle that afforded him a look at her full cleavage thank you darlin i preciate that let me know if you need anything else there is one thing is layla here tonight no shes not here bosch nodded and the waitress straightened up how about rhonda then bosch asked thats randy up there she pointed to the stage and bosch shook his head and signaled her to come closer no rhonda like help help me rhonda she working tonight she was here last night oh that rhonda yeah shes around you just missed her set shes probably in the back changing bosch reached into his pocket for his money and put a five on her bar tray will you go back and tell her the friend of tonys she talked to last night wants to buy her a drink sure she squeezed his shoulder again and went off boschs attention was drawn to the stage where randys first song had just ended the next song was lawyers guns and money by warren zevon bosch hadnt heard it in a while and he remembered how it had been an anthem among the uniforms back when he had worked patrol the dancer named randy soon slipped out of her outfit and was nude except for a garter stretched tightly around her left thigh many of the men got up and met her as she danced her way slowly down the runway they slid dollar bills under the garter and when a man put a five under the strap randy bent down over him using his shoulder to steady herself and did an extra wiggle and kissed his ear bosch watched this and was thinking that he now had a pretty good idea how tony aliso ended up with the small handprint on his shoulder when a petite blond woman slid into the seat next to him hi im rhonda you missed my show i heard that im sorry well i go back on in a half hour and do it all over again i hope youll stay yvonne said you wanted to buy me a drink as if on cue bosch saw the waitress heading their way bosch leaned over to rhonda listen rhonda id rather take care of you than give my money to the bar so do me a favor and dont go exorbitant on me exorbitant she crinkled her face up in a question dont go ordering champagne oh i gotcha she ordered a martini and yvonne floated back into the darkness so i didnt catch your name harry and youre a friend of tonys from la you make movies too no not really how do you know tony i just met him recently listen im trying to find layla to get a message to her yvonne tells me shes not on tonight you know where i can find her bosch noticed her stiffen she knew something wasnt right first of all layla doesnt work here anymore i didnt know that when i talked to you last night but shes gone and wont be back and secondly if youre a friend of tonys then how come youre asking me how to find her she wasnt as dumb as bosch had thought he decided to go direct because tony got himself killed so i cant ask him i want to find layla to tell her and maybe warn her what she shrieked her voice cut through the loud music like a bullet through a slice of bread everybody in the place including the naked randy on the stage looked in their direction bosch had no doubt that everyone in the place must think he had just propositioned her offering an insulting fee for an equally insulting act keep it down randy he quickly said its rhonda rhonda then what happened to him he was just here somebody shot him in la when he got back now do you know where layla is or not you tell me and ill take care of you well what are you are you really his friend or not in a way im his only friend right now im a cop my names harry bosch and im trying to find out who did it her face took on a look that seemed even more horrified than when he told her aliso was dead sometimes telling people you were a cop did that save your money she said i cant talk to you she got up then and moved quickly away toward the door next to the stage bosch threw her name out after her but it was crushed by the sound of the music he casually took a look around and noticed behind him that the tuxedo man was eyeing him through the darkness bosch decided he wasnt going to stick around for rhondas second show he took one more gulp of beerhe hadnt even touched his second glassand got up as he neared the exit the tuxedo leaned back and knocked on the mirror behind him it was then that bosch realized there was a door cut into the glass it opened and the tuxedo stepped to the side to block boschs exit sir could you step into the office please what for just step in the manager would like a word with you bosch hesitated but through the door he could see a lighted office where a man in a suit sat behind a desk he stepped in and the tuxedo came in behind him and shut the door bosch looked at the man behind the desk blond and beefy bosch wouldnt know whom to bet on if a fight broke out between the tuxedoed bouncer and the socalled manager they were both brutes i just got off the phone with randy in the dressing room she says you were asking about tony aliso it was rhonda rhonda whatever neverthefuckmind she said you said he was dead he spoke with a midwestern accent sounded like southside chicago bosch guessed was and still is the blond nodded to the tuxedo and his arm came up in a split second and hit bosch with a backhand in the mouth bosch went back against the wall banging the back of his head before his mind cleared the tuxedo twirled him around until he was faceagainstthewall and leaned his weight against him he felt the mans hands begin patting him down enough of the wiseass act the blond said what are you doing talking to the girls about tony before bosch could say anything the hands running over his body found his gun hes strapped the tuxedo said bosch felt the gun being jerked out of his shoulder holster he also tasted blood in his mouth and felt rage building in his throat the hands then found his wallet and his cuffs tuxedo threw them on the desk in front of the blond and held bosch pinned against the wall with one hand by straining to turn his head bosch could watch the blond open the wallet hes a cop let him go the hand came off his neck and bosch gruffly pulled away from the tuxedo an la cop the blond said hieronymus bosch like that painter huh he did some weird stuff bosch just looked at him and he handed the gun and cuffs and wallet back whyd you have him hit me that was a mistake see most cops what come in here they announce themselves they tell us their business and we help em if we can you were sneaking around anonymous hieronymus we have a business to protect here he opened a drawer and pulled out a box of tissues and proffered it to bosch your lips bleeding bosch took the whole box so this is true what she says you told her tonys dead thats what i said how well did you know him see thats good you assume i knew him and put that assumption in your question thats good so then answer it he was a regular in here he was always trying to pick off girls told em hed put em in the movies same old stuff but hell they keep falling for it last two years he cost me three of my best girls theyre in la now he left em high and dry once he got them there and did what he wanted with em they never learn whyd you let him keep coming in if he was picking off your girls he spent a lot of bread in here besides theres no shortage of quiff here in vegas no shortage at all bosch headed in another direction what about friday was he here no i dontyes yes he was he stopped by for a short while i saw him out there with his hand he indicated a panel of video monitors showing every angle of the club and front entrance it was equally as impressive as the setup hank meyer had shown bosch at the mirage you remember seeing him gussie the blond asked the tuxedo yeah he was here there you go he was here no problems he just came and went right no problems then whyd you fire layla the blond pinched his lips tight for a moment now i get it he said youre one of those guys what likes to weave a web with words get somebody caught in it maybe well nobodys caught anywhere layla was tonys latest fuck thats true but shes gone now she wont be back yeah and what happened to her like you heard i fired her saturday night for what for any number of infractions of the rules but it doesnt really matter because its none of your business now is it what did you say your name is i didnt then how bout if i just call you asshole how would that be people round here call me lucky can we get on with this please sure we can get on with it just tell me what happened to layla sure sure but i thought you were here to talk about tony least thats what randy said rhonda rhonda right bosch was losing his patience but managed to just stare at him and wait him out layla right well saturday night she got into a beef with one of the other girls it got a little nasty and i had to make a choice modesty is one of my best girls best producers she gave me an ultimatum either layla goes or she goes i had to let layla go modesty man she sells ten twelve splits of champagne a night to those suckers out there i had to back her over layla i mean laylas good and shes a looker but she aint no modesty modestys our top girl bosch just nodded so far his story jibed with the phone message layla had left for aliso by drawing it out of the blond man bosch was getting a sense of how much he could be believed what was the trouble between layla and the other girl about he asked i dont know and dont really care just your typical catfight they didnt like each other since day one see bosch every club has its top girl and here its modesty layla was trying to move in on that and modesty didnt want to be moved in on but i have to say layla was trouble since she came here none of the girls liked her act she stole songs from the other girls wouldnt stop with the pussy dust even when i told her we just had a lot of trouble with her im glad shes gone i gotta business to run here i cant be babysitting a bunch of spoiled cunts pussy dust yeah you know she put that sparkly stuff on her snatch made it sparkle in the dark and twinkle in the lights only problem is those sparkles come off and get on the suckers she does a lap dance on you and you end up with a crotch that glitters then you go home and the wife figures it out and raises holy hell i lose customers i cant have that shit bosch if it hadnt been modesty it would have been something else i got rid of layla when i got the chance bosch thought about the story for a few moments okay he said just give me her address and ill be on my way i would but i cant dont start that shit now i thought we were having a conversation let me see your payroll records theres got to be an address the man called lucky smiled and shook his head payroll we dont pay these broads a dime they ought to pay us comin in here its a license to make money you must have a phone number or an address you want your man gussie here to go down to metro on an assaultingapoliceofficer clip we dont have her address bosch what can i tell you or her phone number he held his hands out palms up i mean i dont have addresses on any of the girls i set a schedule and they come in and they dance they dont show they arent allowed back see its nice and simple streamlined that way its the way we do it and as far as the assault thing goes with gussie if you want to do that dance well do it but remember youre the guy what came in here by hisself never said who you were or what you wanted to nobody had four beers in less than an hour and insulted one of the dancers before we asked you to leave we can have affidavits to that effect in an hour he raised his arms again this time in a handsoff manner as if to say it was boschs call bosch had no doubt that yvonne and rhonda would tell the story they were told to tell he decided to cut his losses he smiled glibly have a good night he said and turned to the door you too officer lucky said to his back come back when you have time and can enjoy the show the door opened by some unseen electronic means apparently controlled from the desk gussie allowed bosch to leave first he then followed behind as bosch went through the main door to the valet stand bosch gave a mexican man with a face like a crumpled paper lunch bag his parking stub he and gussie then waited in silence for the car to be brought up no hard feelings right gussie finally said as the car was approaching i didnt know you was a cop bosch turned to face him no you just thought i was a customer yeah right and i had to do what the boss told me to do he put his hand out in his peripheral vision bosch could see his car still coming he took gussies hand and in a sharp move pulled the big man toward him at the same time he raised his knee and drove it into his groin gussie let out an oomph and doubled over bosch let go of his hand and quickly jerked the tail of the mans jacket up over his head pinning his arms in the tangle finally he brought his knee up into the jacket and felt it connect solidly with gussies face the big man fell backward onto the hood of a black corvette parked near the door just as the valet jumped out of boschs rental car and came scrambling around to defend his boss the man was older and smaller than bosch this one wouldnt even be close and bosch wasnt interested in any innocent bystanders he held his finger up to stop the man dont he said the man considered his situation while gussie groaned through his tuxedo jacket finally the valet raised his hands and stepped back allowing bosch a path to the car door at least somebody around here makes the right choices bosch said as he slid in he looked through the windshield and saw gussies body slide down the slope of the corvettes hood and fall to the pavement the valet ran to his side as bosch pulled out onto madison he checked the rearview mirror the valet was pulling the jacket back over gussies head bosch could see blood on the bouncers white shirt bosch was too keyed up to go back to the hotel to sleep he also had a bad mix of emotions weighing on him seeing the naked woman dancing still bothered him he didnt even know her but thought he had invaded some private world of hers he also felt angry at himself for lashing out at the brute gussie but most of all what bothered him was that he had played the whole scene wrong he had gone to the strip club to try to get a line on layla and he got nothing at best all he had come up with was the probable explanation for what the specks of glitter found in the cuffs of tony alisos pants and the shower drain were and where they came from it wasnt enough he had to go back to la in the morning and he had nothing when he got to a traffic light at the beginning of the strip he lit a cigarette then took out his notebook and opened it to the page on which he had written down the address felton had given him earlier in the night at sands boulevard he turned east and within a mile he came to the apartment complex where eleanor wish lived it was a sprawling development with numbered buildings it took him a while until he found hers and then figured out which unit was hers he sat in his car and smoked and watched her lighted windows for a while he wasnt sure what he was doing or what he wanted five years earlier eleanor wish had done the worst and the best to him she had betrayed him put him in danger and she had also saved his life she had made love to him and then it all went bad still he had often thought about her the old whatmighthavebeen blues she had a hold on him through time she had been cold to him this night but he thought for sure the hold went both ways she was his reflection he had always been sure of that he got out of the car dropped his dead cigarette and went to her door she answered his knock quickly almost as if she was expecting him or someone howd you find me did you follow me no i made a call thats all what happened to your lip its nothing are you going to ask me in she backed up to allow him to enter it was a small place with spare furnishings it looked as though she was adding things over time as she could afford them he first noticed the print of hoppers nighthawks on the wall over the couch it was a painting that always struck a chord with him he had once had the same print on his own wall it had been a gift from her five years before a goodbye gift he looked from the painting to her their eyes met and he knew everything she had said earlier had been a front he stepped closer to her and touched her put his hand on her neck and ran a thumb along her cheek he looked closely at her face it was resolute determined this time its been a long time for me she whispered and he remembered that he had told her the same on the night theyd first made love that was a lifetime ago bosch thought what am i doing now can you pick up after so long and so many changes he pulled her close and they held each other and kissed for a long moment and then she wordlessly led him to the bedroom where she quickly unbuttoned her blouse and dropped her jeans to the floor she pressed herself to him again and they kissed while she worked her hands up his shirt opening it and pressing her skin to his her hair smelled of smoke from the tables but there was an underlying scent of perfume that reminded him of a night five years before he remembered the jacaranda trees outside her window and how they put a violet snow on the ground they made love with an intensity that bosch had forgotten that he had it was a bruising huffing physical act devoid of love invigorated and driven solely it seemed by lust and maybe a memory when he was done she pulled him toward her into her in rhythmic thrusts until she too reached her moment and subsided then with the clarity of thought that always comes after they became embarrassed about their nakedness about how they had coupled with the ferocity of animals and now looked at each other as human beings i forgot to ask she said youre not married now are you she giggled he reached to the floor to where his jacket had been thrown and pulled out the cigarettes no he said im alone i shouldve known harry bosch the loner i shouldve known she was smiling at him in the darkness he saw it when the match flared he lit the cigarette and then offered it to her she shook her head no how many women have there been since me tell me i dont know just a few there was one we were together about a year that was the most serious one what happened to her she went to italy for good who knows well if you dont know then she isnt coming back at least to you yeah i know that ones been over a while he was silent for a moment and then she asked him who else there had been there was a painter i met in florida on a case that didnt last long after that theres you again what happened to the painter bosch shook his head as if to dismiss the inquiry he didnt really enjoy reviewing his illfated romantic record distance i guess he said it just didnt work i couldnt leave la she couldnt leave where she was she moved closer to him and kissed him on the chin he knew he needed a shave what about you eleanor are you alone yes the last man to make love to me was a cop he was gentle but very strong i dont mean in a physical way in a life way it was a long time ago at the time we both needed healing we gave it to each other they looked at each other in the darkness for a long moment and then she came closer just before their mouths met she whispered a lot of time gone past he thought about those words as she kissed him and then pushed him back on the pillows she straddled him and started a gentle rocking motion with her hips her hair hung down around his face until he was in a perfect darkness he ran his hands along her warm skin from her hips to her shoulders and then underneath to touch her breasts he could feel her wetness on him but it was too soon for him whats the matter harry she whispered you want to rest a while i dont know he kept thinking of those words a lot of time gone past maybe too much time she kept rocking i dont know what i want he said what do you want eleanor all i want is the moment weve fucked everything else up its all weve got left after a while he was ready and they made love again she was very silent her movements steady and gentle she stayed on top of him her face above him breathing in short rhythmic clips near the end when he was just trying to hang on waiting for her he felt a teardrop hit his cheek he reached up and smeared the tears on her face with his thumbs its all right eleanor its all right she put one of her hands on his face feeling it in the dark as if she were a blind woman in a short while they met at the moment when nothing in the world can intrude not words or even memories it was just them together they had the moment he slept on and off in her bed until nearly dawn she slept soundly with her head on his shoulder but when he was lucky enough to doze off it never lasted long for the most part he lay there staring into the gray darkness smelling their sweat and sex wondering what road he was on now at six he extricated himself from her unconscious embrace and got dressed when he was ready he kissed her awake and told her he must go i go back to la today but i want to come back to you as soon as i can she nodded sleepily okay bosch ill be waiting it was finally cool outside he lit his first smoke of the day as he walked to his car when he pulled onto sands to head up to the strip he saw the sun was throwing a golden light on the mountains west of town the strip was still lit by a million neon lights though the crowds on the sidewalk had greatly decreased by this hour still bosch was awed by the spectacle of light in every imaginable color and configuration it was a megawatt funnel of enticement to greed that burned twentyfour hours a day bosch felt the same attraction that all the other grinders felt tug at them las vegas was like one of the hookers on sunset boulevard in hollywood even happily married men at least glanced their way if only for a second just to get an idea what was out there maybe give them something to think about las vegas was like that there was a visceral attraction here the bold promise of money and sex but the first was a broken promise a mirage and the second was fraught with danger expense physical and mental risk it was where the real gambling took place in this town when he got to his room he noticed the message light was blinking he called the operator and was told that someone named captain felton had called at one and then again at two and then someone named layla at four there were no messages or numbers left by either of the callers bosch put the phone down and frowned he figured it was too early to call felton but it was the call from layla that most interested him if it had been the real layla who had called then how did she know where to reach him he decided that it had probably been through rhonda the night before when he had called from tony alisos office in hollywood he had asked rhonda for directions from the mirage she could have passed that on to layla he wondered why she had called maybe she hadnt heard about tony until rhonda had told her still he decided to put layla on a back burner for the moment with the financial probe kizmin rider had opened up in la the focus of the case seemed to be shifting it was important for them to talk to layla but his priority was to get back to la he picked the phone back up and called southwest and booked a flight to la he figured that would give him time to check in with felton then check out the dealership where rider said tony aliso had leased his cars and still make it back to the hollywood division by lunchtime bosch stripped off his clothes and took a long hot shower washing the sweat of the night away when he was done he wrapped a towel around himself and used another to wipe the fog off the mirror so he could shave he noticed that his lower lip had swollen on one side to the size of a marble and his mustache did little to hide it his eyes were redrimmed and bloodshot he wondered as he got the bottle of visine drops out of his shaving bag if eleanor had found a single thing about him attractive when he stepped back into the room to get dressed he was greeted by a man he had never seen before sitting in the chair by the window he was holding a newspaper which he put down when he noticed bosch step into the room clad only in the towel its bosch right bosch looked to the bureau and saw his gun was still sitting there it was closer to the man in the chair but bosch thought he might be able to get to it first easy now the man said were in this together im a cop with metro felton sent me what the fuck you doing in my room i came up got no answer i could hear the shower i had a friend from downstairs slip me in i didnt want to wait around in the hall go ahead get dressed then ill tell you what we got let me see some id the man got up and approached bosch pulling a wallet from his inside coat pocket and putting a bored look on his face he opened the wallet flashing the badge and id card iverson from metro captain felton sent me whats so important that felton had to send somebody to break into my room look i didnt break in okay weve been calling all night and got no answer we first of all wanted to make sure you were all right and secondly the captain wants you to be in on the arrest so he sent me over to try to find you we gotta get going why dont you get dressed what arrest thats what im trying to tell you if youd get dressed and we could get going you hit the jackpot with those prints you flew in here with bosch looked at him for a moment and then went to the closet to grab a pair of pants and some underwear he then went into the bathroom to put them on when he came back out he said one word to iverson talk bosch quickly finished dressing as iverson began you know the name joey marks bosch thought a moment and then said it sounded familiar but he couldnt place it joseph marconi they call him joey marks used to before he tried to put on legitimate airs now its joseph marconi anyway he got the name joey marks cause thats what he did he left marks on anybody who crossed him got in his way who is he hes the outfits guy in vegas you know what the outfit is right the chicago mafia family they control or have the say at least on everything west of the mississippi that includes vegas and la hey you took some geography didnt you i probably wont have to school you too much then on whats what out here you alreadyve got a score card youre saying the prints on my vics jacket came from joey marks in your dreams but they did come back to one of his top guys and bosch thats like manna from heaven were taking this guy down today pulling him right the fuck out of bed were going to turn him bosch make him our boy and through him well finally get joey marks hes been a thorn in our side going on near a decade now arent you forgetting something no i dont thinkoh yeah of course you and the lapd have our undivided thanks for this no youre forgetting its my case its not your case what the fuck you people think youre doing taking this guy down without even talking to me we tried to call i told you that iverson sounded hurt so you dont get me and you just go ahead with the plan iverson didnt answer bosch finished tying his shoes and stood up ready to go lets go take me to felton i cant believe you guys on the elevator down iverson said that while boschs exception to the plan was noted it was too late to stop anything they were heading out to a command post in the desert and from there they would move in on the suspects house which was out near the mountains wheres felton hes out there at the cp good iverson was silent during most of the ride out which was good because it allowed bosch to think about this latest development he realized suddenly that tony aliso might have been washing money for joey marks marks was riders mr x he guessed but something went wrong the irs audit was endangering the scheme and thereby endangering joey marks marks had responded by eliminating the washer the story felt good to bosch but there were still things that didnt jibe the breakin at alisos office two days after he was dead why did whoever that was wait until then and why didnt they take all the financial records the recordsif connections between the dummy corporations and joey marks could be mademight be just as dangerous to marks as aliso was bosch found himself wondering if the hitter and the b ampe man were the same person it didnt seem so whats this guys name the one the prints matched luke goshen we only had his prints on file because he had to give em to get the entertainment license for one of joeys strip clubs the license is in goshens name it keeps joey out of it nice and clean only not anymore the prints tie goshen to a murder and that means joey isnt far behind wait a minute whats the name of the club dollys its in north las vegas son of a bitch what i say something this goshen guy do they call him lucky probably not after today his lucks about to run out sounds like you know of him i met the prick last night youre shitting me at dollys the last phone call from alisos office in la was to dollys i found out he was coming out here and spending time with one of the dancers at that place i went to check it out last night and fucked up goshen had one of his guys give me this bosch touched the bump on his lip i was wondering where you got that which one give you that gussie fucking big john flanagan well be bringing his lard ass in today too john flanagan how they get gussie out of that its on account hes the bestdressed bouncer in the county you know the tuxedo he gets all gussied up to go to work thats how he got that one i hope you didnt let him get away with puttin that knot on your lip we had a little discussion in the parking lot before i left iverson laughed i like you bosch youre a tough nut im not sure i like you yet iverson im still not happy about you people trying to take over my case itll work out for all of us youre going to clear your case and were going to take a couple of major douche bags out of the picture city fathers are going to be smiling all around well see theres one other thing iverson said we were already working a tip on lucky when you showed up what are you talking about we got a tip it was anonymous came in sunday to the bureau guy wont give his name but says he was in a strip club the night before and hears a couple of big guys talking about a hit he heard one call the other lucky what else just something about the guy being put in the trunk and then getting capped felton know this when i talked to him yesterday no it hadnt filtered up to him it came up last night after he found out the prints you brought matched goshen one of the guys in the bureau had taken the tip and was going to check it out put out a flier on it it wouldve eventually gotten over there to la and you woulda come calling youre just here sooner rather than later they had completely left the urban sprawl of the city and the chocolatebrown mountain chain rose in front of them there were sporadic patches of neighborhoods homes that were built way out and were waiting for the city to catch up bosch had been out this way once before on an investigation going to a retired cops house it had reminded him of nomansland then and it still did now tell me about joey marks bosch said you said hes trying to go legitimate no i said hes trying to give the appearance of legitimacy thats two different things guy like that hell never be legitimate he can clean up his act but hes always going to be a grease spot on the road whats he into if you believe the media the mob was run out of town to make way for all the allamerican family yeah i know the tune its true though vegas has changed in ten years when i first made it to the bureau you could practically take your pick of the casinos and go to work they all had connections if it wasnt the front office then it was the suppliers the unions whatever now its cleaned up its gone from sin city to fuckin disneyland we got more water slides than whorehouses now i think i liked it the old way had more of an edge know what i mean yeah i know what you mean anyway the important thing is we ninetynine percent have the mob out of the casinos thats the good thing but theres still a lot of what we call ancillary action around thats where joey fits in he runs a string of highrent strip bars mostly in north vegas because nudity and alcohol are allowed there and the money is in alcohol very hard to watch that money we figure hes siphoning a couple mil a year off the top on the clubs alone weve had the irs go after his books but he does too good a job lets see we think he also has a piece of some of the brothels up north then hes got the usual your standard loansharking and fencing operations he runs a book and has the street tax on almost anything that moves in town you know the escort services peep shows all of that hes the king he cant go in any of the casinos cause hes in the commissions black book but it doesnt matter hes the king how does he have a betting book in a town where you can walk into any casino and bet on any game any race anywhere you gotta have money to do that not with joey hell take your bet and if you are unlucky enough to lose then you better come up with the money quick or youre one sorry motherfucker remember how he got his name well suffice it to say his employees carry on the tradition see thats how he gets his hooks into people he gets them to owe him and then they have to give him a piece of what they have whether its a company that makes paint in dayton or something else maybe a guy who makes cheap movies in la yeah like that thats how it works they open up to him or they get two broken knees or worse people still disappear in vegas bosch it might look like its all volcanoes and pyramids and pirate ships on the outside but on the inside its still dark enough for people to disappear in bosch reached over and turned the air up a notch the sun was already all the way up and the desert was beginning to bake this is nothing iverson said wait till about noon if were out here then forget about it well be over oneten easy what about joeys air of legitimacy yeah well like i said hes got holdings all over the country pieces of the legitimate world he got through these various scams he also reinvests he cleans up all the cash hes pulling out of his various enterprises and then puts it into legit stuff even charities hes got car dealerships a country club on the east side a goddamn wing of a hospital named after one of his kids who died in a swimming pool his picture gets in the paper at ribbon cuttings bosch i tell you weve either got to fucking take the guy down or give him the key to the city and i dont know which would be more appropriate iverson shook his head after a few minutes of silence they were there iverson pulled into a county fire station and drove around back where there were several more detective cars and several men standing around them holding paper cups of coffee one of them was captain felton bosch had forgotten to take a bulletproof vest with him from los angeles and had to borrow one from iverson he was also given a plastic raid jacket that said lvpd in bright yellow letters across the chest when it was zipped closed they were standing around feltons taurus going over the plan and waiting for the uniform backup execution of the warrant was going to be done by vegas rules the captain said that meant at least one uniform team had to be there when they kicked the door by this time bosch had already had his friendly exchange with felton the two had gone into the fire station to get bosch some coffee and bosch had given the police captain an earful for the way he had handled the discovery that the prints bosch had brought with him belonged to lucky luke goshen felton feigned contrition and told bosch hed be involved in calling the shots from that moment on bosch had to back down after that hed gotten what he wanted at least in the captains words now he just had to watch that felton walked the talk besides felton and bosch there were four others standing around the car they were all from metros organized crime unit it was iverson and his partner cicarelli and then another pair baxter and parmelee the ocu was part of feltons domain in the department but it was baxter who was running the show he was a black man who was balding with gray hair lightly powdered around the sides of his head he was heavily muscled and had a countenance that said i want no hassles he seemed to bosch to be a man accustomed to both the violent and violence there was a difference luke goshens home was known to them from their banter bosch figured that they had watched the place before it was about a mile further west from the station and baxter had already made a driveby and determined that goshens black corvette was in the carport what about a warrant bosch asked he could just envision the whole thing getting kicked out of court because of a warrantless entry into the suspects house the prints were more than enough for a warrant to search the premises and arrest your man felton said we took it to a judge first thing this morning we also had our own information which i think iverson told you about look his prints were on the guy but it doesnt mean he did it it doesnt make a case were acting too quickly here my guy was put down in la ive got nothing putting luke goshen there and your own information thats a joke youve got an anonymous call thats it it doesnt mean shit they all looked at bosch as if he had just belched at the debutante ball harry lets get another cup felton said im fine lets get one anyway he put his arm on boschs shoulder and led him back toward the station inside at the kitchen counter where there was a coffee urn felton poured himself another cup before speaking look harry you gotta go with this this is a major opportunity for us and for you i know that i just dont want to blow it cant we hold off on this until were sure of what weve got its my case captain and youre still running the show i thought we had that all straightened out i thought we did too but i might as well be pissing in the wind look detective were going to go up the road and take this guy down search his place and put him in a little room i guarantee that if he isnt your man hes going to give him to you and hes going to give us joey marks along the way now come on get with the program and get happy he cuffed bosch on the shoulder and headed back out to the lot bosch followed in a few moments he knew that he was whining over nothing you find somebodys prints on a body you bring him in thats a given you sweat the details later but bosch didnt like being a bystander that was the real rub and he knew it he wanted to run the show only out here in the desert he was a fish out of water flopping on the sand he knew he should call billets but it was too late for her to do anything and he didnt like the idea of telling her he had let this one get away from him the patrol car with the two uniforms was there when bosch stepped out of the fire station and back into the oven all right felton said were all here mount up and lets go get this fucker they were there in five minutes goshen lived in a house that rose out of the scrubland on desert view avenue it was a large house but not one that looked particularly ostentatious the one thing that looked out of the ordinary was the concreteblock wall and gate that surrounded the halfacre property the house was in the middle of nowhere but its owner needed to put a security wall around it they all stopped their cars on the shoulder of the road and got out baxter had come prepared from the trunk of his caprice he pulled out two stepladders that they would use to scale the wall next to the driveway gate iverson was the first to go over when he got to the top of the wall he put the other ladder in place on the other side but hesitated before climbing down into the front yard anybody see any dogs no dogs baxter said i checked this morning iverson went down and the others followed him over while he waited for his turn bosch looked around and could just see the neon demarcation of the strip several miles to the east above this the sun was a neon red ball the air had gone from warm to hot and was as dry and rough as sandpaper bosch thought of the cherryflavored chap stick in his pocket that he had bought at the hotel gift shop but he didnt want to use it in front of the local boys after bosch had scaled the wall and was approaching the house behind the others he looked at his watch it was now almost nine but the house seemed dead no movement no sound no lights nothing curtains were closed across every window you sure hes here bosch whispered to baxter hes here baxter replied without lowering his voice i jumped the wall about six and touched the hood of the vette it was warm he hadnt been home long hes in there asleep i guarantee it nine oclock to this guy is like four in the morning for normal people bosch looked over at the corvette he remembered it from the night before as he looked around further he realized the confines within the walls of the compound were carpeted in lush green grass it must have cost a fortune to plant and another one to keep it watered the property sat in the desert like a towel on the beach bosch was drawn from his wonder by the sound of iverson hitting the front door with his foot with weapons drawn bosch and the others followed iverson into the dark opening to the house they went in screaming the usual identifierspolice and dont moveand quickly moved down a hallway to the left bosch followed the sharp slashes of light from their flashlights almost immediately he heard female screams and then a light came on in a room at the end of the hall by the time he got in there he saw iverson kneeling on a kingsize bed holding his smith amp wesson short barrel six inches from the face of luke goshen the big man bosch had encountered the night before was wrapped in the beds black silk sheets and looked as calm about the situation as magic johnson used to look while shooting free throws with the game on the line he even took the time to glance up at the ceiling to view the reflection of the scene in the mirror it was the women who werent calm two of them both nude stood on either side of the bed oblivious to their nakedness but fully in the latter stages of fright finally baxter quieted them with a loud shout of shut up it took a few moments for the silence to sink in nobody moved bosch never took his eyes off goshen he was the only danger in the room he sensed that the other cops who had branched off to search the house had now moved into the room behind him along with the two uniform cops on your face luke iverson finally ordered you girls get some clothes on now one of the women said you cant just shut up iverson cut her off or you go in to town like that your choice im not go randy goshen boomed with a voice as deep as a barrel shut the fuck up and get dressed theyre not taking you anywhere you too harm all the men but goshen instinctively looked at the woman he had called harm she looked like she weighed about ninety pounds she had soft blond hair breasts she could hide in a childs tea cups and a gold hoop piercing one of the folds of her vagina there was a look of fright etched on her face that had completely crowded out any hint of beauty harmony she whispered understanding their dilemma well get dressed harmony felton said both of you turn to the wall and get dressed just get em their clothes and get em out of here iverson said harmony was stepping into a pair of jeans when she stopped and looked at the men giving conflicting orders well which is it randy asked in an irritated voice you people got your shit together or what bosch recognized her as the woman who had been dancing in dollys the night before get em out of here iverson yelled now the uniforms moved in to usher the naked women out were going randy yelped dont touch me iverson yanked the sheets off goshen and began cuffing his hands behind his back goshens blond hair ran in a thin and tightly braided ponytail down his back bosch hadnt noticed that the night before whatsa matter iverson he said his face against the mattress you got a problem with a little poon hangin around you a little punk or something goshen do yourself a favor shut your fuckin hole goshen laughed off the threat he was a deeply tanned man who seemed even larger than bosch recalled from the night before he was completely buffed his arms the size of hams for a short moment bosch thought he understood goshens desire to sleep with two women and why they willingly went with him in twos goshen faked a yawn to make sure everyone knew he wasnt the least bit threatened by what was happening he wore only black bikini underwear that matched the sheets there were tattoos on his back a one percent sign on the left shoulder blade a harley davidson insignia on the right on the upper left arm there was another tattoo the number eightyeight whats this your iq iverson said as he sharply slapped the arm fuck you iverson and the phony fuckin warrant you rode in on bosch knew what the tattoo meant he had seen it enough in la the eighth letter of the alphabet was h eighteight meant hh short for heil hitler it meant goshen had spent some time with white supremacists but most of the assholes bosch came across with similar tattoos had gotten them in prison it was amazing to him that goshen apparently had no criminal record and had spent no time in stir if he had his name would have come up when the prints from tony alisos jacket had been run through the afis computer he put thoughts of this contradiction aside when goshen managed to turn his head so that he was looking at bosch you he said youre the one they should be arresting after what you did to gussie bosch bent over the bed to reply this aint about last night this is about tony aliso iverson roughly turned goshen over on the bed what the fuck are you talking about goshen asked angrily im clean on that man what are you he tried to pull himself up into a sitting position but iverson pushed him back down hard just sit tight iverson said well hear your sorry side of things but were going to have a look around first he took the warrant out of his pocket and dropped it on goshens chest theres your warrant i cant read it not my fault you didnt stay in school just hold it up for me iverson ignored him and looked at the others okay lets split up and see what weve got here harry you take this room okay keep our friend here company right iverson then addressed the two uniforms i want one of you guys in here just stand out of the way and keep your eyes on douche bag here one of the uniforms nodded and the others left the room bosch and goshen looked at each other i cant read this thing goshen said i know bosch said you said that this is bullshit its just a roust you couldnt possibly have anything on me because i didnt do it then whod you have do it gussie no man nobody theres no way youll be able to pin this on me no fucking way i want my lawyer as soon as youre booked booked for what for murder lucky goshen continued his denials and demands for a lawyer while bosch ignored him and started looking around the room checking the drawers of the dresser he glanced back at goshen every few seconds it was like walking around a lions cage he knew he was safe but that didnt stop him from checking he could tell goshen was watching him in the mirror over the bed when the big man finally quieted bosch waited a few moments and then started asking questions he did it casually while he continued the search as if he didnt really care about the answers so where were you friday night fuckin your mother shes dead i know it it wasnt all that good bosch stopped what he was doing and looked at him goshen wanted him to hit him he wanted the violence it was the playing field he understood where were you goshen friday night talk to my lawyer we will but you can talk too i was working the club i have a fucking job you know yeah i know when did you work till i dont know four i go home after that yeah right its the truth where were you in that office thats right anybody see you you ever come out before four i dont know talk to my lawyer dont worry we will bosch went back to the search and opened the closet door it was a walkin but it was only a third lined with clothes goshen lived light fuckin a its right goshen called from the bed you go check check it out the first thing bosch did was to turn over the two pairs of shoes and the nikes that were lined on the floor he studied the sole patterns and none of them appeared even remotely like the pattern found on the bumper of the rolls and tony alisos hip he glanced back out at goshen to make sure the big man wasnt moving he wasnt bosch next reached to the shelf above the clothes rod he took a box down and found it full of photos they were eight by ten publicity shots of dancers they werent nudes each young woman was posed provocatively in a skimpy costume each ones name was printed in the white border below the photo accompanied by the name and number of models a million which bosch guessed was a local agency that provided dancers to clubs he looked through the box until he found a photo with the name layla on it he studied the photo of the woman he had been looking for the previous night she had long flowing brown hair with blond highlights a full figure dark eyes and bee sting lips in the photo they were parted just enough to show a hint of white teeth she was a beautiful woman and there was something familiar about her but he couldnt place it he decided that maybe the familiarity was the sexual malice that all the women in the photos and those whom he had seen the night before in the club seemed to convey bosch took the box out of the closet and dropped it on the bureau he held the picture of layla out of it whats with the pictures lucky theyre all the girls ive been with how bout you cop you had that many i bet the ugliest one in there is better than the best one youve ever had so what do you want to do compare pricks too im glad youve had your fill of women lucky cause there arent going to be any more i mean sure youll be able to fuck or be fucked it just wont be with women is all im saying goshen was quiet while he contemplated this bosch put the photo of layla on the bureau next to the box look bosch just tell me what you guysve got and ill tell you what i know so we can get this straightened out youre wrong on this i didnt do anything so lets get this over with stop wasting each others time bosch didnt answer he went back into the closet and hiked up on his toes to see if there was anything else on the shelf there was a small cloth folded like a handkerchief he took it down and unfolded it it was soiled with oil he smelled it and recognized it bosch came out of the closet tossed the rag so it hit goshen in the face and fell onto the bed whats this i dont know what is it its a rag with gun oil on it wheres the gun i dont have a gun and that isnt mine either never saw it before okay what do you mean okay i never fuckin saw it before i mean okay goshen thats all dont get nervous its hard with you people sticking your nose up my ass bosch bent over the night table he opened the top drawer found an empty cigarette box a set of pearl earrings and an unopened box of condoms bosch threw the box at goshen it bounced off his huge chest and fell to the floor you know goshen just buying them aint safe sex you gotta put em on he opened the bottom drawer it was empty how long you lived here goshen moved in right after i kicked your sister out on her ass put her on the street last i seen she was selling it over on fremont outside the cortez bosch straightened up and looked at him goshen was smiling he wanted to provoke something he wanted to control things even handcuffed on the bed even if it cost him some blood my mother now my sister whos next my wife yeah i got something planned for her ill shut up would you its not working understand youre not getting to me you cant get to me so save your strength everybody can be gotten to bosch remember that bosch looked at him and then stepped into the master bathroom it was a large room with a separate shower and tub almost in the same configuration as the room tony aliso had used at the mirage the toilet was in a small closetsize room behind a door with a slatted grill bosch started there he quickly lifted the top of the water tank and found nothing unusual before putting the porcelain top back in place he leaned over the toilet and looked down the wall behind the tank what he saw made him immediately call for the uniform in the bedroom yes sir the cop said he looked like he wasnt yet twentyfive his black skin had almost a bluish tint to it he kept his hands on his equipment belt in a relaxed mode his right just a few inches from his gun it was the standard pose bosch saw that the nameplate above his breast pocket said fontenot fontenot take a look down here behind the tank the cop did as he was asked without even taking his hands off his belt what is it he asked i think its a gun why dont you step back and let me pull it out bosch flattened his hand and reached it down into the twoinch space between the wall and the tank his fingers closed on a plastic bag attached to the back of the tank with gray duct tape he managed to pull it free and get the bag out he held it up for fontenot to see the bag contained a blue metal pistol equipped with a threeinch screwon silencer a twentytwo fontenot asked oh yeah bosch said go get felton and iverson would you right away bosch followed fontenot out of the bathroom he was holding the bag containing the gun the way a fisherman holds a fish by its tail when he stepped into the bedroom he couldnt help but smile at goshen whose eyes noticeably widened that aint mine goshen immediately protested thats a plant you fuck i dont beget me my goddamned lawyer you son of a bitch bosch let the words go by but studied the look he saw something flash in goshens eyes it was there for only a second and then he covered up it wasnt fear he didnt think that was something goshen would let slip into his eyes bosch believed he had seen something else but what he looked at goshen and waited a moment for the look to return was it confusion disappointment goshens eyes showed nothing now but bosch believed he knew the look what he had seen had been surprise iverson baxter and felton then filed into the room they saw the gun and iverson yelped in triumph sayonara baybee his glee showed on his face bosch explained how and where he had found the weapon these fuckhead gangsters iverson said looking at goshen think the cops never saw the godfather whod you put it there for goshen michael corleone i said get me my fucking lawyer goshen yelled youll get your lawyer iverson said now get up you piece of shit you gotta get dressed for the ride in bosch held him at gunpoint while iverson took one of the cuffs off then they both pointed guns at him while he got dressed in black jeans boots and tshirtthe shirt manufactured for a much smaller man you guys are always tough in numbers goshen said as he went about putting the clothes on you ever come up against me alone then its going to be wet ass time come on goshen we dont have all day iverson said when he was done they cuffed him and stuffed him into the back of iversons car iverson locked the gun in the trunk then they went back inside the house in a short meeting inside the front hallway it was decided that baxter and two of the other detectives would stay behind to finish the search of the house what about the women bosch asked the uniforms will watch them until these boys are done iverson said yeah but as soon as they leave theyll be on the phone well have goshens lawyer down our throat before we even get started ill take care of that goshens got one car here right wheres the keys kitchen counter one of the other detectives said okay iverson said were out of here bosch followed him through the kitchen watching him pocket the keys that were on the counter and then out into the carport by the corvette there was a little workroom here with tools hanging on a peg board iverson selected a shovel and then stepped out of the carport and around to the back yard bosch followed and watched as iverson found the spot where the telephone line came in from a pole at the street and connected to the house he swung the shovel up and with one strike disconnected the line amazing how strong the wind can get out here in the open desert he said he looked around behind the house those girls have no car and no phone he said nearest house is a half mile citys about five my guess is theyll stay put a while thatll give us time all we need iverson took a baseball swing with the shovel and launched it out over the property wall and into the scrub brush he started walking toward the front of the house and his car what do you think bosch asked i think the bigger they are the harder they fall goshens ours harry yours no i mean about the gun what about it i dont knowit seems too easy nobody said criminals gotta be smart goshens not smart hes just been lucky but not anymore bosch nodded but he still didnt like it it wasnt really a question of being smart or not criminals followed routines instincts this didnt make sense i saw something in his eyes when he saw the gun like he was just as surprised to see it as we were maybe maybe hes just a good actor and maybe its not even the right gun youll have to take it back with you to run tests find out if its the gun harry then worry about if its too easy bosch nodded he took out a cigarette and lit it i dont know i feel like im missing something look harry you want to make a case or not i want a case then lets take him in and put him in a room see what he has to say they were at the car bosch realized he had left the photo of layla inside he told iverson to start the car and hed be right back when he came back with the photo and got in he checked goshen in the back and saw a trickle of blood running down from the corner of his mouth bosch looked at iverson who was smiling i dont know he mustve bumped his face getting in either that or he did it on purpose to make it look like i did it goshen said nothing and bosch just turned around iverson pulled the car out onto the road and they headed back toward the city the temperature was climbing rapidly and bosch could already feel the sweat sticking his shirt to his back the air conditioner labored to overcome the heat that had built up in the car while they were inside the house the air was as dry as old bones bosch finally took out the chap stick and rolled it across his sore lips he didnt care what iverson or goshen thought about it they took goshen up to the detective bureau in a back elevator in which goshen audibly farted then bosch and iverson walked him down a hallway off the squad room and into an interview room barely larger than a restroom stall they handcuffed him to a steel ring bolted to the center of the table and locked him in then they left him there as iverson closed the door goshen called after him that he wanted to make his phone call bosch noticed that the squad room was almost deserted as they walked back toward feltons office somebody die bosch asked where is everybody theyre out picking up the others what others the captain wanted to bring in your pal gussie throw a scare at him theyre bringing in the girl too layla they found her no not her the one you had us run last night the one that played with your victim at the mirage turns out shes got a jacket bosch reached over and yanked iversons arm to stop him eleanor wish youre bringing in eleanor wish he didnt wait for iversons reply he broke away from the man and charged into feltons office the captain was on the phone and bosch paced anxiously in front of the desk waiting for him to hang up felton pointed at the door but bosch shook his head he could see feltons eyes start to smolder as he told whoever was on the other end of the line he had to go i cant talk right now he said you dont have to worry its under control ill talk to you he hung up and looked at bosch what is it now call your people tell them to leave eleanor wish alone what are you talking about she had nothing to do with this i checked her out last night felton leaned forward and clasped his hands together as he thought when you say you checked her out what does that mean i interviewed her she had a passing acquaintance with the victim thats it shes clean do you know who she is bosch i mean do you know her history she was an fbi agent assigned to the la bank robbery squad she went to prison five years ago on a conspiracy charge stemming from a series of burglaries involving bank safe deposit vaults it doesnt matter captain shes clean on this i think it might be good to sweat her a little bit and take another go at her with one of my guys just to be sure im already sure look i bosch looked back at the office door and saw iverson hanging around trying to listen in bosch walked over and closed the door then pulled a chair away from the wall and sat right in front of feltons desk and leaned across to him look captain i knew eleanor wish in la i worked that case with the bank vaults iwe were more than just partners on it then it all turned to shit and she went away i hadnt seen her in five years until i saw her on the surveillance tape at the mirage thats why i called you last night i wanted to talk to her but not because of the case shes clean she did her time and shes clean now call your people felton was quiet bosch could see the wheels turning ive been up most of the night working on this i called your room a half dozen times to bring you in on it but you werent there i dont suppose you want to tell me where you were no i dont felton thought some more and then shook his head i cant do it i cant cut her loose yet why not because there is something about her you apparently dont know bosch closed his eyes for a moment like a boy expecting to get slapped by an angry mother but steadying himself to take it what dont i know she mightve only had a passing acquaintance with your victim but shes got more than that with joey marks and his group it was worse than he expected what are you talking about i put her name up for discussion with some of my people last night after you called weve got her in a file on numerous occasions she has been seen in the company of a man named terrence quillen who works for goshen who works for marks numerous times detective bosch in fact ive got a team out looking for quillen now see what he has to say in the company of what does that mean looked like strictly business according to the reports bosch felt like hed been punched this was impossible he had spent the night with the woman the sense of betrayal was building in him but a deeper gut sense told him she was true that this was all some huge mixup there was a knock on the door and iverson poked his head in fyi the others are back boss theyre puttin them in the interview rooms okay you need anything no were fine close the door after iverson left bosch looked at the captain is she arrested no we asked her to come in voluntarily let me talk to her first i dont think that would be wise i dont care if its wise let me go talk to her if shell tell anybody shell tell me felton thought a moment and then finally nodded his head okay go ahead you get fifteen minutes bosch should have thanked him but didnt he just got up quickly and went to the door detective bosch felton said harry looked back from the door ill do what i can for you on this but this cuts us in in a big way you understand that bosch stepped out without answering felton had no finesse it was understood without being said that bosch was now beholden to him but felton had to say it anyway in the hallway bosch passed the first interview room where they had placed goshen and opened the door to the second sitting there handcuffed to the table was gussie flanagan his nose was misshapen and looked like a new potato he had cotton jammed into the nostrils he looked at bosch with bloodshot eyes and recognition showed on his face bosch backed out and closed the door without saying a word eleanor wish was behind door number three she was disheveled obviously dragged from sleep by the metro cops but her eyes had the alert and wild quality of a cornered animal and that cut bosch to the bone harry what are they doing he closed the door and moved quickly into the tiny room touching her shoulder in a consoling manner and taking the seat across from her eleanor im sorry what what did you do yesterday when i saw you on the tape at the mirage i asked felton hes the captain here to get me your number and address because you were unlisted he did but then without my knowledge he ran your name and pulled up your package then on his own he had his people get you this morning its all part of this tony aliso thing i told you i didnt know him i had one drink with him once just because i happened by chance to be at the same table with him they bring me in she shook her head and looked away the distress written on her face this was the way it would always be she now knew the criminal record she carried would guarantee it ive got to ask you something i want to get this cleared up and get you out of here what tell me about this man terrence quillen he saw the shock in her eyes quillen what does heis he the suspect eleanor you know how this works i cant tell you things you tell me just answer the question do you know terrence quillen yes how do you know him he came up to me about six months ago when i was leaving the flamingo i had been out here four or five months i was settling in playing six nights a week by then he came up to me and in his words told me whats what he somehow knew about me who i was that id just gotten out he said there was a street tax he said i had to pay it that all the locals paid it and that if i didnt thered be trouble he said that if i did pay it hed watch out for me be there if i ever got in a jam you know how it goes extortion plain and simple she broke then and started to cry it took all of boschs will not to get up and try to hold her and comfort her in some way i was alone she said scared i paid i pay him every week what was i supposed to do i had nothing and nowhere to go fuck it bosch said under his breath he got up and squeezed around the end of the table and grabbed hold of her he pulled her to his chest and kissed the top of her head nothings going to happen he whispered i promise you that eleanor he held her there in silence for a few moments listening to her quiet crying until the door opened and iverson stood there he had a toothpick in his mouth get the fuck out of here iverson the detective slowly closed the door im sorry eleanor said im getting you in trouble no youre not its all on me everything is on me a few minutes later he walked back into feltons office the captain looked up at him wordlessly she was paying off quillen to leave her alone two hundred a week that was all it was the street tax she doesnt know anything about anything she happened by chance to be at the same table as aliso for about an hour friday shes clean now kick her loose tell your people felton leaned back and started tapping his lower lip with the end of a pen he was showing bosch his deepthinking pose i dont know he said okay this is the deal you let her go and i make a call to my people and whatll you tell em ill tell them ive gotten excellent cooperation from metro out here and that we ought to run this as a joint operation ill say were going to put the squeeze on goshen here and go for the twoforone sale were going to go for goshen and joey marks because marks was the one who wouldve ultimately pushed the button on tony aliso ill say its highly recommended that metro take the lead out here because they know the turf and they know marks do we have a deal felton tapped out another code message on his lip then reached over and turned the phone on his desk so bosch could have access to it make the call now he said after you talk to your co put me on the line i want to talk to him its a her whatever a half hour later bosch was driving a borrowed unmarked metro car with eleanor wish sitting crumpled in the passenger seat the call to lieutenant billets had gone over well enough for felton to keep his end of the deal eleanor was kicked loose though the damage was pretty much done she had been able to eke out a new start and a new existence but the underpinnings of confidence and pride and security had all been kicked out from beneath her it was all because of bosch and he knew it he drove in silence unable to even fathom what to say or how to make it better and it cut him deeply because he truly wanted to before the previous night he had not seen her in five years but she had never been far from his deepest thoughts even when he had been with other women there had always been a voice back there that whispered to him that eleanor wish was the one she was the match theyre always going to come for me she said in a small voice what you remember that bogart movie where the cop says round up the usual suspects and they go out and do it well thats me now they are going to mean me i guess i never realized that until now im one of the usual suspects i guess i should thank you for slapping me in the face with reality bosch said nothing he didnt know how to respond because her words were true in a few minutes they were at her apartment and bosch walked her in and sat her on the couch you okay fine when you get a chance look around and make sure they didnt take anything i didnt have anything to take bosch looked at the nighthawks print on the wall above her it was a painting of a lonely coffee shop on a dark night a man and a woman sitting together another man by himself bosch used to think he was the man alone now he stared at the couple and wondered eleanor he said i have to go back ill come back here as soon as i can okay harry thanks for getting me out you going to be okay sure promise promise back at metro iverson was waiting for bosch before they took their first shot at goshen felton had acceded to leaving goshen for bosch it was still his case in the hallway outside the interview room iverson tapped bosch on the arm to stop him before going in listen bosch i just want to say i dont know what you got going on with that woman and i guess its nobodys business anymore since the captain let her go but since were going to be working together on lucky here i thought id clear the air i didnt appreciate the way you spoke to me telling me to get the fuck out and all bosch looked at him a minute the detective still had a toothpick in his mouth and bosch wondered if it was the same one from before you know iverson i dont even know your first name its john but people call me ivy well iverson i didnt appreciate the way you were sneaking around the captains office or the interview room in la weve got a name for cops who sneak around and eavesdrop and are assholes on general principle we call em squints and i dont really care if youre offended by me or not youre a squint and you make any trouble for me from here on out and ill go right to felton and make trouble for you ill tell him about finding you in my room today and if thats not enough ill tell im that i won six hundred bucks on the wheel in the casino last night but the money disappeared off the bureau after you were there now you want to do this interview or not iverson grabbed bosch by the collar and shoved him against the wall dont you fuck with me bosch dont you fuck with me ivy a smile slowly cracked across iversons face and he released his grip and stepped back bosch straightened his tie and shirt then lets do it cowboy iverson said when they squeezed into the interview room goshen was waiting for them with his eyes closed his legs up on the table and his hands laced behind his head bosch watched iverson look down at the torn metal where the cuff ring had been attached to the table red flares of anger burst on his cheeks okay asshole get up iverson ordered goshen stood up and brought his cuffed hands up iverson got out his keys and took the cuff off one wrist lets try this again sit down when goshen was back down iverson cuffed his wrists behind his back looping the chain through one of the steel slats of the chair back iverson then kicked out a chair and sat to the side of the gangster bosch sat across from him okay houdini you alsove got destroying public property on your list now iverson said wow thats bold iverson really bold thats like the time you came into the club and took cinda into the fantasy booth i think you called it interrogation she called it something else whats this going to be iversons face now glowed with anger goshen puffed his chest up proudly and smirked at the detectives embarrassment bosch shoved the table into goshens midsection and the big man doubled over it as his breath burst out bosch was up quickly and around the table as he went he pulled his keychain from his pocket then using his elbow to keep goshens chest down on the table he flicked open the blade of his pocket knife and sawed off the big mans ponytail he went back to his seat and when goshen lifted up threw the sixinch length of hair on the table in front of him ponytails went out of style at least three years ago goshen you probably didnt hear about it iverson burst out in uproarious laughter goshen looked at bosch with pale blue eyes that seemed as soulless as buttons on a machine he didnt say a word he was showing bosch he could take it he was standup but bosch knew even he couldnt stand up forever nobody can youve got a problem lucky iverson said big problems you wait a minute wait a minute i dont want to talk to you iverson i dont want you to talk to me youre a runt ive got no respect for you understand anybody talks let him talk goshen nodded to bosch there was a silence during which bosch looked from him to iverson and then back go get a cup bosch said without looking at iverson well be fine in here no you go get a cup you sure iverson looked as if he were being kicked out of the college fraternity because the boys didnt think he fit in yeah im sure you got a rights form on you iverson got up he took a folded piece of paper out of his coat pocket and tossed it on the table ill be right outside the door when goshen and bosch were alone they studied each other for a moment before bosch spoke you want a smoke dont play the good guy with me just tell me whats what bosch shrugged off the rebuke and got up he moved behind goshen and took his keys out again this time he unlocked one of the cuffs goshen brought his hands up and began rubbing the wrists to get circulation going he noticed the length of hair on the table and slapped it onto the floor let me tell you something mr la ive been to a place where it doesnt matter what they do to you where nothing can hurt you ive been there and back everybodys been to disneyland so what im not talking about fuckin disneyland asshole i spent three years in the penta down in chihuahua they didnt break me then you arent going to do it now let me tell you something then in my life ive killed a lot of people just wanted you to know that up front time comes again there wont be any hesitation none this isnt about good guy cops and bad guy cops goshen thats the movies the movies where the bad guys have ponytails i guess but this is real life you are nothing to me but meat and im gonna put you down thats a given its just up to you how hard and how far you want to go down goshen thought a moment all right so now we know each other talk to me and ill take that smoke now bosch put his cigarettes and matches on the table goshen got one out and lit it bosch waited until he was done i gotta advise you first you know the routine bosch opened the piece of paper iverson had left and read goshen his rights he then had the man sign his name on it this is being taped isnt it not yet okay then whatve you got your fingerprints were on tony alisos body the gun we found behind the toilet will be going back to la today the prints are good to have real good but if the bullets they pick out of tonys gourd match that gun then its all over i dont care what kind of alibi you line up or what your explanation will be or if your lawyers johnny fucking cochran you wont just be meat youll be one hundred percent grade a dead meat that gun aint mine its a plant goddamn it you know it and i know it and its not going to fly bosch bosch looked at him a moment and felt his face getting hot youre saying i put that there im saying i watched the oj show cops out here are no different im saying i dont know if it was you or iverson or whoever but that guns a fuckin plant goddammit thats what im saying bosch traced a finger along the top of the table waiting for the anger to dissipate to the point where he could control his voice you hang on to that bullshit story goshen and youll go far with it youll go about ten years and then theyll strap you down and stick a needle in your arm at least its not the gas chamber anymore they make it easy on you guys now bosch leaned back but there wasnt a lot of room the back of the chair hit the wall he took out the chap stick and reapplied it we own you now goshen all you have left is one small window of opportunity call it a little piece of destiny still in your grasp and what windows that you know what window you know what im talking about guy like you doesnt move an inch without the okay give us the guy you worked the hit with and the guy who told you to put tony in the trunk you dont make a deal and theres no light at the end of the tunnel goshen let out his breath and shook his head look i did not do this i did not bosch didnt expect him to say anything different it wasnt that easy he had to wear him down he leaned across the table conspiratorially listen im going to tell you something so that you know that im not bullshitting you maybe save some time so you can decide where to go from here go ahead but its not going to change anything anthony aliso was wearing a black leather jacket friday night remember that one with the twoinch lapels it youre wasting your you grabbed him there goshen just like this bosch reached across the table and demonstrated using both hands to grab an imaginary set of lapels on a jacket goshen wasnt wearing remember that tell me im wasting my time now remember goshen you did it you grabbed him like that now who is bullshitting who goshen shook his head but bosch knew he had scored the pale blues were looking inward at the memory kindve a freaky thing processed leather like that holds the amino acids from the prints thats what the tech tells me we got some nice ones enough to take to the da or the grand jury enough for me to come out here enough for us to come right into your fucking house and hook you up he hesitated a moment until goshen was looking at him and now this gun turns up in your house i guess well just have to wait on the ballistics if you dont want to talk anymore but ive got a hunch about it i like my chances goshen slammed two open palms down on the steel table it made a sound like a shot and echo this is a setup you people put iverson burst through the door his gun out and aimed at goshen he jerked the weapon up like a tv cop you okay yeah bosch said lucky here is just a little mad is all give us a few more minutes iverson went back out without a word nice play but thats all it was goshen said wheres my phone call bosch leaned back across the table you can make the call now but you make the call and its over right here because that wont be your lawyer that will be joeys lawyer hell be here to represent you but we both know the one hell be watching out for is joey marks bosch stood up i guess then well just have to settle for you well go the distance on you yeah but you dont have me you prick fingerprints you need more than that that guns a plant and everybodys going to know it yeah you keep saying it ill know what i need to know from ballistics by tomorrow morning it was hard for bosch to tell if that had registered because goshen didnt give it much time to ive got a fuckin alibi you cant pin this on me man yeah whats your fuckin alibi how do you even know when he got hit you asked me about friday night right thats the night i didnt say that goshen sat silent and motionless for a half minute bosch could see the eyes going to work goshen knew he had crossed one line with what he had said bosch guessed he was considering how far he should cross bosch pulled the chair out and sat back down i got an alibi so im in the clear youre not in the clear till we say you are whats your story no im gonna tell my lawyer what it is youre hurting yourself goshen youve got nothing to lose telling me except my freedom right i could go out verify your story maybe then id start listening to your story about the gun being planted yeah right thats like puttin the inmates in charge of the prison talk to my lawyer bosch now get me a fucking phone bosch stood up and signaled for him to put his arms behind his back he did so and bosch cuffed him again then left the room after bosch filled them in on how goshen had won round one felton told iverson to take a phone into the interview room and allow the suspect to call his lawyer i guess well let him stew felton said when he and bosch were alone see how he likes his first taste of incarceration he told me he did three years down in mexico he tells that to a lot of people hes trying to impress like the tattoos when we were backgrounding him after he showed up a couple years ago we never found anything about a mexican prison and as far as we know hes never ridden a harley let alone with any motorcycle gang i think a night in county might soften him up maybe by round two well have the ballistics back bosch said he had to use a phone to call his co to check on what the plan was for the gun just pick an empty desk out there felton said make yourself at home listen ill tell you how this most likely will go and you can tell your lieutenant billets the lawyer he calls is most likely going to be mickey torrino hes joey markss top guy hes going to object to extradition and meantime try to get bail any bail will do all they want to do is get him out of our hands and into their hands and then they can make their decision what decision whether or not to whack him if joey thinks lucky might flip hell just take him out to the desert somewhere and well never see him again nobody will bosch nodded so you go make your call and ill call over to the prosecutors office see if we cant get an x hearing scheduled i think the sooner the better if you can get lucky to la hes going to be even more likely to start thinking about cutting a deal that is if we dont break him first itd be nice to have the ballistics before the extradition hearing if we get a ballistics match it will seal it but things dont move so quickly in la if you know what i mean i doubt theres even been an autopsy well make your call and then well reconnoiter bosch used an empty desk next to iversons to make his call he got billets at her desk and he could tell she was eating he quickly updated her on his failed effort to scam goshen into talking and the plans to have the prosecutors office in las vegas handle the extradition hearing what do you want to do about the gun he asked when he was done i want it back here as soon as possible edgar talked somebody over at the coroners office into doing the cut this afternoon we should have the bullets by tonight if we have the gun we can take the whole thing over to ballistics tomorrow morning todays tuesday i doubt thered be an extradition hearing before thursday wed have an answer from ballistics by then okay ill grab a plane good bosch sensed something off about her tone she was preoccupied by something other than ballistics and what she was eating lieutenant he said whats up is there something i dont know about she hesitated a moment and bosch waited her out actually somethings come up boschs face flashed warm he guessed that felton had screwed him and told billets about the eleanor wish situation what is it ive made an id on the guy who was in tony alisos office thats great bosch said relieved but confused by her somber tone who no its not great it was dominic carbone from ocid bosch was stunned into silence for a long moment carbone what the i dont know ive got some feelers out id like you back here until we figure out what to do with this goshen will keep until the extradition hearing hes not going to be talking to anyone but his lawyer if you can get back id like us all to get together and hash this around i havent talked to kiz and jerry yet today theyre still working the financial trail howd you make the id on carbone pure luck things were kind of slow after i talked to you and the captain out there this morning i took a drive downtown and stopped by central ive got a friend shes a lieutenant too up in oc lucinda barnes you know her no anyway i went up to see her i wanted to kind of feel around maybe get an idea why they took the pass on this one and lo and behold were sitting there talking and this guy walks through the squad and i think i recognize him but im not sure from where i ask who he is and she tells me thats carbone and thats when i remembered hes the guy on the tape he had his suit jacket off and his sleeves rolled up i even saw the tattoo its him you tell all this to your friend hell no i just acted natural and got the hell out of there i tell you harry i dont like this inside stuff i dont know what to do well figure something look im going to go ill be there as soon as i can what you might want to do in the meantime lieutenant is try to use some juice with ballistics tell them well be coming in with a code three in the morning billets said she would do what she could on that after making arrangements to fly back to la bosch barely had time to take a cab back to the mirage and check out and still make it by eleanors apartment to say goodbye but his knock on her door went unanswered he didnt know what kind of car she had so it was impossible for him to check the lot to make sure she was gone he went back to his rental and sat inside and waited as long as he could until he was at risk of missing his flight he then scribbled a message on a page from his notebook saying he would call her and went back to the door he folded the page up tight and stuck it in the crack of the door jamb so that it would fall and be noticed the next time she opened the door he wanted to wait around longer and talk to her in person but he couldnt twenty minutes later he was leaving the security office of the airport the gun from goshens house was wrapped in an evidence bag and safely in his briefcase five minutes later he was aboard a jet headed for the city of angels part iii billets had a weighted and worried look on her face when bosch stepped into her office harry lieutenant i dropped the gun at ballistics theyre waiting on the bullets whoever it was you talked to over there they snapped to good where is everybody theyre both over at archway kiz spent the morning at the irs and then went over to help jerry with the interviews with alisos associates i also borrowed a couple of people from major fraud to help with the books theyre tracing down these dummy corporations theyre going to go after the bank accounts search and seizure when we freeze the money then maybe some real live people will come out of the woodwork and claim it my theory is that this joey marks was not the only one aliso was washing money for theres too much involvedif kizs numbers are right aliso was probably working for every mob combine west of chicago bosch nodded oh by the way she continued i told jerry that youd take the autopsy so he can stay at archway then i want everybody back here at six to talk about what we have okay whens the autopsy threethirty that going to be a problem no can i ask you something whyd you call major fraud in instead of ocid for obvious reasons i dont know what to do about carbone and ocid i dont know whether to bring in internal affairs look the other way or what well we cant look the other way they have something we need and if you call in iad then forget it that will freeze everything up down there and that will be that what do they have that we need it stands to reason that if carbone was pulling a bug out of that office then theres tapes jesus i forgot about that they dropped into silence for a few moments bosch pulled the chair out across from her desk and finally sat down let me take a run at carbone see if i can figure out what they were doing and get the tapes he said weve got the leverage this may have something to do with the chief and fitzgerald you know maybe she was referring to the intradepartmental skirmish between deputy chief leon fitzgerald commander of ocid for more than a decade and the man who was supposed to be his boss the chief of police in the time fitzgerald had run the ocid he had taken on an aura akin to j edgar hoovers at the fbi a keeper of secrets who would use them to protect his position his division and his budget it was believed by many that fitzgerald had his minions investigate and keep tabs on more honest citizens cops and elected officials of the city than the mobsters his division was charged with rooting out and it was no secret within the department that there was an ongoing power struggle between fitzgerald and the police chief the chief wanted to rein in ocid and its deputy chief but fitzgerald didnt want to be reined in in fact he wanted his domain to broaden he wanted to be police chief the struggle was largely at a namecalling standstill the chief could not fire fitzgerald outright because of civil service protections and he could not get backing to simply gut and overhaul ocid from the police commission mayor or city council members because it was believed that fitzgerald had thick files on all of them including the chief these elected and appointed officials did not know what was in those files but they had to assume that the worst things they had ever done were duly recorded and therefore they would not back the chiefs move against fitzgerald unless they and the chief were in a guaranteed nolose position most of this was department legend or rumor but bosch knew even legend and rumor usually have some basis in reality he was reluctant to step behind this curtain and possibly into this fight as billets clearly was but offered to do so because he saw no alternative he had to know what ocid had been doing and what it was that carbone was trying to protect by breaking into the archway office okay billets said after some long thought but be careful wheres the video from archway she pointed to the safe on the floor behind her desk it was used to secure evidence it will be safe she said it better be it will probably be the only thing that keeps them off me she nodded she knew the score the ocid offices were on the third floor of central division in downtown the division was located away from police headquarters at parker center because the work of the ocid involved many undercover operations and it would not be wise to have so many undercovers going in and out of a place as public as the socalled glass house parker center but it was that separation that helped foster the deepening gulf between leon fitzgerald and the police chief on the drive over from hollywood bosch thought about a plan and knew just how he was going to play it by the time he got to the guard shack and flipped his id to the rookie assigned parking lot duty he read the name off the tag above the cops breast pocket and drove into the lot and over toward the back doors of the station then put the car in park and got out his phone he called the ocids main number and a secretary answered yeah this is trindle down on the parking lot bosch said is carbone there yes he is if you hold a just tell him to come down somebody busted into his car bosch hung up and waited in three minutes one of the doors at the rear of the station house opened and a man hurried out bosch recognized him from the archway surveillance tape billets had been right on bosch put the car in drive and followed along behind the man eventually he pulled up alongside him and lowered the window carbone yeah what he kept walking barely giving bosch a glance slow down your cars all right carbone stopped and now looked closely at bosch what what are you talking about i made the call i just wanted to get you out here who the fuck are you im bosch we talked the other night oh yeah the aliso caper then it dawned on him that bosch could have just taken the elevator up to the third floor if he wanted to see him what is this bosch whats going on why dont you get in i want to take a little ride i dont know man i dont like the way youre doing this get in carbone i think you better bosch said it in a tone and with an accompanying stare that invited no choice but compliance carbone who was about forty with a stocky build hesitated a moment then walked around the front of the car he was wearing a nice dark blue suit like most mob cops liked to wear and he filled the car with the smell of a brisk cologne right away bosch didnt like him they drove out of the parking lot and bosch went north toward broadway there was a lot of traffic and pedestrians and they moved slowly bosch said nothing waiting for carbone okay so whats so important you have to kidnap me away from the station he finally asked bosch drove another block without answering he wanted carbone to sweat a little youve got problems carbone he finally said i just thought i should tell you see i want to be your friend carbone carbone looked at bosch with caution i know i got problems he said im paying two different women child support my house still has cracks in the walls from the earthquake and the union aint going to get us a raise again this year so fuckin what those arent problems man those are inconveniences im talking about real problems about the breakin you did the other night over at archway carbone was silent for a long moment and bosch wasnt sure but he thought the man was holding his breath i dont know what youre talking about take me back no carbone see thats the wrong answer im here to help you not hurt you im your friend and that goes for your boss fitzgerald too i still dont know what youre talking about okay then ill tell you what im talking about i called you sunday night and asked you about my stiff named aliso you call me back and tell me not only is ocid taking a pass but you never heard of the guy but as soon as you hang up the phone you get over to archway break into the guys office and pop the bug you people planted in his phone thats what im talking about bosch looked over at him for the first time and he saw the face of a man whose mind is racing to find a way out bosch knew he had him now bullshit thats what youre talking about yeah you dumb fuck next time you decide to do a little breaking and entering look up check for cameras rodney king rule number one dont get caught on tape he waited a moment to let that sink in and then put the final nails in the coffin you knocked the mug off the desk and broke it you then dumped it outside hoping nobody would notice anything and one last thing about the rules if youre going to do a b ampe in short sleeves then you ought to get yourself a bandaid or somethin and cover up that tattoo on your arm know what i mean thats a slambang identifier when you got it on tape and carbone youre on tape lots of tape carbone wiped a hand across his face bosch turned on third and they went into the tunnel that runs under bunker hill in the darkness that shrouded the car carbone finally spoke who knows about this for the moment just me but dont get any ideas anything happens to me and the tape will get known by a lot of people but for the moment i can probably contain it what do you want i want to know what was going on and i want all the tapes you took off his phone impossible cant do it i dont have those tapes it wasnt even my file i just did what what fitz told you to do yeah i know but i dont care about that you go to fitz or whoevers file it was and get it ill go with you if you want or ill wait out in the car but were going back now to get them i cant do it what bosch knew he meant was that he couldnt get the tapes without going to fitzgerald and telling him how he had so badly messed up the breakin youre going to have to carbone i dont give a shit about you you lied to me and fucked with my case you either get me the tapes and an explanation or this is what i do i dub off three copies of the surveillance tape one goes to the chiefs office in the glass house one goes to jim newton at the times and the last goes over to stan chambers at channel stans a good man hell know what to do with it do you know hes the one who got the rodney king tape first jesus bosch youre killing me youve got your choice the autopsy was being conducted by a deputy coroner named salazar he had already started by the time bosch got to the coroners office at countyusc medical center they said their perfunctory hellos and bosch garbed in the protective paper body suit and plastic mask leaned back against one of the stainless counters and just watched he wasnt expecting much from the autopsy he had really only come for the bullets and his hope was that one of them would be usable for comparison purposes it was well known that one reason hitters preferred to use twentytwos on the job was that the soft bullets often became so misshapen after bouncing around in the brain case that they were worthless for ballistic comparison salazar kept his long black hair in a ponytail that he then wrapped in a larger paper cap because he was in a wheelchair he worked at an autopsy table that was lowered to accommodate him this gave bosch an unusually clear vantage point in viewing what was happening to the body in years past bosch would have maintained an ongoing banter with salazar while the autopsy proceeded but since his motorcycle accident his ninemonth medical leave and his return in a wheelchair salazar was no longer a cheerful man and rarely engaged in small talk bosch watched as salazar used a dulled scalpel to scrape a sample of the whitish material from the corners of alisos eyes he placed the material in a paper bindle and put it in a petri dish he placed the dish on a tray that held a small stand containing the test tubes filled with blood urine and other samples of body materials to be scanned and tested think it was tears bosch asked i dont think so too thick he had something in his eyes or on his skin well find out what bosch nodded and salazar proceeded to open the skullcap and examine the brain the bullets mushed this puppy he said after a few minutes he used a pair of long tweezers to pick out two bullet fragments and drop them in a dish bosch stepped over and looked at them and frowned at least one of the bullets had fragmented upon impact the pieces were probably worthless for comparison purposes then salazar pulled out a complete bullet and dropped it in the tray you might be able to work with this one he said bosch took a look the bullet had mushroomed on impact but about half the shaft was still intact and he could see the tiny scratches made when it was fired through the barrel of a gun he felt a twinge of encouragement this might work he said the autopsy wrapped up in about ten more minutes overall aliso had gotten fifty minutes of salazars time it was more than most bosch checked a clipboard that was on the counter and saw that it was the eleventh autopsy of the day for salazar salazar cleaned the bullets and put them in an evidence envelope as he handed it to bosch he told the detective that he would be informed of the results of the analysis of the samples retrieved from the body as soon as it was completed the only other thing that he thought was worth mentioning was that the bruise on alisos cheek was antemortem by four or five hours this bosch found to be very curious he didnt know how it fit in it would mean that someone had roughed aliso up while he was in las vegas yet he had been killed here in la he thanked salazar calling him sally as many people did and headed out he was in the hallway before he remembered something and went back to the door of the autopsy suite when he stuck his head in he saw salazar tying the sheet around the body making sure the toe tag hung free and could be read hey sally the guy had hemorrhoids right salazar looked back at him with a quizzical look on his face hemorrhoids no why do you ask i found a tube of preparation h in his car in the glove box it was half used hmmmwell no hemorrhoids not on this one bosch wanted to ask him if he was sure but knew that would be insulting he let it go for the moment and left details fueled any investigation they were important and not to be misplaced or forgotten as he headed toward the glass exit doors of the coroners office bosch found himself bothered by the detail of the tube of preparation h found in the glove box of the silver cloud if tony aliso hadnt suffered from hemorrhoids then whom did the tube belong to and why was it in his car he could dismiss it as probably being unimportant but that wasnt his way everything had its place in an investigation bosch believed everything his deep concentration on this problem caused bosch to go through the glass doors and down the stairs to the parking lot before he saw carbone standing there smoking a cigarette and waiting when bosch had dropped him off earlier the ocid detective had begged for a couple of hours to get the tapes together bosch had agreed but hadnt told him that he was heading to an autopsy so he now assumed that carbone had called the bureau in hollywood and been told by billets or someone else that he was at the coroners office bosch wouldnt check this with carbone because he didnt want to show any kind of concern that the ocid detective had so easily found him bosch yeah somebody wants to talk who when i want the tapes carbone cool your jets for a couple minutes over here in the car he led bosch to the second parking row where there was a car with its engine running and its darktinted windows all the way up hop in the back carbone said bosch nonchalantly walked to the door still showing no concern he opened it and ducked in leon fitzgerald was sitting in the back he was a tall manmore than six and a half feetand his knees were pressed hard against the back of the drivers seat he wore a beautiful suit of blue silk and held the stub of a cigar between his fingers he was almost sixty and his hair was a jetblack dye job his eyes behind steelrimmed glasses were pale gray his skin was pasty white he was a night man chief bosch said nodding he had never met fitzgerald before but had seen him often enough at cop funerals and on television news reports he was the embodiment of the ocid no one else from the secretive division ever went on camera detective bosch fitzgerald said i know of you know of your exploits over the years you have been suggested to me more than once as a candidate for our unit why didnt you call carbone had come around and gotten in the drivers seat he started moving the car slowly through the lot because like i said i know of you fitzgerald was saying and i know you would not leave homicide homicide is your calling am i correct pretty much which brings us to the current homicide case you are pursuing dom with one hand carbone passed a shoebox over the seat fitzgerald took it and put it on boschs lap bosch opened it and found it full of audiocassette tapes with dates written on tape stuck to the cases from alisos phone he asked obviously how long were you on it wed only been listening for nine days it hadnt been productive but the tapes are yours and what do you want in return chief what do i want fitzgerald looked out the window down at the railroad switching yard in the valley below the parking lot what do i want he asked again i want the killer of course but i also want you to be careful the departments been through a lot these past few years no need to hang our dirty laundry in public once again you want me to bury carbones extracurricular activities neither fitzgerald nor carbone said anything but they didnt have to everybody in the car knew that carbone did what he did on orders probably orders from fitzgerald himself then youve got to answer some questions of course why was there a bug on tony alisos phone same reason theres a bug on anyones phone we heard things about the man and set about finding out if they were true what did you hear that he was dirty that he was a scumbag that he was a launderer for the mob in three states we opened a file we had just begun when he was killed then when i called why did you pass on it fitzgerald took a long pull on his cigar and the car filled with its smell theres a complicated answer to that question detective suffice it to say that we thought it best if we remained uninvolved the tap was illegal wasnt it it is extremely difficult under state law to gather the required information needed for a wiretap the feds they can get it done on a whim we cant and we dont want to work with the feds all the time it still doesnt explain why you passed you couldve taken the case from us and then controlled it buried it done whatever you wanted with it no one would have known about illegal wiretaps or anything else perhaps perhaps it was a wrong choice bosch realized they had underestimated himself and his crew fitzgerald had believed the breakin would go unnoticed and therefore his units involvement would not be discovered bosch understood the tremendous leverage he held over fitzgerald word about the illegal wiretap would be all the police chief would need to rid himself of fitzgerald so what else do you have on aliso he asked i want everything if i hear at any point you held something back then your littleblackbag job is going to get known you know what i mean it will get known fitzgerald turned from the window and looked at him i know exactly what you mean but you are making a mistake if you are going to smugly sit there and believe you have all the high cards in this game then put whatever cards you have on the table detective i am about to fully cooperate with you but know this if you seek to hurt me or anyone in my division with the information you get here i will hurt you more for example theres this matter of your keeping company last night with a convicted felon he let that hang in the air with his cigar smoke bosch was stunned and angry but managed to swallow down his urge to throttle fitzgerald there is a department prohibition against any officer knowingly associating with criminals im sure you know that detective and understand the need for such a safeguard if this were to become known about you then your job could be in jeopardy then where would you and your mission be bosch didnt answer he looked straight ahead over the seat and out the front window fitzgerald leaned over so that he was almost whispering in his ear this is what we know about you in just one hour he said what if we spend a day a week and its not just you my friend you can tell your lieutenant that there is a glass ceiling in the department for lesbians especially if something like that should get out now her girlfriend she could go further her being black but the lieutenant shed have to get used to hollywood you ask me he leaned back to his spot and returned his voice to normal modulation do we have an understanding here detective bosch bosch turned and finally looked at him we have an understanding after dropping the bullets retrieved from tony alisos head at the ballistics lab in boyle heights bosch made it back to the hollywood division just as the investigators were gathering in billetss office for the six oclock meeting bosch was introduced to russell and kuhlken the two fraud investigators and everybody sat down also sitting in was a deputy district attorney matthew gregson was from special prosecutions a unit that handled organized crime cases as well as the prosecution of police officers and other delicate matters bosch had never met him bosch gave his report first and concisely brought the others up to date on the occurrences in las vegas as well as the autopsy and his swing by the departments gun shop he said hed been promised that the ballistics comparison would be done by ten the following morning but bosch made no mention of his meetings with carbone and fitzgerald not because of the threat fitzgerald had madeor so bosch told himself but because the information he had gleaned from those meetings was best not discussed with such a large group in general and a prosecutor in particular apparently feeling the same way billets asked him no questions in this regard when bosch was finished rider went next she said she had talked to the irs auditor assigned to the tna productions case and gotten very little information basically they have a whistleblowing program she said you blow the whistle on a tax scofflaw and you get a share of whatever taxes the irs finds its been cheated out of thats how this started only problem is according to hirschfield hes the irs guy this tip came in anonymously whoever blew the whistle didnt want a share he said they got a threepage letter outlining tony alisos moneywashing scam he would not show it to me because he claimed anonymous or not the guidelines of the program call for strict confidence and the specific language of the letter could lead to identification of the author he thats bullshit gregson said probably rider said but there was nothing i could do about it afterwards give me the guys name and ill see what i can do sure anyway they got this letter did some preliminary looking at tnas corporate filings over the years and decided the letter had merit they sent the audit letter to tony on august and were going to do him at the end of this month that was it with himoh the one thing he would tell me about the letter was that it was mailed from las vegas it was on the postmark bosch almost nodded involuntarily because that last bit of information fit with something fitzgerald had told him okay now for tony alisos associates jerry and i spent the better part of the day interviewing the core group of people he used when making this trash he called film he basically raided the local film schools lowrent acting schools and strip bars for the socalled artistic talent for these shoots but there were five men that he repeatedly worked with to get them off the ground we took them all one by one and it appears they were not privy to financing of the movies or the books tony kept we think they were in the dark jerry thats right edgar said i personally think tony picked these guys because they were stupid and didnt ask questions about that sort of stuff he just sent them out you know over to usc or ucla to grab some kid whod want to direct or write one of these things theyd go over to the star strip on la cienega and talk girls into taking the bimbo parts on and on you know how it goes our conclusion is that this little money washing scam was tonys only he and his customers knew which leads us to you guys billets said looking at russell and kuhlken you got anything to tell us yet kuhlken said they were still waistdeep in the financial records but they had so far traced money from tna productions to dummy corporations in california nevada and arizona the money went into the corporation bank accounts and was then invested in other seemingly legitimate corporations he said when the trail was fully documented they would be in a position to use the irs and federal statutes to seize the money as the illegal funds of a racketeering enterprise unfortunately russell said the documentation period was long and difficult it would be another week before they could move keep at it and take the time you need billets said then she looked at gregson so then how are we doing what should we be doing gregson thought a moment i think we are doing fine first thing tomorrow ill call vegas and find out whos handling the extradition hearing im thinking that i possibly should go out there to babysit that im not that comfortable at the moment with all of us here and goshen over there with them if we are lucky enough to pull a match out of ballistics i think you and i harry should go over there and not leave until we have goshen with us bosch nodded his agreement after hearing all of these reports i really have just one question gregson continued why isnt there someone from ocid sitting in this room right now billets looked at bosch and almost imperceptibly nodded the question was being passed to him initially bosch said ocid was informed of the murder and the victims id and they passed they said they didnt know tony aliso as recently as two hours ago i had a conversation with leon fitzgerald and told him what it looked like we had he offered whatever expertise his people had but felt we were too far along now to have fresh people come in he wished us best of luck with it gregson stared at him a long moment and then nodded the prosecutor was in his midforties with shortcropped hair already completely gray bosch had never worked with him but hed heard the name gregson had been aroundlong enough to know there was more to what bosch had said but he had also been around long enough to let it go for the time being billets didnt give him a lot of time to make something of it anyway okay so why dont we brainstorm a little bit before we call it a night she said what do we think happened to this man were gathering a lot of information a lot of evidence but do we know what happened to him she looked at the faces gathered in the room finally rider spoke up my guess is that the irs audit brought it all about she said he got the notice in the mail and he made a fatal mistake he told this guy in vegas joey marks that the government was going to look at his books and his cheap movies and the scam was likely going to come out joey marks responded the way you expect these guys to respond he whacked him he had his man goshen follow tony back home from vegas so it would happen far away from him and goshen puts him in the trunk the others nodded their heads in agreement this included bosch the information hed received from fitzgerald fit with this scenario as well it was a good plan edgar said only mistake was the fingerprints artie donovan got off the jacket that was pure luck and if we didnt have that we probably wouldnt have any of this that was the only mistake maybe not bosch said the prints on the jacket just hurried things along but metro in vegas was already working a tip from an informant who overheard lucky goshen talking about hitting somebody and putting them in a trunk it wouldve gotten back to us eventually well id rather be already on it than waiting for eventually billets said any alternative theories we should also be chasing are we clear on the wife the angry screenwriter his other associates nothing that sticks out rider said there definitely was no love lost between the victim and the wife but she seems clean so far i pulled the gatehouse log up there with a warrant and her car never left hidden highlands on friday night she seems clean what about the letter to the irs gregson asked who sent it obviously someone with pretty good knowledge of what this man was doing but who would that be this could all be part of a power play within the joey marks group bosch said like i said before something about the look on goshens face when he saw that gun and his claims later that it was a planti dont know maybe somebody tipped the irs knowing it would get tony whacked and that they could then possibly lay it off on goshen with goshen gone this person moves up youre saying goshen didnt do it gregson asked his eyebrows arched no i think goshen is probably good for it but i dont think he was counting on that gun showing up behind the toilet it doesnt make sense anyway to keep it around so say he whacks out tony aliso on orders from joey marks he gives the gun to somebody in his crew to get rid of only that person goes and plants it at the housethis is the same person who sent the letter to the irs in the first place to get the whole thing going now we come along and wrap goshen up in a bow the guy who stashed the gun and sent the letter hes in a position to move up bosch looked at their faces as they tried to follow the logic maybe goshen isnt the intended target rider said everyone looked at her maybe theres one more play maybe its someone who wants goshen and joey marks out of the way so he can move in how will they get marks now edgar asked through goshen she said if those ballistics come back a match bosch said then you can stick a fork in goshen because hell be done hell be looking at the needle or life without possibility or a reduced sentence if he gives us something joey marks gregson and edgar said at the same time so who is the letter writer billets asked who knows bosch answered i dont know enough about the organization over there but theres a lawyer who was mentioned by the cops there a guy who handles everything for marks hed know about alisos scam he could pull this off theres probably a handful of people close to marks capable of doing it they all were silent for a long moment each one thinking the story through and seeing that it could work it was a natural conclusion to the meeting and billets stood up to end it lets keep up the good work she said matthew thanks for coming out youll be the first one i call when we get the ballistics in the morning everyone else started standing up kiz and jerry flip a coin billets said one of you will have to go to vegas to work the extradition escort with harry its regulations oh and harry could you wait a minute theres something i need to discuss with you about another case after the others left billets told bosch to close the door he did so and then sat down in one of the chairs in front of her desk so what happened she asked did you really talk to fitzgerald well i guess it was more that he talked to me but yeah i met with him and carbone whats the deal basically the deal is that they didnt know tony aliso from a hole in the ground until they too got a letter probably the same one that went to the irs ive got a copy of it it has details it was from somebody with knowledge just like kiz said the letter ocid got also was postmarked in las vegas and it was addressed specifically to fitzgerald so their response was to bug his office phone right illegal bug they had just startedi have nine days worth of tapes to listen towhen i call up and say tony got whacked they panicked you know his situation with the chief if it came out that first of all they illegally put the bug on tony and second of all might have somehow been the cause of his death because joey marks found out then the chief would pretty much have all hed need to move fitzgerald out and reestablish controls on ocid so fitzgerald sends carbone in to get the bug and they play dumb about tony right carbone didnt see the camera or we wouldnt know any of this that prick when this is over the first thing im going to do is give it all to the chief uh bosch wasnt sure how to say it what is it fitzgerald could see that coming i cut a deal with him what i cut a deal he gave me everything the tapes the letter but their activities go no further than you and me the chief never knows harry how could you you had no hes got something on me lieutenant hes got something on you tooand kiz a long silence followed and bosch watched the anger flush her cheeks that arrogant bastard she said bosch told her what it was fitzgerald had come up with since bosch now was privy to her secret he thought it was only fair that he tell her about eleanor billets just nodded she was clearly thinking more about her own secret and the consequences of fitzgerald having knowledge of it do you think he actually put people on me a tail who knows hes the kind of guy who sees opportunities and acts on them he keeps information like money in a bank in case of a rainy day this was a rainy day for him and he pulled it out i made the deal lets forget about it and move on with the case she was silent a moment and bosch watched her for any sign of embarrassment there was none she looked directly at bosch her eyes searching him for any sign of judgment there was none she nodded what else did they do after the letter came not much they put aliso on a loose surveillance i have the logs but they werent watching him friday night they knew hed gone to las vegas so they were planning to pick him up again after the holiday if he was back they were really just getting started when it all went down she nodded again her mind wasnt on the subject bosch stood up ill listen to the tapes tonight theres about seven hours but fitzgerald said its mostly aliso talking to his girlfriend in vegas nothing much else but ill listen anyway you need anything else lieutenant no lets talk in the morning i want to know about the ballistics as soon as you know you got it bosch headed to the door but she stopped him its weird isnt it when sometimes you cant tell the good guys from the bad he looked back at her yeah its weird the house still smelled of fresh paint when bosch finally got home he looked at the wall he had started to paint three days before and it seemed long ago he didnt know when hed finish now the house had been a groundup rebuilding job after the earthquake hed only been back a few weeks after more than a year of living in a residence hotel near the station the earthquake too seemed long ago things happened fast in this city everything but the moment seemed like ancient history he got out the number felton had given him for eleanor wish and called it but there was no answer not even a machine picking up he hung up and wondered if she had gotten the note he left for her his hope was that they would somehow be together after this case was over but if it came to that he realized he wasnt sure how hed deal with the departments prohibition against associating with a convicted felon his thoughts about this spun into the question of how fitzgerald had found out about her and the night they had spent together in her apartment it seemed to him it was likely that fitzgerald would maintain contacts with metro and he guessed that maybe felton or iverson had informed the deputy chief about eleanor wish bosch made two sandwiches of lunch meat from the refrigerator and then took them two bottles of beer and the box of tapes fitzgerald had given him over to the chair next to his stereo as he ate he arranged the tapes in chronological order and then started playing them there was a photocopy of a log and pen register with entries showing what time of day aliso either received or made the calls and what number he had called more than half the calls were between aliso and layla either placed to the clubbosch could tell because of the background music and noiseor a number he assumed was her apartment she never identified herself on any of the calls but on the occasions tony called her at the club he asked for her by her stage name layla other than that he never used her name most of their conversations were about the minutia of daily life he called her most often at home in the midafternoon in one call to her home layla was angry at aliso for waking her up he complained that it was already noon and she reminded him that she had worked until four at the club like a chastened boy he apologized and offered to call back he did at two in addition to the conversations with layla there were calls to other women involving the timing of a scene that needed to be reshot for one of tonys movies and various other filmrelated business calls there were two calls placed by aliso to his home but both of his conversations with his wife were quick and to the point one time he said he was coming home and the other time he said he was going to be held up and wouldnt be home for dinner when bosch was done it was after midnight and he had counted only one of the conversations as being of even marginal interest it was a call placed to the dressing room at the club on the tuesday before aliso was murdered in the midst of their rather boring innocuous conversation layla asked him when he was coming out next comin out thursday baby aliso replied why you miss me already noi mean yeah sure i miss you and all tone but lucky was asking if you were coming thats why i asked layla had a soft littlegirl voice that seemed unpracticed or fake well tell him ill be in thursday night you working then yeah im working bosch turned off the stereo and thought about the one call that mattered it meant goshen knew through layla that aliso was coming out it wasnt much but it could probably be used by a prosecutor as part of an argument for premeditation the problem was that it was tainted evidence in legal terms it did not exist he looked at his watch it was late but he decided to call he took the number off the log where laylas number had been recorded by a pen register which read the tones that sounded when a number was punched into a phone after four rings it was answered by a woman with a slow voice laced with practiced sexual intent layla no this is pandora bosch almost laughed but he was too tired aging wheres layla she isnt here this is a friend of hers harry she tried to call me the other night you know where she is or where i could reach her no she hasnt been around for a couple days i dont know where she is is this about tony yeah well shes pretty upset i guess if she wants to talk to you shell call you again you in town not right now where dyou guys live uh i dont think im going to tell you that pandora is layla scared of something of course she is her old man gets killed she thinks people might think she knows something but she doesnt shes just scared bosch gave pandora his home number and told her to have layla call if she checked in after he hung up he looked at his watch and took out the little phone book he kept in his jacket he called billetss number and a man answered her husband bosch apologized for the late call asked for the lieutenant and wondered while he waited what the husband knew about his wife and kizmin rider when billets picked up bosch told her about his review of the tapes and how little value they had the one call establishes goshens knowledge of alisos trip to vegas as well as his interest in it but thats about it i think its kind of marginal and well be okay without it when we find layla we should be able to get the same information from her legally well that makes me feel better bosch heard her exhale her unspoken worry had obviously been that if the tapes contained any vital information they would have to have been brought forward to prosecutors thereby alienating fitzgerald and ending her own career sorry for the late call bosch said but i thought you might want to know as soon as i knew thanks harry ill see you in the morning after he hung up he tried eleanor wishs line once more and again there was no answer now the slight worry hed had in his chest bloomed into a fullfledged concern he wished he was still in vegas so he could go to her apartment to see if she was there and just not answering or if it was something worse bosch got himself another beer from the refrigerator and went out to the back deck the new deck was larger than its predecessor and offered a deeper view into the pass it was dark and peaceful out the usual hiss of the hollywood freeway far below was easily tuned out he watched the spotlights from universal studios cut across the starless sky and finished his beer wondering where she was on wednesday morning bosch got to the station at eight and typed out reports detailing his moves and investigation in las vegas he made copies and put them in the lieutenants mailbox and then clipped the originals into the already inchthick murder book that edgar had started he filed no report on his conversations with carbone and fitzgerald or his review of the tapes ocid had made off alisos office phone his work was only interrupted by frequent walks to the watch office for coffee he had completed these chores by ten oclock but waited another five minutes before calling the departments gun shop he knew from experience that he should not call before the time the report on the bullet comparisons was to be finished he threw in the extra five minutes just to make sure it was a long five minutes as he called edgar and rider gravitated toward his spot at the homicide table so that they could immediately get the comparison results it was a makeorbreak point in the investigation and they all knew it bosch asked for lester poole the gun tech assigned the case they had worked together before poole was a gnomish man whose whole life revolved around guns though as a civilian employee of the department he did not carry one himself but there was no one more expert at the gun shop than he he was a curious man in that he would not acknowledge anyone who called him les he insisted on being called lester or even just poole never the diminutive of lester once he confided to bosch that this was because he feared that if he became known as les poole it would only be a matter of time before some smartass cops started calling him cess poole it was his intention never to let that happen lester its harry bosch said when the tech picked up youre the man this morning what have you got for me ive got good and bad news for you harry give me the bad first just finished with your case havent written the report yet but this is what i can tell you the gun has been wiped clean of prints and is not traceable your doer used acid on the serial and i couldnt bring it up with any of my magic tricks so thats that and the good i can tell you that youve got yourself a match between the weapon and the bullets extracted from your victim its a definite match bosch looked up at edgar and rider and gave the thumbsup sign they exchanged a high five and then bosch watched as rider gave lieutenant billets the thumbsup through the glass of her office bosch then saw billets pick up her phone bosch presumed she was calling gregson at the das office poole told bosch that the report would be finished by noon and shipped through intradepartmental courier bosch thanked him and hung up he stood up smiling and then walked with edgar and rider into the lieutenants office billets spent another minute on the phone and bosch could tell she was talking to gregson she then hung up thats a very happy man there she said he should be edgar said all right so now what billets asked we go over there and drag that desert dirtbags ass back here edgar said yes thats what gregson said hes going to go over to babysit the hearing its tomorrow morning right supposed to be bosch said im thinking of heading over there today there are a couple loose ends i want to square away maybe take another shot at finding the girlfriend and then i want to make the arrangements so we can get out of there with him as soon as the judge says go fine billets said then to edgar and rider she asked did you two decide who is going with harry me edgar said kiz is more plugged in on the financial stuff ill go with harry to get this sucker okay fine anything else bosch told them about the gun being untraceable but this didnt seem to dent the euphoria engendered by the ballistics match the case was looking more and more like a slam dunk they left the office after a few more selfcongratulatory statements and bosch went back to his phone he dialed feltons office at metro the captain picked up right away felton its bosch in la bosch whats up thought you might want to know the gun checks out it fired the bullets that killed tony aliso felton whistled into the phone damn thats nice and neat lucky aint going to feel so lucky when he hears about that well im coming out in a little while to tell him good when you going to be here havent set it up yet what about the extradition hearing we still on for tomorrow morning absolutely as far as i know ill have somebody doublecheck to make sure his lawyer might be trying to make waves but that wont work this added piece of evidence will help too bosch told him that gregson would be coming out in the morning to aid the local prosecutor if needed thats probably a wasted trip but hes welcome just the same ill tell him listen if youve got a spare body theres still one loose end bugging me what tonys girlfriend she was a dancer at dollys till she got fired by lucky on saturday i still want to talk to her she goes by the name layla thats all i have that and her phone number he gave felton the number and the captain said hed have somebody check into it anything else yeah one other thing you know deputy chief fitzgerald out here dont you sure do weve worked cases together you talked to him lately uh nono not inits been a while bosch thought he was lying but decided to let it go he needed the mans cooperation for at least another twentyfour hours why do you ask bosch no reason just thought id ask hes been advising us from this end thats all good to hear that hes a very capable individual capable yeah that he is bosch hung up and then immediately set about making travel arrangements for himself and edgar he booked two rooms at the mirage they were above the departments maximum allowance for hotel rooms but he was sure billets would approve the vouchers besides layla had called him once at the mirage she might try again last he reserved roundtrip tickets for himself and edgar out of burbank on the thursday afternoon return he reserved one more seat for goshen their flight out left at threethirty and got them into las vegas an hour later he figured that would give them plenty of time to do what they had to do nash was in the gatehouse and came out to greet bosch with a smile harry introduced edgar looks like you guysve got yourself a real whodunit eh looks that way bosch said you got any theories not a one i gave your girl the gate log she tell you that shes not my girl nash shes a detective pretty good one too i know i didnt mean nothing so is mrs aliso home today lets take a look nash slid the door of the gatehouse back open went inside and picked up a clipboard he scanned it quickly and flipped back to the prior page after scanning it he put the clipboard down and came back out she should be there he said hasnt been out in two days bosch nodded his thanks i gotta call her you know nash said rules no problem nash raised the gate and bosch drove through veronica aliso was waiting at the open door of her house when they got there she was wearing tight gray leggings beneath a long loose tshirt with a copy of a matisse painting on it she had on a lot of makeup again bosch introduced edgar and she led them to the living room they declined an offer for something to drink well then what can i do for you men bosch opened his notebook and tore out a page he had already written on he handed her the page thats the number of the coroners office and the case number he said the autopsy was completed yesterday and the body can be released to you now if you are already working with a funeral home just give that case number to them and theyll take care of it she looked at the page for a long moment thank you she finally said you came all the way up here to give me this no we also have some news weve arrested a man for your husbands murder her eyes widened who did he say why he did this his name is luke goshen hes from las vegas have you ever heard of him confusion spread across her face no who is he hes a mobster mrs aliso and your husband knew him pretty well im afraid were going to las vegas now to get him if all goes well we will be coming back with him tomorrow then the case will proceed through the courts there will be a preliminary hearing in municipal court and then if goshen is bound over for trial as we assume he will be there will be a trial in los angeles superior court it is likely you will have to testify briefly during the trial testify for the prosecution she nodded her eyes far off why did he do it were not sure yet were working on that we do know that your husband was involved in business dealings with this mans uh employer a man named joseph marconi do you recall if your husband ever mentioned goshen or joseph marconi no what about the names lucky or joey marks she shook her head in the negative what business dealings she asked he was cleaning money for them washing it through his film business you sure you did not know anything about this of course not do i need my lawyer you know he already told me not to talk to you people bosch gave an easy smile and held his hands up no mrs aliso you dont need your lawyer were just trying to get to the facts of the case if you knew something about your husbands business dealings it might help us build a case against this man goshen and possibly his employer you see right now weve got this goshen character pretty well tied up for this were not sweating that weve got ballistics fingerprints hard evidence but he wouldnt have done what he did if joey marks didnt tell him to joey marks is who wed really like to get and the more information i have about your husband and his business the better the chance we have of getting to joey marks so if there is anything you can help us with now is the time to tell us he was silent and waited she looked down at the now folded piece of paper in her hand she finally nodded to herself and looked at him i know nothing about his business she said but there was a call last week it came here on wednesday night he took it in the office and closed the door buti went to the door and listened i could hear his side of it what did he say he called the caller lucky i know that he did a lot of listening and then he said hed be out there by the end of the week he then said hed see the caller at the club and that was it bosch nodded why didnt you tell us this before i didnt think it was important iyou see i thought he was talking to a woman the name lucky i thought it was a womans name was that why you were listening through the door she averted her eyes and nodded her head mrs aliso have you ever hired a private investigator to follow your husband no i thought about it but i didnt but you suspected he was having an affair affairs detective i not only suspected i knew a wife can tell okay mrs aliso do you remember anything else about the telephone conversation anything else that was said no just what i told you it might help us with the court case as far as questions of premeditation go if we could isolate this call are you sure it was wednesday yes because he left the next day what time did the call come in it was late we were watching the news on channel so it was after eleven and before eleventhirty i dont think i can narrow it down any further okay mrs aliso thats good bosch looked over at edgar and raised his eyebrows edgar just nodded he was ready to go they stood up and veronica aliso led them to the door oh bosch said before he got to the door there was a question that came up about your husband do you know did he have a regular doctor that he went to yes on occasion why well i wanted to check to see if he suffered from hemorrhoids she looked like she was about to laugh hemorrhoids i dont think so i think tony wouldve complained loud and often if he did really bosch was standing in the doorway now yes really besides you just told me that the autopsy was completed wouldnt that doctor be able to tell you the answer to that question bosch nodded she had him there i guess so mrs aliso the only reason i ask is that we found a tube of preparation h in his car i was wondering why it was there if you know he didnt need it she smiled this time oh thats an old performers trick a performers trick you know actresses models dancers they use that stuff bosch looked at her waiting for more she didnt say anything i dont get it he said why do they use it under their eyes detective bosch you know shrinks the swelling well you put it under your eyes and the bags from all that hard living get shrunk too probably half the people who buy that stuff in this town use it under their eyes not what its supposed to be used for my husbandhe was a vain man if he was going to las vegas to be with some young girl i think he would have done this it was just like him bosch nodded he thought of the unidentified substance under tony alisos eyes you learn something new every day he thought he would have to call salazar how do you think he would have known about that he asked she was about to answer but hesitated then she just hiked her shoulders its a notsosecret hollywood secret she said he couldve learned it anywhere including from you bosch thought but didnt say he just nodded and stepped through the door oh one last thing he said before she closed it this arrest is probably going to hit the media today or tomorrow well try to contain it as much as possible but in this town nothings ever sacred or secret for long you should be prepared for that thank you detective you might want to think about a small funeral something inside tell the director not to give information out over the phone funerals always make good video she nodded and closed the door on the way out of hidden highlands bosch lit a cigarette and edgar didnt object shes a cold piece of work edgar said that she is bosch answered what do you think of the phone call from lucky its just one more piece we got lucky by the balls as far as hes concerned its over bosch took mulholland along the crest of the mountains until it wound down to the hollywood freeway they passed without comment the fire road down which tony aliso had been found at the freeway bosch turned south so he could pick up the io in downtown and head east harry whats up edgar asked i thought we were leavin outta burbank were not flying were driving what are you talking about i only reserved the flights in case somebody checked when we get to vegas we let on that we flew in and that were flying out right after the hearing with goshen nobody has to know were driving you okay with that yeah sure fine i get it precautions settin a smoke screen in case somebody checks i can dig it you never know with the mobsters do you or with the cops part iv averaging over ninety miles an hour including a fifteenminute stop at a mcdonalds they got to las vegas in four hours they drove to mccarran international airport parked in the garage and took their briefcases and overnighters out of the trunk while edgar waited outside bosch went into the terminal and rented a car at the hertz counter it was almost fourthirty by the time they got to the metro building as they walked through the detective bureau bosch saw iverson sitting at his desk and talking to baxter who stood nearby a thin smile played on iversons face but bosch ignored it and went straight to feltons office the police captain was behind his desk doing paperwork bosch knocked on the open door and then entered bosch where ya been taking care of details this your prosecutor no this is my partner jerry edgar the prosecutor isnt coming out until the morning edgar and felton shook hands but felton continued to look at bosch well you can call him and tell him not to bother bosch looked at him a moment he knew now why iverson had smiled something was going on captain youre always full of surprises he said what is it this time felton leaned back in his chair he had an unlit cigar one end soggy with saliva on the edge of the desk he picked it up and clenched it between two fingers he was playing it out obviously trying to get a rise out of bosch but bosch didnt bite and the captain finally spoke your boy goshen is packing his bags hes waiving extradition yeah he got smart bosch took the chair in front of the desk and edgar took one to the right felton continued fired that mouthpiece mickey torrino and got his own guy not that much of an improvement but at least the new guys got luckys best interest in mind and how did he get smart bosch asked you tell him about the ballistics sure i told him brought him over told him the score i also told him how we broke his alibi down to shit bosch looked at him but didnt ask the question yeah thats right bosch we havent been exactly sitting over here on our asses we went to work on this guy and were helping to pound him into the ground for you he said he never left his office friday night until it was time to go home at four well we went over and checked that office out theres a back door he couldve come in and gone out nobody saw him from the time tony aliso left until four when he came out to close the club that gave him plenty of time to go out there take down tony and hop the last flight back and heres the kicker girl that works over there goes by the name of modesty she got into it with another dancer and went to the office to complain to lucky she said nobody answered when she knocked so she tells gussie she wants to see the boss and he tells her the boss aint in that was about midnight felton nodded and winked yeah and what did gussie say about that he isnt saying shit we dont expect him to but if he wants to get on the stand and back up luckys alibi you can tear him apart easy hes got a record goin back to the seventh grade all right never mind him what about goshen like i said we brought him over this morning and told him what we got and that he was running out of time right quick he had to make a decision and he made it he switched lawyers thats about as clear a sign as youre going to get hes ready to deal you ask me that means youll get him and joey marks a few of the other douche bags in town well take the biggest bite out of the outfit in ten years everybodys happy bosch stood up edgar followed suit this is the second time youve done this to me bosch said his voice measured and controlled youre not going to get a third where is he hey cool down bosch were all working for the same thing is he here or not hes in interview room three last i checked weiss was in there with him too alan weiss hes the new lawyer has goshen given you any statement no of course not weiss gave us the particulars no negotiating until you get him to la in other words hell waive and you take him home your people will have to work out the deal over there were out of it after today excepting when you come back to pick up joey marks well help with that ive been waiting for that day for a long time bosch left the office without further word he walked through the squad room without looking at iverson and made his way to the rear hallway that led to the interview rooms he lifted the flap that covered the doors small window and saw goshen in blue jail overalls sitting at the small table a much smaller man in a suit across from him bosch knocked on the glass waited a beat and opened the door counselor could we speak for a moment outside are you from la its about time lets talk outside as the lawyer got up bosch looked past him at goshen the big man was handcuffed to the table it was barely thirty hours since bosch had seen him last but luke goshen was a different man his shoulders seemed slumped as if he was closing in on himself his eyes had a hollow look the kind of stare that comes from a night of looking at the future he didnt look at bosch after weiss stepped out bosch closed the door weiss was about boschs age he was trim and deeply tanned bosch wasnt sure but thought he wore a hairpiece he wore glasses with thin gold frames in the few seconds he had to size the lawyer up bosch decided that goshen had probably done well for himself after introductions weiss immediately got down to business my client is willing to waive any challenge to extradition but detectives you need to act quickly mr goshen does not feel comfortable or safe in las vegas even in metro lockup my hope was that we would have been able to go before a judge today but its too late now but at nine am tomorrow ill be in court its already arranged with mr lipson the local prosecutor youll be able to take him to the airport by ten slow down a second counselor edgar said whats the hurry all of a sudden is it cause luke in there heard about the ballistics we got or because maybe joey marks has heard too and figures he better cut his losses i guess maybe its easier for joey to put the hit out on him in metro than all the way over in la right bosch added weiss looked at them as if they were some form of life he had not previously encountered mr goshen doesnt know anything about a hit and i hope that statement is just part of the usual intimidation tactics you employ what he does know is he is being set up to take the fall for a crime he did not commit and he feels the best way to handle this is to cooperate fully in a new environment someplace away from las vegas los angeles is his only choice can we talk to him now weiss shook his head mr goshen wont be saying a word until hes in los angeles my brother will take the case from there he has a practice there saul weiss you may have heard of him bosch had but shook his head in the negative i believe he has already contacted your mr gregson so you see detective youre just a courier here your job is to get mr goshen on a plane tomorrow morning and get him safely to los angeles it will most likely be out of your hands after that most likely not bosch said he stepped around the lawyer and opened the door to the interview room goshen looked up bosch stepped in and moved to the table he leaned over it and put his hands flat on the table before he could speak weiss had moved into the room and was talking luke dont say a word to this man dont say a word bosch ignored weiss and looked only at goshen all i want lucky is a show of faith you want me to take you to la get you there safe then give me something just answer one question where he has to take you anyway luke dont fall for this i cant represent you if you dont listen to me wheres layla bosch asked im not leaving vegas until i talk to her if you want to get out of here in the morning ive got to talk to her tonight shes not at her place i talked to her roommate pandora last night and she says laylas been gone a couple of days where is she goshen looked from bosch to weiss dont say a word weiss said detective if you step out id like to confer with my client i think actually that might be something i wont have a problem with him answering hope not bosch went back into the hallway with edgar he put a cigarette in his mouth but didnt light it whys layla so important edgar asked i dont like loose ends i want to know how she fits bosch didnt tell him that he knew from the illegal tapes that layla had called aliso and asked at goshens request when hed be coming out to vegas if they found her he would have to draw it out of her during the interview without giving away that he already knew it its also a test he did tell edgar to see how far we can get goshen to go with us the lawyer stepped out then and closed the door behind him if you try that again talking to him when i specifically said he would not respond then we will have no relationship whatsoever bosch felt like asking what relationship they already had but let it go is he going to tell us no i am he said that when this person layla first came to work at the club he gave her a ride home a few nights on one of those nights she asked him to drop her at a different place because she was trying to avoid somebody she was dating at the time and she thought he might be waiting at her apartment anyway it was a house in north las vegas she told him it was where she grew up he doesnt have the exact address but said the place was at the corner of donna street and lillis the northeast corner try there thats all he had bosch had his notebook out and wrote the street names down thank you counselor while you have the notebook out write down courtroom ten thats where we will be tomorrow at nine i trust you will make secure arrangements for my clients safe delivery thats what a courier is for right im sorry detective things are said in the heat of the moment no offense none taken bosch went out to the squad room and used the phone at an empty desk to call southwest and change the reservations on the return flight from three in the afternoon to a tenthirty morning flight bosch didnt look at iverson but could tell the detective was watching him from a desk fifteen feet away when he was done bosch stuck his head in feltons office the captain was on the phone bosch just mocksaluted him and was gone back in the rental car edgar and bosch decided to go over to the jail and make arrangements for the custody transfer before trying to find layla the jail was next to the courthouse a discharge sergeant named hackett gave the detectives a rudimentary rundown on how and where goshen would be delivered to them since it was after five and the shifts had changed bosch and edgar would be dealing with a different sergeant in the morning still it made bosch feel more comfortable seeing the routine ahead of time they would be able to put goshen into their car in an enclosed and safe loadingdock area he felt reasonably sure that there wouldnt be trouble at least not there with directions from hackett they drove into a middleclass neighborhood in north las vegas and found the house where goshen had once dropped layla off it was a small bungalowstyle house with an aluminum awning over each window there was a mazda rx parked in the carport an older woman answered the door she was midsixties and well preserved bosch thought he could see some of the photo of layla in her face bosch held his badge up so she could see it maam my name is harry bosch and this is jerry edgar were over from los angeles and we are looking for a young woman we need to talk to shes a dancer and goes by the name layla is she here she doesnt live here i dont know what youre talking about i think you do maam and id appreciate it if youd help us out i told you shes not here well we heard shes staying here with you is that right are you her mother shes tried to contact me theres no reason for her to be afraid or to not want to talk to us ill tell her that if i see her can we come in bosch put his hand on the door and firmly but slowly started to push it open before she could reply you cant just she didnt finish she knew what she was going to say would be meaningless in a perfect world the cops couldnt just push their way in she knew it wasnt a perfect world bosch looked around after he entered the furnishings were old having to last a few more years than they were intended to and she probably thought they would have to when she bought them it was the standard couch and matching chair setup there were patterned throws on each probably to cover the wear there was an old tv the kind with a dial to change the channels there were gossip magazines spread on a coffee table you live here alone he asked yes i do she said indignantly as if his question was an insult when was the last time you saw layla her names not layla that was my next question what is her name her names gretchen alexander and you are dorothy alexander where is she dorothy i dont know and i didnt ask whend she leave yesterday morning bosch nodded to edgar and he took a step back turned and headed down a hallway leading to the rear of the house wheres he going the woman asked hes just going to take a look around thats all bosch said sit down here and talk to me dorothy faster we get this over with the faster were out of here he pointed to the chair and remained standing until she finally sat he then moved around the coffee table and sat on the couch its springs were shot he sank so low in it that he had to lean forward and even then it felt like his knees were halfway up to his chest he got out his notebook i dont like him messing around in my things dorothy said looking back over her shoulder toward the hallway hell be careful bosch took out his notebook you seemed to know we were coming howd you know that i know what she told me is all she said the police might come she didnt say anything about them coming all the way from los angeles she said angeles with a hard g and you know why were here because of tony she said he went and got himself killed over there where did gretchen go dorothy she did not tell me you can ask me all the times you like but my answers always going to be the same i dont know is that her sports car in the carport sure is she bought it with her own money stripping i always said money was the same whether it was made one way or the next edgar came in then and looked at bosch harry nodded for him to report looks like she was here theres a second bedroom ashtray on the nightstands full theres a space on the rod in the closet where it looks like somebody had hung up some clothes theyre gone now she left this he held his hand out and cradled in his palm was a small oval picture frame with a photograph of tony aliso and gretchen alexander they had their arms around each other and were smiling at the camera bosch nodded and looked back at dorothy alexander if she left whyd she leave her car here dont know a taxi came for her did she fly how could i know that if i dont know where she was going bosch pointed a finger at her like a gun good point did she say when shed be back no how old is gretchen shell be twentythree howd she take the news about tony not well she was in love and now her hearts broken im worried about her you think she might do something to hurt herself i dont know what she might do did she tell you she was in love or did you just think that i just didnt think it up she told me she confided in me and it was the truth she said they were going to get married did she know tony aliso was already married yes she knew but he told her he said that it was over and it was just a matter of time bosch nodded he wondered if it was the truth not the truth that gretchen might have believed but the truth that tony aliso believed he looked down at the blank page of his notebook im trying to think if there is anything else he said jerry edgar shook his head then spoke i guess id just like to know why a mother would let her daughter do that for a living taking her clothes off like that jerry i she has a talent mister men came from all over the country and when they see her they keep coming back because of her and im not her mother i might as well have been her own went and left her with me a long time ago but she has a talent and im not talking to you two anymore get out of my house she stood up as if ready to physically enforce her edict if she needed to bosch decided to let her have her say and stood up putting his notebook away im sorry for the intrusion he said as he dug a business card out of his wallet if you hear from her would you give her this number and tonight she can get me at the mirage again ill tell her if i hear from her she took the card and followed them to the door on the front step bosch looked back at her and nodded thanks mrs alexander for what they were quiet for a while driving back to the strip eventually bosch asked edgar what he thought of the interview shes a crusty old bitch i had to ask that question just to see how shed react other than that i think this layla or gretchen is just a dead end just some stupid girl tony was leading on you know its usually the strippers that are working the angles but this time i think it was tony maybe bosch lit a cigarette and dropped back into silence he was no longer thinking of the interview as far as he was concerned the work for the day was over and he was now thinking about eleanor wish when he got to the mirage bosch swung the car into the circle in front and pulled to a stop near the front doors harry man what are you doing edgar said bullets might pop for the mirage but she isnt going to dig into the company wallet for valet parking im just dropping you off im going to go switch the cars tonight i dont want to go anywhere near that airport tomorrow thats cool but ill go with you man nothin to do here but lose money on the machines bosch reached over and opened the glove box and pushed the trunkrelease button no jed im going on my own i want to think about some things grab your stuff outta the trunk edgar looked at him a long moment bosch had not called him jed in a long time edgar was about to say something but apparently thought better of it he opened the door okay harry you want to grab dinner or something later yeah maybe ill call you in your room youre the man after edgar slammed the trunk bosch drove back out onto las vegas boulevard and then north to sands it was dusk and the days dying light was being replaced with the neon glow of the city in ten minutes he pulled into a parking space in front of eleanor wishs apartment building he took a deep breath and got out of the car he had to know why had she not answered his calls why had she not responded to his message when he got to the door he felt his guts seize as if gripped in a huge fist the note he had carefully folded and squeezed into the doorjamb two nights before was still there bosch looked down at the worn doormat and then squeezed his eyes shut he felt a tremendous wave of the guilt he had worked so hard to bury come forth from inside he had once made a phone call that got an innocent man killed it had been a mistake something he could not possibly have seen coming but it happened just the same and he had worked hard to put it not behind him but at least in a place where he could live with it but now eleanor bosch knew what he would find behind the door asking felton for her number and address had sent things into motion a terrible motion that ended with her being hauled into metro and her fragile dignity and belief that bad things were behind her being crushed bosch kicked over the doormat on the off chance she had left a key there was none his lock picks were in the glove compartment of the car parked at the airport he hesitated a moment focused on a spot over the doorknob then stepped back raised his left leg and drove his heel into the door it splintered along the jamb and flew open bosch slowly stepped into the apartment he noticed nothing amiss in the living room he moved quickly into the hallway and then down into the bedroom the bed was unmade and empty bosch stood there for a moment taking it all in he realized he hadnt taken a breath since he had kicked in the door he slowly exhaled and began breathing normally she was alive somewhere at least he thought so he sat down on the bed took out a cigarette and lit it his feeling of relief was quickly crowded by other doubts and nagging questions why hadnt she called hadnt there been something real about what they had shared hello a mans voice came from the front of the apartment bosch assumed it was someone who had heard him pop the door he stood up and headed out of the bedroom yeah he said im back here im with the police he stepped into the living room and saw a man impeccably dressed in a black suit with a white shirt and black tie it wasnt what bosch expected detective bosch bosch tensed and didnt answer theres someone outside who would like to talk to you who hell tell you who he is and what his business is the man walked out the front door leaving it up to bosch whether to follow he hesitated a moment and did there was a stretch limousine in the parking lot its engine running the man in the black suit walked around and got into the drivers seat bosch watched this for a moment and then walked toward the limo he brought his arm up instinctively and brushed it against his coat until he felt the reassuring shape of his gun beneath it as he did this the rear door closest to him opened and a man with a rough dark face beckoned to him bosch showed no hesitation it was too late now bosch ducked into the big car and took a seat facing the rear there were two men sitting on the plushly padded backseat one was the roughfaced man who was casually dressed and slouching in his luxurious spot and the other an older man in an expensive threepiece suit the tie pulled tight to his neck sitting between the two men on a padded armrest was a small black box with a green light glowing on it bosch had seen such a box before it detected electronic radio waves emitted by eavesdropping devices as long as that green light glowed they could talk and be reasonably assured they wouldnt be overheard and recorded detective bosch the roughfaced man said joey marks i presume my name is joseph marconi what can i do for you mr marconi i thought wed have a little conversation thats all you me and my attorney here mr torrino the other man nodded heard you lost a client today thats what we want to talk to you about marconi said weve got a problem here we how did you know where i was ive had some fellows watching it for me we kind of figured youd be back once you left that note especially they had obviously followed him and he wondered when that had started his mind then jumped to another conclusion and he suddenly knew what the meeting was all about wheres eleanor wish eleanor wish marconi looked at torrino and then back at bosch i dont know her but i suppose shell turn up what do you want marconi i just wanted this chance to talk thats all just a little calm conversation weve got a problem here and maybe we can work it out i want to work with you detective bosch do you want to work with me like i said what do you want what i want is to straighten this out before it gets too far out of hand you are going down the wrong road here detective you are a good man i had you checked out youve got ethics and i appreciate that whatever you do in life you need a code of ethics you have that but you are on the wrong road here tony aliso i had nothing to do with that bosch smirked and shook his head look marconi i dont want your alibi im sure its airtight but i could care less you can still pull a trigger from three hundred fifty miles away its been done from farther away know what i mean detective bosch there is something wrong here whatever that rat bastard is telling you its a lie im clean on tony a my people are clean on tony a and im simply giving you this opportunity to make it right yeah and how do i do that just kick lucky loose so you can pick him up outside the jail in your limo here take him for a ride out into the desert think well ever see lucky again you think youll ever see that lady exfbi agent again bosch stared at him a moment letting his anger build up until he felt a slight tremor tick in his neck then in one quick move he pulled his gun and leaned across the space between the seats he grabbed the thick gold braided chain around marconis neck and jerked him forward he pressed the barrel deep into marconis cheek excuse me easy now detective bosch torrino said then you dont want to do something rash he put a hand on boschs arm take your hand off me you asshole torrino removed his hand and raised it along with his other one in a surrendering gesture i just want to calm things down a little here thats all bosch leaned back into his seat but kept his gun in his hand the muzzle had left a ring of skin indentation and gun oil on marconis cheek he wiped it away with his hand where is she marconi i just heard she wanted to get away for a few days bosch no need to overreact like that were friends here shell be back in fact now that i know youre so uh attached to her ill personally guarantee shell be back in exchange for what hackett was still on duty at the metro jail bosch told him he had to talk to goshen for a couple of minutes in regard to a security issue hackett hemmed and hawed about it being against regulations to set up an afterhours visit but bosch knew it was done on occasion for the locals against the rules or not eventually hackett gave way and took bosch to a room lawyers used to interview clients and told him to wait ten minutes later hackett waltzed goshen into the room and cuffed one wrist to the chair he was placed in hackett then folded his arms and stood behind the suspect sergeant i need to talk to him alone cant do it its a security issue were not going to talk anyway goshen interjected sergeant bosch said what i tell this man whether he chooses to talk to me or not could put you in danger if it becomes known you have this knowledge know what i mean why add that potential danger to your list five minutes its all i want hackett thought a moment and without a word left them alone pretty smooth bosch but im not talking to you weiss said you might try a backdoor run he said youd want to try to get into the candy jar before its time im not playing with you get me to la sit me in front of the people who can deal and then well deal everybody will get what they want then shut up and listen you stupid fuck i dont give a shit about any deal anymore the only deal im worried about now is whether to keep you alive or not bosch saw he had his attention now he waited a few moments to turn the squeeze up and then began goshen let me explain something to you in all of las vegas there is exactly one person i care about one you take her out of the picture and the whole place could dry up and blow away and i really wouldnt worry about it but theres that one person i care about and out of all the people in this place shes the one that your employer decides to grab and hold against me goshens eyes narrowed in concern bosch was talking about his people goshen knew exactly what was coming so the deal im talking about is this bosch said you for her joey marks said if you never get to la then my friend comes back and vice versa you understand what im telling you goshen looked down at the table and slowly nodded do you bosch pulled his gun and pointed it three inches from the big mans face goshen went crosseyed looking at the barrels black hole i could blow your shit away right here hackett would come in here and id tell him you made a move for my gun hed go along he set the meeting up here its against the rules hed have to go along bosch withdrew the gun or tomorrow this is how it goes tomorrow at the airport were waiting for our flight theres a commotion over at the machines somebodys won a big fucking jackpot and my partner and i make the mistake of looking over there meantime somebodymaybe its your pal gussieputs a sixinch stiletto in your neck end of you my friend comes home what do you want bosch bosch leaned across to him i want you to give me the reason not to do it i dont give a shit about you goshen dead or alive but im not going to let any harm befall her ive made mistakes in my life man i once got somebody killed that shouldnt have been killed you understand that its not going to happen again this is redemption goshen and if i have to give a piece of shit like you up to get it ill do it theres only one alternative you know joey marks where would he have her oh jesus i dont know goshen rubbed a hand over his scalp think goshen hes done this kind of thing before its routine for you people where would he hold somebody he doesnt want anyone to find there wastheres a couple of safe houses he uses hed uhi think for this hed use the samoans who are they these two big fuckers he uses samoans theyre brothers their names are too hard to say we call them tom and jerry theyve got one of the safe houses joey would use their place for this the other place is mostly for counting cash putting up people from chicago where is the house with the samoans its in north vegas not too far from dollys actually on a piece of notebook paper bosch gave him goshen drew a crude map with directions to the house youve been there goshen a few times bosch turned the piece of paper over on the table draw the layout of the house bosch pulled the dusty detective car he had picked up at the airport into the valet circle at the mirage and jumped out a valet approached but bosch walked past him sir your keys ill only be a minute the valet was protesting that he couldnt just leave the car there when bosch disappeared through the revolving door as he crossed through the casino toward the lobby bosch scanned the players for edgar his eyes stopping on every tall black man of whom there were few he didnt see edgar on a house phone in the lobby he asked for edgars room and then breathed an almost audible sigh of relief when his partner picked up the phone jerry its bosch i need your help whats up meet me out front at the valet now i just got room service when you didnt call i right now jerry and did you bring your vest from la my vest yeah whats bring your vest with you bosch hung up before edgar could ask any questions as he turned to head back to the car he came face to face with someone he knew at first because the man was well dressed bosch thought it was one of joey markss men but then he placed him hank meyer mirage security detective bosch i didnt expect to see you here just got in tonight came to pick somebody up you got your man then we think so congratulations listen hank i gotta go ive got a car blocking traffic in the front circle oh thats your car i just heard that on the security radio yes please move it ill talk to you later bosch made a move to pass him oh detective just wanted you to know we still havent had that betting slip come in bosch stopped what you asked if wed check to see if anyone cashed the bet your victim put down friday night on the dodgers oh yeah right well we went through the computer tapes and located the sequence number i then checked the number on the computer no one has collected on it yet okay thanks i called your office today to let you know but you werent there i didnt know you were coming here well keep an eye out for it thanks hank i gotta go bosch started walking away but meyer kept talking no problem thank you we look forward to opportunities to cooperate with and hopefully help our law enforcement brethren meyer smiled broadly bosch looked back at him and felt like he had a weight tied to his leg he couldnt get away from him bosch just nodded and kept going trying to remember the last time he had heard the phrase law enforcement brethren he was almost across the lobby when he glanced back and saw that meyer was still behind him one more thing detective bosch bosch stopped but lost his patience hank what ive got to get out of here it will just take a second a favor i assume your department will go to the press with this arrest id appreciate it if you kept any mention of the mirage out of it even our help if you dont mind no problem i wont say a word talk to you later hank bosch turned and walked away it was unlikely the mirage would have been mentioned in any press release anyway but he understood the concern guilt by association meyer was mixing public relations with casino security or maybe they were the same thing bosch got to the car just as edgar came out carrying his bulletproof vest in his hand the valet looked at bosch balefully bosch took out a five and handed it to him it didnt do much to change his disposition then bosch and edgar jumped in the car and took off the safe house goshen told bosch about looked deserted when they drove by bosch pulled the car to a stop a half block away i still dont know about this harry edgar said we should be calling in metro i told you we cant marks has to have somebody inside metro or else he wouldnt have known to snatch her in the first place so we call metro he finds out and shes dead or moved somewhere else before metro even makes a move so we go in and we call metro afterward if there is an afterward just what the hell are we going to do go in blasting this is cowboy shit harry no all youre going to do is get behind the wheel turn the car around and be ready to drive we might have to leave in a hurry bosch had hoped to use edgar as a backup but after hed told him the situation on the way over it was clear that edgar wasnt going to be solid bosch went to plan b where edgar was simply a wheel man bosch opened his door and looked back at edgar before getting out youre going to be here right ill be here just dont get killed i dont want to have to explain it yeah ill do my best let me borrow your cuffs and pop the trunk bosch put edgars cuffs into his coat pocket and went to the trunk at the trunk he took out his vest and put it on over his shirt and then put his coat back on to hide his holster he pulled up the trunk liner and lifted up the spare tire below it was a glock pistol wrapped in an oily rag bosch popped the clip on it checked the top bullet for corrosion and then put the weapon back together he put it in his belt if there was going to be any shooting on this mission he wasnt going to use his service gun he came up alongside the drivers window saluted edgar and headed down the street the safe house was a small concreteblockandplaster affair that blended in with the neighborhood after jumping a threefoot fence bosch took the gun from his belt and held it at his side as he walked along the side of the house he saw no light emitted from any of the front or side windows but he could hear the muffled sound of television she was here he could feel it he knew goshen had told the truth when he got to the rear corner he saw there was a pool in the backyard as well as a covered porch there was a concrete slab with a satellite dish anchored to it the modern mafia crash pad bosch thought you never knew how long youd have to hole up so it was good to have five hundred channels the backyard was empty but as bosch turned the corner he saw a lighted window he crept down the back of the house until he was close the blinds were drawn on the window but by getting close and looking between the cracks he could see them in there two huge men he immediately assumed were the samoans and eleanor the samoans sat on a couch in front of a television eleanor sat on a kitchen chair next to the couch one wrist and one ankle were handcuffed to the chair because the shade of a floor lamp was in the way he could not see her face but he recognized her clothes as those she had worn on the day they had dragged her into metro the three of them were sitting there watching a rerun of a mary tyler moore show bosch felt the anger building in his throat bosch crouched down and tried to think of a way to get her out of there he leaned his back against the wall and looked across the yard and the shimmering pool he got an idea after taking one more glimpse through the blinds and seeing that no one had moved bosch went back to the corner of the house to the slab where the satellite dish sat he put his gun back in his belt studied the equipment for a few moments and then simply used two hands to turn the dish out of alignment and point its focus toward the ground it took about five minutes bosch figured most of this must have been spent with one or the other of the samoans fiddling with the tv and trying to get the picture back finally an outdoor floodlight came on the back door opened and one of them stepped out onto the porch he wore a hawaiian shirt as big as a tent and had long dark hair that flowed over his shoulders when the big man got to the dish he clearly wasnt sure how to proceed he looked at it for a long moment then came around to the other side to see if this afforded him a better angle he now had his back to bosch bosch stepped away from the corner of the house and came up behind the man he placed the muzzle of the glock against the small of the mans back though even the small of his back wasnt small dont move big man he said in a low calm voice dont say a word less you want to spend the rest of your life in a wheelchair with your piss sloshing around in a bag bosch waited the man did not move and said nothing which are you tom or jerry im jerry okay jerry were going to walk over to the porch lets go they moved to one of two steel support beams that held up the porch roof bosch kept the gun pressed against the mans shirt the whole time he then reached into his pocket and pulled out edgars cuffs he handed them around the girth of the man and held them up okay take em cuff yourself around the beam he waited until he heard both cuffs click then came around and checked them clicking them tightly around the mans thick wrists okay thats good jerry now do you want me to kill your brother i mean i could just walk in there and waste him and get the girl thats the easy way you want me to do it that way no then do exactly what i tell you if you fuck up he dies then you die cause i cant afford to leave a witness got it yes okay without saying his name because i dont trust you just call to him and ask if the pictures back on the tv when he says no tell him to come out here and help tell him shell be fine shes handcuffed do it right jerry and everybody lives do it wrong and some people arent going to make it what do i call him how bout hey bro that oughta work jerry did as he was told and did it right after some backandforth banter the brother stepped out onto the porch where he saw jerry with his back to him just as he realized something wasnt right bosch came from the blind spot to his right rear and put the gun on him using his own cuffs this time he locked the second brother who he guessed was slightly larger than the first and had on a louder shirt to the porchs other support beam okay take five boys ill be back in a minute oh who has the key to the cuffs on the woman they both said he does thats not smart guys i dont want to hurt anybody now who has the cuff key i do the voice came from behind him from the porch door bosch froze slowly bosch toss the gun into the pool and turn around real slow like bosch did what he was told and turned around it was gussie and bosch could see the delight and hate in his eyes even in the dark he stepped onto the porch and bosch could see the shape of a gun in his right hand bosch immediately became angry with himself for not casing the house further or even asking jerry if there was anyone other than his brother and eleanor in the house gussie raised the gun and pressed its barrel against boschs left cheek just below the eye see how it feels been talking to the boss huh thats right and were not stupid man youre stupid we knew you might try something like this now we gotta call him and see what he wants to do but first off what youre gonna do is unhook tom and jerry right the fuck now sure gussie bosch was contemplating reaching into his coat and going for his other gun but knew it was suicide as long as gussie held his gun at pointblank range he started slowly reaching into his pocket for his keys when he saw the movement to his left and heard the shout freeze it up asshole it was edgar gussie didnt move an inch after a few moments of this standoff bosch reached into his coat pulled his own gun and pushed the muzzle up into gussies neck they stood there staring at each other for a long moment what do you think bosch finally said you want to try it see if we both get one off gussie said nothing and edgar moved in he put the muzzle of his gun against gussies temple a smile broke across boschs face and he reached up and took gussies gun from him and threw it into the pool i didnt think so he looked over at edgar and nodded his thanks you got him ill go get her i got him harry and im hoping he does something stupid the big fat fuck bosch checked gussie for another weapon and found none wheres the cuff key he asked fuck you remember the other night gussie you want a repeat performance tell me where the fucking key is bosch figured his own cuff key would fit but he wanted to make sure he got one away from gussie the big man finally blew out his breath and told bosch the key was on the kitchen counter bosch went inside the house his gun out his eyes scanning for more surprises there was nobody he grabbed the cuff key off the kitchen counter and went into the back den where eleanor was when he stepped into the room and her eyes rose to his he saw something that he knew he would always cherish it wasnt something he believed he could ever put into words the giving way of fear the knowledge of safety maybe thanks maybe that was how people looked at heroes he thought he rushed to her and knelt in front of her chair so that he could unlock the cuffs you okay eleanor yes yes im fine i knew harry i knew you would come he had the cuffs off and he just looked up at her face he nodded and pulled her into a quick hug we gotta go they went out the back where the scene did not look as if it had changed at all jerry you got him im going to find a phone and call felton i got no eleanor said dont call them i dont want that bosch looked at her eleanor what are you talking about these guys they abducted you if we hadnt come here theres a good chance they wouldve taken you out into the desert tomorrow and planted you i dont want the cops i dont want to go through all of that i just want this to end bosch looked at her a long moment jerry you got him he asked i got him bosch went to eleanor and grabbed her arm and led her back into the house when they were in the alcove by the kitchen and far enough away that the men outside could not hear them he stopped and looked at her eleanor whats going on nothing i just dont want did they hurt you no im did they rape you tell me the truth no harry it is nothing like that i just want this to end here listen to me we can take down marks his lawyer and those three assholes out on the porch thats why im here marks told me he had you dont kid yourself harry you cant touch marks on this what did he really tell you and whos your witness going to be me look at me im a convicted felon harry not only that i used to be one of the good guys just think what a mob lawyer can do with that bosch didnt say anything he knew she was right well im not going to put myself through that she said i got a dose of reality when they jerked me out of my home and took me down to metro im not going to go to bat for them on this now can you get me out of here as long as you are sure you cant change your mind once were out of here im as sure as ill ever be bosch nodded and led her out to the porch its your lucky day boys he said to the three thugs then to edgar he said were pulling out of here well talk about it later edgar just nodded bosch went one by one to the samoans and put their own cuffs on their wrists and then took off the others when he was done he held the key up in front of the smaller of the two giants and then tossed it into the pool he went over to the fence that ran behind the pool and took down a long pole with a net attached to the end of it he fished his gun off the bottom and handed it to eleanor to hold he then returned to gussie who was dressed completely in black edgar was still standing to his right holding the gun against his temple almost didnt recognize you without the tux gussie will you give joey marks a message yeah what fuck you just tell him that hes not going to like that i dont really care hes lucky i dont leave him three bodies here as a message bosch looked over at eleanor anything you want to say or do she shook her head then were outta here only thing is gussie were one set of cuffs short thats too bad for you theres rope in the bosch hit him on the bridge of the nose with the butt end of his gun crushing whatever bone had not been broken in their earlier scuffle gussie dropped heavily to his knees then pitched forward his face making a thud on the porch tile harry jesus it was edgar he looked shocked by the sudden violence bosch just looked at him a moment and said lets go when they got to eleanors apartment bosch backed the car up nearly to the door and popped the trunk we dont have a lot of time he said jerry you stay out here watch for anybody coming eleanor you can fill the trunk with whatever you can fit in there thats about all you can take she nodded she understood las vegas was over for her she could no longer stay not with what had happened bosch wondered if she also understood that it was all because of him her life would still be as it had been if he had not wanted to reach out to her they all got out of the car and bosch followed eleanor into the apartment she studied the broken door for a moment until he told her he had done it why because when i didnt hear from you i thoughti thought something else she nodded again she understood that too theres not a lot she said looking around the place most of this stuff i dont care about i probably wont even need the whole trunk she went into the bedroom took an old suitcase out of the closet and started filling it with clothes when it was full bosch took it out and put in the trunk when he came back in she was filling a box from the closet with her remaining clothes and other personal belongings he saw her put a photo album in the box and then she went to the bathroom to clear the medicine cabinet in the kitchen all she took was a wine bottle opener and a coffee mug with a picture of the mirage hotel on it bought this the night i won four hundred sixtythree dollars there she said i was playing the big table and i was way in over my head but i won i want to remember that she put that in the top of the full box and said thats it thats all i have to show for my life bosch studied her a moment and then took the box out to the car he struggled a bit getting it to fit in next to the suitcase when he was done he turned around to call to eleanor that they must go and she was already standing there holding the framed print of the nighthawks the edward hopper painting she was holding it in front of her like a shield will this fit sure well make it fit at the mirage bosch pulled into the valet circle again and saw the chief valet frown as he recognized the car bosch got out showed the man his badge quickly so that he might not notice it wasnt a metro badge and gave him twenty dollars police business ill be twentythirty minutes tops i need the car here because when we leave were going to have to really book the man looked at the twenty in his hand as if it were human feces bosch reached into his pocket pulled out another twenty and gave it to him okay okay leave me the keys no no keys nobody touches the car bosch had to take the picture out of the trunk to get to eleanors suitcase and a gun kit he kept there he then repacked the trunk and lugged the suitcase inside waving off an offer of help from a doorman in the lobby he put the case down and looked at edgar jerry thanks a lot he said you were there man eleanors going to change and then im going to shoot her out to the airport i probably wont be back until late so lets just meet here at eight oclock tomorrow and well go to court sure you dont need me for the airport run no i think were fine marks wont try anything now and if were lucky gussie wont be waking up for another hour or so anyway im going to go check in he left eleanor there with him and went to the desk there was no wait it was late after giving the clerk his credit card he looked back at eleanor saying her goodbye to edgar he put out his hand and she shook it but then she pulled him into an embrace edgar disappeared into the crowd of the casino eleanor waited until they were in his room before she spoke why am i going to the airport tonight you said you doubted they would do anything because i want to make sure youre safe and tomorrow i wont be able to worry about it ive got court in the morning and then im driving goshen to la i have to know youre safe where am i going to go you could go to a hotel but i think my place would be better safer you remember where it is yes up off mulholland yeah woodrow wilson drive ill give you the key take a cab from the airport and ill be there by tomorrow night then what i dont know well figure it out she sat down on the edge of the bed and bosch came around and sat next to her he put his arms around her shoulders i dont know if i could live in la again well figure it out he leaned in and kissed her on the cheek dont kiss me i need to take a shower he kissed her again and then pulled her back onto the bed they made love differently this time they were more tender slower they found each others rhythm afterward bosch took the first shower and then while eleanor bathed he used oil and a rag from his gun kit to clean the glock that had been thrown into the pool he worked the action and trigger several times to make sure the weapon was working properly then he filled the clip with fresh ammunition he went to the closet and took a plastic laundry bag off the shelf put the gun inside it and shoved it beneath a stack of clothes in eleanors suitcase after her shower eleanor dressed in a yellow cotton summer dress and twined her hair into a french braid bosch liked watching her do it with such skill when she was ready he closed the suitcase and they left the room the head valet came up to bosch as he was putting the suitcase into the trunk next time thirty minutes is thirty minutes not an hour sorry bout that sorry doesnt cut it i couldve lost my job man bosch ignored him and got in the car on the way to the airport he tried to compose his thoughts into articulate sentences that he could recite to her but it wasnt working his emotions were too much of a jumble eleanor he finally said everything thats happened its my fault and i want to try to make it up to you she reached over and put her hand on his thigh he put his hand on top of hers she didnt say anything at the airport bosch parked in front of the southwest terminal and got her suitcase out of the trunk he locked his own gun and badge in the trunk so he could go through the airports metal detector without a problem there was one last flight to la leaving in twenty minutes bosch bought her a ticket and checked her bag the gun would cause no problem as long as the bag was checked he then escorted her to the terminal where there was already a line of people making their way down the jetway bosch took the key to his house off his keychain gave it to her and told her the exact address its not the same as you might remember it he said the old place got wrecked in the earthquake its been rebuilt and its not all the way done but it will be all right the sheets uh i probably shouldve washed them a few days ago but didnt have time theres fresh ones in the hallway closet she smiled dont worry ill figure everything out uh listen like i said before i dont think that youve got anything to worry about anymore but just in case youve got the glock in your suitcase thats why i checked it you cleaned it while i was in the shower didnt you i thought i smelled the oil when i came out he nodded thanks but i dont think ill need it anyway probably not she looked over at the line the last people were boarding she had to go youre being very good to me harry thank you he frowned not good enough not enough to make up for everything she went up on her toes and kissed him on the cheek goodbye harry goodbye eleanor he watched her hand in her ticket and go through the door to the jetway she didnt look back and there was a whisper in the back of his mind telling him he might never see her again but he shut it off and walked back through the nearly deserted airport most of the slot machines stood mute and ignored bosch felt a deep sense of loneliness engulf him the only hitch in thursday mornings court proceedings occurred before they started when weiss came out of lockup after conferring with his client and quickly went into the hall to find bosch and edgar conferring with lipson the local prosecutor who would handle the extradition hearing gregson had not made the trip from the la county das office weiss and lipson had given him their assurances that luke goshen was going to waive any objection to being brought back to california detective bosch weiss said i was just in with my client and he asked me to get him some information before the hearing he said he wanted an answer before he gave any waiver i dont know what its about but i hope you havent been in contact with my client bosch put a concerned yet puzzled look on his face whats he want to know he just wanted to know how last night worked out whatever that means id like to know what is going on here just tell him everything is fine what is fine detective if your client wants to tell you he can tell you just deliver the message weiss stalked away heading back toward the lockup door bosch looked at his watch it was five till nine and he figured the judge wouldnt come out to the bench at the crack of nine none of them ever did he reached into his pocket for his cigarettes im going outside to have a smoke he told edgar bosch took the elevator down and went out to the front of the courthouse to have his cigarette it was warm out and he thought the day would probably be another scorcher with las vegas in september it was pretty much guaranteed he was glad hed be leaving soon but he knew the ride through the desert during the heat of the day would be rough he didnt notice mickey torrino until the lawyer was a few feet away from him he too was smoking a cigarette before going in to handle the days business of mobrelated legal work bosch nodded his greeting as did torrino i guess you heard by now no deal torrino looked around to see if they were being watched i dont know what youre talking about detective yeah i know you guys never know anything i do know one thing and thats that you are making a mistake on this one in case you care about things like that i dont think so at least not in the big picture we might not have the real shooter but we have the guy who set it up and were going to get the guy who ordered it who knows maybe well get the whole crew who you going to work for then counselor that is if we dont get you too torrino smirked and shook his head as if he were dealing with a foolish child you dont know what youre dealing with here its not going to play youll be lucky if you get to keep goshen at best youve got only him thats all you know lucky keeps making noises about being set up he of course thinks its us putting him in the frame and i know thats bullshit but i keep thinking what if there is a frame i mean i have to admit that him keeping that gun is hard to figure though ive seen even dumber moves in my time but if there is a frame and we didnt do it who did why would joey marks frame his own guy when that guys just going to roll over and put the finger back on joey doesnt make sense at least from joeys point of view but then i started thinking what if you were joeys righthand man say his lawyer and you wanted to be the big shot the one who makes the calls see what im talking about here thisd be a nice little way of getting rid of your nearest competitor and joey at the same time how would that play counselor if you ever repeat that bullshit story to anyone you will be very very sorry bosch took a step toward him so that their faces were only a foot apart if you ever threaten me again you will be very very sorry if anything ever happens to eleanor wish again i will hold you personally responsible asshole and sorry is not the right word for how you will be then torrino stepped back loser in the staring contest without another word he walked away from bosch and toward the courthouse doors as he opened the heavy glass door he looked back at bosch then disappeared inside when bosch got back to the third floor he met edgar as he was coming quickly out of the courtroom followed by weiss and lipson bosch looked at the hallway clock it was five after nine harry whereya been smokin a whole pack edgar asked what happened its over he waived weve got to bring the car around and get over to the release desk well have him in fifteen minutes detectives weiss said i want to know every detail of how my client will be moved and what security measures youre taking bosch put his arm on weisss shoulders and leaned into him in a confidential manner they had stopped at the bank of elevators the very first security measure we are taking is that we arent telling anyone how or when were getting back to la that includes you mr weiss all you need to know is that hell be in la municipal court for arraignment tomorrow morning wait a minute you cant yes we can mr weiss edgar said as an elevator opened your client waived his opposition to extradition and in fifteen minutes hell be in our custody and were not going to divulge any information about security here or there or on the way there now if youll excuse us they left him there and loaded onto the elevator as the doors closed weiss shouted something about them not being allowed to talk to his client until his los angeles counsel had met with him a half hour later the strip was in the rearview mirror and they were driving into the open desert say goodbye lucky bosch said you wont be back when goshen didnt say anything bosch checked him in the mirror the big man was sitting sullenly in the back with his arms cuffed to a heavy chain that went around his waist he returned boschs stare and for a brief moment bosch thought he saw the same look he had let loose for a moment in his bedroom before he managed to drag it back inside like a naughty child just drive he said after he had recovered his demeanor were not having a conversation here bosch looked back at the road ahead and smiled maybe not now but we will well be talking part v as bosch and edgar were leaving the mens central jail in downtown los angeles boschs pager sounded and he checked the number he didnt recognize it but the exchange told him the person paging him was in parker center he took the phone out of his briefcase and returned the call lieutenant billets answered detective where are you her use of his rank instead of his name told him she probably wasnt alone the fact that she was calling from parker center rather than the bureau in hollywood told him that something had gone wrong at mens central whats up do you have luke goshen with you no we just dropped him off why what is it give me the booking number bosch hesitated a moment but then held the phone under his chin while he reopened his briefcase and got the number from the booking receipt he gave billets the number and once again asked what was going on she once again ignored the question detective she said i want you to come over to parker right away the sixthfloor conference room the sixth floor was administration level it was also where the internal affairs offices were bosch hesitated again before finally answering sure grace you want jerry too tell detective edgar to go back to hollywood division ill contact him there weve only got the one car then tell him to take a cab and put it on his expense account hurry it up detective we are waiting for you here we whos waiting she hung up then and bosch just stared at the phone for a moment what is it edgar asked i dont know bosch stepped off the elevator into the deserted sixthfloor hallway and proceeded toward the conference room he knew was behind the last door before the entrance to the police chiefs office at the end of the hall the yellowed linoleum had been recently polished as he walked toward his destiny with his head down he saw his own dark reflection moving just in front of his steps the door to the conference room was open and as bosch stepped in all eyes in the room were on him he looked back at lieutenant billets and captain levalley from the hollywood division and the recognizable faces of deputy chief irvin irving and an iad squint named chastain but the four remaining men gathered in chairs around the long conference table were strangers to bosch nevertheless he guessed from their conservative gray suits that they were feds detective bosch have a seat irving said irving stood up ramrod straight in a tight uniform the dome of his shaven head shone under the ceiling fluorescents he motioned to the empty seat at the head of the table bosch pulled the chair out and sat down slowly as his mind raced he knew that this kind of showing of brass and feds was too big to have been caused by his affair with eleanor wish there was something else going on and it involved only him otherwise billets would have told him to bring edgar along who died bosch asked irving ignored the question when boschs eyes traveled across the table to his left and up to billetss face the lieutenant glanced away detective we need to ask you some questions pertaining to your investigation of the aliso case irving said what are the charges bosch responded there are no charges irving replied calmly we need to clear some things up who are these people irving introduced the four strangers bosch had been right they were feds john samuels an assistant us attorney assigned to the organized crime strike force and three fbi agents from three different field offices they were john ogrady from la dan ekeblad from las vegas and wendell werris from chicago nobody offered to shake boschs hand nobody even nodded they just stared at bosch with looks that transmitted their contempt for him since they were feds their dislike of the lapd was standard issue bosch still couldnt figure out what was going on here okay irving said were going to get some things cleared up first im going to let mr samuels take it from here samuels wiped a hand down his thick black mustache and leaned forward he was in the chair at the opposite end of the table from bosch he had a yellow legal tablet on the table in front of him but it was too far away for bosch to be able to read what was on it he held a pen in his left hand and used it to hold his place in his notes looking down at the notes he began lets start with your search of luke goshens home in las vegas samuels said exactly who was it who found the firearm later identified as the weapon used in the killing of anthony aliso bosch narrowed his eyes he tried looking at billets again but her eyes were focused on the table in front of her as he scanned the other faces he caught the smirk on chastains face no surprise there bosch had hooked up with chastain before he was known as sustained chastain by many in the department when departmental charges are brought against an officer an internal affairs investigation and board of rights hearing result in one of two findings the allegations are either sustained or ruled unfounded chastain had a high ratio of sustained to unfounded casesthus the departmental moniker which he wore like a medal if this is the subject of a departmental investigation i think im entitled to representation bosch said i dont know what this is about but i dont have to tell you people anything detective irving said he slid a sheet of paper across the table to bosch that is a signed order from the chief of police telling you to cooperate with these gentlemen if you choose not to you will be suspended without pay forthwith and youll be assigned your union rep then bosch looked down at the letter it was a form letter and he had received them before it was all part of the departments way of backing you into the corner to the point that you had to talk to them or you didnt eat i found the gun bosch said without looking up from the order it was in the master bathroom wrapped in plastic and secreted between the toilet tank and the wall somebody said the mobsters in the godfather did that the movie but i dont remember were you alone when you supposedly found the weapon there supposedly are you saying it wasnt there just answer the question please bosch shook his head in disgust he didnt know what was going on but it was looking worse than he had imagined i wasnt alone the house was full of cops were they in the master bathroom with you ogrady asked bosch just looked at ogrady he was at least ten years younger than bosch with the cleancut looks the bureau prized i thought mr samuels was going to handle the questioning irving said i am samuels said were any of these cops in that bathroom with you when you located this weapon i was by myself as soon as i saw it i called the uniform in the bedroom in to take a look before i even touched it if this is about goshens lawyer making some beef to you people about me planting the gun its bullshit the gun was there and besides weve got enough on him without the gun weve got motive printswhy would i plant a gun to make it a slam dunk ogrady said bosch blew out his breath in disgust its typical of the bureau to drop everything and come after an la cop just because some sleezeball gangster drops a dime what are they givin annual bonuses now if you guys nail a cop double if its an la cop fuck you ogrady okay yeah fuck me just answer the questions then ask them samuels nodded as if bosch had scored a point and moved his pen a half inch down his pad do you know he asked did any other police officer enter that bathroom before you entered to search it and subsequently found the gun bosch tried to remember picturing the movements of the metro cops in the room he was sure no one had gone into the bathroom other than to take a quick look to make sure no one was in there hiding i dont know for sure about that he said but i doubt it if somebody did go in there wasnt enough time to plant the gun the gun was already there samuels nodded again consulted his legal pad and then looked at irving chief irving i think thats as far as we want to take it for the moment we certainly appreciate your cooperation in this matter and i expect well be talking again soon samuels made a move to stand up wait a minute bosch said thats it youre just going to get up and leave what the fuck is going on here i deserve an explanation who made the complaint goshens lawyer because im going to make a complaint right back at him your deputy chief can discuss this with you if he chooses to no samuels you tell me youre asking the questions now you answer a few samuels drummed his pen on his pad for a moment and looked at irving irving opened his hands to show it was his choice samuels then leaned forward and looked balefully at bosch if you insist on an explanation ill give you one he said im limited of course in what i can say jesus would you just tell me what the hell is going on samuels cleared his throat before going on about four years ago in a joint operation involving the fbi offices in chicago las vegas and los angeles the strike force instituted what we called operation telegraph personnelwise it was a small operation but it had a large goal our goal was joseph marconi and the remaining tentacles of the mobs influence in las vegas it took us more than eighteen months but we managed to get someone inside an agent on the inside and in the two years since that was accomplished that agent was able to rise to a level of prominence in joseph marconis organization one in which he had the intended targets complete confidence conservatively we were four to five months from closing the operation and going to a grand jury to seek indictments for more than a dozen highranking members of the cosa nostra in three cities not to mention an assortment of burglars casino cheats bustout artists cops judges lawyers and even a few hollywood fringe players such as anthony n aliso this is not to mention that largely through the efforts of this undercover agent and the wiretaps authorized with probable cause gathered through him we now have a greater understanding of the sophistication and reach of organized crime entities such as marconis samuels was talking as if he were addressing a press conference he let a moment pass as he caught his breath but he never took his eyes off bosch that undercover agents name is roy lindell remember it because hes going to be famous no other agent was underground for so long and with such important results you notice that i said was hes no longer under detective bosch and for that we can thank you the name roy used undercover was luke goshen lucky luke goshen so i want to thank you for fucking up the end of a wonderful and important case oh well still get marconi and all the others with what roys good work got us but now its all been marred by aby you bosch felt anger backing up in his throat but tried to remain calm and he managed to speak in an even voice your suggestion then isno your accusation isthat i planted that gun well you are wrong about that dead wrong i should be angry and offended but given the situation i understand how you made the mistake but instead of pointing at me maybe you folks ought to take a look at your man goshen or whatever the hell his name is maybe you should question whether you left him under too long because that gun wasnt planted you dont you dare ogrady blurted out dont you dare say a word about him you youre nothing but a fucking rogue cop we know about you bosch all your baggage this time you went too far you planted evidence on the wrong man this time i take it back bosch said still calm i am offended i am angry so fuck you ogrady you say i planted the gun prove it but first i guess you gotta prove that i was the one who put tony aliso in his trunk because how the hell else would i have the gun to plant easy you couldve found it there in the bushes off the goddamned fire road we already know you searched it by yourself we gentlemen irving interjected will put you down for this bosch gentlemen ogrady closed his mouth and everyone looked at irving this is getting out of hand im ending this meeting suffice it to say an internal investigation will be conducted and we are doing our own investigation samuels said meantime we have to figure out how to salvage our operation bosch looked at him incredulously dont you understand he said there is no operation your star witness is a murderer you left him in too long samuels he turned became one of them he killed tony aliso for joey marks his prints were on the body the gun was found in his house not only that hes got no alibi nothing he told me he spent all night in the office but i know he wasnt there he left and he had time to get over here do the job and get back bosch shook his head sadly and finished in a low voice i agree with you samuels your operation is tainted now but not because of me it was you who left the guy in the oven too long he got cooked you were his handler you fucked up this time samuels shook his head and smiled sadly that was when bosch realized the other shoe hadnt dropped there was something else samuels angrily flipped up the top page of his pad and read a notation the autopsy concludes time of death was between eleven pm friday and two am saturday is that correct detective bosch i dont know how you got the report since i havent seen it myself yet was the death between eleven and two yes do you have those documents dan samuels asked ekeblad ekeblad took several pages folded lengthwise from the inside of his jacket and handed them to samuels samuels opened the packet and glanced at its contents and then tossed it across the table to bosch bosch picked it up but didnt look at it he kept his eyes on samuels what you have there are copies of a page from an investigative log as well as an interview report prepared tuesday morning by agent ekeblad here there are also two sworn affidavits from agents ekeblad and phil colbert who will be with us here shortly what youll find if you look at those is that on friday night at midnight agent ekeblad was sitting behind the wheel of his bureau car in the back parking lot at caesars just off industrial road his partner colbert was there next to him and in the back seat agent roy lindell he waited a beat and bosch looked down at the papers in his hands it was roys monthly meeting he was being debriefed he told ekeblad and colbert that just that night he had put four hundred and eighty thousand dollars cash from marconis various enterprises into anthony alisos briefcase and sent him back to la to have it put in the wash he also by the way mentioned that tony had been in the club drinking and got a little out of line with one of the girls in his role as enforcer for joey marks and manager of the club he had to get tough with tony he cuffed him once and jerked him around by his collar this i think you might agree would account for the fingerprints recovered from the deceaseds jacket and the antemortem facial bruising noted in the autopsy bosch still refused to look up from the documents other than that there was a lot to talk about detective bosch roy stayed for ninety minutes and there is no fucking way in the world he could have gotten to los angeles to kill tony aliso before two am let alone three am and just so you dont leave here thinking all three of these agents were involved in the murder you should know that the meeting was monitored by four additional agents in a chase car also parked in the lot for security reasons samuels waited a beat before delivering his closing argument you dont have a case the prints can be explained and the guy you said did it was sitting with two fbi agents three hundred and fifty miles away when the shooting went down youve got nothing no actually thats wrong you do have one thing a planted gun thats what youve got as if on cue the door behind bosch opened and he heard footsteps keeping his eyes on the documents in front of him bosch didnt turn around to see who it was until he felt a hand grip his shoulder and squeeze he looked up into the face of special agent roy lindell he was smiling standing next to another agent who bosch assumed was ekeblads partner colbert bosch lindell said i owe you a haircut bosch was dumbfounded to see the man he had just locked up standing there but quickly assimilated what had happened irving and billets had already been told about the meeting in the parking lot behind caesars had read the affidavits and believed the alibi they had authorized lindells release that was why billets had asked for the booking number when bosch had returned her page bosch looked away from lindell to irving and billets you believe this dont you you think i found the gun out there in the weeds and planted it just to make the case a slam there was a hesitation while each one left space for the other to answer finally it was irving the only thing we know for sure is that it wasnt agent lindell his story is solid im reserving judgment on everything else bosch looked at lindell who was still standing then why didnt you tell me you were federal when we were in that room together at metro why do you think for all i knew you had already put a gun in my bathroom you think im just going to tell you im an agent and everything would be cool after that yeah right we had to play along bosch to see what moves youd make and to make sure roy got out of the metro jail in one piece ogrady said after that we were two thousand feet above you and two thousand behind you all the way across the desert we were waiting half of us were betting you made a deal with joey marks you know in for a pinch in for a pound they were taunting him now bosch shook his head it seemed to be the only thing he could do dont you people see what is happening he said youre the ones who made a deal with joey marks only you dont know it he is playing you like a symphony jesus i cant believe im sitting here and this is actually happening how is he playing us billets asked the first indication that she might not have gone all the way across to the other side on him bosch answered looking at lindell dont you see they found out about you they knew you were an agent so they set this all up ekeblad snorted in derision they dont set things up bosch samuels said if they thought roy was an informant theyd just take him out to the desert and put him under three feet of sand end of threat no because were not talking about an informant im talking about them knowing specifically he was an agent and knowing that because of that they couldnt just take him out to the desert not an fbi agent if they did that theyd have more heat on them than the branch davidians ever felt no so what they did was make a plan they know hes been around a couple years and knows more than enough to take them all down hard but they cant just kill him not an agent so theyve got to neutralize him taint him make him look like he crossed like hes just as bad as they are so when he testifies they can take him apart with tony alisos hit make a jury think that hed carry out a hit to maintain his cover they sell a jury that and they could all walk away bosch thought he had planted the seeds of a pretty convincing story even having pulled it together on the fly the others in the room looked at him in silence for a few moments but then lindell spoke up you give them too much credit bosch he said joeys not that smart i know him hes not that smart what about torrino you going to tell me he couldnt come up with this i just thought of it sitting here who knows how long he had to come up with something answer one question lindell did joey marks know that tony aliso had the irs on his back that an audit was coming lindell hesitated and looked to samuels to see if he could answer bosch felt the sweat of desperation breaking on his neck and back he knew he had to convince them or he wouldnt walk out of the room with his badge samuels nodded to lindell if he knew he didnt tell me lindell said well maybe thats it bosch said maybe he knew but he didnt tell you joey knew he had a problem with aliso and somehow he knew he had a bigger problem with you and he and torrino put their heads together and came up with this whole thing so they could kill two birds with the one stone there was another pause but samuels shook his head it doesnt work bosch youre stretching besides weve got seven hundred hours of tapes theres enough on them to put joey away without roy even testifying one word first of all they might not have known there were tapes billets said and secondly even if they did its fruit of the poison tree you wouldnt have the tapes without agent lindell you want to introduce them in court you have to introduce him they destroy him they destroy the tapes billets had clearly shifted to boschs side of the equation and that gave him hope it also made samuels see that the meeting was over he gathered up his pad and stood up well he said i can see we arent going any further with this lieutenant youre listening to a desperate man we dont have to chief irving i dont envy you you have a problem and you have to do something about it if on monday i find out that bosch is still carrying his badge then im going to go to the sitting grand jury and get an indictment against him for evidence tampering and violating the civil rights of roy lindell i will also ask our civil rights unit to look into every arrest this man has made in the last five years a bad cop never plants evidence once chief its a habit samuels made his way around the table toward the door the others got up and were following bosch wanted to jump up and throttle him but he remained outwardly calm his dark eyes followed samuels as the federal attorney moved to the door he never looked back at bosch but before stepping out he took one last shot at irving the last thing i want to have to do is air your dirty laundry chief but if you dont take care of this youll leave me no choice with that the federals filed out and those remaining sat in silence for a long moment listening to the sound of the steps tracking down the polished linoleum in the hallway bosch looked at billets and nodded thanks lieutenant for what sticking up for me at the end there i just dont believe youd do it is all i wouldnt plant evidence on my worst enemy if i did that id be lost chastain shifted in his seat while a small smile played on his face but not small enough to pass boschs notice chastain you and i have hooked up a couple times before and you missed me both times bosch said you dont want to strike out do you you better sit this one out look bosch the chief asked me to sit in on this and i did that its his call but i think you and that story you just wove out of thin air are full of shit i agree with the feds on this one if it was my choice i wouldnt let you out of this room with a badge but its not your choice is it irving said when bosch got to his house he carried a bag of groceries to the door and knocked but there was no answer he kicked over the straw mat and found the key he had given eleanor there a feeling of sadness came over him as he bent to pick it up she was not there upon entering he was greeted by the strong smell of fresh paint which he thought was odd because it had now been four days since he had painted he went directly into the kitchen and put away the groceries when he was finished he took a bottle of beer from the refrigerator and leaned against the counter drinking it slowly making it last the smell of paint reminded him that now he would have plenty of time to finish all the work the house needed he was strictly a ninetofiver at the moment he thought of eleanor again and decided to look to see if there was a note from her or whether her suitcase might be in the bedroom but he went no further than the living room where he stopped and looked at the wall he had left halfpainted after getting the call to the crime scene on sunday the wall was now completely painted bosch stood there a long moment appraising the work as though it were a masterpiece in a museum finally he stepped to the wall and lightly touched it it was fresh but dry painted just a few hours before he guessed though no one was there to see it a broad smile broke across his face he felt a jolt of happiness break through the gray aura surrounding him he didnt need to look for her suitcase in the bedroom he took the painted wall as a sign as her note shed be back an hour later he had unpacked his overnighter and the rest of her belongings from the car and was standing in the darkness on the rear deck he held another bottle of beer and watched the ribbon of lights moving along the hollywood freeway at the bottom of the hill he had no idea how long she had stood in the frame of the sliding door to the deck and watched him when he turned around she was just there eleanor harryi thought you wouldnt be back until later neither did i but im here he smiled he wanted to go to her and touch her but a cautious voice told him to move slowly thanks for finishing he gestured toward the living room with his bottle no problem i like to paint it relaxes me yeah me too they looked at each other a moment i saw the print she said it looks good there bosch had taken her print of hoppers nighthawks out of the trunk and hung it on the freshly painted wall he knew that how she reacted to seeing it there would tell him a lot about where they were and where they might be headed good he said nodding and trying not to smile what happened to the one i sent you that had been a long time ago earthquake he said she nodded whered you just come from oh i went and rented a car you know until i can figure out what im going to do i left my car in vegas i guess we could go over and get it drive it back you know get in and out not hang around she nodded oh i got a bottle of red wine too you want something or another beer ill have what youre having im going to have a glass of wine you sure you want that im sure ill open it he followed her into the kitchen and opened the wine and took down two glasses from a cabinet and rinsed them he hadnt had anyone who liked wine over in a long time she poured and they touched glasses before drinking so hows the case going she asked i dont have a case anymore she creased her brow and frowned what happened i thought you were bringing your suspect back i did but its no longer my case not since my suspect turned out to be a bureau agent with an alibi oh harry she looked down are you in trouble bosch put his glass on the counter and folded his arms im on a desk for the time being ive got the squints investigating me they thinkalong with the bureauthat i planted evidence against the agent the gun i didnt but i guess somebody did when i figure out who then ill be okay harry how did this he shook his head moved toward her and put his mouth on hers he gently took the glass out of her hand and put it on the counter behind her after they made love bosch went into the kitchen to open a bottle of beer and make dinner he peeled an onion and chopped it up along with a green pepper he then cleared the cutting board into a frying pan and sautéed the mixture with butter powdered garlic and other seasonings he added two chicken breasts and cooked them until the meat was easy to shred and pull away from the bone with a fork he added a can of italian tomato sauce a can of crushed tomatoes and more seasonings he finished by pouring a shot of red wine from eleanors bottle in while it all simmered he put a pot of water on to boil for rice it was the best dinner he knew how to cook in a kitchen he would have preferred grilling something on the deck but the grill had been hauled away when the original house was demolished after the earthquake while he had replaced the house he had not yet gotten around to getting a new grill he decided as he mixed rice into the boiling water that if eleanor chose to stay for a while he would get the grill smells good he turned and she was standing in the doorway she was dressed in blue jeans and a denim shirt her hair was damp from the shower bosch looked at her and felt the desire to make love to her again i hope it tastes good he said this is a new kitchen but i dont really know how to use it yet never did much cooking she smiled i can tell already it will be good tell you what will you stir this every few minutes while i take a shower sure ill set the table okay i was thinking wed eat out on the deck it doesnt smell like paint out there sorry no i mean it will be nice out there im not complaining about the paint in fact that was all a ruse you know to leave the wall half painted like that i knew you wouldnt be able to resist she smiled a regular tom sawyer detective third grade maybe not for long his comment ruined the moment and she stopped smiling he silently chastised himself on the way back to the bedroom after his shower bosch put the last part of his recipe into the frying pan he took a handful of frozen peas and mixed them into the simmering chickenandtomato stew as he brought the food and wine out to the picnic table on the deck he told eleanor who was standing at the railing to have a seat sorry he said as they settled in i forgot about a salad this is all i need they started the meal in silence he waited i like it a lot she finally said what do you call this i dont know my mother just called it chicken special i think thats what it was called in a restaurant where she first had it a family recipe the only one they ate quietly for a few minutes during which bosch surreptitiously tried to watch her to see if she really enjoyed the food he was pretty sure she did harry eleanor said after a while who are the agents involved in this theyre from all over chicago vegas la who from la guy named john ogrady you know him it had been more than five years since she had worked in the bureaus la field office fbi agents moved around a lot he doubted she would know ogrady and she said she didnt what about john samuels hes the ausa on it hes from the oc strike force samuels i know or knew he was an agent for a while not a particularly good one had the law degree and when he figured out he wasnt much of an investigator he decided he wanted to prosecute she started laughing and shook her head what nothing just something they used to say about him its kind of gross what does he still have his mustache yeah well they used to say that he could sure put a case together for prosecution but as far as investigating it out on the street went he couldnt find shit if it was in his own mustache she laughed againa little too hard bosch thought he smiled back maybe thats why he became a prosecutor she added something occurred to bosch then and he quickly withdrew into his thoughts eventually he heard eleanors voice what you disappeared i asked what you were thinking i didnt think it was that bad a joke no i was just thinking about what a bottomless hole im in about how it doesnt really matter whether samuels actually believes im dirty on this he needs me to be dirty how so theyve got cases to make with their undercover guy against joey marks and his crew and theyve got to be ready and able to explain how a murder weapon got to be in their guys house because if they cant explain it then joeys lawyers are going to shove it down their throats make it look like their guy is tainted is a killer worse than the people he was after that gun has reasonable doubt written all over it so the best way to explain away the gun is to blame it on the lapd on me a bad cop from a bad department who found the gun in the weeds and planted it on the guy he thought did it the jury will go along theyll make me out to be this years mark fuhrman he saw the humor was long gone from her face now there was obvious concern in her eyes but he thought there was also sadness maybe she understood too how well he was boxed in the alternative is to prove that joey marks or one of his people planted the gun because they somehow knew luke goshen was an agent and needed to discredit him though thats the likely truth its a harder road to follow its easier for samuels just to throw the mud on me he looked down at his halffinished dinner and put his knife and fork on the plate he couldnt eat anymore he took a long drink of wine and then kept the glass in his hand ready i think im in big trouble eleanor the gravity of his situation was finally beginning to weigh on him hed been operating on his faith that the truth would win out and now clearly saw how little truth would have to do with the outcome he looked up at her their eyes connected and he saw that she was about to cry he tried to smile hey ill think of something he said i might be riding a desk for the time being but im not taking both oars out of the water im going to figure this out she nodded but her face still looked distraught harry remember when you found me in the casino that first night and we went to the bar at caesars and you tried to talk to me remember what you said about doing things differently if you had the chance to go back yes i remember she wiped her eyes with her palms before any tears could show i have to tell you something you can tell me anything eleanor what i told you about me paying quillen and the street tax and all of that theres more to it she looked at him with intensity now trying to read his reaction before going further but bosch sat stone still and waited when i first went to vegas after getting out of frontera i didnt have a place or a car and i didnt know anyone i just thought id give it a shot you know playing cards and there was a girl i knew from frontera her name was patsy quillen she told me to look up her unclethat was terry quillenand that hed probably stake me after he checked me out and saw me play patsy wrote him and gave me an introduction bosch sat silently listening he now had an idea where this was going but couldnt figure out why she was telling him so he staked me i got the apartment and some money to play with he never said anything about joey marks though i should have known the money came from somewhere it always does anyway later when he finally told me who had really staked me he said i shouldnt worry because the organization he worked for didnt want me to pay the nut back what they wanted was just the interest two hundred a week the tax i didnt think i had a choice id already taken the money so i started paying in the beginning it was tough i didnt have it a couple times and it was double the next week plus that weeks regular tax you get behind and theres no way out she looked down at her hands and clasped them on the table what did they make you do bosch asked quietly also averting his eyes its not what youre thinking she said i was luckythey knew about me i mean that i had been an agent they figured they could use my skills as dormant as they were so they had me just watch people mostly in casinos but there were a few times i followed them outside most of the time i didnt even know exactly who they were or why they wanted the information but i just watched sometimes played at the same tables and reported to terry what the guy was winning or losing who he was talking to any nuances of his gameyou know things like that she was just rambling now putting off the meat of what she had to tell him but bosch didnt say anything he let her go on a couple days i watched tony aliso for them they wanted to know how much he was dropping at the tables and where he was going the usual stuff but as it turned out he wasnt losing he actually was quite good at cards where did you watch him go oh hed go out to dinner to the strip club hed run errands things like that you ever see him with a girl one time i followed him on foot from the mirage into caesars and then into the shopping arcade he went to spago for a late lunch he was alone and then the girl showed up she was young i thought at first it was like an escort thing but then i could tell he knew her after lunch they went back to his hotel room for a while and when they came out they took his rental and he took her to get a manicure and to buy cigarettes and to a bank while she opened an account just errands then they went to the strip club in north vegas when he left he was alone i figured then she was a dancer bosch nodded were you watching tony last friday night bosch asked no that was just coincidence that we ended up at the same table it was because he was waiting to go to the highstakes table i actually hadnt done anything for them in a month or so other than pay the weekly tax untilterry her voice trailed off they were finally at the point of no return until terry what eleanor she looked toward the fading horizon the lights across the valley were coming on and the sky was pink neon mixed with gray paint bosch kept his eyes on her she spoke while still watching the end of the day quillen came to my apartment after you took me home from metro he took me to the house where you found me they wouldnt tell me why and they told me not to leave they said nobody would get hurt if i just did what i was told i sat around that place for two days they only put the handcuffs on me that last night it was like they knew youd be coming then she let a beat of silence follow it was there if bosch wanted to use it but he didnt say a word i guess what im trying to tell you is that the whole thing was something less than an abduction she looked back down at her hands now and thats obviously why you didnt want us to call out metro bosch said quietly she nodded i dont know why i didnt tell you everything before im really sorry harry i now bosch felt his own words sticking in his throat her story was understandable and believable he even felt for her and understood that she was in her own bottomless pit he saw how she had believed she had no choices what he couldnt see and what hurt him was why she couldnt tell him everything from the start why couldnt you tell me eleanor he managed to get out i mean right away why didnt you tell me that night i dont know she said i wantedi guess i hoped it would just go away and you would never have to know then why are you telling me now she looked right at him because i hated not telling you everythingand because while i was there at that house i heard something that you need to know now bosch closed his eyes im sorry harry very sorry he nodded he was too he washed his hands over his face he didnt want to hear this but knew he had to his mind raced jumping between feelings of betrayal and confusion and sympathy one moment his thoughts were of eleanor and the next they were on the case they knew someone had told joey marks about eleanor and him he thought of felton and iverson then baxter and every cop he had seen at metro someone had fed marks the information and they used eleanor as bait for him but why why the whole charade he opened his eyes and looked at eleanor with a blank stare what was it that you heard and that i need to know it was the first night i was kept in that back room where the tv was where you came and got me i was kept in there and the samoans were there in and out but from time to time there were people in other parts of the house i heard them talking gussie and quillen no quillen left i know his voice and it wasnt him and i dont think it was gussie i think it was joey marks and someone else probably the lawyer torrino whoever it was i heard the one man call the other joe at one point thats how come i think it was marks okay go on what did they say i couldnt hear all of it but one man was telling the other the one he called joe what he had learned about the police investigation about the metro side of things i think and i heard the one called joe get very angry when he was told the gun had been found at luke goshens house and i remember his words very clearly he was yelling he said how the hell did they find the gun there when we didnt do the goddamned hit and then he said some more things about the cops planting the gun and he said you tell our guy that if this is some kind of shakedown then he can fuck off he can forget it i didnt hear much after that they lowered their voices and the first guy was just trying to calm the other guy down bosch stared at her for a few moments trying to analyze what she had overheard do you think it was a show he asked you know put on for your benefit because they figured youd turn around and tell me what you heard i did at first and thats another reason i didnt tell you this right away she said but now im not so sure when they first took me when quillen was driving me out there and i was asking a lot of questions he wouldnt answer them but he did say one thing all he would tell me was that they needed me for a day or two to run a test on somebody he would explain no further a test thats all he said a test bosch looked confused listen to me harry ive done nothing but think about this since you got me out of there she held up a finger lets start with what i overheard lets say it was joey marks and his lawyer and lets say it wasnt a show but what they said was true they didnt put the hit on tony aliso okay okay look at it from their perspective they had nothing to do with this but one of their inclose guys gets picked up for it and from what they hear from their source in metro its looking like a slambang case i mean the cops have fingerprints and the murder weapon found right there in goshens bathroom joey marks has to be thinking either its all been planted by the cops or maybe goshen went and did this on his own for some unknown reason either way what do you think his immediate concern would be damage control right he has to figure out what is going on with goshen and whats the damage but he cant because goshen has gone and gotten himself his own attorney torrino has no access to him so what joey does instead is he and torrino set up a test to see if the reason goshens gotten his own attorney is because hes going to talk make a deal right now lets say that from their source in metro they know that the lead cop on the case has a relationship with someone they know of and have their hooks in me so they just take you to the safe house and wait because they know that if i find out where the safe house is and show up to get you or if i call up metro and say i know where you are then they know goshen is the only one who could have told me it means hes talking that was the test quillen was talking about if i dont show theyre cool it means goshen is standing up if i do show up then they know theyve got to get to goshen in metro right quick and put a hit on him right before he can talk thats how i figured it too so that would mean that aliso wasnt really a hitat least by marks and his peopleand that they had no idea goshen was an agent she nodded bosch felt the surge of energy that comes with making a huge step through the murky darkness of an investigation there was no trunk music he said what the whole las vegas angle joey marks all of that it was all a diversion we went completely down the wrong path it had to be engineered by someone very close to tony close enough to know what he was doing to know about the money washing and to know how to make his killing look mob connected to pin it on goshen she nodded and thats why i had to tell you everything even if it meant we bosch looked at her she didnt finish the line and neither did he bosch took a cigarette out of his pocket and put it in his mouth but didnt light it he leaned across the table and picked up her plate and his own he spoke to her as he slid off the bench i dont have any dessert either thats okay he took the plates into the kitchen and rinsed them and put them into the dishwasher he had never used the new appliance before and spent some time leaning over it and trying to figure out how to operate it once he got it going he started cleaning the frying pan and the pot in the sink the simple work began to relax him eleanor came into the kitchen with her wineglass and watched him for a few moments before speaking im sorry harry its okay you were in a bad situation and you did what you had to do eleanor nobody can be blamed for that i probably would have done everything you did it was a few moments before she spoke again do you want me to go bosch turned off the water and looked into the sink he could make out his dark image reflected in the new stainless steel no he said i dont think so bosch arrived at the station at seven friday morning with a box of glazed doughnuts from the fairfax farmers market he was the first one in he opened the box and put it on the counter near the coffee machine he took one of the doughnuts and put it on a napkin and left it at his spot on the homicide table while he went up to the watch office to get coffee from the urn it was much better than what came out of the detective bureaus machine once he had his coffee he took his doughnut and moved to the desk that was behind the bureaus front counter his assignment to desk duty meant that he would handle most of the walkins as well as the sorting and distribution of overnight reports the phones he wouldnt have to worry about they were answered by an old man from the neighborhood who donated his time to the department bosch was alone in the squad room for at least fifteen minutes before the other detectives started to trickle in six different times he was asked by a new arrival why he was at the front desk and each time he told the detective who asked that it was too complicated to get into but that the word would be out soon enough nothing remained a secret for long in a police station at eightthirty the lieutenant from the am watch brought the morning reports in before going off shift and smiled when he saw bosch his name was klein and he and bosch had known each other in a surface way for years whod you beat up this time bosch he kidded it was well known that the detective who sat at the desk where bosch now sat was either there by fate of the bureau rotation or on a desk duty assignment while the subject of an internal investigation more often than not it was the latter but kleins sarcasm revealed that he had not yet heard that bosch actually was under investigation bosch played off the question with a smile but didnt answer he took the twoinchthick stack of reports from klein and gave him a mock salute back the stack klein had given him constituted nearly all crime reports filed by hollywood division patrol officers in the last twentyfour hours there would be a second smaller delivery of stragglers later in the morning but the stack in his hands constituted the bulk of the days work in the bureau keeping his head down and ignoring the buzz of conversations around him it took bosch a half hour to sort all the reports into piles according to crimes next he had to scan them all using his experienced eye to possibly make connections between robberies and burglaries or assaults and so on and then deliver the individual piles to the detective tables assigned to that particular classification of crime when he looked up from his work he saw that lieutenant billets was in her office on the phone he hadnt noticed that she had come in part of his desk job would be to give her a morning briefing on the reports informing her of any significant or unusual crimes or anything else she should be aware of as the detective bureau commander he went back to work and weeded through the autotheft reports first because they made up the largest pile he had culled from the stack of reports there had been thirtythree cars reported stolen in hollywood in the last twentyfour hours bosch knew that this was probably a belowaverage tally after reading the summaries in the reports and checking for other similarities he found nothing of significance and took the pile to the detective in charge of the autotheft table as he was heading back to the front of the squad room he noticed that edgar and rider were standing at the homicide table putting things into a cardboard box as he approached he realized they were packing up the murder book and the ancillary files and evidence bags relating to the aliso case it was all being sent to the feds morning guys bosch said unsure of how to start harry edgar said how are you doing harry rider said genuine concern in her voice im hangin in uh listen i justi just want to say that im sorry you guys have been pulled into this but i wanted you to know there is no way i forget it harry edgar said you dont have to say one damn thing to us we both know the whole thing is bullshit in all my years on the job you are the most righteous cop i know man all the rest is bullshit bosch nodded touched by edgars words he didnt expect such sentiments from rider because it had been their first case together but she spoke anyway i havent worked with you long harry but from what i do know i agree with what jerry says you watch this will blow over and well be back at it again thanks bosch was about to head back to his new desk when he looked down into the box they were packing he reached in and pulled out the twoinchthick murder book that edgar had been charged with preparing and keeping up to date on the aliso case are the feds coming here or you just sending it out sposed to have somebody come pick it up at ten edgar said bosch looked up at the clock on the wall it was only nine mind if i copy this just so we have something in case the whole thing drops into that black hole they keep over there at the bureau be my guest edgar said did salazar ever send over a protocol bosch asked the autopsy rider asked no not yet unless its in dispatch bosch didnt tell them that if it was in transit then the feds had somehow intercepted it he took the murder book to the copy machine unhooked the three rings and removed the stack of reports he set the machine to copy both sides of the original documents and put the stack into the automatic feed tray before starting he checked to make sure the paper tray was filled with threehole paper it was he pressed the start button and stood back to watch there was a copying franchise chain in town that had donated the machine and regularly serviced it it was the one thing in the bureau that was modern and could be counted on to work most of the time bosch finished the job in ten minutes he put the original binder back together and returned it to the box on edgars desk he then took a fresh binder from the supply closet put his copies of the reports on the rings and dropped it into a file cabinet drawer that had his business card taped to it he then told his two partners where it was if they needed it harry rider said in a low voice youre thinking of doing a little freelancing on it arent you he looked at her a moment unsure of how to answer he thought about her relationship with billets he had to be careful if you are she said perhaps sensing his indecision id like to be in on it you know the bureau isnt going to work it with any due diligence theyre going to let it drop count me in too edgar added bosch hesitated again looked from one to the other and then nodded how bout we meet at mussos at twelvethirty he said im buying well be there edgar said when he got back to the front of the bureau he saw through the glass window of her office that billets was off the phone and looking at some paperwork her door was open and bosch stepped in knocking on the doorjamb as he entered good morning harry there was a wistfulness to her voice and demeanor as if maybe she was embarrassed that he was her frontdesk man anything happening i should know about right away i dont think so it looks pretty tame uh theres a hot prowler working the strip hotels again though at least it looks like one guy did one at the chateau and another at the hyatt last night people never woke up looks like the same mo on both were the vics anybody we should know and care about i dont think so but i dont read people magazine i might not recognize a celebrity if they came up and bit me she smiled how much were the losses i dont know im not done with that pile yet thats not why i came in i just wanted to say thanks again for sticking up for me like you did yesterday that was hardly sticking up for you yes it was in those kinds of circumstances what you said and did was sticking your neck way out i appreciate it well like i said i did it because i dont believe it and the sooner iad and the bureau get on with it the sooner they wont believe it whens your appointment by the way two who is your defense rep going to be guy i know from rhd names dennis zane hes a good guy and hell know what to do for me you know him no but listen let me know if there is anything else i can do thanks lieutenant grace right grace when bosch went back to his desk he thought about his appointment with chastain in accordance with departmental procedures bosch would be represented by a union defense rep who was actually a fellow detective he would act almost as an attorney would counseling bosch on what to say and how to say it it was the first formal step of the internal investigation and disciplinary process when he looked up he saw a woman standing at the counter with a young girl the girl had redrimmed eyes and a marblesized swelling on her lower lip that looked like it might have been the result of a bite she was disheveled and stared at the wall behind bosch with a distance in her eyes that suggested that a window was there but there wasnt bosch could have asked how he could help them without moving from his desk but it didnt take a detective to guess why they were there he got up came around the desk and approached the counter so they could speak confidentially rape victims were the people who evoked the most sadness in bosch he knew he wouldnt be able to last a month on a rape squad every victim he had ever seen had that stare it was a sign that all things in their lives were different now and forever they would never get back to what they had had before after speaking briefly to the mother and daughter bosch asked if the girl needed immediate medical attention and the mother said she didnt he opened the half door in the counter and ushered them both back to one of the three interview rooms off the hallway to the rear of the bureau he then went to the sex crimes table and approached mary cantu a detective who had been handling for years what bosch knew he couldnt handle for a month mary youve got a walkin back in room three bosch said shes fifteen happened last night she got too curious about the pusher who works the nearby corner he grabbed her and sold her and a rock to his next customer shes with her mother thanks bosch just what i needed on a friday ill go right back you ask if she needed medical she said no but i think the answer is yes okay ill handle it thanks back at the front desk it took bosch a few minutes to clear his thoughts about the girl from his mind and another fortyfive to finish reading through the reports and deliver them to the appropriate detective squads when he was done he checked on billets through the window and saw she was on the phone with a pile of paperwork in front of her bosch got up and went to his file cabinet and took out the copy of the murder book he had put there earlier he lugged the thick binder back to his desk at the front counter he had decided that in his free time between his duties at the front desk he would begin reviewing the murder book the case had taken off so quickly earlier in the week that he had not had the time he usually liked to spend reviewing the paperwork he knew from experience that command of the details and the nuances of an investigation was often the key to closing it out he had just started turning through the pages in a cursory review when a vaguely familiar voice addressed him from the counter is that what i think it is bosch looked up it was ogrady the fbi agent bosch felt his face burn with embarrassment that hed been caught redhanded with the file and with his growing dislike for the agent yeah its what you think it is ogrady you were supposed to be here a half hour ago to pick it up yeah well i dont run on your time i had things to do like what get your buddy roy a new ponytail just give me the binder bosch and all the rest bosch still had not gotten up and made no move to now what do you want it for ogrady we all know youre going to let the thing drop you people dont care who killed tony aliso and you dont want to know thats bullshit give me the file ogrady reached over the counter and was reaching around blindly for the release button on the half door hold your fucking horses man bosch said as he stood up just wait there ill get it all carrying the binder bosch walked back to the homicide table and using his back to shield ogradys view placed the binder on the table and picked up the box containing the original binder and the ancillary reports and evidence bags that edgar and rider had put in with it he carried it back and dropped it on the counter in front of ogrady you gotta sign for it he said were extra careful about how we handle evidence and who gets to handle it yeah right the whole world knows that from the oj case dont they bosch grabbed ogradys tie and jerked his upper body down over the counter the agent could not find a purchase with his hands that would give him the leverage to pull back bosch bent down so that he was talking directly into his ear excuse me bosch you harry bosch looked up billets was standing in the door of her office bosch let go of the tie and ogradys body sprang backward as he straightened up his face was crimson with embarrassment and anger as he jerked his tie loose from around his neck he yelled youre certifiable you know that youre a fucking asshole i didnt know you agents used that kind of language bosch said harry just sit down billets commanded ill take care of this she had come up to the counter now hes got to sign the receipt i dont care ill handle it bosch went back to his desk and sat down he stared deadeyed at ogrady while billets dug through the box until she found the inventory list and receipt edgar had prepared she showed ogrady where to sign and then told him to go you better watch him he said to billets as he picked the box up off the counter you better watch yourself agent ogrady if i hear anything else about this little disagreement here ill file a complaint against you for inciting it hes the one who i dont care understand i dont care now leave im leaving but you watch your boy there keep him away from this ogrady pointed to the contents of the box billets didnt answer ogrady picked the box up and made a move to step away from the counter but stopped and looked once more at bosch hey bosch by the way i got a message from roy agent ogrady would you please leave billets said angrily what is it bosch said he just wanted to ask whos the meat now with that he turned around and headed down the hall to the exit billets watched him until he was gone and then turned around and looked at bosch with anger in her eyes you just dont know how to help yourself do you she said why dont you grow up and quit these little pissing wars she didnt wait for his reply because he didnt have one she walked quickly back into her office and shut the door she then closed the blinds over the interior window bosch leaned back with his hands laced behind his neck looked up at the ceiling and exhaled loudly after the ogrady incident bosch almost immediately became busy with a walkin case involving an armed robbery at the time the entire robbery crew was out on a carjacking that had involved a highspeed chase and that meant bosch as the desk man had to interview the walkin victim and type up a report the victim was a young mexican boy whose job it was to stand on the corner of hollywood boulevard at sierra bonita and sell maps to the homes of movie stars up in the hills at ten that morning shortly after he had set up his plywood sign and begun waving down cars an old americanmade sedan had pulled up with a man driving and a woman in the passenger seat after asking how much the maps cost and whether he had sold very many of them the woman had pointed a gun at the boy and robbed him of thirtyeight dollars he had come in to report the crime with his mother as it turned out he had sold only one map that day before the robbery and nearly all of the money taken from him was his ownhe had brought it with him to make change his loss was about what he made for a whole day of standing on the corner and waving his arm like a windmill because of the small take and sloppy method used by the robbers bosch immediately thought the suspects were a couple of hypes looking for a quick score to buy their next balloon of heroin they had not even bothered to hide the cars license plate which the boy had spotted and memorized as they drove away after he was finished with the boy and his mother he went to the teletype machine and put out a wanted on the car with a description of the suspects he found when he did this that there was already a wanted out on the vehicle for its use in two prior robberies in the last week a lot of good that did the kid who lost a days pay bosch thought the robbers should have been picked up before they got to the boy but this was the big city not a perfect world disappointments like that didnt stay long with bosch by this time the squad room had pretty much cleared out for lunch bosch saw only mary cantu at the sex crimes table probably working on the paper from that mornings walkin job edgar and rider were gone apparently having decided it would be better to go separately to mussos as bosch got up to leave he noticed that the blinds were still drawn over the window to the lieutenants office billets was still in there he knew he went to the homicide table and put the copy of the murder book into his briefcase and then went and knocked on her door before she could answer he opened the door and stuck his head in im going to go catch some lunch and then go downtown for the iad thing you wont have anybody out on the counter okay she said ill put edgar or rider up there after lunch theyre just waiting around for a case anyway okay then ill see you uh harry yes im sorry for what happened earlier not for what i said i meant what i said but i should have taken you in here and spoken to you doing it out there in front of the others was wrong i apologize dont worry about it have a nice weekend you too ill try lieutenant grace grace bosch got to musso and franks restaurant on hollywood boulevard at exactly twelvethirty and parked in the back the restaurant was a hollywood landmark having been on the boulevard since in its heyday it had been a popular destination for hollywoods elite fitzgerald and faulkner held forth chaplin and fairbanks once raced each other down hollywood boulevard on horseback the loser having to pick up the dinner tab the restaurant now subsisted mostly on its past glory and faded charm its red leather padded booths still filled every day for lunch and some of the waiters looked and moved as if they had been there long enough to have served chaplin the menu hadnt changed in all the years bosch had been eating therethis in a town where the hookers out on the boulevard lasted longer than most restaurants edgar and rider were waiting in one of the prized round booths and bosch slid in after they were pointed out by the maître dhe was apparently too old and tired to walk bosch over himself they were both drinking iced tea and bosch decided to go along with that though privately he lamented that they were in the place that made the best martini in the city only rider was looking at the menu she was new in the division and hadnt been to mussos enough times to know what the best thing was to order for lunch so what are we doing edgar asked while she looked weve got to start over bosch said the vegas stuff was all misdirection rider glanced over the top of the menu at bosch kiz put that down he said if you dont get the chicken pot pie youre making a mistake she hesitated nodded and put the menu aside what do you mean misdirection she asked i mean whoever killed tony wanted us to go that way and they planted the gun out there to make sure we stayed out there but they screwed up they didnt know the guy they planted the gun on was a fed who would have a bunch of other feds as an alibi that was the screwup now once i learned that our suspect was an agent i thought joey marks and his people must have figured out he was a fed and set the whole thing up to taint him i still think that sounds good edgar said it does or it did until last night bosch said as an ancient waiter in a red coat came to the table three chicken pot pies bosch said do you want something to drink the waiter asked hell with it bosch decided yeah ill have a martini three olives you can bring them some more iced tea thats it the waiter nodded and slowly glided away without writing anything on his pad last night bosch continued i learned from a source that joey marks did not know the man he thought was named luke goshen was a plant he had no idea he was an informant let alone an agent in fact once we picked goshen up joey was engaged in a plan to try to find out whether goshen was going to stand up or talk this was because he had to decide whether to put a contract on him in the metro jail he waited a moment to let them think about this so you can see with that information in the mix now the second theory no longer works well whos the source edgar asked i cant tell you that guys but its solid its the truth he watched their eyes float down to the table he knew they trusted him but they also knew how informants were often the most skilled liars in the game it was a tough call to base everything from here on out on an informant okay bosch said the source was eleanor wish jerry have you told kiz about all of that edgar hesitated then nodded okay then you know who she is she overheard all of what i told you while they had her in that house before we got there both joey and the lawyer torrino were there she overheard them and from what she heard they didnt know about goshen see that whole abduction was part of the test they knew the only way i could find out where the safe house was would be to get it from goshen that was the test to see if he was talking or not they sat in silence for a few minutes while edgar and rider digested this okay edgar finally said i see what youre saying but if vegas was one big fucking red herring how does the gun get over there in the agents house thats what we have to figure out what if there was someone outside of tonys mob connections but close enough to him to know he was washing money and the reason why he made all the trips to vegas someone who either had personal knowledge or maybe followed tony to vegas and watched how he worked how he picked up the money from goshen everything someone who knew exactly how he did it who knew goshen could be set up to take the fall and that tonyd be coming back on friday with a lot of money in his briefcase they would be able to set the whole thing up as long as they could get into the agents house to plant the gun edgar answered right and getting into the house would be no problem its out in the middle of nowhere he was away at the club for long stretches at a time anybody could get in plant the gun and get out the question is who youre talking about either his wife or his girlfriend edgar said both could have had that kind of access bosch nodded so which one do we set up on the three of us cant do both not on a freelance like this we dont need to bosch said i think the choice is obvious which edgar said the girlfriend bosch looked at rider giving her the chance to answer she saw his look and then her eyes narrowed as she went to work itit cant be the girlfriend becausebecause she called tony on sunday morning on the voice mail why would she call the guy if she knew he was dead bosch nodded she was good could have been part of a setup edgar said another misdirection could be but i doubt it bosch said plus we know she worked friday night that would make it kind of tough for her to be over here whacking tony so then its the wife edgar said veronica right bosch said i think she was lying to us acting like she didnt know anything about her husbands business when she knew everything i think this whole thing was her plan she wrote the letters to the irs and to the ocid she wanted to get something going against tony then when he ended up dead it would point toward a mob hit trunk music planting the gun on goshen was just icing if we found it fine if we didnt then wed be sniffing around vegas until we shelved the case youre saying she did this all on her own edgar asked no bosch said im just saying i think this was her plan but she had to have had help an accomplice it took two to do the actual hit and she sure didnt take the gun to vegas after the kill she stays at the house and waits while the accomplice goes to vegas and plants the gun while luke goshens at the club but wait a minute rider said were forgetting something veronica aliso had it very cushy in her existing life tony was raking in the bread with his washing machine they had the big house in the hills the carswhy would she want to kill the cash cow how much was in that briefcase according to the feds four hundred and eighty thousand bosch said edgar whistled softly rider shook her head i still dont see it she said thats a hell of a lot of money but tony was making at least that much a year in business terms killing him was a shortterm gainlongterm loss for her doesnt make sense then there is something else running through all of this that we dont know about yet bosch said maybe he was about to dump her maybe that old lady in vegas who said tony was going to go away with layla was telling the truth or maybe theres money somewhere we dont know about but for now i cant see anybody else fitting into this picture but her but what about the gatehouse rider said the log shows she never left friday the whole night and she had no visitors well weve got to work on that bosch said there had to have been a way for her to get in and out what else edgar asked we start over bosch said i want to know everything about her whered she come from who are her friends what does she do in that house all day long and what did she do and who did she do it with all those times tony was away rider and edgar nodded theres got to be an accomplice and my guess is that its a man and ill bet well find him through her the waiter came up with a tray and put it down on a folding cart they watched silently as he prepared the meal there were three separate chicken pot pies on the tray the waiter used a fork and spoon to take the top crust off each and put it on a plate next he scooped the contents of each pie out and put it on the crust served the three cops their dishes and put down fresh glasses of iced tea for edgar and rider he then poured boschs martini from a small glass carafe and floated away without a word obviously bosch said we have to do this quietly yeah edgar said and bullets also put us on the top of the rotation next call comes in me and kiz get it and we hafta work it without you thats going to take us away from this well do what you can if you get a body you get a body nothing we can do about that meantime this is what i propose you two work on veronicas background see what you can find you got any sources at the times or the trades i know a couple at the times rider said and theres a woman i once had a case withshe was a vicwhos a receptionist or something at variety you trust em i think i can see if theyll pull a search on veronica for you she had a brief flash of fame a while back her fifteen minutes maybe there were some stories about her stories that would have names of people we could talk to what about talking to her again edgar asked i dont think we should do it yet i want to have something to talk to her about what about neighbors you can do that maybe shell look out the window and see you give her something to think about if you go up there see if you can take another look at the gate log talk to nash im sure you can turn him without needing another search warrant id like to take a look at the whole year know who has been going in to see her especially while tony was out of town we have tonys credit records and can construct his travel history youll be able to know when she was in that house alone bosch raised his fork he hadnt had a bite of food yet but his mind was too full of the case and what needed to be done the other thing is we need as much of the case file as we can get all weve got is the copy of the murder book im going down to parker center for my little chat with the iad ill swing by usc and get a copy of the autopsy the feds already have it ill also go talk to donovan in sid and see if he came up with anything we pulled out of the car also hes got the shoe prints ill get copies hopefully before the feds come in and take everything anything else im missing the other two shook their heads you want to see what we get and then put our heads together after work they nodded cat and fiddle about six they nodded again they were too busy eating to talk bosch took his first bite of food which was already getting cold he joined them in their silence thinking about the case its in the details he said after a few moments what rider asked the case when you get one like this the answer is always in the details you watch when we break it the answer will have been sitting in the files in the book it always happens the interview with chastain at internal affairs began as bosch expected it would he sat with zane his defense rep at a gray government table in one of the iad interview rooms an old sony cassette player was turned on and everything said in the room was recorded in police parlance chastain was locking up boschs story getting his words and explanation in as much detail as possible down on tape chastain really wouldnt begin his investigation until after boschs story was locked in he would then hunt for flaws in it all he had to do was catch bosch in a single lie and he could take him to a board of rights hearing depending on the size and import of the lie he could seek a penalty ranging from suspension to dismissal in a dull and laborious drone chastain read prepared questions from a legal pad and bosch slowly and carefully answered them with as few words as possible it was a game bosch had played it before in the fifteen minutes they had before reporting to iad zane had counseled bosch on how it would go and how they should proceed like a good criminal defense lawyer he never directly asked harry if he had planted the gun zane didnt really care he simply looked at iad as the enemy as a group of bad cops with the sole purpose of going after good cops zane was part of the old school who thought all cops were inherently good and though sometimes the job turned them bad they should not be persecuted by their own everything was routine for a half hour but then chastain threw an unexpected pitch at them detective bosch do you know a woman named eleanor wish zane reached out a hand in front of bosch to stop him from answering what is this shit chastain who have you been talking to chastain bosch added wait a minute harry zane said dont say anything wheres this going chastain its very clear from the orders from the chief im investigating boschs conduct during this investigation as far as who i have been talking to or where i get my information you are not privy to that at this point in the process this is supposed to be about a supposedly planted gun that we all know is bullshit thats what we are here to answer do you wish to read the order from the chief again its quite clear zane looked at him a moment give us five minutes so we can talk about this why dont you go get the points of your teeth filed chastain stood up and reached over and turned the tape recorder off as he stepped to the door he looked back at them with a smile this time i got you both you wont get out from under this one bosch and zane well i guess you cant win them all can you you ought to know that better than me you sanctimonious asshole get out of here and leave us alone after chastain was gone zane bent over the tape recorder to make sure it was off he then got up and checked the thermostat on the wall to make sure it wasnt a secret listening device after he was satisfied their conversation was private he sat back down and asked bosch about eleanor wish bosch told him about his encounters with eleanor over the past few days but left out mention of the abduction and her subsequent confession one of those cops over there in metro mustve told him you shacked up with her zane said thats all hes got hes going for an associating beef if you admit it here then hes got you but if thats all he gets then its a slap on the wrist at best as long as he gets nothing else but if you lie about it and say you werent with her when you were and he can prove you were then youve got a problem so my advice is that you tell him yeah you know her and youve been with her fuck it its nothing tell him its over and if thats all hes got then hes a chickenshit asshole i dont know if it is or it isnt what over well dont tell him nothin about that unless he asks for it then use your best judgment ready bosch nodded and zane opened the door chastain was sitting outside at a desk where ya been chastain zane complained were waiting in here chastain didnt answer he came in turned the recorder back on and continued the q and a yes i know eleanor wish bosch said yes ive spent time with her over the last few days how much time i dont know exactly a couple of nights while you were conducting the investigation not while i was conducting it at night when i was done for the day we all dont work around the clock like you chastain bosch smiled at him without humor was she a witness in this case chastain asked with a tone that denoted that he was shocked that bosch would cross that line initially i thought she might be a witness after i located her and talked to her i learned pretty quickly that she was not an evidentiary witness of any kind but you did initially encounter her while you were in your capacity as an investigator on this case thats correct chastain consulted his pad for a long moment before asking the next question is this woman thats the convicted felon eleanor wish i am still talking about is she living in your home at this time bosch felt the bile rising in his throat the personal invasion and chastains tone were getting to him he struggled to remain calm i dont know the answer to that he said you dont know if someone is living in your house or not look chastain she was there last night okay is that what you want to hear she was there but whether shell be there tonight i dont know shes got her own place in vegas she may have gone back today i dont know i didnt check you want me to call and ask her if she is officially living in my home at this time i will i dont think thats necessary i think i have everything i need for the time being he then went directly into the standard iad endofinterview spiel detective bosch you will be informed of the results of the ongoing investigation into your conduct if departmental charges are filed you will be informed of the scheduling of a board of rights hearing in which three captains will hear evidence you will be allowed to choose one of those captains i will select a second and the third will be chosen at random any questions just one how can you call yourself a cop when all you do is sit up here and conduct these bullshit investigations into bullshit zane reached over and put a hand on boschs forearm to quiet him no thats okay chastain said waving off zanes effort to calm things i dont mind answering in fact i get that question a lot bosch funny but it always seems i get it from the cops i happen to be investigating anyway the answer is that i take pride in what i do because i represent the public and if there is no one to police the police then there is no one to keep the abuse of their wide powers in check i serve a valuable purpose in this society detective bosch im proud of what i do can you say the same yeah yeah yeah bosch said im sure that sounds great on tape for whoever listens to it i get the feeling you probably sit alone at night and listen to it yourself over and over again after a while you believe it but let me ask you this chastain who polices the police who police the police bosch stood up and zane followed the interview was over after leaving iad and thanking zane for his help bosch went down to the sid lab on the third floor to see art donovan the criminologist had just come back from a crime scene and was sorting through evidence bags and checking the material against an evidence list he looked up as bosch was approaching howd you get in here harry i know the combination most detectives who worked rhd knew the doorlock combo bosch hadnt worked rhd in five years and they still hadnt changed it see donovan said thats how the trouble starts what trouble you coming in here while im handling evidence next thing you know some wiseass defense lawyer says it got tainted and i look like an asshole on national tv youre paranoid artie besides were not due for another trial of the century for at least a few years funny what do you want harry youre the second guy who said i was funny today what happened with my shoe prints and all the rest of the stuff the aliso case no the lindbergh case what do you think well i heard that aliso wasnt yours anymore im supposed to have everything ready for the fbi to pick up when is that donovan looked up from what he was doing for the first time they just said theyd send somebody by five then its still my case until they show up what about the shoe prints you pulled theres nothing about them i sent copies to the bureaus crime lab in dc to see if they could id the make and model and and nothing i havent heard back bosch every department in the country sends shit to them you know that and last i heard they dont drop everything theyre doing when a package from the lapd comes in it will probably be next week sometime before i hear back if im lucky shit its too late to call the east coast now anyway maybe monday i didnt know they suddenly became so important to you communication harry thats the secret you ought to try it sometime never mind that do you still have a set of copies yup can i get a set sure can but youre going to have to wait about twenty minutes or so till im done with this come on artie its probably just sitting in a file cabinet or something itll take you thirty seconds would you leave me alone donovan said with exasperation im serious harry yes its sitting in a file and it would only take me half a minute to get it for you but if i leave what im doing here i could get crucified when i testify in this case i can see it now some shyster all righteous and angry and saying you are telling this jury that while in the middle of handling evidence from this case you got up and handled evidence from another and you dont have to be f lee bailey anymore to make it sound good to a jury now leave me alone come back in a half hour fine artie ill leave you alone and buzz me when you come back dont just come in we gotta get that combination changed the last line he said more to himself than to bosch bosch left the way he had come in and took the elevator down to go outside and have a smoke he had to walk out to the curb and light up because it was now against departmental rules to stand outside the front door of parker center and smoke so many cops working there were addicted to cigarettes that there had often been a crowd outside the buildings main doors and a permanent haze of blue smoke had begun to hang over the entrance the chief thought this was unsightly and instituted the rule that if you left the building to smoke you had to leave the property as well now the front sidewalk along los angeles street often looked like the scene of a labor action with cops some even in uniform pacing back and forth in front of the building the only thing missing from the scene was picket signs the word was that the police chief had consulted with the city attorney to see if he could outlaw smoking on the sidewalk as well but he was told that the sidewalk was beyond the bounds of his control as bosch was lighting a second cigarette off the first he saw the huge figure of fbi agent roy lindell waltzing leisurely out of the glass doors of the police headquarters when he got to the sidewalk he turned right and headed toward the federal courthouse he was coming directly toward bosch lindell didnt see bosch until he was a few feet away it startled him what is this are you waiting for me no im having a cigarette lindell what are you doing none of your business he made a move to pass but bosch stopped him with the next line have a nice chat with chastain look bosch i was asked to come over and give a statement and i obliged i told the truth let the chips fall trouble is you dont know the truth i know you found that gun and i didnt put it there thats the truth part of it at least well its the only part i know and thats what i told him so have a good day he passed by bosch and harry turned around to watch him go once again he stopped him you people might be satisfied with only part of the truth but im not lindell turned around and stepped back to bosch whats that supposed to mean figure it out no you tell me we were all used lindell im going to find out by who when i do ill be sure to let you know look bosch you dont have the case anymore were working it and you better stay the fuck away from it yeah you guys are working the case all right bosch said sarcastically im sure youre pounding the pavement on this one let me know when you figure it out bosch its not like that we care about it give me one answer lindell what in the time you were under did tony aliso ever bring his wife over there to make a pickup lindell was quiet a moment while he decided whether to answer he finally shook his head not once he said tony always said she hated the place too many bad memories i guess bosch tried to remain cool memories of vegas lindell smiled for somebody who supposedly has all the answers you dont know much do you bosch tony met her in the club something like twenty years ago long before my time she was a dancer and tony was going to make her a movie star same story he was using on em to the end only after her i guess he got wise and learned not to marry every one of them did she know joey marks your one question is now up to three bosch did she i dont know what was her name back then thats another one i dont know ill see you around bosch he turned and walked away bosch threw his cigarette into the street and walked back toward the glass house a few minutes later after being properly buzzed through the door into the sid offices bosch found donovan at his desk again the criminalist lifted a thin file from the desk and handed it to harry you got copies in there he said same thing i sent the bureau what i did was shoot a copy of the negative and then shot the new negative and printed it in blackandwhite contrast for comparison purposes i also blew it up to actual size bosch didnt understand what donovan had just said except for the last part he opened the file there were two pages of copy paper with the shoe prints in black both were partial prints of the same right shoe but between the two partials almost all of the shoe was there donovan got up and looked at the open file he pointed to a tread ridge on one of the copies it was a curving line on the heel but the line was broken now if you find the shooter and he still has the shoes this is where youll get him see how that line is broken there that does not appear to be a manufacturers design this guy stepped on glass or something at some point and it cut the tread there its either that or a flaw in manufacturing but if you find the shoe well be able to make an id match that should send the boy away okay bosch said still looking at the copies now did you get anything even preliminary from the bureau on this not really ive got a guy i go to pretty regularly with this kind of stuff i know him seen him at a couple of the sid conventions anyway he called just to let me know he got the package and hed get on it as soon as he could he said that off the top of his head he thought it was one of those lightweight boots that are popular now you know theyre like work boots but theyre comfortable and wear like a pair of nikes okay artie thanks bosch drove over to the countyusc medical center and around to the parking lot by the railroad yard the coroners office was located at the far end of the medical center property and bosch went in through the back door after showing his badge to a security guard he checked dr salazars office first but it was empty he then went down to the autopsy floor and looked in the first suite where the lowered table that salazar always used was located salazar was there working on another body bosch stepped in and salazar looked up from the open chest cavity of what looked like the remains of a young black man harry what are you doing here this is a south bureau case i wanted to ask about the aliso case kind of got my hands full at the moment and you shouldnt be in here without a mask and gown i know you think you could have your assistant dub off a copy of the protocol for me no problem i heard the fbi took an interest in the case harry is that true thats what i hear funny thing those agents didnt bother talking to me they just came in and got a copy of the protocol the protocol only has conclusions none of the ruminating we doctors like to do so what would you have ruminated about with them if they had talked to you i would have told them my hunch harry which is salazar looked up from the body but kept his rubbergloved and bloody hands over the open chest so they wouldnt drip on anything else my hunch is that youre looking for a woman whys that the material in and below the eyes preparation h what nothing never mind what did you find the substance was analyzed and it came back oleo capsicum found it on the nasal swabs too know what oleo capsicum is better known as harry pepper spray shit harry you ruin my fun sorry so somebody sprayed him with pepper spray right again thats why i think its a woman someone who was either having problems controlling him or afraid of problems that makes me think its a woman besides all these women around here they all carry that stuff in their purses bosch wondered if veronica aliso was one of those women thats good sally anything else no surprises tests came back clean no amyl nitrate nope but that has a short retention we dont find it that often did you get anywhere with the slugs yeah we did all right can you call your guy take me to the intercom while salazar held his hands up in front of himself so they wouldnt touch anything bosch pushed his wheelchair to the nearby counter where there was a phone with an intercom attachment salazar told bosch which button to push and then ordered someone to make a copy of the protocol immediately for bosch thanks bosch said no problem hope it helps remember look for a woman who carries pepper spray in her purse not mace pepper spray right the endoftheweek traffic was intense and it took bosch nearly an hour to get out of downtown and back to hollywood when he got to the cat amp fiddle pub on sunset it was after six and as he walked through the gate he saw edgar and rider already sitting at a table in the openair courtyard there was a pitcher of beer on their table and they werent alone sitting at the table with them was grace billets the cat amp fiddle was a popular drinking spot with the hollywood cops because it was only a few blocks from the station on wilcox so bosch didnt know as he approached the table whether billets happened to be there by coincidence or because she knew of their freelance operation howdy folks bosch said as he sat down there was one empty glass on the table and he filled it from the pitcher he then held the glass up to the others and toasted to the end of another week harry rider said the lieutenant knows what weve been doing shes here to help bosch nodded and slowly looked at billets im disappointed that you didnt come to me first she said but i understand what you are doing i agree that it might be in the bureaus best interest to let this lie and not endanger their case but a man was murdered if theyre not going to look for the killer i dont see why we shouldnt bosch nodded he was almost speechless hed never had a boss who wasnt a rigid bythebook man grace billets was a major change of course she said we have to be very careful we screw this up and well have more than just the fbi mad at us the unspoken message was that their careers were at stake here well my positions already pretty much shot bosch said so if anything goes wrong i want you all to lay it on me thats bullshit rider said no its not you all are going places im not going anywhere hollywood is it for me and all of us here know it so if this thing hits the fan back out ill take the heat if you cant agree to that i want you to back out now there was silence for a few moments and then one by one the other three nodded okay then he said you may have told the lieutenant what youve been doing but id like to hear it myself weve come up with a few things not a lot rider said jerry went up the hill to see nash while i worked the computer and talked to a friend at the times first off i ran tony alisos trw credit report and got veronicas social security number off that i then ran that through the department of social security computer to try and get a work history and found out that veronica is not her real name the social comes back to jennifer gilroy born fortyone years ago in las vegas nevada no wonder she said she hated vegas she grew up there any work history nothing until she came out here and worked for tna productions what else before she could answer there was a loud commotion near the glass door to the interior bar the door opened and a large man in a bartenders jacket pushed a smaller man through the smaller man was disheveled and drunk and yelling something about the lack of respect he was getting the bartender roughly walked him to the courtyard gate and pushed him through as soon as the bartender turned to go back to the bar the drunk spun around and started back in the bartender turned around and pushed him so hard he fell backward onto the seat of his pants now embarrassed he threatened to come back and get the bartender a few people at some of the outside tables snickered the drunk got up and staggered out to the street they start early around here billets said go ahead kiz anyway i did an ncic run jennifer gilroy got picked up twice in vegas for soliciting this is going back more than twenty years i called over there and had them ship us the mugs and reports its all on fiche and they have to dig it out so we wont get it till next week there probably wont be much there anyway according to the computer neither case went to court she pleaded out and paid a fine each time bosch nodded it sounded like a routine disposal of routine cases thats all ive got on that as far as the times goes there was nothing on the search and my friend at variety didnt do much better veronica aliso was barely mentioned in the review of casualty of desire both she and the movie were panned but id like to see it anyway do you still have the tape harry on my desk does she get naked in it edgar asked if she does id like to see it too he was ignored okay what else rider said uh veronica also got a couple mentions in stories about movie premieres and who attended it wasnt a lot when you said she had fifteen minutes i think you confused minutes with seconds anyway thats it from me jerry edgar cleared his throat and explained that he had gone up to the gatehouse at hidden highlands and run into a problem when nash insisted on a new search warrant to look at the complete gate log edgar said he then spent the afternoon typing up the search warrant and hunting for a judge who hadnt left early for the weekend he eventually was successful and had a signed warrant which he planned to deliver the next morning kiz and i are goin up there in the morning well get a look at the gate log and then were probably going to hit some of the neighbors do some interviews like you said were hopin the widow will look out her window and catch our act maybe get a little spooked maybe panic make a mistake it was then boschs turn and he recounted his afternoon efforts including his runin with roy lindell and the agents recollection that veronica aliso had started her show business career as a stripper in vegas he also discussed salazars finding that tony aliso had been hit in the face with a blast of pepper spray shortly before his death and shared the deputy coroners hunch that it might have been a woman who sprayed him does he think she could have pulled this off by herself after hitting him with the pepper spray billets asked it doesnt matter because she wasnt alone bosch answered he pulled his briefcase onto his lap and took out the copies of the shoe prints donovan had recovered from the body and the bumper of the rolls he slid the pages to the middle of the table so the three others could look thats a size eleven shoe it belongs to a man artie says a big man so the woman if she was there could have sprayed him with the pepper but this guy finished the job bosch pointed to the shoe prints he put his foot right on the victim so he could lean in close and do the job pointblank very cool and very efficient probably a pro maybe someone she knew since her vegas days probably the one who planted the gun in vegas billets asked thats my guess bosch had been keeping his eye on the front gate of the courtyard just in case the drunk who had been tossed out decided to come back and make his point but when he glanced over now he didnt see the drunk he saw officer ray powers wearing mirrored glasses despite the lateness of the day entering the courtyard and being met halfway across by the bartender waving his arms in an animated fashion the bartender told the big cop about the drunk and the threats powers glanced around at the tables and saw bosch and the others when he had disengaged from the bartender he sauntered over so the detective bureau brain trust takes five he said thats right powers edgar said i think the guy youre looking for is out there pissing in the bushes yes suh ill jus go out there n fetch him boss powers looked around the table at the others with a satisfied smirk on his face he saw the copies of the shoe prints on the table and pointed at them with his chin is this what you dicks call an investigative strategy session well ill give you a tip those there are what they call shoe prints he smiled at his remark proud of it were off duty powers billets said why dont you go do your job and well worry about ours powers saluted her somebodys got to do the job dont they he walked away and out through the gate without waiting for a reply hes got one hell of a bug up his ass rider said hes just mad because i told his lieutenant about the fingerprint he left on our car billets said i think he got his ass chewed anyway back to business what do you think harry do we have enough to take a hard run at veronica i think we almost do im going to go up there with these guys tomorrow see whats on the gate log maybe well pay her a visit i just wish we had something concrete to talk to her about billets nodded i want to be kept informed tomorrow call me by noon will do the more time that goes by on this the harder it will be to keep this investigation among just us i think by monday were going to have to take stock and decide whether to turn what we have over to the bureau i dont see that bosch said shaking his head whatever we give them theyre just going to sit on if you want to clear this youve got to let us alone keep the bureau off us i will try harry but there will come a point where that will be impossible were running a fullscale investigation off the books here words going to get out it has to and all im saying is that it will be better if that word comes from me and can be controlled bosch nodded reluctantly he knew she was right but he had to fight her suggestion the case belonged to them it was his and all that had happened to him in the last week made it all the more personal he didnt want to give it up he gathered up the copies of the shoe prints and put them back in his briefcase he finished the last of his glass of beer and asked who and what he owed for it its on me billets said the next one after we clear this is on you its a deal when bosch got to his house he found the door locked but the key he had given eleanor wish was under the front mat the first thing he checked when he got inside was the hopper print it was still there on the wall but she was gone he made a quick scan of the rooms and found no note he checked the closet and her clothes were gone so was her suitcase he sat on the bed and thought about her leaving that morning they had left things open he had risen early and while she was still in bed watching him get ready for the day hed asked her what she was going to do during the day she had told him she didnt know now she was gone he rubbed a hand over his face he was already beginning to feel the loss of her and he replayed in his mind their conversations of the night before he had played it wrong he decided it had cost her something to tell him of her complicity and he had only evaluated it in terms of what it meant to him and to his case not to her not to them bosch leaned back until he was lying across the bed he spread his arms and stared up at the ceiling he could feel the beer working inside him making him tired okay he said out loud he wondered if she would call or if another five years would go by before he saw her again by happenstance he thought about how much had happened to him in the past five years and how long a wait that had been his body ached he closed his eyes okay he fell asleep and dreamed about being alone in a desert with no roads and miles of open desolate country ahead of him in every direction he looked part vi bosch picked up two containers of coffee and two glazed doughnuts from bobs in the farmers market at seven saturday morning then drove to the clearing where tony alisos body had been found in the trunk of his car as he ate and drank he looked out on the marine layer shrouding the quiet city below the sun rising behind the towers of downtown cast them as opaque monoliths in the haze it was beautiful but bosch felt as though he were the only one in the world seeing it when he had finished eating he used a napkin he had wet in the water fountain at the farmers market to clean the sticky residue of sugar off his fingers he then stuffed all the papers and the first empty coffee cup back into the doughnut bag and started the car bosch had fallen asleep early friday evening and awakened in his clothes before sunrise he felt the need to get out of the house and do something he had always believed that you could make things happen in an investigation by staying busy and with hard work he decided that he would use the morning to try to find the spot where tony alisos rollsroyce was intercepted and pulled over by his killers he concluded for a couple of reasons that the abduction had to have taken place on mulholland drive near the entrance to hidden highlands first the clearing where the car had been found was off mulholland if the abduction had taken place near the airport it was likely the car would have been dumped near the airport not fifteen miles away and second the abduction could be done more easily and quietly up on mulholland in the dark the airport and the surrounding area were always congested with traffic and people and would have presented too much of a risk the next question was whether aliso had been followed from the airport or his killers simply waited for him at the abduction spot on mulholland bosch decided on the latter figuring that it was a small operationtwo people topsand a tail and vehicle stop would be too iffy a proposition particularly in los angeles where every owner of a rollsroyce would be acutely aware of the danger of carjackings he thought that they had waited on mulholland and somehow created a trap or scene that made aliso stop his car even though he was carrying in cash in his briefcase and bosch guessed that the only way aliso would make such a stop was if that scenario involved his wife in his mind bosch saw the headlights of the rollsroyce sweeping around a curve and illuminating a frantically waving veronica aliso tony would stop for that bosch knew that the waiting spot had to be on a place on mulholland they were sure tony would pass there were only two logical routes from the airport to mulholland drive and then to the gatehouse at hidden highlands one way would be to go north on the freeway and simply take the mulholland drive exit the other way would have been to take la cienega boulevard from the airport north to laurel canyon and up the hill to mulholland the two routes had only a onemile stretch of mulholland in common and since there was no way of knowing for sure which route aliso would take home that night it seemed obvious to bosch that the car stop and abduction would have been somewhere along that one mile of road it was here that bosch came and for nearly an hour he drove back and forth along the stretch finally settling on the spot he would have chosen for the abduction if it had been his plan the location was at the bend in a hairpin curve a half mile from the hidden highlands gatehouse it was in an area with few homes and those that were there were built on the south side on a promontory well above the road on the north side the undeveloped land dropped steeply away from the road into a heavily wooded arroyo where eucalyptus and acacia trees crowded one another it was the perfect spot secluded out of sight once again bosch envisioned tony aliso coming around the curve and the lights of his rolls coming upon his own wife in the road aliso stops confusedwhat is she doing there he gets out and from the north side of the road her accomplice emerges she hits her husband with the spray the accomplice goes to the rolls and pops the trunk alisos hands are clawing at his eyes when he is roughly thrown into the trunk and his hands tied behind him all they had to worry about was a car coming around the curve and throwing its lights on them but at that late hour on mulholland it didnt seem likely the whole thing could have been done in fifteen seconds thats why the spray was used not because it was a woman but because it would make it fast bosch pulled off the road got out and looked around the spot had the right feel to him it was as quiet as death he decided that he would come back that night to see it in darkness to further confirm what he felt in his gut to be true he crossed the street and looked down into the arroyo where her accomplice would have hidden and waited looking down he tried to find a spot just off the road where a man could have ducked down and been concealed he noticed a dirt trail going into the woods and stepped down to it looking for shoe prints there were many prints and he squatted down to study them the ground here was dusty and some of the prints were fully recognizable he found prints from two distinctly different sets of shoes an old pair of shoes with worn heels and a much newer pair with heels that left sharp lines in the dirt neither pair was what he was looking for the workshoe pattern with the cut in the sole that donovan had noticed boschs eyes looked up from the ground and followed the trail into the brush and trees he decided to take a few more steps in lifted a branch of an acacia and ducked under it after his eyes adjusted to the darkness under the canopy of foliage they were drawn to a blue object he could see but not identify about twenty yards further into the dense growth he would have to leave the trail to get to it but he decided to investigate after slowly moving ten feet into the brush he could see that the blue object was part of a plastic tarp the kind you saw on roofs all over the city after an earthquake knocked down chimneys and opened up the seams of buildings bosch stepped closer and saw that two corners of the tarp were tied to trees and it was hung over the branch of a third creating a small shelter on a level portion of the hillside he watched for a few moments but saw no movement it was impossible to come up on the shelter quietly the ground was covered with a thick layer of dead and dried leaves and twigs that crackled under boschs feet when he was ten feet from the canvas tarp a mans hoarse voice stopped him ive got a gun you fuckers bosch stood stockstill and stared at the tarp because it was draped over the long branch of an acacia tree he was in a blind spot he could not see whoever it was who had yelled and the man who yelled probably couldnt see him bosch decided to take a chance ive got one too he called back and a badge police i didnt call the police there was a hysterical tinge to the voice now and bosch suspected he was dealing with one of the homeless wanderers who were dumped out of mental institutions during the massive cutbacks in public assistance in the s the city was teeming with them they stood at almost every major intersection holding their signs and shaking their change cups they slept under overpasses or burrowed like termites into the woods on the hillsides living in makeshift camps just yards from milliondollar mansions im just passing through bosch yelled you put down yours ill put down mine bosch guessed that the man behind the scared voice didnt even have a gun okay its a deal bosch unsnapped the holster under his arm but left his gun in place he walked the final few steps and came slowly around the trunk of the acacia a man with long gray hair and beard flowing over a blue silk hawaiian shirt sat crosslegged on a blanket under the tarp there was a wild look in his eyes bosch quickly scanned the mans hands and the surroundings within his immediate reach and saw no weapon he eased up a bit and nodded at the man hello he said i didnt do nothin i understand bosch looked around there were folded clothes and towels under the shelter of the tarp there was a small folding card table with a frying pan on it along with some candles and sterno cans two forks and a spoon but no knife bosch figured the man had the knife under his shirt or maybe hidden in the blanket there was also a bottle of cologne on the table and bosch could tell that it had been liberally sprinkled about the shelter also under the tarp were an old tar bucket filled with crushed aluminum cans a stack of newspapers and a dogeared paperback copy of stranger in a strange land he stepped to the edge of the mans clearing and squatted like a baseball catcher so they could face each other on the same level he took a look around the outer edge of the clearing and saw that this was where the man discarded what he didnt need there were bags of trash and remnants of clothing by the base of another acacia there was a brownandgreen suit bag it was unzipped and lying open like a gutted fish bosch looked back at the man he could see he wore two other hawaiian shirts beneath the blue one on top which had a pattern of hula girls on surfboards his pants were dirty but had a sharper crease in them than a homeless mans pants would usually have his shoes were too well polished for a man of the woods bosch guessed that the pair he wore had made some of the prints up on the trail the ones with the sharpedged heels thats a nice shirt bosch said its mine i know i just said it was nice whats your name names george george what george whatever the hell you want it to be okay george whatever the hell you want it to be why dont you tell me about that suit bag over there and those clothes youre wearing the new shoes where did it all come from it was delivered its mine now what do you mean by delivered delivered thats what i mean delivered they gave it all to me bosch took out his cigarettes took one and offered the pack to the man he waved them away cant afford it take me half a day to find enough cans to buy a pack of smokes i quit bosch nodded how long you been livin up here george all my life when did they kick you out of camarillo who told you that it had been an educated guess camarillo being the nearest state institution they did how long ago was that if they told you about me then they wouldve told you that im not stupid you know you got me there george about the bag and the clothes when was it all delivered i dont know bosch got up and went over to the suit bag there was an identification tag attached to the handle he turned it over and read anthony alisos name and address he noticed the bag was lying on top of a cardboard box that was damaged from a tumble down the hill bosch tipped the box with his foot and read the markings on the side scotch standard hst vhs count he left the box and the suit bag there and went back to the man and squatted again hows last friday night sound for the delivery whatever you say is good its not what i say george now if you want me to leave you alone and you want to stay here youve got to help me if you go into your nut bag youre not helping me when was it delivered george tucked his chin down on his chest like a boy whod been chastised by a teacher he brought a thumb and forefinger up and pressed them against his eyes his voice came out as if it were being strangled with piano wire i dont know they just came and dropped it off for me thats all i know who dropped it off george looked up his eyes bright and pointed upward with one of his dirty fingers bosch looked up and saw a patch of blue sky through the upper limbs of the trees he blew out his breath in exasperation this wasnt going anywhere so little green men dropped it down from their spaceship is that right george is that your story i didnt say that i dont know if they were green i didnt see them but you saw the spaceship nope i didnt say that neither i didnt see their craft only the landing lights bosch looked at him a moment perfect size george said they got an invisible beam that measures you from up there you dont even know it then they send down the clothes thats great boschs knees were beginning to ache he stood up and they painfully cracked im getting too old for this shit george thats a policemans line i watched kojak when i had the house i know tell you what im going to take this suit bag with me if you dont mind and the box of videotapes help yourself im not going anywhere and i dont have no video machine either bosch walked toward the box and bag wondering why they had been discarded and not just left in the rolls after a moment he decided they must have been in the trunk and in order to make room for aliso in there the killers had yanked them out and thrown them down the hill out of sight they were in a hurry it was the kind of decision made in haste a mistake he picked up the suit bag by a corner careful not to touch the handle though he doubted there would be any prints on it other than georges the box was light but bulky he would have to make a second trip for it he turned and looked at the homeless man he decided not to ruin his day yet george you can keep the clothes for now okay thanks youre welcome as he climbed back up the hill to the road bosch was thinking about how he should declare the area a crime scene and call out sid to process everything but he couldnt do that not without announcing he had been continuing an investigation he had been ordered away from it didnt bother him however because by the time he got up to the road he knew he had a new direction a plan was coming together quickly bosch was jazzed when he stepped onto level ground he punched his fist in the air and walked quickly to his car bosch worked out the details in his head while he was driving to hidden highlands the plan he had been like a cork floating in a great wide ocean that was the case bouncing with the currents not in control of anything but now he had an idea a plan that would hopefully draw veronica aliso into the box nash was in the gatehouse when bosch pulled up he stepped out and leaned down on boschs door morning detective bosch howzit going captain nash its going i gotta say your people are creating a bit of a stir already this morning yeah well that can happen whaddaya gonna do go with the flow i guess you going in to catch up with them or you heading to mrs alisos im going to see the lady good maybe thatll get her off my back i gotta call you know whys she on your back shes just been calling up wondering why you people have been talkin to the neighbors all morning what did you tell her i told her they got a job to do and a murder investigation requires them to talk to a lot of people thats good ill see you nash waved him off and opened the gate bosch drove to the aliso house but before he got there he saw edgar walking from the front door of the home next door to his car bosch stopped and waved him over harry jerry get anything yet nah not really thing about these rich neighborhoods its like working a shooting in south central nobody ever wants to talk nobody saw nothing i get tired of these people wheres kiz shes working the other side of the street we met at the station and took one car shes on foot down there somewhere hey harry what do you think about her kiz i think shes good no i dont mean as a cop you knowwhat do you think bosch looked at him you mean like you and her what do i think yeah me and her bosch knew edgar was six months divorced and starting to pull his head out of the sand again but he also knew something about kiz that he didnt have the right to tell him i dont know jerry partners shouldnt get involved i suppose so you going to see the widow now yeah maybe i better go with you you never know if she figures out we think shes it then shes liable to wig out maybe try to take you out i doubt it shes too cool for that but lets go find kiz i think both of you should come ive got a plan now veronica aliso was waiting for them at her door ive been waiting for you people to come by to explain just what is going on sorry mrs aliso bosch said weve been kind of busy she ushered them in can i get you something she asked over her shoulder as she led them in i think were fine part of the plan was for bosch to do all the talking if possible rider and edgar were to intimidate her with their silence and their coldeyed stares bosch and rider sat where they had sat before and so did veronica aliso edgar remained standing on the periphery of the seating section of the living room he put his hand on the mantel of the fireplace and the look on his face said he would rather be anywhere else on the planet on this saturday morning veronica aliso was wearing blue jeans a light blue oxford shirt and dirty work boots her hair was pulled back and pinned up in the back she was still very attractive though obviously dressing down through her open collar bosch could see a scattering of freckles that he knew from her video went all the way down her chest are we interrupting something bosch asked were you about to go out i wanted to go to the burbank stables sometime today if i could i keep a horse there my husbands body was cremated and i want to take his ashes up the trail into the hills he loved the hills bosch somberly nodded well this wont take too long first off youve seen us in the neighborhood this morning were just conducting a routine canvass you never know maybe someone saw something maybe somebody watching the house or a car here that shouldnt have been here you never know well i think id be the one who would know about any car that shouldnt be here well i mean if you werent here if you were out and someone was here you probably wouldnt know how could they get in past the gate its a long shot we know mrs aliso its all weve got right now she frowned theres nothing else what about what you told me the other day about this man in las vegas well mrs aliso i hate to tell you this but we went down the wrong path on that we gathered a lot of information about your husband and initially it looked like that was the way to go but it didnt work out we do think were moving in the right direction now and were going to make up for the lost time she seemed genuinely stunned i dont understand the wrong path yes well i can explain it to you if you want to hear it but it involves your husband and some unsavory things detective ive prepared myself over the last few days for anything tell me mrs aliso as i think i indicated to you on our last visit your husband was involved with some very dangerous people in las vegas i think i mentioned them joey marks and luke goshen i dont recall she kept the look of bewilderment on her face she was good bosch had to give that to her she might not have made it in the film business but she could act when she needed to to put it bluntly theyre mobsters bosch said organized crime and it looks like your husband had been working for them for a long time he took mob money from vegas and put it into his films laundered it through then he gave it back to them after taking out a fee it was a lot of money and thats where we went down the wrong path your husband was about to get audited by the irs did you know that audited no he didnt tell me anything about an audit well we found out about the audit which likely would have revealed his illegal activities and we thought maybe these people he did business with became aware of it too and had him killed so he wouldnt be able to talk about their business only we dont think that anymore i dont understand are you sure of this it seems obvious to me that these people had some involvement she faltered a little bit there her voice was a little too urgent well like i said we thought that too we havent fully dropped it but so far it doesnt check out the man we arrested over there in vegas this goshen fellow i mentioned he looked pretty good for it i have to say but then his alibi turned out to be a rock we couldnt break it couldnt have been him mrs aliso it looks as though somebody went to great lengths to make it look like it was him even planted a gun in his house but we know it wasnt she looked at him with dull eyes for a moment and then shook her head then she made her first real mistake she should have said that if it wasnt goshen then it was probably the other one bosch had mentioned or some other mobster associate but she said nothing and that instinctively told bosch that she knew of the setup on goshen she now knew the plan hadnt worked and her mind was probably scrambling so then what will you do she finally asked oh we already had to let him go no i mean about the investigation whats next well were sort of starting from scratch looking at it like maybe it was a planned robbery you said his watch wasnt taken right it wasnt but the las vegas angle wasnt a total waste we found out that your husband was carrying a lot of money with him when he landed here that night he was taking it back here to run through his company to clean it up it was a lot of money nearly a million dollars he was carrying it for a million dollars that was her second mistake to bosch her emphasis on million and her shock betrayed her knowledge that there had been far less than that in tony alisos briefcase bosch watched as her eyes stared blankly and all her movement was interior he guessedand hopedshe was now wondering where the rest of the money was yes he said see the man who gave your husband the money the one we first thought was a suspect is an fbi agent who infiltrated the organization your husband worked for that is why his alibi is so solid anyway he told us that your husband was carrying a million dollars it was all in cash and there was so much that he couldnt fit it all into his briefcase he had to put about half of it in his suit bag he paused for a few moments he could tell the story was playing in her internal theater her eyes had that faraway look in them he remembered that look from her movie but this time it was for real he hadnt even finished the interview but she was already making plans he could see it was the money marked by the fbi she asked i mean could they trace it that way no unfortunately their agent did not have it long enough to do that there was too much of it frankly but the transaction did take place in an office with a hidden video camera there is no doubt tony left there with a million dollars uh bosch paused to open his briefcase and quickly consult a page from a file actually it was a million seventysix thousand all in cash veronicas eyes went down to the floor as she nodded bosch studied her but his concentration was interrupted when he thought he heard a sound from somewhere in the house it suddenly occurred to him that maybe there was someone else there they had never asked did you hear that bosch asked what i thought i heard something are you alone in the house yes i thought i heard a bump or something you want me to look around edgar offered oh no veronica said quickly uh it probably was just the cat bosch didnt remember seeing any sign of a cat when he had been in the house before he glanced at kiz and saw her almost imperceptibly turn her head to signal she didnt remember a cat either he decided to let it go for the time being anyway he said thats why were canvassing and thats why were here we need to ask you some questions they might go over some of the same ground weve covered before but like i said were kind of starting over it wont take too much longer then youll be able to go to the stables fine go ahead would you mind if i have a drink of water first no of course not im sorry i should have asked anybody else want something ill pass edgar said im fine rider said veronica aliso stood up and headed toward the hallway bosch gave her a head start and then stood up and followed you did ask he said to her back but i turned it down i didnt think id get thirsty he followed her into the kitchen where she opened a cabinet and took down a glass bosch looked around it was a large kitchen with stainlesssteel appliances and black granite countertops there was a center island with a sink in it tap waterd be fine for me he said taking the glass from her and filling it at the island he turned and leaned against the counter and drank from it he then poured the rest out and put the glass on the counter thats all you want yes just needed something to wash the dust down i guess he smiled and she didnt well then should we go back to the living room she asked thatd be fine he followed her out of the kitchen just before he entered the hallway he turned back and his eyes swept across the graytiled floor he didnt see what he thought should be there bosch spent the next fifteen minutes asking mostly questions that had been asked six days earlier and that had little bearing on the case now he was going through the motions the finishing touches the trap was baited and this was his way of quietly stepping back from it finally when he thought he had said and asked enough bosch closed the notebook in which he had been scribbling notes hed never look at again and stood up he thanked her for her time and veronica aliso walked the three detectives to the door bosch was the last one out and as he stepped over the threshold she spoke to him he somehow knew that she would there were parts to her act that had to be played as well keep me informed detective bosch please keep me informed bosch turned and looked back at her oh i will if anything happens youll be the first to know bosch drove edgar and rider back to their car he didnt speak about the interview until he pulled in behind it so what do you think he asked as he got out his cigarettes i think we sunk the hook but good edgar said yeah rider said its going to be interesting bosch lit a cigarette what about the cat he asked what edgar asked the noise in the house she said it was the cat but in the kitchen there were no food bowls on the floor maybe they were outside edgar offered bosch shook his head i think people who keep cats inside feed them inside he said in the hills youre supposed to keep em in coyotes anyway i dont like cats i get allergic to them i can usually tell when somebody has a cat i dont think she has a cat kiz you didnt see a cat in there did you i spent all monday morning in there and i never saw a cat you think maybe it was the guy then edgar asked whoever she worked this with maybe i think somebody was in there maybe her lawyer nah lawyers dont hide like that they come out and confront true should we watch the place see who comes out edgar asked bosch thought a moment no bosch said they spot us and theyll know the money thing is just bait better we let it go better just to get out of here go get set up we gotta get ready part vii during his time in vietnam boschs primary assignment had been to fight the war in the tunnel networks that ranged beneath the villages in the cu chi province to go into the darkness they called the black echo and to come back alive but the tunnel work was done quickly and between those missions he spent days in the bush fighting and waiting under the jungle canopy one time he and a handful of others got cut off from their unit and bosch spent a night sitting in the elephant grass his back pressed against the back of an alabama boy named donnel fredrick listening as a company of vc fighters moved through they sat there and waited for charlie to stumble onto them there was nothing else they could do and there were too many to fight so they waited and the minutes went by like hours they all made it through though donnel was later killed in a foxhole by a direct mortar hitfriendly fire bosch always thought that night in the elephant grass was the closest hed ever come to experiencing a miracle bosch remembered that night sometimes when he was alone on a stakeout or in a tight spot he thought about it now as he sat crosslegged against the base of a eucalyptus tree ten yards from the tarp the homeless man george had erected over his clothes he wore a green plastic poncho he always kept in the trunk of his work car the candy bars he had with him were hersheys chocolate with almonds the same kind he had taken with him into the bush so long ago and like that night in the tall grass he had not moved for what seemed like hours it was dark with only a glimmer of moonlight making it down through the overhead canopy and he was waiting he wanted a cigarette but couldnt afford to open a flame in the blackness every now and then he thought he could hear edgar make a move or readjust himself twenty yards to his right but he couldnt be sure that it was his partner and not a deer or maybe a coyote passing through george had told him there were coyotes when he had put the old man into the back of kizs car for the ride to the hotel they were putting him up in he had warned bosch but bosch wasnt afraid of coyotes the old man had not gone easily he was sure they were there to take him back to camarillo and the truth was he should have been going back there but the institution wouldnt have him not without a governmentpunched ticket instead he was going to be treated to a couple of nights at the mark twain hotel in hollywood it wasnt a bad place bosch had lived there for more than a year while his house was being rebuilt the worst room there beat a tarp in the woods hands down but bosch knew george might not see it that way by eleventhirty the traffic up on mulholland had thinned down to a car every five minutes or so bosch couldnt see them because of the incline and the thickness of the brush but he could hear them and see the lights wash through the foliage above him as the cars made the curve he was alert now because a car had slowly gone by twice in the last fifteen minutes once each way bosch had sensed that it was the same car because the engine was overthrottled to compensate for a skip in the engine stroke and now it was back for a third time bosch listened intently as he heard the familiar engine and this time there was the added sound of tires turning on gravel the car was pulling off the road in a few moments the engine stopped and the following silence was punctuated only by the sound of a car door being opened and then closed bosch slowly got up on his haunches as painful as it was on his knees and got ready he looked into the darkness to his right toward edgars position and saw nothing he then looked up the incline toward the edge and waited in a few moments he could see the beam of a flashlight cut through the brush the light was pointed downward and was moving in a backandforth sweeping pattern as its holder slowly descended the hill toward the tarp under his poncho bosch held his gun in one hand and a flashlight in the other his thumb paused on the switch and ready to turn it on the movement of the light stopped bosch guessed that its holder had found the spot where the suit bag should have been after a moment of seeming hesitation the beam was lifted and it swept through the woods flicking across bosch for a fraction of a second but it didnt come back to him instead it held on the blue tarp as bosch guessed it probably would the light began advancing its holder stumbling once as he or she went toward georges home a few moments later bosch saw the beam moving behind the blue plastic he felt another charge of adrenaline begin to course through his body again his mind flashed on vietnam this time it was the tunnels that he thought of coming upon an enemy in the darkness the fear and thrill of it it was only after he had left that place safely that he acknowledged to himself there had been a thrill to it and in looking to replace that thrill he had joined the cops bosch slowly raised himself hoping his knees wouldnt crack as he watched the light they had placed the suit bag in underneath the shelter after stuffing it first with crumpled newspaper bosch began to move as quietly as he could in behind the tarp he was coming from the left according to the plan edgar would be coming from the right but it was still too dark for bosch to see him bosch was ten feet away now and could hear the excited breathing of the person under the tarp then there was the sound of a zipper being pulled open followed by the sharp cutoff of breath shit bosch moved in after hearing the curse he realized he recognized the mans voice just as he came around the open side of the tarp and raised both his weapon and his flashlight from beneath his poncho freeze police bosch yelled at the same moment he put on his light all right come out of there powers almost immediately edgars light came on from boschs right what the edgar started to say crouched there in the crossing beams of light was officer ray powers in full uniform the big patrol cop held a flashlight in one hand and a gun in the other a look of utter surprise played across his face his mouth dropped open bosch he said what the fuck are you doing here thats our line powers edgar said angrily dont you know what the fuck you just did you walked right into awhat are you doing here man powers lowered his gun and slid it back into its holster i wasthere was a report somebody mustve seen you guys sneaking in here they said they saw two men sneaking around bosch stepped back from the tarp keeping his gun raised come out of there powers he said powers did as he was commanded bosch put the beam from his light right in the mans face what about this report who called it in just some guy driving by up on the road mustve seen you going in here can you get the light out of my face bosch didnt move the focus of the light an inch then what he asked whod he call bosch knew that after rider had dropped them off her job was to park on a nearby street and keep her scanner on if there had been such a radio call she would have heard it and called off the patrol response telling the dispatcher it was a surveillance operation he didnt call it in i was cruising by and he waved me down you mean he claimed he just saw two guys going into the woods uh no no he waved me down earlier i just didnt get a chance to check it out until now bosch and edgar had gone into the woods at twothirty it was full daylight then and powers hadnt even been on duty yet and the only car that had been in the area at the time was riders bosch knew powers was lying and it was all beginning to fall into place his finding the body his fingerprint on the trunk the pepper spray on the victim the reason the bindings were taken off the wrists it was already there in the details how much earlier bosch asked uh it was right after i came on duty i cant remember the time daylight yeah daylight can you put the fuckin light down bosch ignored him again what was the citizens name i didnt get it just some guy in a jag he waved me down at laurel canyon and mulholland told me what he saw and i said id check it when i got the chance so i was checking it out and saw the bag here i figured it belonged to the guy in the trunk i saw the bulletin you people put out about the car and the luggage so i knew you were looking for it sorry i blew it but you people shouldve let the watch commander know what you were doing jesus bosch im going blind here yeah its blown all right bosch said finally lowering the light he lowered his gun to his side also but didnt put it away he kept it ready there under the poncho might as well pack it in now powers go on up the hill to your car jerry grab the bag bosch climbed up the hill behind powers careful to keep the light up and back on the patrol cop he knew that if they had cuffed powers down by the tarp theyd never get him up the hill because of the steep terrain and because powers might fight them so he had to scam him he let him think he was clear at the top of the hill bosch waited until edgar came up behind them before making a move know what i dont get powers he said what bosch i dont get why you waited until dark to check out a complaint you got during the day youre told that two suspiciouslooking characters went into the woods and you decide to wait until its late and its dark to check it out by yourself i told you didnt have the time youre full of shit powers edgar said he had either just caught on or had played along with bosch perfectly bosch saw powerss eyes go dead as he went inside to try to figure out what to do in that instant bosch raised his gun again and aimed it at a spot between those two vacant portals dont think so much powers he said its over now stand still jerry edgar moved in behind the big cop and yanked his gun out of its holster he dropped it on the ground and jerked one of powerss hands behind his back he cuffed the hand and then he did the other when he was done he picked up the gun it seemed to bosch that powers was still inside still staring blankly at nothing then he came back you people you have just fucked up big time he said controlled rage in his voice well see about that jerry you got him i want to call kiz go ahead i got his ass i hope he does make a move go ahead powers do something stupid for me fuck you edgar you dont know what youve just done youre goin down bro youre going down edgar remained silent bosch took the motorola twoway out of his pocket turned it on and keyed the mike kiz you there here im here come on over hurry on my way bosch put the twoway back and they stood there in silence for a minute until they saw the flashing blue light lead riders car around the bend when it pulled up the lights swept repeatedly through the tops of the trees on the incline bosch realized that from below down in georges shelter the lights on the trees might look as if they were coming from the sky it all came to bosch then georges spacecraft had been powerss patrol car the abduction had been a traffic stop the perfect way to get a man carrying nearly a half million in cash to stop powers had simply waited for alisos white rolls probably at mulholland and laurel canyon then followed and put the lights on when they approached the secluded curve tony probably thought he had been speeding he pulled over rider pulled off the road behind the patrol car bosch came over and opened the back door and looked in at her harry what is it she asked powers powers is it oh my god yeah i want you and jerry to take him in ill follow with his car he walked back over to edgar and powers okay lets go you people have all lost your jobs powers said you fucked yourselves up you can tell us about it at the station bosch jerked him by the arm feeling its thickness and strength he and edgar then hustled him into the back of riders car edgar went around and got in the other side next to him looking in through the open rear door bosch went over what would be the procedure take all his shit away and lock him in one of the interview rooms he said make sure you get his cuff key ill be right behind you bosch slammed the door and knocked twice on the roof he then went to the patrol car put the suit bag in the back seat and got in rider pulled out and bosch followed they sped west toward laurel canyon it took billets less than an hour to come in when she got there the three of them were sitting at the homicide table bosch was going through the murder book with rider while she took notes on a legal pad edgar was at the typewriter billets walked in with a force and look on her face that clearly showed the situation bosch hadnt talked to her yet it had been rider who had called her in from home what are you doing to me billets asked her piercing eyes clearly fixed on bosch what she was really saying to him was that he was the team leader and the responsibility for this potential fuckup rested squarely on him that was okay with bosch because not only was that right and fair but in the half hour hed had to go through the murder book and the other evidence his confidence had grown what am i doing to you im bringing in your killer i told you to conduct a quiet and careful investigation billets responded i didnt tell you to conduct some kind of halfassed sting operation and then drag a cop in here i cant believe this billets was now pacing behind riders back without looking at them the squad room was deserted except for the three of them and the angry lieutenant its powers lieutenant bosch said if youd calm down we oh its him is it you have the evidence of that great ill call a da in here right now and well write up the charges then because you really had me worried there for a minute that you three jerked this guy off the street with just enough probable cause to charge him with jaywalking now she was looking at bosch with the angry eyes again she had even stopped her pacing to level them at him he responded as calmly as he could first of all it was my decision to take him off the street and youre right we dont have enough to call out a da yet but well get it theres no doubt in my mind hes the man its him and the widow well im glad theres no doubt in your mind but youre not the da or the goddamned jury he didnt respond it was no use he had to wait for her anger to ebb and then they could talk sensibly where is he billets asked room three bosch said what did you tell the watch commander nothing it happened at the end of shift powers was going to grab the suit bag and then go punch out we were able to bring him in while most everybody else was still up in roll call i parked his car and dropped the key at the watch office i told the watch lieutenant we were using powers for a little while on a warrant that we wanted a uniform with us when we knocked on a door he said fine and then i expect he went off shift as far as i know nobody knows we have him back there billets thought for a moment when she spoke she was calmer and more like the person who normally sat behind the desk in the glass office okay im going to go back there and get some coffee see if i get asked about him when i come back well go over all of this in detail and see what we have she walked slowly to the hallway at the rear of the squad room that led to the watch office bosch watched her go and then picked up the phone and dialed the number of the security office of the mirage hotel and casino he told the officer who answered who he was and that he needed to speak with hank meyer immediately when the officer mentioned that it was after midnight bosch told him it was an emergency and that he was sure that if meyer was informed who needed to speak with him he would return the call bosch gave him all the numbers he could be reached at beginning with his number at the homicide table and hung up he went back to his work with the murder book did you say hes in three bosch looked up billets was back a cup of steaming coffee in her hand he nodded i want to have a look she said bosch got up and walked with her down the hallway to the four doors leading to the interview rooms doors marked one and two were on the left three and four on the right but there was no fourth interview room the room marked four was actually a small cubicle with a oneway glass window that allowed for observation of room three in three the other side of the glass was a mirror billets entered four and looked through the glass at powers he sat ramrod straight at a table in a chair directly opposite the mirror his hands were cuffed behind his back he still wore his uniform but his equipment belt had been removed he stared straight ahead at his own reflection in the mirror this created an eerie effect in the fourth room because it appeared that he was looking right at them as if there were no mirror or glass between them billets said nothing she just looked back at the man staring at her there is a lot hanging in the balance tonight harry she said quietly i know he said they stood there silently for a few moments until edgar opened the door and told bosch that hank meyer was on the phone bosch headed back picked up the phone and told meyer what he needed meyer said he was at home and that hed have to go into the hotel but he would call back as soon as possible bosch thanked him and hung up billets had now taken one of the empty seats at the homicide table okay she said one of you tell me exactly how this went down tonight bosch remained in the lead and took the next fifteen minutes to recount how he found tony alisos suit bag set up the sting through veronica aliso and then waited in the woods off mulholland until powers showed up he explained how the story powers had offered for his being there did not make sense what else did he say billets asked at the end nothing jerry and kiz put him in the room and thats where hes been ever since what else have you got for starters we have his print on the inside of the trunk lid we also have a record of association with the widow billets raised her eyebrows thats what we were working on when you came in on sunday night when jerry ran the victims name through the computer we got a hit on a burglary report from back in march somebody hit the aliso house jerry pulled the report but it looked unconnected just a routine burglary and it was except the officer who took the initial report from mrs aliso was powers we think the relationship started with the burglary thats when they met after that we have the gate records police patrols of hidden highlands are recorded on the gate logs by the cars roof number the logs show the car assigned to powersthe zebra carhas been going in there two three nights a week on patrol always on the nights we know from credit card records that tony was out of town i think he was poppin over there to see veronica what else the lieutenant asked so far all youve got is a bunch of coincidences strung together there are no coincidences bosch said not like this then what else have you got like i said his story about why he came down into the woods doesnt check out he came down looking for the suit bag and the only way he would have known that it was worth coming back for was through veronica its him lieutenant its him billets thought about this bosch believed the facts he was giving her were beginning to have a cumulative effect in convincing her he had one thing left with which to nail her down theres one other thing remember our problem with veronica if she was involved in this how did she get out of hidden highlands and not have it noted on the gate log right well the gate log shows that on the night of the murder the zebra car cruised through on patrol twice he was in and out both times first time he was logged in at ten and out at tenten then back in at elevenfortyeight and out four minutes later it was noted as just routine patrol okay so so on the first time he cruises in and picks her up she gets down on the floor in the back its dark out the gate guy only sees powers heading back out they go and wait for tony do the deed and then powers takes her back homethe second set of entries on the log it works billets said nodding her approval the actual abduction how do you see it weve figured all along it took two people to do this job first off veronica had to know from tony what flight he was taking so that set the time frame powers picks her up that night and they go to laurel canyon and mulholland and wait for the white rolls to go by we figure that happens about eleven or so powers follows until tony is close to the curve through the woods he puts on the lights and pulls him over like a routine traffic stop only he tells tony to step out and go to the back of the car maybe he makes him open the trunk maybe he does that himself after he cuffs him either way the trunk is opened and powers has a problem tonys suit bag and a box of videos are in the trunk and that doesnt leave much room for him powers doesnt have much time a car could come around the bend any moment and light up the whole thing so he takes the suit bag and the box out and throws them down the hill into the woods he then tells tony to get in the trunk tony says no or maybe he struggles a bit either way powers takes out his pepper spray and gives him a shot in the face tony is then real manageable easy to throw into the trunk maybe powers pulled his shoes off then to stop him from kicking around in there making noise thats when veronica pops out rider said picking up the story she drives the rolls while powers follows in the squad car they knew where they were going they needed a spot where the car wouldnt be found for a couple days giving powers time to get over to vegas on saturday plant the gun and lay down a few more clues like the anonymous call to metro that call was what was supposed to put the finger on luke goshen not the fingerprints that was just luck for them anyway thats getting ahead of the story veronica drives the rolls and powers follows to the clearing over the bowl she pops the trunk and powers leans in and does the job or maybe he puts one cap in tony and he makes veronica do the second that way theyre partners for good partners in blood billets nodded a serious look on her face it seems kind of risky what if he had to take a radio call the whole plan would go down the drain we thought of that and jerry checked with the watch office gomez was the co friday night he says he remembers that powers had such a busy shift he didnt take a dinner break until ten he doesnt recall hearing from him until just before end of watch billets nodded again what about the shoe prints recovered are they his powers got lucky there edgar said hes wearing brandnew boots in there looks like he maybe just bought em today shit yeah bosch said we figure he saw the shoe prints on the table last night at the cat and fiddle he went out and got new ones today oh man well maybe theres still a chance he didnt get rid of the old ones were working on a search warrant for his place oh and our luck aint so bad either jerry tell her about the spray edgar leaned forward on the table i went back to the supply post took a look at the sheet on sunday powers signed out an oc cartridge only i then went and looked at the fiftyone list in the watch loos office no useofforce reported by powers in this deployment period so billets said he somehow used his pepper spray because he had to get a refill cartridge but he never reported using the spray to his watch commander right billets thought about things for a few moments before speaking again okay she said what youve come up with quickly is all good stuff but its not enough its a circumstantial case and most of this can be explained away even if you could prove he and the widow have been meeting it doesnt prove murder the fingerprint on the trunk can be explained by sloppy work at the crime scene who knows maybe thats all it really was i doubt it bosch said well your doubts arent good enough where do we go from here we still have some things in the fire jerrys going for a warrant based on what weve got so far if we get inside powerss house maybe we find the shoes maybe we find something else well see i also have an angle in vegas working we figure that for them to have pulled this off powers had to have followed tony over there once or twice you know to know about goshen and pick him to hang it all on if were lucky powers wouldve wanted to stay right on tony that would mean staying at the mirage you cant stay there without a trail you can pay cash but youve got to give a legit credit card imprint to cover room charges phone calls things like that in other words you cant register under any name you dont have on a credit card ive got a guy checking okay its a start billets said she nodded her head cupped a hand over her mouth and lapsed into a contemplative silence for a long moment what it all comes down to is that we need to break him dont we she finally asked bosch nodded probably unless we get lucky with the warrant youre not going to break him hes a cop he knows the angles he knows the rules of evidence well see she looked at her watch bosch looked at his and saw it was now one oclock were in trouble billets said solemnly we wont be able to contain this much past dawn after that i will have to make proper notification of what weve done and what weve got going if that happens you can count on us not being involved and worse bosch leaned forward go back home lieutenant he said you were never here let us have the night come back in at nine tomorrow bring a da back with you if you want make sure its somebody who will go to the edge with you if you dont know one i can call somebody but give us till nine eight hours then you come in and we either have the complete package tied up for you or you go ahead and do what you have to do she looked carefully at each one of them took a deep breath and exhaled slowly good luck she said she nodded got up and left them there outside the door to interview room three bosch paused and composed his thoughts he knew that everything would turn on what happened inside the room he had to break powers and that would be no easy task powers was a cop he knew all the tricks but somehow bosch had to find a weakness he could exploit until the big man went down he knew it was going to be a brutal match he blew out his breath and opened the door bosch stepped into the interview room took the chair directly across from powers and spread out the two sheets of paper he carried with him in front of powers okay powers im here to tell you whats what you can save it asshole the only one i want to talk to is my lawyer well thats what im here for why dont you take it easy and well talk about it take it easy you people arrest me hook me up like a goddamn criminal and then leave me in here for a fucking hour and a half while you sit out there and figure out how fucked up this is and you want me to take it easy what planet are you on bosch im not taking anything easy now cut me loose or give me the goddamn phone well thats the problem isnt it deciding whether to book you or cut you loose thats why i came in powers i thought maybe you could help us out on that powers didnt appear to pick up on that his eyes dropped to the center of the table and they were workingsmall quick movements looking for the angles this is what is what bosch said if i book you now then we call the lawyer and we both know that is going to be that no lawyer is gonna let his client talk to the cops well just have to go to court and you know what that means youll be suspended no pay well go for no bail and youll sit in the can nine ten months and then maybe it gets straightened out in your favor and maybe not meantime youre all over the front page your mother father neighborswell you know how that goes bosch took out a cigarette and put it in his mouth he didnt light it and he didnt offer one to powers he remembered offering one to the big cop at the crime scene and being turned down the alternative to that he continued is that we sit here and try to get this straightened out right now youve got two forms there in front of you the good thing about dealing with a cop like this is i dont really need to explain this stuff to you the first ones a rights form you know what that is you sign that you understand your rights and then you make your choice talk to me or call your lawyer after we book you the second form is the attorney waiver powers stared silently down at the pages and bosch put a pen down on the table ill take the cuffs off when youre ready to sign bosch said see now the bad thing about dealing with a cop is that i cant bluff you you know the game you know if you sign that waiver and talk to me youll either talk yourself out of this or right into iti can give you more time to think about it if you want i dont need any more time he said take off the cuffs bosch got up and went around behind powers you right or left right there was barely enough room between the back of the big man and the wall to work on the cuffs it was a dangerous position to be in with most suspects but powers was a cop and he probably knew that the moment he became violent was the moment he lost any chance of getting out of this room and back to his life he also had to assume someone was watching and ready behind the glass in room four bosch unhooked the right cuff and closed it around one of the metal slats of the chair powers scribbled signatures across both forms bosch tried to give no indication of his excitement powers was making a mistake bosch took the pen from him and put it in his pocket put your arm behind you come on bosch treat me like a human if were going to talk lets talk put your arm behind you powers did as he was told and blew out his breath in frustration bosch recuffed his wrists through the metal slat at the back of the chair and then took his seat again he cleared his throat going over the last details in his mind he knew his mission here he had to make powers believe he had the edge that he had a chance to get out if he believed that then he might start talking if he started talking bosch thought he could win the fight okay bosch said im going to lay it out for you if you can convince me that we have it wrong then youll be out of here before the suns up thats all i want powers we know you have a relationship with veronica aliso predating her husbands death we know you followed him to vegas on at least two occasions prior to the killing powers kept his eyes on the table in front of him but bosch was able to read them like the needles of a polygraph machine there had been a slight tremor in the pupils when bosch mentioned las vegas thats right bosch said weve got the records from the mirage that was careless powers leaving a record like that we can put you in vegas with tony aliso so i like goin to vegas big deal tony aliso was there wow what a coincidence from what i heard he went there a lot what else you got weve got your print powers fingerprint inside the car you got a refill of pepper spray on sunday but you never filed a useofforce report explaining how you used it accidental discharge i didnt file a useofforce because there wasnt any you havent got shit my fingerprint youre right youve probably got prints but i was in that car asshole im the one who found the body remember this is a joke man im thinking i better just get my lawyer in here and take my chances no da is going to touch this bullshit with a tenfoot pole bosch ignored the baiting and went on and last but not least we have your little climb down the hill tonight your story is for shit powers you went down there to look for alisos suit bag because you knew it was there and you thought it had something you and the widow overlooked before about a half million dollars the only question i really have is whether she called you up and told you or if that was you in her house this morning when we dropped by bosch saw the pupils jump again slightly but then they went flat like i said ill take that lawyer now i guess youre just the errand boy right she told you to go and get the money while she waited at the mansion powers started laughing in a fake way i like that bosch errand boy too bad i barely know the woman but its a good try good try i like you too bosch but i gotta tell you something he leaned across the table and lowered his voice i ever run across you again on the outside you know when its just me and you head to head im going to seriously fuck you up he straightened up again and nodded bosch smiled you know i dont think i was sure until now but now im sure you did it powers youre the man and there is never going to be an outside for you never so tell me whose idea was it was she the first one to bring it up or was that you powers stared sullenly down at the table and shook his head let me see if i can figure it out bosch said i guess you went up there to that big house and saw all that they had the money maybe heard about tony and his rolls and it just went on from there im betting it was your idea powers but i think she knew you would come up with it see shes a smart woman she knew you would come up with it and she waited and you know what weve got nothing on her nothing she played you perfect man right down the line shes going to do the walk and youhe pointed at powerss chestare going to do the time is that how you want it powers leaned back a bemused smile on his face you dont get it do you powers said youre the errand boy here but look at yourself youve got nothin to deliver look at what youve got you cant tie me to aliso i found the body man i opened the car if you found a print then thats when i left it all the rest is a bunch of bullshit adding up to nothing you go in to see a prosecutor with that theyre going to laugh your ass out onto temple street so go get me the phone errand boy and lets get it on just go get me the phone not yet powers bosch said not just yet bosch sat at his spot at the homicide table with his head down on his folded arms an empty coffee cop was near his elbow a cigarette he had perched on the edge of the table had burned down to the butt leaving one more scar on the old wood bosch was alone it was almost six and there was just the hint of dawns light coming through the windows that ran high along the east wall of the room hed gone at it for more than four hours with powers and had gained no ground he hadnt even made a dent in powerss cool demeanor the first rounds had assuredly gone to the big patrol cop bosch wasnt asleep though he was simply resting and waiting and his thoughts remained focused on powers bosch had no doubts he was sure that he had the right man sitting handcuffed in the interview room what minimal evidence they had certainly pointed to powers but it was more than the evidence that convinced him it was experience and gut instinct bosch believed an innocent man would have been scared not smug as powers had been an innocent man would not have taunted bosch and so what still remained now was to take away that smugness and break him bosch was tired but still felt up to the task the only thing that worried him was time time was against him bosch raised his head and looked at his watch billets would be back in three hours he picked up the empty cup used his palm to push the dead cigarette and its ashes into it and dropped it into the trash can under the table he stood up lit another cigarette and took a walk down the aisle between the crime tables he tried to clear his mind to get ready for the next round he thought about paging edgar to see if he and rider had found anything yet anything at all that could help but decided against it they knew that time was important they would have either called or come back if they had something as he stood at the far end of the squad room and these thoughts traveled through his mind his eyes fell on the sex crimes table and he realized after a moment that he was looking at a polaroid photo of the girl who had come into the station with her mother on friday to report that she had been raped the photo was on the top of a stack of polaroids that were paperclipped to the outside of the case envelope detective mary cantu had left it on the top of her pile for monday without thinking about it bosch pulled the stack of photos from beneath the clip and began to look through them the girl had been badly mistreated and the bruises documented on her body by cantus camera were a depressing testament to all that was wrong with the city bosch always found it easier to deal with victims who were no longer living the live ones haunted him because they could never be consoled not fully they were forever left with the question why sometimes bosch thought of his city as some kind of vast drain that pulled all bad things toward a spot where they swirled around in a deep concentration it was a place where it seemed the good people were often outnumbered by the bad the creeps and schemers the rapists and killers it was a place that could easily produce someone like powers too easily bosch put the photos back under the clip embarrassed by his thoughtless voyeurism of the girls pain he went back to the homicide table picked up the phone and dialed his home number it was nearly twentyfour hours since he had been to his house and his hope was that eleanor wish would answerhe had left the key under the mator there might be a message from her after three rings the line was picked up and he heard his own voice on tape tell himself to leave a message he punched in his code to check for messages and the machine told him he had none he stood there a long moment thinking about eleanor the phone still at his ear when suddenly he heard her voice harry is that you eleanor im here harry why didnt you answer i didnt think it would be for me when did you get there last night ive been waiting for you thanks for leaving the key youre welcome eleanor whered you go there was a beat of silence before she answered i went back to vegas i needed to get my carclear out my bank account things like that where have you been all night working we have a new suspect were holding him here did you go by your apartment no there was no reason to i just did what i had to do and drove back im sorry if i woke you thats okay i was worried about where you were but i didnt want to call you there in case you were in the middle of something bosch wanted to ask her what came next for them but he felt such a sense of happiness that she was there in his home that he didnt dare to ruin the moment i dont know how much longer ill be tied up he said bosch heard the heavy doors in the stations rear hallway open and bang shut footsteps were coming toward the squad room do you have to go eleanor asked um edgar and rider walked into the squad room rider carried a brown evidence bag with something heavy in it edgar carried a closed cardboard box across which someone had stenciled xmas with a magic marker he also had a broad smile on his face yeah bosch said i think i better go okay harry ill see you youll be there ill be here okay eleanor ill see you as soon as i can he hung up and looked up at his two partners edgar was still smiling we got your christmas present here harry edgar said we got powers right here in this box you got the boots no no boots we got better than boots show me edgar lifted the lid off the box off the top he took out a manila envelope he then tilted the box so that bosch could look in bosch whistled merry christmas edgar said you count it bosch asked his eyes still on the stacks of currency with rubber bands around them each bundle has a number on it rider said you add them all up it equals four hundred eighty thousand it looks like its everything not a bad present eh harry edgar said excitedly no where was it attic crawl space edgar said one of the last places we looked box was just sitting there in front of me as soon as i stuck my head up bosch nodded okay what else found these under his mattress from the envelope edgar withdrew a stack of photos they were six by four in size and each had the date of the photograph digitally printed on the bottom left corner bosch put them on the table in front of them and looked through them carefully picking them up by the corners he hoped edgar had handled them the same way the first photo was of tony aliso getting into a car at the valet stand in front of the mirage the next was of him walking to the door of dollys following that was a series of shots of him outside dollys talking to the man aliso knew as luke goshen it was dark outside in these shots and they were taken from a distance but the neonglutted entrance of the club was lit as brightly as daylight and aliso and goshen were easily recognizable then there were photos from the same location but the date at the bottom corner had changed they showed a young woman leaving the club and walking to alisos car bosch recognized her it was layla there were also pictures of tony and layla poolside at the mirage the last shot was of tony leaning his deeply tanned body over laylas lounge chair and kissing her on the mouth bosch looked up at edgar and rider edgar was smiling again rider wasnt just like we thought edgar said he cased this guy over there in vegas that shows he had the knowledge to set this whole thing up him and the widow we got em harry this shows premeditation lying in wait the works we got em both nine ways to sunday maybe he looked at rider whats up with you kiz she shook her head i dont know it just seems too easy the place was very clean no old boots no sign that veronica ever even set foot in that place then we find these so easy it was like we were supposed to find it all i mean why would he take the time to get rid of the boots but leave the photos under the mattress i can see him wanting to hang on to the money but putting it in the attic seems pretty lame she moved her hand toward the photos and the cash in a dismissive gesture bosch nodded his agreement and leaned back in his chair i think youre right he said hes not that stupid he thought about the similarity to the gun being planted on goshen that too turned out to be too easy i think its a setup bosch said veronica did this he took the photos for her he probably told her to destroy them but she didnt she hung on to them just in case she probably snuck them back in under his bed and put the cash up in the attic was it easy to get to easy enough rider said folddown ladder wait a minute why would she set him up edgar asked not from the start bosch said it was like a fallback position if things started to go wrong if we got too close she had powers out there ready to take the fall maybe when she sent powers after the suitcase she went to his place with the photos and the cash who knows when it started but i bet when i tell powers we found this stuff in his house his eyes are going to pop whaddaya got in the bag kiz the camera she nodded and put the bag on the table without opening it nikon with a telephoto on it credit card receipt for his purchase of it bosch nodded and his thoughts strayed a bit he was trying to think about how he was going to work the photos and money with powers it was their shot at breaking him it had to be played right hold on hold on edgar said a look of confusion on his face i still dont get this what makes you say it was a setup maybe he was holding the cash and the photos and they were going to split it all after the heat died down why does it have to be that she set him up bosch looked at rider and then back at edgar cause kiz is right its too easy not if he thought we didnt have a clue if he thought he was clear right up to the moment we jumped out of the bushes up there in the woods bosch shook his head i dont know i dont think he would have played it the way he did when i was just talking to him not if he knew he had this stuff back at his place i go with it being a setup shes putting it all on him we pull her in and shell feed us some story about the guy being obsessed with her maybe if shes any kind of actress she tells us yes she had an affair with him but then she broke it off but he wouldnt go away he killed her old man so he could have her all to himself bosch leaned back and looked at them waiting for their response i think its good rider said it could work except we dont believe it bosch said so whats she get out of this edgar asked refusing to drop his disagreement shes givin up the money puttin it in his pad whats that leave her the house the cars insurance bosch said whatevers left of the companyand the chance to get away but it was a weak answer and he knew it a half million dollars was a lot of cash to use to set somebody up it was the one flaw in the theory he had just spun she got rid of her husband rider said maybe that was all that was important to her hed been screwing around on her for years edgar said why now what was different this time i dont know rider said but there was something different or something else we dont know about thats what we have to find out yeah well good luck edgar said ive got an idea bosch said if anyone knows what that something else is its powers i want to try to scam him and i think i know how kiz you still got that tape the one with veronica in it casualty of desire yeah its in my drawer go get it and set it up in the lieutenants office im going to grab some more coffee and ill meet you there bosch stepped into interview room three with the box of cash turned so that the side that said xmas on it was held against his chest he hoped it looked like any common cardboard box he watched powers for a sign of recognition and got none powers was sitting just as bosch had left him ramrod straight his arms behind him as if by choice he looked at bosch with deadpan eyes that were ready and waiting for the next goround bosch put the box on the floor where it would be shielded from view pulled out the chair and sat across from him again he then reached down opened the box and took out a tape recorder and a file folder he put them on the table in plain sight i told you bosch no taping if you got the camera on the other side of the glass going then youre ripping off my rights too no camera no tape powers this is just to play you something thats all now where were we we were to the point of put up or shut up you cut me loose or you get my lawyer in here well actually a couple of things have come up i thought you might want to know about them first you know before you make a decision like that fuck that im through with this shit get me the phone do you own a camera powers i said geta camera what about it do you own a camera its a pretty straightforward question yes everybody owns a camera what about it bosch studied him for a moment he could feel the momentum and control start to maybe shift just a bit it was coming across the table from powers he could feel it bosch played a thin smile on his face he wanted powers to know that from this point on it was slipping away from him did you take the camera with you when you went to vegas last march i dont know maybe i take it on all my vacations didnt know it was a crime the fucking legislature what will they think of next bosch let him have his smile but didnt return it is that what you called it he said quietly a vacation yeah thats exactly what i called it thats funny because thats not what veronica is calling it i dont know anything about that or her his eyes momentarily looked away from bosch it was the first time and again bosch felt the balance shifting he was playing it right he felt it things were shifting sure you know about it powers and you know her pretty good too she just told us all about it shes in the other room right now turns out she was weaker than i thought my money had been on you you know the saying the bigger they are the harder they fall all of that i thought youd be the one but it was her edgar and rider broke her down a little while ago amazing how crime scene photos can work on somebodys guilty conscience she told us everything powers everything youre so full of bullshit bosch and its getting pretty old wheres the phone this is how she tells it you i dont want to hear it you met her when you went up there that night to take the burglary report one thing led to another and pretty soon you two were having a little romance an affair to remember only she came to her senses and broke it off she still loved ol tony she knew he traveled a lot strayed a lot but she was used to that she needed him so she cut you off only and this is according to her you wouldnt be cut off you kept after her calling her following her when shed leave the estate up there it was getting scary i mean what could she do go to tony and say this guy i had an affair with is following me all the time she this is so much bullshit bosch its a joke then you started following tony you see he was your problem he was in the way so you did your homework you followed him to vegas and you caught him in the act you knew just what he was up to and how to put him down in a way that wed go down the wrong path trunk music they call it only you couldnt carry the tune powers were on to you with her help were going to put you down powers was looking down at the table the skin around his eyes and his jawline had drawn tight this is so much crap he said without looking up im tired of listening to it and to you shes not in the other room shes sitting up there in that big house on the hill this is the oldest trick in the book powers looked up and a twisted smile cracked his face you try to pull this shit on a cop i cant believe it this is really weak man youre weak youre embarrassing yourself here bosch reached over to the tape recorder and pushed the play button veronica alisos voice filled the tiny room it was him hes crazy i couldnt stop him until it was too late then i couldnt tell anyone because itit would look like i bosch turned it off thats enough he said its out of line for me to even play that for you but i thought cop to cop you should know where you stand bosch silently watched powers as he did a slow burn bosch could see the anger boiling up behind his eyes he didnt seem to move a muscle yet he seemed all at once to become as hard as a stack of lumber he finally was able to hold himself back though and compose himself its just her word he said in a quiet voice theres no corroboration of anything its a fantasy bosch her word against mine it could be except we have these bosch opened the file and threw the stack of photos in front of powers then he reached across and carefully fanned them on the table so they could be seen and recognized that backs up a good part of her story dont you think bosch watched as powers studied the photographs once again powers seemed to go to the edge with an interior rage but once more he contained it it doesnt back up shit he said she couldve taken these herself anybody could have just because she gives you a stack ofshes got you people wrapped up doesnt she youre buying every line she feeds you maybe that would be so only she didnt give us the photos bosch reached into the file again and pulled out a copy of the search warrant he reached over and put it on top of the photos five hours ago we faxed that to judge warren lambert at his home in the palisades he faxed it back signed edgar and rider have been in your little hollywood bungalow most of the night among the items seized was a nikon camera with telephoto lens and these photos they were under your mattress powers he paused here to let it all sink in behind powerss darkening eyes oh and one other thing we found bosch reached down and brought the box up this was in the attic with the christmas stuff he dumped the contents of the box on the table and the stacks of cash tumbled every which way some falling to the floor bosch shook the box to make sure it had all come out and then dropped it to the floor he looked at powers his eyes were wild darting over the thick bundles bosch knew he had him and he also knew in his gut that he had veronica aliso to thank for that now personally i dont think you are this stupid bosch said quietly you know to keep the pictures and all this cash right in your house of course ive seen crazier things in my time but if i was betting id bet that you didnt know all of this was there because you didnt put it there but hey either way it works fine for me weve got you and well clear this one thats all i care about it would be nice to grab her too but thats okay well need her for you with the photos and her story and all the other stuff weve talked about here i think we got you for the murder easy theres also lyinginwait to tack on that makes it a special circumstances case powers youre looking at one of two things the needle or lwp he pronounced the last acronym elwop knowing that any cop just as any criminal in the system would know it meant life without parole anyway bosch continued i guess ill go get that phone brought in here so you can call your lawyer better make it a good one and none of those grandstanders from the oj case you need to get yourself a lawyer who does his best work outside of the courtroom a negotiator he stood up and turned to the door with his hand on the knob he looked back at powers you know i feel bad powers you being a cop and all i was sort of hoping youd catch the break instead of her i feel like were hitting the wrong person with the hammer but i guess thats life in the big city somebodys got to be hit with it he turned back to the door and opened it bitch powers said with a quiet forcefulness then he whispered something under his breath that bosch couldnt hear bosch looked back at him he knew enough not to say a word it was her idea powers said all of it she conned me and now shes conning you bosch waited a beat but there was nothing else are you saying you want to talk to me yeah bosch have a seat maybe we can work something out at nine bosch sat in the lieutenants office billets behind the desk bringing her up to date he had an empty styrofoam cup in his hand but he didnt drop it in the trash can because he needed something to remind him that he needed more coffee he was beat tired and the lines beneath his eyes were so pronounced they almost hurt his mouth tasted sour from all the coffee and cigarettes hed eaten nothing but candy bars in the last twenty hours and his stomach was finally protesting but he was a happy man he had won the last round with powers and in this kind of battle the last round was the only one that mattered so billets said he told you everything his version of it bosch said he lays everything on her and thats to be expected remember he thinks shes in the other room laying everything on him so hes making her out to be the big bad black widow like he never had an impure thought in his life until he ran across her he brought the cup up to his mouth but then realized it was empty but once we get her in here and she knows hes talking well probably get her version he said when did jerry and kiz leave bosch looked at his watch about forty minutes ago they should be back with her any time why didnt you go up to get her i dont know i figured i took powers they should have her spread it around you know better be careful you keep acting like that and youll lose your rep as a hardass bosch smiled and looked down into his cup so whats the gist of his story billets asked the gist is pretty much how we figured it he went up there to take a burglary report that day and it went from there he says she put the moves on him and next thing you know they had a thing going he started taking more and more patrol swings through the neighborhood and she was stopping by his bungalow in the mornings after tony went to work or while he was in vegas the way he describes it she was reeling him in the sex was good and exotic he was hooked up pretty good then she asked him to tail tony right that first trip powers took to vegas was a straight job she asked him to tail tony he did and he came back with a bunch of photos of tony and the girl and a lot of questions about who tony was meeting with over there and why he wasnt stupid he could tell tony was into something he says veronica filled him in knew every detail knew all the oc guys by name she also told him how much money was involved that was when the plan came together she told powers that tony had to go that it would be just them afterward them and a lot of money she told him tony had been skimming skimming off the skim for years there was at least a couple million in the pot plus whatever they took off tony when they put him down bosch stood up and continued the story while pacing in front of her desk he was too tired to sit for very long without being overcome with fatigue anyway that was what the second trip was for powers went over and watched tony one more time it was research he also tailed the guy tony made the pickups from luke goshen who he obviously had no idea was an agent they decided goshen would be the patsy and worked out the plan to make it look like a mob hit trunk music its pretty complicated yeah that it is he says the planning was all hers and i kind of think he might be telling the truth there you ask me powers is smart but not that smart this whole thing was veronicas plan and he became a willing player only she had a backdoor built into it that powers didnt know about he was the backdoor yeah she set him up to take the fall but only if we got too close he said hed given her a key to his place its a bungalow over on sierra bonita she mustve gone over there sometime this week shoved the photos under the mattress and stuck the box of money in the attic smart woman nice setup when jerry and kiz get her in here i know just what shell say shes going to say it was all him that he became infatuated with her that they had an affair and that she broke it off he went ahead and knocked off her husband when she realized what had happened she couldnt say anything he forced her to go along with it she had no choice he was a cop and he told her he could pin it all on her if she didnt go along its a good story in fact it still might work with a jury she could walk on this maybe we still have some things to do what about the skim good question nothing like the kind of money hes talking about showed up on alisos bank accounts powers said she said it was in a safe deposit box but she never told him where its got to be somewhere well find it if it exists i think it does she planted a half million in powerss place to put him in the frame thats a lot of money to spend on setting him up unless you happen to have a couple million more stashed someplace thats what we bosch looked through the glass into the squad room edgar and rider were walking toward the lieutenants office veronica aliso was not with them they came into the office with urgent looks on their faces and bosch knew what they were going to say shes gone edgar said bosch and billets just stared at them looks like she split last night edgar said her cars are still there but there was nobody at the house we slipped in a back door and its empty man she take her clothes jewelry bosch asked doesnt look like it shes just gone you check the gate yeah we checked at the gate she had two visitors yesterday first was a courier at fourfifteen legal eagle messenger service guy was there about five minutes in and out then a visitor last night late guy gave the name john galvin she had already called the gate and given the same name and told them to let him through when he showed up they took his plate down and we ran it its hertz out of vegas well put a call in anyway galvin stayed until one this morning just about the time we were in the woods hooking up powers he split she probably went with him we called the guard on duty at the time rider said he couldnt remember if galvin left alone or not he doesnt specifically remember seeing mrs aliso last night but she could have been down in the backseat do we know who her attorney is billets asked yes rider said neil denton century city okay jerry you work the trace on the hertz rental and kiz you try to run down denton and see if you can find out what was so important that he had to messenger it over to her on saturday all right edgar said but i got a bad feeling i think shes in the wind well then we have to go into the wind to find her billets said go to it edgar and rider went back out to the homicide table and bosch stood silent for a few moments thinking about this latest development should we have put people on her billets asked well looking back it seems that way but we were off the books we didnt have the people besides we didnt really have anything on her until a couple hours ago billets nodded a pained expression on her face if they dont get a line on her in the next fifteen minutes put it out on the air right listen getting back to powers you think hes holding anything back hard to say probably theres still the question about why this time what do you mean i mean aliso had been going over to vegas for years and bringing back suitcases full of money hed been skimming for years according to powers and also had been having his share of the women over there veronica knew all of this she had to so what was it that made her do it now rather than last year or next year maybe she just got fed up maybe this was just the right time powers came along and it clicked maybe i asked powers and he said he didnt know but i think maybe he was holding back im going to take another run at him billets didnt respond theres still some sort of secret we dont know about bosch continued theres something there im hoping shell tell it if we find her billets dismissed it with a wave of her hand you have powers on tape she asked audio and video kiz was watching in room four as soon as he said he wanted to talk she started it all rolling did you advise him again on the tape yeah its all on there hes sealed up pretty good you want to watch it ill get the tape no i dont even want to look at him if i can help it you didnt promise him anything did you bosch was about to answer but stopped there was the sound of muffled yelling that he could tell was coming from powers still sequestered in room three he looked through the glass of the lieutenants office and saw edgar get up from the homicide table and go down the hall to check it out he probably wants his lawyer now bosch said well its a little late for thatanyway no i made no promises i did tell him id talk to the da about dropping special circs but thats going to be tough with what he told me in there we can take our pick conspiracy to commit lying in wait murder for hire maybe i guess i should get a da in here yeah if you dont have anyone in mind or anybody you owe a hot case to put in a request for roger goff this is his kind of case and ive owed him one for a while he wont blow it i know roger ill ask for him i have to call out the brass too its not every day you get to call a deputy chief and tell him not only have your people been running an investigation they were specifically told to stay away from but that theyve arrested a cop to boot and for murder no less bosch smiled he would not relish having to make such a call its really going to hit the fan this time he said one more black eye for the department by the way they didnt seize any of it because its not related to this case but jerry and kiz found some scary stuff in powerss place nazi paraphernalia whitepower stuff you might alert the brass about that so they can do with it what they want thanks for telling me ill talk to irving im sure he wont want that to see the light of day edgar leaned in through the open door powers says hes got to take a leak and cant hold it any longer he was looking at billets well take him she said keep him hooked bosch added hows he gonna piss his hands behind his back dont be expecting me to be taking it out for him no way billets laughed just move the cuffs to the front bosch said give me a second to finish in here and ill be right there okay ill be in three edgar left and bosch watched him through the glass as he walked to the hallway leading to the interview rooms bosch looked back at billets who was still smiling at edgars comical protest bosch put a serious look on his face you know you can use me when you make that call what do you mean i mean if you want to say you didnt know about any of this until i called you this morning with the bad news thats cool with me dont be ridiculous we cleared a murder and got a killer cop off the street if they cant see that the good in this outweighs the bad thenwell fuck em if they cant take a joke bosch smiled and nodded youre cool lieutenant thanks anytime and its grace right grace bosch was thinking about how much he liked billets as he walked down the short hallway to the interview rooms and into the open door of room three edgar was just closing the cuffs on powerss wrists his hands were in front of him now do me a favor bosch powers said let me use the can in the front hallway what for so nobodyll see me in the back i dont want anybody to see me like this besides you might have a problem if people dont like what they see bosch nodded powers had a point if they took him to the locker room then all the cops in the watch office would likely see them and there would be questions maybe even anger from some of the cops who didnt know what was going on the bathroom in the front hallway was a public rest room but this early on a sunday morning it would likely be empty and they could take powers in and out of there without being seen okay lets go bosch said to the front they walked him past the front counter and down the hallway past the administration offices which were empty and closed for the day while bosch stayed with powers in the hall edgar checked the rest room out its empty he said holding the door open from inside bosch followed powers in and the big cop went to the furthest of three urinals bosch stayed by the door and edgar took a position on the other side of powers by the row of sinks when powers was finished at the urinal he stepped toward one of the sinks as he walked bosch saw that his right shoelace was untied and so did edgar tie your shoe powers edgar said you trip and fall and break your pretty face i dont want any cryin bout police brutality powers stopped and looked down at the shoelace on the floor and then at edgar sure he said powers first washed his hands used a paper towel to dry them and then brought his right foot up on the edge of the sink to tie his shoe new shoes edgar said laces on em always come undone dont they bosch couldnt see powerss face because the cops back was turned toward the door but he was looking up at edgar fuck you nigger it was almost as if he had slapped edgar whose face immediately filled with revulsion and anger he looked over at bosch a quick glance to judge whether bosch was going to do anything about his plan to hit powers but it was all the time powers needed he sprang away from the sink and threw his body into edgar pinning him against the whitetiled wall his cuffed hands came up and the left one grabbed a handful of the front of edgars shirt while the right pressed the barrel of a small gun into the stunned detectives throat bosch had covered half of the distance to them when he saw the gun and powers began to shout back off bosch back off or you got a dead partner you want that powers had turned his head so that he was looking back at bosch bosch stopped and raised his hands away from his body thats it powers said now this is what youre going to do take your gun out real slowly and drop it in that first sink there bosch made no move do it now powers spoke with measured force careful to keep his voice low bosch looked at the tiny gun in powerss hand he recognized it as a raven a favored throwdown gun among patrol cops going back to at least his own time in a uniform it was smallit looked like a toy in powerss handbut deadly and it fit snugly into a sock or boot virtually unseen with the pants leg pulled down as bosch came to the realization that edgar and rider had not completely searched powers he also knew that a shot from the raven at pointblank range would certainly kill edgar it was against all his instincts to give up his weapon but he saw no alternative powers was desperate and bosch knew desperate men didnt think things out they went against the odds they were killers with two fingers he slowly removed his gun and dropped it into the sink thats real good bosch now i want you to get on the floor underneath the sinks bosch did as he was told never taking his eyes off powers as he moved edgar powers said now your turn you can just go ahead and drop yours on the floor edgars gun hit the tile now you get under there with your partner thats it powers this is crazy bosch said wherere you going to go you cant run whos talking about running bosch take out your cuffs and put one on your left wrist after bosch had complied powers told him to loop the cuffs through one of the sink trap pipes he then told edgar to put the free cuff around his right wrist he did so and then powers smiled there thats good that ought to hold you guys for a few minutes now give me your keys both of you throw em out here powers picked edgars set up off the floor and unlocked the cuffs around his wrists he quickly massaged them to get the circulation going he was smiling but bosch wondered if he even knew it now lets see he reached into the sink and grabbed boschs gun this is a nice one bosch nice weight balance beats mine mind if i borrow it for a couple minutes bosch knew then what he was planning to do he was going for veronica bosch thought of kiz sitting at the homicide table her back to the front counter and billets in her office they wouldnt see him until it was too late shes not here powers he said what who veronica it was a scam we never even picked her up powers was silent as the smile dropped away and was replaced with a serious look of concentration bosch knew what he was thinking the voice came from one of her movies i taped it off the videotape you go back to those interview rooms and its a dead end theres nobody back there and no way out bosch saw the same tightening of skin around powerss face that he had seen before his face grew dark with blood and anger then inexplicably the smile suddenly creased across it you smart fucker bosch is that so you spect me to believe shes not there maybe this is the con and not before see what im saying its no con she isnt there we were going to pick her up with what you told us went up the hill an hour ago but shes not there either she left last night if shes not already here then how that part was no scam the money and pictures were in your house if you didnt put them there then she did shes setting you up why dont you just put the gun down and lets start this over you apologize to edgar for what you called him and we drop this little incident oh i see you drop the escape but i still get hit with the murder i told you were going to talk to the da we got one coming in right now hes a friend hell do right by you shes the one we really want you fucking asshole powers said loudly he then brought his voice back into check dont you see that i want her you think you beat me you think you broke me down in there you didnt win bosch i talked because i wanted to talk i broke you man but you didnt know it you started trusting me because you needed me you shouldve never moved the cuffs brother he was silent a moment letting that sink in now ive got an appointment with that bitch that im going to keep no matter what she aint here then ill go find her she could be anywhere so could i bosch and she wont see me coming i have to go powers grabbed the plastic bag out of the trash can and emptied it on the floor he put boschs gun into the bag then turned the faucets in all three sinks on full blast the cascading water created a cacophony as it echoed off the tile walls powers picked up edgars gun and put it in the bag he then wrapped the bag around itself several times concealing the two guns inside he put the raven in his front pocket for easy access threw the handcuff keys into one of the urinals and flushed each one without even looking at the two men handcuffed under the sink he headed to the door adios dipshits he threw over his shoulder and then he was gone bosch looked at edgar he knew that if they yelled it was likely they wouldnt be heard it was a sunday the administration wing was empty and in the bureau there were only billets and rider with the water running their shouts would probably be unintelligible billets and rider would probably think it was the normal yelling from the drunk tank bosch swiveled around and braced his feet on the wall beneath the sink counter he grabbed the trap pipe so that he could use his legs as leverage in an attempt to pull the pipe free but the pipe was burning hot son of a bitch bosch yelled as he let go he turned the hot water on what are we going to do hes getting away your arms are longer see if you can reach up there and turn off the water its too hot i cant grab the pipe with bosch feeding his arm almost up to the elbow through the pipe loop edgar was barely able to touch the faucet it took him several seconds to turn the water down to a trickle now turn on the cold bosch said cool this thing down it took another few seconds but then bosch was ready to try again he grabbed the pipe and pushed against the wall with his legs as he did this edgar squeezed his hands around the pipe and did the same the added muscle broke the pipe free along the seal beneath the sink water sloshed down on them as they threaded the cuffs chain through the pipe break they got up and slid along the tile to the urinal where bosch saw his keys on the bottom grate he grabbed them up and fumbled with them until he had the cuff off he handed the keys to edgar and ran toward the door sloshing through the water that had completely spread across it turn off the water he yelled as he hit the door bosch ran down the hallway and vaulted over the detective bureau front counter the squad room was empty and through the glass he saw the lieutenants office was vacant he then heard a loud pounding and the muffled shouts of rider and billets he ran down the hallway to the interview rooms and found all the doors open but one he knew powers had checked for veronica aliso anyway after locking billets and rider in room thrree he opened the door to three and then quickly ran back through the squad room into the station houses rear hallway he slammed through the heavy metal door and into the back parking yard instinctively reaching to his empty shoulder holster he scanned the parking lot and the open bays of the garage there was no sign of powers but there were two patrol officers standing near the gas pumps bosch focused on them you seen powers yeah said the older of the two he just left with our fucking car what the fucks going on bosch didnt answer he closed his eyes bowed his head and cursed silently to himself six hours later bosch edgar and rider sat at the homicide table silently watching the meeting taking place in the lieutenants office huddled in the small office like people on a bus were billets captain levalley deputy chief irving three iad investigators including chastain and the chief of police and his administrative aide deputy district attorney roger goff had been consulted on the speakerphonebosch had heard his voice through the open door but then the door was closed and bosch was sure the group was deciding the fate of the three detectives sitting outside the police chief stood in the middle of the cramped room with his arms folded and his head down he was the last to arrive and it looked as if he was getting the rundown from the others occasionally he nodded but it didnt look to bosch as though he was saying much at all bosch knew that the main issue they were discussing was how to handle the problem with powers there was a killer cop on the loose going to the media with that would be an exercise in selfflagellation but bosch saw no way around it they had looked in all the likely places for powers and had not found him the patrol car he had commandeered had been found abandoned up in the hills on fareholm drive where he had gone from there was anyones guess surveillance teams stationed outside his bungalow and the aliso house as well as the lawyer neil dentons house and office had produced nothing it was now time to go to the media to put the rogue cops picture on the six oclock news bosch guessed that the reason the police chief had showed up was that he planned to call a press conference otherwise he would have left the whole thing for irving to deal with bosch realized rider had said something excuse me i said what are you going to do with your time i dont know depends on how much we get if its just one dp ill use it to finish work on my house if its longer than two ill have to see about making some money somehow a dp or deployment period was fifteen days suspensions were usually handed out in such increments when the offense was serious bosch was pretty sure the chief wouldnt be handing out minor suspensions to them he isnt going to fire us is he harry edgar asked doubt it but it all depends on how theyre telling it to him bosch looked back at the office window just as the chief was looking out at him the chief looked away not a good sign bosch had never met him and never expected that he would he was an outsider brought in to appease the community not because of any particular police administrative skills but because they needed an outsider he was a large black man with most of his weight around his waist cops who didnt like him and there were many often referred to him as chief mud slide bosch didnt know what cops who liked him called him i just want to say im sorry harry rider said sorry about what bosch asked about missing the gun i patted him down i ran my hands down his legs but somehow i missed it i dont understand it it was small enough that he could fit it in his boot bosch said its not all on you kiz we all had our chances me and jerry fucked up in the rest room we shouldve been watching him better she nodded but bosch could tell she still felt miserable he looked up and saw that the meeting in the lieutenants office was beginning to break up as the police chief and his aide followed by levalley and the iad dicks filed out they left the bureau through the front entrance it would make for an outoftheway walk if their cars were parked in the station lot out back but it meant they didnt have to walk by the homicide table and acknowledge bosch and the others another bad sign he though only irving and billets remained in the office after it cleared billets then looked out at bosch and signaled the three of them into her office they got up slowly and headed in edgar and rider sat down but bosch stayed on his feet chief billets said giving irving the floor okay ill give it to you the way it was just given to me irving said he looked down at a piece of paper on which he had taken a few notes for conducting an unauthorized investigation and for failure to follow procedure in searching and transporting a prisoner each of you is suspended without pay two deployment periods and suspended with pay for two deployment periods these are to run consecutively thats two months and of course a formal reprimand goes into each of your jackets per procedure you can appeal this to a board of rights he waited a beat it was heavier than bosch had expected but he showed nothing on his face he heard edgar audibly exhale as far as the appeal went disciplinary action by the police chief was rarely overturned it would require two of the three captains on the board of rights to vote against their commander in chief overruling an iad investigator was one thing overruling the chief was political suicide however irving continued the suspensions are being held in abeyance by the chief pending further developments and evaluation there was a moment of silence while the last sentence was computed what does he mean abeyance edgar asked it means the chief is offering you a break irving said he wants to see how things fall out over the next day or two each of you is to come to work tomorrow and proceed with the investigation where you can we talked with the das office theyre willing to file on powers get the paperwork over there tomorrow first thing weve put the word out and the chief will take it to the media in a couple hours if were lucky well get this guy before he finds the woman or does any other damage and if were lucky you three will probably be lucky what about veronica aliso arent they going to file on her not yet not until we have powers back goff said that without powers the taped confession is worthless he wont be able to use it against her without powers on the stand to introduce it or her being able to confront a witness against her bosch looked down at the floor so without him she walks thats the way it looks bosch nodded his head whats he going to say he asked the chief i mean hes going to tell it like it is you people will come out okay in some parts not so okay in others overall its not going to be a good day for this department is that why were getting hit for two months because were the messengers irving looked at him a long moment his jaw clenched before answering im not going to dignify that with a reply he looked at rider and edgar and said you two can go now youre finished here i need to discuss another matter with detective bosch bosch watched them go and prepared for more of irvings ire about the last comment he wasnt sure why he had said it he knew it would bait the deputy chief but after rider closed the door to the office irving spoke of another matter detective i wanted you to know that ive already talked to the federal people and were all squared away on that how is that i told them that with todays developments it has become pretty clearmake that crystal clearthat you had nothing to do with planting evidence on their man i told them it was powers and that we were terminating that particular aspect of our internal investigation of your conduct fine chief thanks thinking that was it bosch made a move toward the door detective there is one other thing bosch turned back to him in discussing this matter with the chief of police there is still one other aspect that bothers him and what is that the investigation started by detective chastain brought in ancillary information about your association with a convicted felon its troubling to me too id like to be able to get some assurance from you that this is not going to continue id like to take that assurance to the chief bosch was silent a moment i cant give you that irving looked down at the floor he was working the thick muscles of his jaw again you disappoint me detective bosch he finally said this department has done a lot by you so have i ive stood by you through some tough spots youve never been easy but you have a talent that i think this department and this city certainly need i suppose that makes you worth it do you want to possibly alienate me and others in this department not particularly then take my advice and do the right thing son you know what that is thats all im going to say on that yes sir thats all when bosch got to his house he saw a dusty ford escort parked at the curb out front it had nevada plates inside the house eleanor wish was sitting at the table in the small dining room with the classified ads section of the sunday times she had a lit cigarette in the ashtray next to the paper and she was using a black marker to circle want ads bosch saw all of this and his heart jumped into a higher gear what it meant to him was that if she was looking for a job then she might be digging in staying in la and staying with him to top it all off the house was filled with the aroma of an italian restaurant heavy on the garlic he came around the table and put his hand on her shoulder and tentatively kissed her on the cheek she patted his hand as he straightened up though he noticed she was looking at ads for furnished apartments in santa monica not the employment section whats cooking he asked my spaghetti sauce you remember it he nodded that he did but he really didnt his memory of the days he had spent with her five years before were all centered on her the moments they were intimate and what happened afterward how was las vegas he asked just to be saying something it was vegas the kind of place you never miss if i never go back that will be fine with me youre looking for a place here i thought i might as well start looking she had lived in santa monica before bosch remembered her apartment with the bedroom balcony you could smell the sea and if you leaned out over the railing you could look down ocean park boulevard and even see it he knew she couldnt afford a place like that now she was probably looking at the listings east of lincoln you know theres no hurry he said you can stay here nice view its private why dont youi dont know take your time she looked up at him but decided not to say what she was about to say bosch could tell do you want a beer she asked instead i bought some more theyre in the fridge he nodded letting her escape from the moment and went into the kitchen he saw a crockpot on the counter and wondered if she had bought it or brought it back with her from las vegas he opened the refrigerator and smiled she knew him she had bought bottles of henry weinhards he took two out and brought them back to the dining room he opened hers and gave it to her then his own they both started to speak at the same time sorry go ahead she said no you you sure yeah what i was just going to ask how things went today oh well they went good and bad we broke the guy down and he told us the story he gave up the wife tony alisos wife yeah it was her plan all along according to him the vegas stuff was just a misdirection thats great whats the bad part well first of all our guy is a cop and oh shit yeah but its even worse he got away from us today got away what do you mean got away i mean he escaped right out of the station he had a pistol a little raven in his boot we missed it when we hooked him up edgar and me took him into the can and he mustve stepped on his shoelace while we were going over you know on purpose then when edgar noticed it and told him to tie his shoe he came up with the raven he got away from us went into the back lot and just took a squad car he was still in uniform jesus and they didnt find him yet that was about eight hours ago hes in the wind well where could he go in a patrol car and in a uniform oh he dumped the carthey already found thatand i doubt wherever he is hes in the uniform it looks like he was into the farright whitesupremacy thing he probably knew people whod get him clothes no questions asked sounds like a helluva cop yeah its funny he was the guy who found the body you know last week it was on his beat and because he was a cop i didnt give him a second thought i knew that day he was an asshole but i didnt even look at him at all as anything other than the cop who found the stiff and he mustve known that and he timed it so that wed be in a rush out there he was pretty smart about it or she was yeah more likely it was her but anyway i feel more i dont know upset or disappointed about that first day that i didnt take a look at him than i do about letting him get away today i shouldve looked at him more often than not the one who finds the body is the one his uniform blinded me to that she got up from the table and came over to him she put her arms around his neck and smiled up at him youll get him dont worry he nodded they kissed what were you going to say before she asked when we both talked at once ohi dont remember now must not have been important then i wanted to tell you to stay here with me she put her head down against his chest so that he couldnt see her eyes harry just to see how it works i feel likeits almost like all this time hasnt gone by i wanti just want to be with you i can take care of you you can feel safe and you can have all the time you need to make a new start here find a job whatever you want to do she stepped back from him and looked up into his eyes the warning irving had given him was the furthest thing from his mind right now all he cared about was keeping her close and doing whatever it took to accomplish that but a lot of time has gone by harry we just cant jump in like this bosch nodded and lowered his eyes he knew she was right but he still didnt care i want you harry she said nobody else but i want to take it slow so that were sure both of us i already know im sure you just think you are santa monica is so far away from here she smiled and then laughed and shook her head then youre just going to have to sleep over when you come visit he nodded again and they embraced for a long moment you can make me forget a lot of things you know that he whispered into her ear you too she said back while they made love the phone rang but whoever was calling did not leave a message when the machine picked up later after bosch got out of the shower eleanor reported that another call had come in but no message was left finally while eleanor was boiling water for the pasta the phone rang a third time and bosch got it before the machine picked up hey bosch yeah whos this its roy lindell remember me luke goshen i remember was that you who called a couple times before yeah why didnt you pick up i was busy what do you need so it was the bitch huh what tonys wife yeah did you know this guy powers not really just to see around bosch didnt want to tell him anything he didnt already know lindell exhaled in a bored way loudly into the phone yeah well tony once told me that he was more afraid of his wife than he was of joey marks yeah bosch said suddenly interested he said that when i dont know one night we were talking in the club and he just said it i remember the place was closed he was waiting for layla and we were talking lindell thanks a lot for telling me this what else did he say hey im telling you now bosch anyway i couldnt before i was in character man and in that character you dont tell the cops shit and then after iwell then i thought you were trying to fuck me over i wasnt going to tell you shit then either and now you know better yeah right look bosch most guys you wouldve never heard from but im calling you think youll hear from anybody else from the bureau saying maybe we made a mistake about you no way but i like your style i mean you get pulled off the case and what do you do you turn around and get right back on it then you solve the fucker that takes balls and style bosch i can dig that you can dig it thats great roy what else did tony aliso tell you about his wife nothing much he just said she was cold he said that she had him by the short hairs hooked and snooked and that was that he couldnt get a divorce from her without losing half his wad and then having her running around out there with all that she knew about his business and his business associates if you know what i mean why didnt he just go to joey marks and ask for a whack on her i think on account that she knew joey from way back and he liked her it was joey who introduced her to tony way back when i think tony knew that if he went to joey it would get kod pretty quick and it might get back to her and if he went to somebody else hed have to answer to joey joey had the final say on that kind of stuff and he wouldnt want tony getting involved in a freelance job like that and possibly endangering the wash operation how well do you think she knew joey marks you think she couldve gone back to him now no way she killed the golden goose tony made joey legitimate money his first allegiance is always to the money bosch was quiet for a few moments and so was lindell so what happens with you now bosch finally said you mean with my thing i go back to vegas tonight i sit down in front of the grand jury in the morning i figure ill be talking to them at least a couple weeks ive got a pretty good story to tell em we should have joey and his crew tagged and bagged by christmas hope youre bringing your bodyguards oh yeah im not alone well good luck lindell all the bullshit aside i like your style too let me ask you something whyd you tell me about the safe house and the samoans that wasnt in keeping with your character i had to bosch you scared me you thought id actually clip you for them i wasnt sure but that didnt really worry me i had people watching over me that you didnt know about but i was sure that theyd clip her and im an agent man it was my duty to try to stop that so i told you i was surprised you didnt guess i was undercover right then never crossed my mind you were good well i fooled the people i had to fool ill see you around bosch sure oh lindell yeah did joey marks ever think that tony a was skimming off him lindell laughed you dont give up do you bosch i guess not well that information would be part of the investigation and i cant talk about it officially what about unofficially unofficially you didnt hear it from me and i never talked to you but to answer your question joey marks thought everybody was skimming off him he trusted no one every time i wore a wire with the guy i was sweating bullets because you never knew when he was going to put his hand down your chest i was with him more than a year and he was still doin that every now and then i had to wear the bug in my armpit man you try pulling tape out of your armpit sometime man it hurts what about tony thats what im getting at sure joey thought tony was skimming he thought i was too and you gotta understand a certain amount of that was permissible joey knew everybody had to make a buck to be happy but he mighta felt tony was taking more than his share he never told me thats what he thought but i know he had the boy followed a couple times over here in la and he got to somebody in tonys bank in beverly hills joey was being copied on the monthly statements yeah yeah he wouldve known if there were any deposits that were outta line bosch thought a moment but couldnt think what else to ask whyd you ask that bosch oh i dont know something im workin out powers said the wife told him tony had a couple million he skimmed its hidden somewhere lindell whistled over the line seems like a lot to me seems like joey wouldve caught that and put the hammer down on tony pronto thats not what you call permissible well i think it accrued over the years you know he could have piecemealed it also he was washing money for some of joeys friends in chicago and arizona remember he couldve skimmed them too anythings possible listen bosch let me know how it all shakes out i have to catch a plane one more thing bosch i gotta get to burbank you ever heard of anybody in vegas named john galvin galvin was the name of the man who had last visited veronica aliso on the night she disappeared there was a beat of silence before lindell finally said the name was not familiar but that silence was what bosch really heard you sure look i never heard of the guy okay i gotta go after hanging up bosch opened his briefcase on the dining room table and took out a notebook so he could write down a few notes about what lindell had said eleanor came out of the kitchen with utensils and napkins in her hands who was that lindell who the agent who was luke goshen what did he want i guess to apologize thats unusual the bureau usually doesnt apologize for anything it wasnt an official call oh just one of those macho male bonding calls bosch smiled because she was so right whats this she asked as she put the silverware down and took the tape of casualty of desire out of his briefcase oh was this one of tony alisos movies yeah part of his hollywood legacy its one of the ones veronica was in i was supposed to give it back to kiz you already saw it bosch nodded i wouldve liked to see it did you like it it was pretty bad but we can put it on tonight if you want you sure you wouldnt mind im sure during dinner bosch updated her in detail about the case eleanor asked few questions and eventually they lapsed into a comfortable quiet the bolognese sauce and linguini eleanor had made was fantastic and bosch broke the silence to tell her so she had opened a bottle of red wine and that tasted good too he told her about that as well afterward they left the dishes in the sink and went out to the living room to watch the movie bosch sat with his arm on the back of the couch his hand lightly touching eleanors neck he found it boring to watch the film again and his mind quickly drifted away as he thought over the days events the money was what held his attention the longest he wondered if veronica already had it in her possession or if it was in a place where she had to go to get it not a local bank he decided they had already checked the local bank accounts that left las vegas he concluded tony alisos travel records showed that in the last ten months he had not been anywhere but los angeles and las vegas if he had been operating a skim fund hed have to have had access to it if the money wasnt here then it was over there and since veronica had not left the house before today bosch also concluded that she didnt have the money yet the phone rang and interrupted these thoughts bosch climbed up from the couch and answered the phone in the kitchen so he wouldnt disturb eleanors viewing of the movie it was hank meyer calling from the mirage but it didnt sound like hank meyer it sounded like a scared boy detective bosch can i trust you sure you can hank whats the matter somethings happened i mean somethings come up uh because of you i know something i dont think i should know i wish this whole thingi dont know what to hold on hold on hank just calm down and tell what it is thats wrong be calm talk to me and well fix it whatever it is well fix it im at the office they called me at home because i had a flag on the computer for that betting slip that belonged to your victim right well somebody cashed it tonight okay somebody cashed it who was it well you see i put an irs flag on the computer meaning that the cashier was supposed to request a drivers license and get a social security number you know for tax purposes even though this ticket was worth only four thousand i put the flag on it okay so who cashed the slip a man named john galvin he had a local address bosch leaned over the counter and pressed the phone tightly to his ear when did this happen he asked at eightthirty tonight less than two hours ago i dont understand hank why is this upsetting to you well i left instructions on the computer for me to be contacted at home as soon as this slip was cashed i was contacted i came in and got the information on who cashed the slip so i could get it to you asap and then i went directly to the video room i wanted to see this john galvin you know if we got a clear picture of him he stopped there it was like pulling teeth getting the story out of him and bosch said who was it hank we got a clear picture it turns out i know john galvin but not as john galvin uh as you know one of my duties is to interface with law enforcement maintain relations and help when i can whenever there yes hank i know who was it i looked at the video it was very clear john galvin is a man i know hes in metro a captain his name is john felton howd because i know him too now listen to me hank you didnt tell me this okay we never talked its best that way safest for you understand yes butbut what is going to happen you dont have to worry ill take care of it and no one at metro will ever know about this okay okay i guess i hank ive got to go thanks and i owe you a favor bosch hung up and called information for the number of southwest airlines at the airport in burbank he knew southwest and america west handled most of the flights to las vegas and they both flew out of the same terminal he called southwest and had them page roy lindell while he waited he looked at his watch it had been more than an hour since he had talked to lindell but he didnt think the agent was in as much of a hurry as he had intimated on the phone bosch thought he had just said that to get off the phone a voice came on the line and asked who he was holding for after bosch repeated lindells name he was told to hold and after two clicks lindells voice was on the line yeah this is roy whos this you son of a bitch who is this john galvin is john felton and you knew it all the time bosch bosch what are you doing felton is joeys man in metro you knew that from being on the inside and when felton does things for marks he uses the name john galvin you knew that too bosch i cant talk about this its all part of our in i dont give a shit about your investigation you have to figure out whose side youre on man felton has got veronica aliso and that means joey marks has got her what are you talking about this is crazy they know about the skim dont you see joey wants his money back and theyre going to squeeze it out of her how do you know all of this because i know bosch thought of something and looked out through the kitchen door to the living room eleanor was still watching the movie and she looked over at him and raised her eyebrows in a question bosch shook his head to show his dissatisfaction with the person on the other end im going to vegas lindell and i think i know where theyll be you want to get your people involved i sure as hell cant call metro on this how are you so sure shes even there because she sent up a distress signal are you in or out were in bosch let me give you a number you call it when you get over there after bosch hung up he went into the living room eleanor had already turned off the tape i cant watch any more of that its terrible whats going on that time you followed tony aliso around in vegas you said he went to a bank with the girlfriend right right which bank where i uhit was on flamingo east of the strip east of paradise road i cant remember the name i think it was silver state national yes thats it silver state the silver state on flamingo are you sure now right yes and it looked like she was opening an account yes but i cant be sure thats the problem with a oneman tail its a small branch bank and i couldnt hang around inside too long it looked like she was signing account papers and tony was just watching but i had to go out and wait outside until they were done remember tony knew me if he even saw me the tail would be blown okay im going tonight tonight i have to make some calls first bosch went back into the kitchen and called grace billets while filling her in on what he had learned and his hunch about what it all meant he got a pot of coffee going after getting her approval to travel he next called edgar and then rider and made arrangements to pick them up at the station in one hour he poured himself a cup of coffee and leaned against the counter in deep thought felton there was a contradiction it seemed to bosch if the metro captain was the joey marks organizations inside man why had he moved so quickly to go after goshen when he got the match on the fingerprints bosch had provided bosch played with this for a while and finally decided that felton must have seen an opportunity in moving goshen out of the way he must have believed that his position in the las vegas underworld would rise if goshen were out of the picture perhaps he even planned to arrange goshens assassination thereby ensuring the indebtedness of joey marks bosch realized that for this plan to work felton either didnt know that goshen knew he was the organizations inside man or he planned to get rid of goshen before he got a chance to tell anyone bosch took a sip of the scalding coffee and put these thoughts aside he went back into the living room eleanor was still on the couch are you going yeah ive got to pick up jerry and kiz why tonight got to be there before the bank opens tomorrow you think veronica is going to be there its a hunch i think joey marks finally figured out just like we did that if he didnt whack tony then somebody else did and that person had to have been close to him and that that person now has his money he knew veronica from way back and would figure she was up to it i think he sent felton over to check into it and to get his money back and take care of her if she was dirty on it but she mustve talked him out of it somehow probably by mentioning she had two million in skim in a safe deposit box in vegas i think thats what stopped felton from killing her and instead made him take her with him shes probably only alive until they get into that box i think she gave felton her husbands last betting slip because she knew he might cash it and wed be watching for it what makes you think its at the bank where i saw him go because we know about everything he had over here all his accounts its not over here powers told me veronica had told him that tony dropped the skim into a safe deposit box that she wouldnt have access to until he was dead she wasnt a signatory on it so my guess is that its in vegas its the only place hes been outside of la for the last year and that if one day he was taking his girlfriend to open a bank account somewhere hed just go ahead and take her to the same bank he used eleanor nodded its funny bosch said what is that what all of this really came down to was a bank caper its not really about tony alisos murder its about the money he skimmed and hid a bank caper with his murder sort of a side effect and thats how you and i met on a bank job she nodded her eyes going far off as she thought about it bosch immediately wished he hadnt brought the memory up sorry he said i guess its not really that funny eleanor looked up at him from the couch harry im going with you to las vegas part viii the silver state national bank branch where tony aliso had taken his girlfriend while eleanor wish had watched was in the corner of a small shopping plaza between a radio shack and a mexican restaurant called la fuentes the parking lot was largely empty at dawn on monday morning when the fbi agents and lapd detectives came to set up the bank didnt open until nine and the other businesses would follow beginning at ten because the businesses were closed the agents had a problem in locating their surveillance points it would be too obvious to stick four government cars in the lot they would be too noticeable because there were only five other cars in the entire blocklong parking lot four parked on the outer fringes and an old cadillac parked in the first row nearest the bank there were no license plates on the caddy which had a spider web crack in the windshield its windows left open and the trunk sprung and held closed by a chain and padlock through one of its many rustedout spots it had the sad appearance of having been abandoned its owner probably another las vegas casualty like someone lost in the desert and dying of thirst just a few feet from an oasis the caddy had stopped for the final time just a few feet from the bank and all the money inside it the agents after cruising by the location a few times to get the lay of the land decided to use the caddy as a blind by popping the hood and sticking an agent in a greasy tshirt under it and ostensibly working on the dead engine they complemented this agent with a panel van parked right next to the caddy four agents were in the van at seven that morning they had taken it to the federal utilities shop and had a painter stencil la fuentes mexican restaurantestablished on the side panels in red paint the paint was still drying when they drove the van into the lot at eight now at nine the lot was slowly beginning to fill mostly with employees of the stores and a few silver state customers who needed to take care of business as soon as the bank opened its doors bosch watched all of this from the backseat of a federal car lindell and an agent named baker were in the front seat they were parked in the service bay of a gas station across flamingo road from the shopping center where the bank was located edgar and rider were in another bureau car parked further up flamingo there were two other bureau cars in the area one static and one roving the plan was for lindell to move his car into the bank parking lot once it became more crowded with cars and the bureau car would not stand out this plan included a bureau helicopter making wide arcs around the shopping center theyre opening up a voice from the car radio reported gotcha la fuentes lindell said back the bureau cars were each equipped with a radio pedal and overhead mike on the windshield visor meaning the driver of each car simply depressed the foot pedal and spoke avoiding having to raise a microphone to his mouth and possibly being noticed and identified as law enforcement bosch had heard that the lapd was finally getting such equipment but the narcotics units and specialized surveillance teams were getting it first lindell he said you ever go to talk on the radio and slam on the brakes by mistake not yet bosch why just curious how all this fancy equipment works its only as good as the people who work it bosch yawned he couldnt remember the last time he had slept they had driven through the night to get to las vegas and then spent the rest of the time planning for the bank surveillance so what do you think bosch lindell asked him sooner or later this morning theyll want their money they dont want to wait yeah maybe you think its later if it was me id do it later that way if there were people out there watching and waitingwhether its the bureau or lapd or powers or whoevertheyd get cooked in the sun know what i mean yeah we sit out here all day and we arent going to be very sharp when the time comes bosch was quiet for a little while after that from the backseat he studied lindell he noticed that the agent had gotten a haircut there was no sign of the spot where bosch had hacked off his ponytail you think youre going to miss it bosch asked miss what being under the life i mean no it was getting old ill be happy to go straight not even the girls bosch saw lindells eyes take a quick swipe at baker and then look at bosch in the rearview mirror that told bosch to let that subject go whaddaya think about the lot now don lindell said changing the subject baker scanned the lot it was slowly filling up there was a bagel shop on the far end from the bank and that was responsible for most of the autos at the moment i think we can take it in park it by the bagel place baker said theres enough cover now okay then lindell said he tilted his head slightly so that he was projecting his voice toward the visor uh la fuentes this is roy rogers were going to take our position in now well check ya from the bagel shop that will be to your posterior i believe roger that came the return you always wanted to be on my tail end didnt you roy funny guy lindell said an hour went by while they watched from their new position and nothing happened lindell was able to move their car in closer parking in front of a carddealing school about half the parking lots length from the bank it was class day and several wouldbe dealers had been pulling in and parking it was good cover i dont know bosch lindell said breaking a long silence you think theyre going to show or not i never said it was anything more than a hunch but i still think it all fits it even fits better since we got here last week i found a matchbook in alisos room at the mirage it was from la fuentes whether they show or not i say tonys got a box in that bank well im thinking about sending don here in to ask about that we might be able to call an end to this and stop wasting our time if we find out theres no box well its your call you got that right a couple more minutes of tense silence went by what about powers lindell asked what about him i dont see him here either bosch when you got here this morning you were all hot and heavy about him comin out here to find her and blast her full of holes so where is he i dont know lindell but if were smart enough to figure this out so is he i wouldnt doubt it if he knew from tailing tony where the box was all along and just left that out of our little conversation wouldnt surprise me either but i still say itd be stupid for him to come here hes got to know we have a fix on this stupid isnt the word its suicidal but i dont think he cares he just wants her to go down and if he takes a bullet too then thats the way it goes like i told you before he was ready to do the kamikaze scene at the station when he thought she was there well lets just hope hes cooled down a little since there baker barked out bosch followed his pointing finger toward the far corner of the lot where a white limousine had just pulled in and was moving slowly toward the bank jesus lindell said dont tell me he is this stupid all limos looked basically the same to bosch but somehow lindell and baker had recognized the car is that joey marks its his limo he likes those big whitewalls its the wop in him i just canthe cant be in there hes not going to waste two years of my fucking life making this pickup is he the limo stopped in the lane in front of the bank there was no further movement you got this la fuentes lindell asked yeah we got it came a whispered reply though there was clearly no way anyone in that van could be overheard by someone in the limo uh one two and three standby lindell continued looks like we might have the fox in the henhouse air jordan you take five until further i dont want you swinging over and spooking anybody this brought a chorus of rogers from the three other ground units and the helicopter on second thought three why dont you come on up by the southwest entrance and stand by there for me lindell said roger that finally the door to the limo opened but it was on the side blocked from boschs view he waited not breathing and after a beat captain john felton emerged from the limo bingo the whisper came over the radio felton then leaned back into the open door and reached in veronica aliso now emerged feltons hand tightly around her arm following her another man emerged at the same time the trunk opened automatically while this second man who was wearing gray pants and a shirt with an oval name tag sewn above the breast pocket went to the trunk felton bent down and said something to someone still inside the limo he never took his hand off veronicas arm bosch caught only a glimpse of veronicas face then though he was an easy thirty yards from her he could see the fear and weariness it had probably been the longest night of her life the second man pulled a heavy red toolbox from the trunk and followed behind as felton walked veronica toward the bank his arm still gripping her and his head swiveling as he looked about bosch saw feltons focus linger on the van and then finally look away the paint job had probably been the deciding factor it had been a nice touch as they walked alongside the old cadillac felton bent down to look at the man working under the hood satisfied he was not a threat felton straightened up and went on to the glass doors of the bank before they disappeared inside bosch saw that veronica was clutching a cloth bag of some kind its dimensions were not discernible because it appeared to be empty and folded over on itself bosch didnt breathe again until they were no longer in sight okay lindell said to the visor weve got three felton the woman and the driller anybody recognize him the radio was silent for a few seconds and then a lone voice answered im too far away but i thought it looked like maury pollack hes a safeandlock man whos worked for joeys crew before okay lindell said well check him later im sending baker in now to open a new account wait five and then conlon you go in next check your sets now they went through a quick check of the radio sets baker and conlon were wearing under their clothes with wireless earpieces and wrist mikes they checked out and baker got out of the car and walked briskly along the sidewalk in front of the other stores toward the bank okay morris lindell said take a walk try the radio shack roger bosch watched as an agent he recognized from the predawn meeting started crossing the lot from a car parked near the southwest entrance to the lot morris and baker crossed paths ten feet apart but didnt acknowledge each other or even glance at the limo which still sat with its engine idling in the lane in front of the bank it took about an hour for the next five minutes to go by it was hot out but bosch was mainly sweating from the anxiety of waiting and wondering what was going on there had been only one transmission from baker once he was inside he had whispered that the subjects were in the safe deposit vault okay conlon go lindell ordered at the fiveminute mark bosch soon saw conlon walking along the storefronts from the direction of the bagel shop he went into the bank and then there was nothing for the next fifteen excruciating minutes finally lindell spoke just to break the silence how we doin out there everybody chipper there was a chorus of microphone clicks signaling an affirmative response just as the radio had gone silent again bakers voice came up in an urgent whisper theyre coming out coming out somethings wrong bosch watched the bank doors and in a moment felton and veronica came out the police captains hand still firmly on her arm the driller followed behind lugging his red toolbox felton didnt look around this time he just walked with purpose toward the limo he carried the bag now and it did not appear to bosch to have grown in size if veronicas face looked fearful and tired before it now looked even more distorted by fright it was hard for bosch to tell at this distance but it looked like she was crying the door to the limo was opened from within as the threesome retraced their path alongside the old cadillac and were getting near all right lindell said to the listening agents on my call we go in ill take the front of the limo three you are in behind me one and two you got the back standard vehicular stop la fuentes i want you people to come up and clear the limo do it quick if theres shooting everybody watch the cross fire watch the cross fire as the rogers were coming in bosch was watching veronica he could tell she knew she was going to her death the look on her face was vaguely reminiscent of what bosch had seen on her husbands face that certain knowledge that the game was up as he watched he suddenly saw the trunk of the cadillac spring open behind her and from it as if propelled by the same taut steel jumped powers in a loud wildanimal voice that bosch heard clearly and would never forget powers yelled one word as he hit the ground veronica as she felton and the driller turned to the origin of the sound powers raised his hands both of them holding weapons in that instant bosch saw the glint of his own gun the satinfinished smith amp wesson in the killer cops left hand gun lindell yelled everybody in everybody in he jerked the car into gear and slammed his foot on the gas pedal the car jerked forward and started screaming toward the limo but bosch knew there was nothing they could do they were too far away he watched the scene unfold with a grim fascination as if he were watching a slowmotion scene from a peckinpah movie powers began firing both guns the shells ejecting and arcing away over both his shoulders as he stepped toward the limo felton made an attempt to go inside his jacket for his own gun but he was cut down in the fusillade the first to drop then veronica standing perfectly still facing her killer and making no move to run or shield herself was hit and went down dropping to the pavement where bosch couldnt see her because the limo blocked his view powers kept coming and firing the driller dropped his toolbox raised his hands and started stepping backward away from the line of fire powers apparently ignored him bosch couldnt tell if he was shooting at veronicas fallen body or into the open door of the limo the limo took off its tires spinning at first without purchase before it finally started to move the rear door still open but almost immediately its driver failed to negotiate the left turn in the parking lane and the big car crashed into a row of parked cars the driver jumped out and started running in the direction of the bagel shop powers seemed to pay the fleeing driver no mind he had reached the spot where felton had fallen to the ground he dropped boschs gun on the police captains chest and reached down for the bag which was on the ground next to feltons hand it seemed that powers did not realize the bag was empty until he had actually picked it up off the ground and held it and as he was making this discovery the doors of the van behind him were opened and four agents carrying shotguns were coming out the agent in the tshirt was coming around the side of the cadillac the handgun he had hidden in the engine compartment now pointed at powers a squealing tire from one of the approaching bureau cars drew powerss attention away from the empty duffel bag he dropped it and turned on the five agents behind him he raised both his hands again though he only had one gun this time the agents opened fire and bosch watched as powers was literally lifted off the ground by the force of the impact and onto the front hood of a fullsized pickup truck that probably belonged to a bank customer powers landed on his back his hand lost its grip on the remaining gun and it clattered off the hood to the ground as loud as the eight seconds of shooting had been the silence that followed the gun falling to the ground seemed even louder powers was dead felton was dead giuseppe marconi aka joseph marconi aka joey marks was deadhis body sprawled and awash in blood on the soft leather seats in the back of his limousine when they got to veronica aliso she was alive but dying she had been hit with two rounds in the upper chest and the bubbles in the froth of blood in her mouth indicated her lungs had been shredded while the fbi agents ran about securing and containing the scene bosch and rider went to veronica her eyes were open but losing their moisture they were moving all around as if searching for someone or something that wasnt there her jaw started to work and she said something but bosch couldnt hear he crouched down over her and turned his ear to her mouth can youget me ice she whispered bosch turned and looked at her he didnt understand she started to speak again and he turned his ear to her mouth again the pavementso hot ii need ice bosch looked at her and nodded its coming its coming veronica wheres the money he bent over her realizing that she was right the pavement was now burning the palms of his hands he could barely make out her words at least they dontthey dont get it she started coughing then a deep wet cough and bosch knew her chest was full of blood and it wouldnt be long before she drowned he couldnt think of what to do or say to this woman he realized they were probably his own bullets in her and that she was dying because they had fucked up and let powers get away he almost wanted to ask her to forgive him to say she understood how things could go so wrong he looked away from her and across the lot he could hear sirens approaching but he had seen enough gunshot wounds to know she wasnt going to need the ambulance he looked back down at her her face was very pale and going slack her lips moved once more and he bent to listen this time her voice was no more than a desperate rasp in his ear he could not understand her words and he whispered in her ear to say it again et my gergo he turned his head to look at her the confusion in his eyes he shook his head an annoyed expression crossed her face let she said clearly using the last of her strength letmy daughter go bosch kept his eyes locked on hers as that last line ran through his mind then without thinking about it he nodded once to her and as he watched she died her eyes lost their focus and he could tell she was gone bosch stood up and rider studied his face harry what did she say she saidim not sure what she said bosch edgar and rider stood leaning against the trunk of lindells car watching as a phalanx of fbi and metro people continued to descend on the crime scene lindell had ordered the entire shopping center closed and marked off with yellow tape a move that prompted edgar to comment when these guys throw a crime scene they really throw a crime scene each of them had already given a statement they were no longer part of the investigation they were merely witnesses to the event and now observers the special agent in charge of the las vegas field office was on the scene directing the investigation the bureau had brought in a motor home that had four separate interview rooms in it and agents were taking statements in them from witnesses to the shooting the bodies were still there now covered in yellow plastic on the pavement and in the limo that splash of bright color made for good video for the news helicopters circling overhead bosch had been able to pick up pieces of information from lindell on how things stood the id number on the cadillac in which powers had hidden for at least the four hours it was under observation by the fbi was traced to an owner in palmdale california a desert town northeast of los angeles the owner was already on file with the bureau he was a white supremacist who had held antigovernment rallies on his land the last two independence days he was also known to have sought to contribute to the defense funds of the men charged with bombing the federal courthouse in oklahoma city two years before lindell told bosch that the saic had ordered an arrest warrant for the owner on charges of conspiracy to commit murder for his role in helping powers it had been a nice plan the trunk of the caddy was lined with a thick carpet and several blankets the chain and padlock used to hold it closed could be unhooked from the inside through rustedout spots on the fenders and trunk it had been possible for powers to watch and wait for the right moment to come out guns ready the driller who it turned out was indeed maury pollack was only too happy to cooperate with the agents he was just happy he wasnt one of the ones wearing a yellow plastic blanket he told lindell and the others that joey marks had picked him up that morning told him to wear a workingmans outfit and to bring his drill he didnt know what the situation was because there was little talking in the limo on the ride over he just knew the woman was scared inside the bank veronica aliso had presented a bank officer with a copy of her husbands death certificate his will and a court order issued friday in las vegas municipal court granting her as sole heir to anthony aliso access to his safe deposit box access was approved and the box was drilled because mrs aliso said she had not been able to locate her husbands key the trouble was pollack said when he drilled the box open they found it was empty can you imagine that lindell said as he related this information to bosch all of this for nothing i was hoping to get my hands on that two mil of course wedve split it with la right down the middle bosch right bosch said did you look at the records when was the last time tony went into his box thats another thing he was just in on friday like twelve hours before they killed him he went in and cleared the box he mustve had a premonition or something he knew man he knew maybe bosch thought about the matchbook from la fuentes that he had found in tonys room at the mirage tony didnt smoke but he remembered the ashtrays at the house where layla had grown up he decided that if tony had cleared his box out on that friday and eaten at la fuentes while he was here the only likely reason he would have ended up with matches from the restaurant in his room was that he had been at the restaurant with someone who needed them now the question is wheres the money lindell said we can seize it if we can find it ol joeys not going to need it lindell looked over at the limo the door was still open and one of marconis legs stuck out from under the yellow plastic a powder blue pants leg a black loafer and white sock that was all bosch could see of joey marks now the bank people are they cooperating or do you need a warrant for every move you make bosch asked no theyre on board the managers in there shaking like a leaf not every day you get a massacre outside your front door then ask them to check their records and see if theres a box in there under the name gretchen alexander gretchen alexander whos that you know her roy its layla layla are you fuckin kidding me you think hed give that bimbo two million duckets while he goes off and gets himself killed just check roy its worth a shot lindell went off toward the bank doors bosch looked at his partners jerry you going to want your gun back we should tell them now so they dont destroy them or file them away forever my gun edgar looked at all of the yellow plastic with a pained look on his face no harry i dont think so that piece is haunted now i dont ever want it back yeah bosch said i was thinking the same thing bosch brooded about things for a while and then heard his name being called he turned and saw lindell beckoning him from the door of the bank he headed over bingo lindell said shes got a box they walked back into the bank and bosch saw several agents conducting interviews with the branchs stunned employees lindell led him to a desk where the branch manager sat she was a woman of about thirty with brown curly hair the nameplate on her desk said jeanne connors lindell picked up a file that was on her desk and showed it to bosch she has a box here and she made tony aliso a signatory on it he pulled the box at the same time he pulled his own on the friday before he got nailed you know what im thinking i think he emptied his and put it all in hers probably bosch was looking at the safe deposit entry records in the file they were handwritten on a three by five card so lindell said what we do is we get a warrant for her box and drill the suckermaybe get maury out there to do it since hes being so cooperative we seize the money and the federal government is that much ahead you guysd get a split too bosch looked at him you can drill it if youve got the probable cause but there isnt going to be anything in it bosch pointed to the last entry on the box card gretchen alexander had pulled the box herself five days earlierthe wednesday after tony aliso was killed lindell stared at it a long moment before reacting jesus you think she cleared it out yeah roy i do shes gone isnt she youve been looking for her havent you shes in the wind man and i guess so am i youre leaving i gave my statement im clear ill see you roy yeah okay bosch bosch headed to the door of the bank as he opened it lindell came up behind him but whyd he put it all in her box he was still holding the box card and staring at it as if it might suddenly answer all his questions i dont know but ive got a guess whats that bosch he was in love with her him a girl like that you never know people can kill each other for all kinds of reasons i guess they can fall in love with each other for all kinds of reasons you gotta take it when it comes no matter if its a girl like that orsomeone else lindell just nodded and bosch stepped through the door bosch edgar and rider took a cab to the federal building and picked up their car bosch said he wanted to stop by the house in north las vegas where gretchen alexander had grown up she isnt going to be there harry edgar said are you kidding i know she wont be there i just want to talk to the old lady for a minute he found the house without getting lost and pulled into the driveway the rx was still there and didnt look like it had moved this will only take a minute if you want to stay in the car ill go in rider said ill stay and keep the ac going edgar said in fact ill drive the first leg harry he got out as bosch and rider exited and came around and took boschs place behind the wheel boschs knock on the front door was answered quickly the woman had heard or seen the car and was ready you she said looking through the twoinch crack she had allowed in the door gretchen still isnt here i know mrs alexander its you i want to talk to me what on earth for would you please let us in its hot out here she opened the door with a resigned look on her face hot in here too i cant afford to put the thermostat lower than eighty bosch and rider entered and moved into the living room he introduced rider and all three of them sat down this time bosch sat on the edge of the sofa remembering how he had sunk in last time all right whats this about why do you want to talk to me i want to know about your granddaughters mother bosch said the old womans mouth went slack and bosch could tell rider wasnt much less confused her mother dorothy asked her mothers long gone didnt have the decency to see her own child through never mind her mother when did she leave long time ago gretchen wasnt even out of diapers she just left me a note saying goodbye and good luck she was gone whered she go i have no earthly idea and i dont want to know good riddance is what i say she turned her back on that beautiful little girl didnt have the decency to ever call or even send for a picture how did you know she was even alive i didnt she could be dead all these years for all i know or care she was a bad liar the type who got louder and indignant when she lied you know bosch said she sent you money didnt she the woman looked sullenly down at her hands for a long moment it was her way of confirming his guess how often once or twice a year it wasnt near enough to make up for what she did bosch wanted to ask how much would have been enough but let it go how did the money come mail it was in cash i know it came from sherman oaks california that was always the postmark what does this have to do with anything now tell me your daughters name dorothy she was born to me and my first husband my name was gilroy back then and that was hers jennifer gilroy rider said repeating veronica alisos true name the old woman looked at rider with surprise but didnt ask how she knew we called her jenny she said anyway you see when i took over with gretchen i was remarried and had a new name i gave it to gretchen so the kids at school wouldnt bother her about it everybody always thought i was her momma and that was fine with the both of us nobody needed to know diffrent bosch just nodded it had all come together now veronica aliso was laylas mother tony aliso had gone from the mother to the daughter there was nothing else to ask or say he thanked the old woman and touched rider on the back so that she would go through the door first out on the front step he paused and looked back at dorothy alexander he waited until rider was a few steps toward the car before speaking when you hear from laylai mean gretchentell her not to come home tell her to stay as far away from here as she can he shook his head she shouldnt ever come home the woman didnt say anything bosch waited a couple moments while looking down at the worn welcome mat he then nodded and headed to the car bosch took the backseat behind edgar rider sat in the front as soon as they were in the car and edgar was backing out of the driveway rider turned around and looked at bosch harry how did you ever put that together her last words veronicas she said let my daughter go i just sort of knew then theres a resemblance there i just didnt place it before youve never even seen her ive seen her picture what edgar said whats going on do you think tony aliso knew who she was rider asked ignoring edgar hard to say bosch said if he did it makes what happened to him easier to understand easier to take maybe he was flaunting it with veronica maybe its what sent her over the edge and laylaslashgretchen edgars head was swiveling back and forth between them and the road a look of confusion on his face something tells me she didnt know i think if she did she would have told her grandmother and the old lady didnt know if he was just using her to get to veronica whyd he move all the money into her box he couldve been using her but he also couldve been in love with her well never know mightve just been coincidence that it happened on the day he got killed he couldve just transferred the cash because he had the irs on him maybe he was afraid theyd find out about the box and freeze his access to it it couldve been a lot of things but well never know now everybodys dead except for the girl edgar made a hard stop pulling to the side of the road coincidentally they happened to be across the street from dollys on madison is somebody gonna tell me what the hell is going on he demanded i do you people a favor and keep the car cool while you two go inside for a chat and then im left in the dark now what the hell are you two talking about he was looking at bosch in the rearview mirror just drive jed kiz will tell you when we get to the flamingo they drove into the front circle of the hilton flamingo and bosch left them there he moved quickly through the football fieldsized casino dodging rows of slot machines until he reached the poker room where eleanor had said she would be when they were done they had dropped her at the flamingo that morning after she had shown them the bank she had once seen tony aliso going into with gretchen alexander there were five tables going in the poker room bosch quickly scanned the faces of the players but did not see eleanor then as he turned to look back across the casino she was there just as when she had appeared on the first night hed gone looking for her harry eleanor i thought youd be playing i couldnt play while thinking about you out there is everything okay everything is fine were leaving good i dont like las vegas anymore he hesitated for a moment before saying anything he almost faltered but then the resolve came back to him there is that one stop id still like to make before we leave the one we talked about that is if youve decided she looked at him for a long moment and then a smile broke across her face part ix bosch walked across the polished linoleum on the sixth floor of parker center purposely driving his heels down with each step he wanted to put scuff marks on the carefully tended finish he turned into the alcove entrance to the internal affairs division and asked the secretary behind the counter for chastain she asked if he had an appointment and bosch told her he didnt make appointments with people like chastain she stared at him a moment and he stared back until she picked up a phone and punched in an extension after whispering into the line she held the phone to her chest and looked up at bosch and then eyed the shoebox and file he held in his hands he wants to know what its about tell him its about his case against me falling apart she whispered some more and then bosch was finally buzzed through the counters half door he went into the iad squad room where several of the desks were occupied by investigators chastain stood up from behind one of these what are you doing here bosch youre on suspension for letting that prisoner escape he said it loudly so that the others in the squad room would know that bosch was a guilty man the chief cut it down to a week bosch said i call that a vacation well thats only round one i still got your file open thats why im here chastain pointed to the interview room bosch had been in the week before with zane lets talk in there no bosch said were not talking chastain im just showing he dropped the file he was carrying on the desk chastain remained standing and looked at it without opening it what is this its the end of the case open it chastain sat down and opened the file exhaling loudly as if he were embarking on a distasteful and worthless chore on top was a copy of a page from the departments manual of procedure and officer conduct the manual was to iad dicks what the state penal code was to the rest of the officers and investigators in the department the page in the file pertained to officers associating with known criminals convicted felons and members of organized crime such association was strictly forbidden and punishable by dismissal from the department according to the code bosch you didnt need to bring me this ive got the whole book chastain said he was trying out some light banter because he didnt know what bosch was doing and was well aware that his peers were watching from their desks while trying to act as if they werent yeah well you better get your book out and read the bottom line there pal the exception chastain looked down at the bottom of the page says exception to this code can be established if the officer can show to the satisfaction of superior officers a family relationship through blood or marriage if that is established officer must thats enough bosch said he reached down and took the page so that chastain could see what was in the rest of the file what you have there chastain is a marriage certificate issued in clark county nevada attesting to my marriage to eleanor wish if thats not good enough for you beneath it are two affidavits from my partners they witnessed the marriage best man and maid of honor chastain kept his eyes on the paperwork its over man bosch said you lose so get the fuck out of my life chastain leaned back his face was red and he had an uncomfortable smile on his face now he was sure the others were watching youre telling me you got married just to avoid an iad beef no asshole i got married because i love somebody thats why you get married chastain didnt have a reply he shook his head looked at his watch and shuffled some papers while trying to act as though this was just a minor interruption in his day he did everything but look at his nails yeah i thought youd run out of things to say bosch said ill see you around chastain he turned to walk away but then turned back to chastain oh and i almost forgot you can tell your source our deal is done with also what source bosch deal what are you talking about im talking about fitzgerald or whoever you get your information from at ocid i dont sure you do i know you chastain you couldnt have come up with eleanor wish on your own youve got a pipeline over there to fitzgerald he told you about her it was him or one of his people doesnt matter to me who either way im out of a deal i made with him you can tell him that bosch held the shoebox up and shook it the videotape and audiotapes rattled inside it but he could tell chastain had no idea what was in the box or what it meant you tell him chastain he said again see you around he finally left then pausing only at the counter to give the secretary a thumbsup sign in the hallway rather than turn left toward the elevators he took a right and headed through the double doors of the chief of polices office suite the chiefs adjutant a lieutenant in uniform sat behind the reception desk bosch didnt know him which was good he walked up and put the shoebox down on the desk can i help you whats this its a box lieutenant its got some tapes the chief will want to watch and listen to right away bosch made a move to leave wait a minute the adjutant said will he know what this is about tell him to call deputy chief fitzgerald he can explain what its about bosch left then not turning around when the adjutant called after him for his name he slipped through the double doors and headed down to the elevator he felt good he didnt know if anything would come of the illegal tapes he had given the police chief but he felt that all decks were cleared his show with the box earlier with chastain would ensure that the word got back to fitzgerald that this was exclusively boschs play billets and rider should be safe from recriminations by the ocid chief he could come after bosch if he wanted but bosch felt safe now fitzgerald had nothing on him anymore no one did part x it was their first day on the beach after spending two days almost exclusively in their room bosch couldnt get comfortable on the chaise lounge he didnt understand how people did this just sit in the sun and bake he was covered with lotion and there was sand caked between his toes eleanor had bought him a red bathing suit that he thought made him look foolish and that made him feel like a target at least he thought it wasnt one of those slingshot things some of the men on the beach were wearing he propped himself up on his elbows and looked around hawaii was unbelievable so beautiful it was like a dream and the women were beautiful too especially eleanor she lay beside him on her own lounge her eyes were closed and there was a small smile on her face she wore a onepiece black bathing suit that was cut high on her hips and showed off her tanned and nicely muscled legs what are you looking at she said without opening her eyes nothing i justi cant get comfortable i think im going to take a walk or something why dont you get a book to read harry you have to relax thats what honeymoons are about sex relaxation good food and good company well two out of four isnt bad whats wrong with the food the foods great funny she reached out and hit him in the arm then she too propped herself up on her elbows and gazed out at the shimmering blue water they could see the spine of molokini rising in the distance its so beautiful here harry yes it is they sat in silence for a few moments watching the people walking by at the waters edge bosch brought his legs up leaned forward and sat with his elbows on his knees he could feel the sun burning into his shoulders it was beginning to feel good he noticed a woman walking languidly along the edge she had the attention of every man on the beach she was tall and lithe and had long brownishblond hair that was wet from the sea her skin was copper and she wore the smallest of bathing suits just a few strings and triangles of black cloth as she passed in front of him the glare dropped off boschs sunglasses and he studied her face the familiar lines and tilt of the jaw were there he knew her harry eleanor whispered then is thatit looks like the dancer the girl in that photo you had the one i saw tony with layla bosch said not answering her but just to say the name its her isnt it i didnt used to believe in coincidences he said are you going to call the bureau the moneys probably right here on the island with her bosch watched the woman moving away her back was to him now and from that angle it was almost as if she were naked just a few strings from her suit were visible the glare came back on his glasses at this angle and his vision of her was distorted she was disappearing in the glare and the mist coming in from the pacific no im not calling anybody he finally said why not she didnt do anything he said she let some guy give her money nothing wrong with that maybe she was even in love with him he watched for another moment thinking about veronicas last words to him anyway whos going to miss the money he said the bureau the lapd some fat old gangster in a chicago suburb with a bunch of bodyguards around him forget it im not calling anybody he took one last look at her she was far away now and as she walked she was looking out to sea the sun holding her face bosch nodded to her but of course she didnt see this he then lay back down on the lounge and closed his eyes almost immediately he felt the sun begin penetrating his skin doing its healing work and then he felt eleanors hand on top of his he smiled he felt safe he felt like nobody could ever hurt him again
