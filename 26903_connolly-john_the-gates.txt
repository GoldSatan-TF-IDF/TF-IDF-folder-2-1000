john connolly the gates for cameron and alistair scientists are not after the truth it is the truth that is after scientists dr karl schlecta i in which the universe forms which seems like a very good place to start in the beginning about billion years ago to be reasonably precise there was a very very small dot ftnref scientists call it the singularity people who are religious might call it the mote in gods eye some scientists will say you cant believe in the singularity and the idea of a god or gods some religious people will try to tell you the same thing still you can believe in the singularity and a god if you like its entirely up to you one requires evidence the other faith theyre not the same thing but as long as you dont get the two mixed up then everything should be fine the dot which was hot and incredibly heavy contained everything that was and everything that ever would be all crammed into the tiniest area possible a point so small that it had no dimensions at all suddenly the dot which was under enormous pressure due to all that it contained exploded and it duly scattered everything that was or ever would be across what was now about to become the universe scientists call this the big bang although it wasnt really a big bang because it happened everywhere and all at once just one thing about that age of the universe stuff there are people who will try to tell you that the earth is only about years old that humans and dinosaurs were around at more or less the same time a bit like in the movies jurassic park and one million years bc and that evolution the change in the inherited traits of organisms passed from one generation to the next does not and never did happen given the evidence its hard not to feel that theyre probably wrong many of them also believe that the universe was created in seven days by an old chap with a beard perhaps with breaks for tea and sandwiches this may be true but if it was created in this way they were very long days about two billion years long for each give or take a few million years which is a lot of sandwiches anyway to return to the dot lets be clear on something because its very important the building blocks of everything that you can see around you and a great deal more that you cant see at all were blasted from that little dot at a speed so fast that within a minute the universe was a million billion miles in size and still expanding so the dot was responsible for bringing into being planets and asteroids whales and budgerigars you and julius caesar and elvis presley and evil because somewhere in there was all the bad stuff as well the stuff that makes otherwise sensible people hurt one another theres a little of it in all of us and the best that we can do is to try not to let it govern our actions too often but just as the planets began to take on a certain shape and the asteroids and the whales and the budgerigars and you so too in the darkest of dark places evil took on a form it did so while the residue of the big bang spread across the universe ftnref in fact about percent of the static that sometimes appears on your television set is a relic of the big bang and if your eyes were sensitive to microwave light instead of just visible light then the sky at night would appear white instead of black because it continues to glow from the heat of the big bang oh and because atoms are so small and are constantly recycled every breath you take contains atoms that were once breathed by julius caesar and elvis presley so a little bit of you formerly ruled rome and sang blue suede shoes while the earth was cooling while tectonic plates shifted until at last life appeared and evil found a target for its rage yet it could not reach us for the universe was not ordered in its favor or so it seemed but the thing in the darkness was very patient it stoked the fires of its fury and it waited for a chance to strike ii in which we encounter a small boy his dog and some people who are up to no good on the night in question mr abernathy answered the door to find a small figure dressed in a white sheet standing on his porch the sheet had two holes cut into it at eye level so that the small figure could walk around without bumping into things a precaution that seemed wise given that the small figure was also wearing rather thick glasses the glasses were balanced on its nose outside the sheet giving it the appearance of a shortsighted and not terribly frightening ghost a mismatched pair of sneakers the left blue the right red poked out from the bottom of the sheet in its left hand the figure held an empty bucket from its right stretched a dog leash ending at a red collar that encircled the neck of a little dachshund the dachshund stared up at mr abernathy with what mr abernathy felt was a troubling degree of selfawareness if he hadnt known better mr abernathy might have taken the view that this was a dog that knew it was a dog and wasnt very happy about it all things considered equally the dog also appeared to know that mr abernathy was not a dog for in general dogs view humans as just large dogs that have learned the neat trick of walking on two legs which only impresses dogs for a short period of time this suggested to mr abernathy that here was a decidedly smart dog indeedfreakishly so there was something disapproving in the way the dog was staring at mr abernathy mr abernathy sensed that the dog was not terribly keen on him and he found himself feeling both annoyed and slightly depressed that he had somehow disappointed the animal mr abernathy looked from the dog to the small figure then back again as though unsure as to which one of them was going to speak trick or treat said the small figure eventually from beneath the sheet mr abernathys face betrayed utter bafflement what said mr abernathy trick or treat the small figure repeated mr abernathys mouth opened once then closed again he looked like a fish having an afterthought he appeared to grow even more confused he glanced at his watch and checked the date wondering if he had somehow lost a few days between hearing the doorbell ring and opening the door its only october the twentyeighth he said i know said the small figure i thought id get a head start on everyone else what said mr abernathy again what said the small figure why are you saying what said mr abernathy i just said what i know why why what my question exactly said the small figure who are you asked mr abernathy his head was starting to hurt im a ghost said the small figure then added a little uncertainly boo no not what are you who are you oh the small figure removed the glasses and lifted up its sheet revealing a pale boy of perhaps eleven with wispy blond hair and very blue eyes im samuel johnson i live in number and this is boswell he added indicating the dachshund by raising his leash mr abernathy who was new to the town nodded as though this piece of information had suddenly confirmed all of his suspicions upon hearing its name spoken the dog shuffled its bottom on mr abernathys porch and gave a bow mr abernathy regarded it suspiciously your shoes dont match said mr abernathy to samuel i know i couldnt decide which pair to wear so i wore one of each mr abernathy raised an eyebrow he didnt trust people especially children who displayed signs of individuality so said samuel trick or treat neither said mr abernathy why not because its not halloween yet thats why not but i was showing initiative samuels teacher mr hume often spoke about the importance of showing initiative although anytime samuel showed initiative mr hume seemed to disapprove of it which samuel found very puzzling no you werent said mr abernathy youre just too early its not the same thing oh please a chocolate bar no not even an apple no i can come back tomorrow if that helps no go away with that mr abernathy slammed the front door leaving samuel and boswell to stare at the flaking paintwork samuel let the sheet drop down once more restoring himself to ghostliness and replaced his glasses he looked down at boswell boswell looked up at him samuel shook the bucket sadly it seemed like a good idea he said to boswell i thought people might like an early fright boswell sighed in response as if to say i told you so samuel gave one final hopeful glance at mr abernathys front door willing him to change his mind and appear with something for the bucket even if it was just a single solitary nut but the door remained firmly closed the abernathys hadnt lived on the road for very long and their house was the biggest and oldest in town samuel had rather hoped that the abernathys would decorate it for halloween or perhaps turn it into a haunted house but after his recent encounter with mr abernathy he didnt think this was very likely mr abernathys wife meanwhile often looked like she had just been fed a very bitter slice of lemon and was searching for somewhere to spit it out discreetly no thought samuel the abernathy house would not be playing a significant part in this years halloween festivities as things turned out he was very very wrong mr abernathy stood silent and unmoving at the door he peered through the peephole until he was certain that the boy and his dog were leaving then locked the door and turned away hanging from the end of the banister behind him was a black hooded robe not unlike something a bad monk might wear to scare people into behaving themselves mr abernathy put the robe back on as he walked down the stairs to his basement had samuel seen mr abernathy in his robe he might have reconsidered his position on mr abernathys willingness to enter into the spirit of halloween mr abernathy was not a happy man he had married the woman who became mrs abernathy because he wanted someone to look after him someone who would advise him on the right clothes to wear and the proper food to eat thus allowing mr abernathy more time to spend thinking mr abernathy wrote books that told people how to make their lives happier he was quite successful at this mainly because he spent every day dreaming about what might have made him happier including not being married to mrs abernathy he also made very sure that nobody who read his work ever met his wife if they did they would immediately guess how unhappy mr abernathy really was and stop buying his books now his robe heavy on his shoulders he made his way into the darkened room below waiting for him were three other people all dressed in similar robes painted on the floor was a fivepointed star at the center of which was an iron burner filled with glowing charcoal incense grains had been sprinkled across the coals so that the basement was filled with a thick perfumed smoke who was it dear asked one of the hooded figures she said the word dear the way an executioners ax might say the word thud if it could speak as it was lopping off someones head that weird kid from number said mr abernathy to his wife for it was she who had spoken and his dog what did he want he was trick or treating but its not even halloween yet i know i told him that i think theres something wrong with him and his dog mr abernathy added well hes gone now silly child can we get on with it said a male voice from beneath another hood i want to go home and watch football the man in question was quite fat and his robe was stretched taut across his belly his name was reginald renfield and he wasnt quite sure what he was doing standing around in a smokefilled basement dressed in a robe that was at least two sizes too small for him his wife had made him come along and nobody argued with doris renfield she was even bigger and fatter than her husband but not half as nice and since mr renfield wasnt very nice at all that made mrs renfield very unpleasant indeed reginald do keep quiet said mrs renfield all you do is complain were having fun oh said reginald are we he didnt see anything particularly amusing about standing in a cold basement wearing a scratchy robe trying to summon up demons from the beyond mr renfield didnt believe in demons although he sometimes wondered if his friend mr abernathy might have married one by accident mrs abernathy frightened him the way strong women will often frighten weak men still doris had insisted that they come along and join their new friends who had recently moved to the town of biddlecombe for an evening of fun mrs abernathy and mrs renfield had met in a bookshop where they were both buying books about ghosts and angels from then on their friendship had grown eventually drawing in their husbands as well mr renfield didnt like the abernathys exactly but a funny thing about adults is that they will spend time with people they dont like very much if they think it might benefit them in this case mr renfield was hoping that mr abernathy might buy an expensive television from mr renfields electrical shop well some of us are having fun said mrs renfield you wouldnt know fun if it ran up and tickled you under the arm she laughed loudly it sounded to her husband like someone pushing a witch in a barrel over a waterfall he pictured his wife in a barrel falling into very deep water and this cheered him up a bit enough said mrs abernathy everyone went quiet mrs abernathy stern and beautiful peered from beneath her hood join hands she said and they did so forming a circle around the star now let us begin and as one they started to chant most people are not bad oh they do bad things sometimes and we all have a little badness in us but very few people are unspeakably evil and most of the bad things they do seem perfectly reasonable to them at the time perhaps theyre bored or selfish or greedy but for the most part they dont actually want to hurt anyone when they do bad things they just want to make their own lives a little easier the four people in the basement fell into the category of bored they had boring jobs they drove boring cars they ate boring food their friends were boring for them everything was just well dull so when mrs abernathy produced an old book she had bought in a usedbooks store and suggested first to her husband and then to their slightlylessboringthantherest friends the renfields that the books contents might make for an interesting evening everyone had pronounced it a splendid idea the book didnt have a name its cover was made of worn black leather emblazoned with a star not unlike the one painted on the basement floor and its pages had turned yellow with age it was written in a language none of them had ever seen and which they were unable to understand and yet and yet somehow mrs abernathy had looked at the book and known exactly what they were meant to do it was almost as if the book had been speaking to her in her head translating its odd scratches and symbols into words she could comprehend the book had told her to bring her friends and her husband to the basement on this particular night to paint the star and light the charcoal and to chant the series of strange sounds that were now coming from each of their mouths it was all rather odd the abernathys and the renfields werent looking for trouble neither were they trying to do anything bad they werent evil or vicious or cruel they were just bored people with too much time on their hands and such people will in the end get up to mischief but just as someone who wears a sign saying kick me will in the normal course of events eventually be kicked so too there was enough mischief being done in that basement to attract something unusually bad something with more than mischief on its mind it had been waiting for a long time now that wait was about to come to an end iii in which we learn about particle accelerators and the playing of battleships deep beneath a mountain in the heart of europe nothing was happening well that wasnt entirely true lots of things were happening some of them quite spectacular but because they were happening at an infinitesimally small level it was quite hard for most people to get too excited about them the large hadron collider was as its name suggested very big it was in fact miles long and stretched inside a ringshaped tunnel burrowed through rock near geneva in switzerland the lhc was a particle accelerator the largest ever constructed a device for smashing protons together in a vacuum consisting of electromagnets chilled to degrees celcius or to you and me crumbs thats really cold anybody got a sweater i can borrow producing a powerful electromagnetic field basically two beams of hydrogen ions atoms that have been stripped of their electrons would whiz around the ring in opposite directions at about miles per second or close to the speed of light and then collide when they met each beam would have the energy of a big car traveling at miles per hour you dont want to be in a car traveling at miles per hour that crashes into another car traveling at the same speed that would not be good when the beams collided enormous amounts of energy would be released from all of the protons they contained and that was where things got really interesting the reason scientists had built the lhc was in order to study the aftermath of that collision which would produce very small particles smaller than atoms and atoms are already so small that it would take ten million of them laid end to end to cover the period at the end of this sentence ultimately they hoped to discover the higgs boson sometimes called the god particle the most basic component of everything in the material world take our two cars traveling at miles per hour before pounding into each other after the crash there isnt likely to be much of the cars left in fact there will probably be only very small pieces of car and possibly very small pieces of anyone who was unfortunate enough to be inside the cars at the time scattered all over the place what the scientists at cern the european organization for nuclear research hoped was that the colliding beams would leave behind lots of little patches of energy resembling those that existed seconds after the big bang when the dot of which we spoke at the start exploded and among them might be the higgs boson the higgs boson would stick out because it would actually be bigger than the two colliding protons that created it but it wouldnt hang about for very long as it would vanish almost instantly so the scientists would have to be quick to spot it it would be as though our two colliding cars had come together and formed a truck which then immediately collapsed in other words the scientists hoped to understand just how the universe came into being which is a big question that is a lot easier to ask than to answer you see scientistseven the very clever onesunderstand only about percent of the matter and energy in the universe which accounts for the stuff we can see around us mountains lakes bears artichokes that kind of thing ftnref and even all that stuff added together still amounts to much less than percent of not very much at all since more than percent of the volume of ordinary matter is empty space if we could get rid of all the empty space in the atoms of our bodies the whole of humanity could be squeezed into a matchbox with room left over for most of the animal kingdom too mind you there would be nobody left to look after the matchbox that leaves them scratching their heads over the remaining percent which is a lot of scratching to save time and prevent unnecessary head injuries the scientists decided that about percent of what remained should be called dark matter although they couldnt see it they knew that it existed because it bent starlight but if dark matter was interesting to them whatever accounted for the remaining percent of everything in the universe was more interesting still it was known as dark energy and it was invisible entirely hidden nobody knew where it came from but they had a pretty good idea of what it was doing it was driving galaxies farther and farther apart causing the universe to expand this would lead to two things the first thing was that human beings if they didnt start inventing fast ways to move somewhere else would eventually find themselves entirely alone as all the neighboring galaxies would have disappeared beyond the edge of the visible universe after that the universe would start to cool and everything in it would freeze to death thankfully thats likely to happen hundreds of billions of years in the future so theres no need to buy a thick coat just yet but its worth remembering the next time you feel the need to complain about the cold the lhc would probably be able to help scientists to better understand all of this as well as provide evidence of other really fascinating stuff like extra dimensions which as everyone knows are filled with monsters and aliens and big spaceships with laser cannons and well you get the picture at this point its a good idea to mention the mightcausethedestructionoftheearthandtheendoflifeasweknowit issue its a minor thing but you cant be too careful basically while the lhc was being built and lots of men in white coats were chatting about dark matter and highspeed collisions someone suggested the collider might create a black hole that would swallow the earth or instead it could cause particles of matter so strange that theyre called strangelets to appear and turn the earth into a lump of dead gray stuff its safe to say that this chap wasnt invited to the scientists christmas party now you or i if told we were about to do something that might just might bring about the end of the world would probably pause for a moment and wonder if it was a good idea after all scientists though are not like you or me instead the scientists pointed out that there was only a very very small chance that the collider might bring about the end of all life on earth hardly worth bothering about at all really they said not to worry take a look at this big spinning thing isnt it pretty ftnref anyway the scientists figured if the end of the world did happen there wouldnt be anybody left to blame them there would probably be just enough time for someone to say hey you said it wouldnt cause the end of before there was a bit of a bang and then silence scientists while very intelligent dont always think things through take for example the first caveman who found a nice rock tied it to a stick with a piece of vine and thought hmm ive just invented a thing for banging other things into things with i feel certain that nobody will use this to hit someone over the head with instead which someone promptly did in fact they probably hit him with it so that they could steal it this is how we end up with nuclear weapons and scientists claiming that theyd only set out to invent something that steamed radishes all of which brings us back to the important things happening in the large hadron collider the experiments were being monitored by a machine called velo velo detected all of the particles given off when the beams crashed it could tell their position to within one twohundredth of a millimeter or onetenth of the thickness of a human hair it was all very exciting although not exciting enough for two of the men who were responsible for watching the screens monitoring what was happening so they were doing what men often do in such situations they were playing battleships b four said victor who was german and blessed with lots of hair that he wore in a ponytail with some left over for his chin and upper lip miss said ed who was british and blessed with hardly any hair at all and certainly none that could be spared for his face nevertheless ed quite liked victor even if he felt victor had been given some of the hair that should by rights have come his way victors face creased in concentration somewhere in the not very vast vastness of eds board lay a submarine a destroyer and an aircraft carrier yet for the life of him victor couldnt seem to hit them he wondered if ed was lying about all those misses then decided that ed wasnt the kind of person who lied about much at all ed wasnt terribly imaginative and in victors experience it was imaginative people who tended to lie lying required making stuff up and only imaginative people were good at that victor had a little more imagination than ed and therefore lied more not much but certainly a bit ed heard victor sniff loudly ugh said victor was that you now ed smelled it too there was a distinct whiff of rotten eggs in the room no it wasnt me said ed somewhat offended for the second time in as many minutes victor wondered if ed might be lying anyway said ed its my turn e three miss beep what was that victor didnt look up i said it was a miss thats what it was a miss no said ed i meant what was that his right index finger was pointing at the computer screen which was occupied by a visual representation of all the exciting things happening in the particle accelerator and which had just beeped the image on the screen looked like a tornado albeit one that was the same width throughout instead of resembling a funnel i dont see anything wrong said victor a bit just whizzed off said ed and it went beep a bit said victor its not a bicycle bits dont just whiz off right then said ed looking miffed a particle of some kind appears to have disengaged itself from the whole and exited the accelerator is that better you mean that a bit just whizzed off said victor thinking who said we germans dont have a sense of humor ed just looked at him victor stared back then sighed its not possible he said its a contained environment particles dont simply leave it to go off well somewhere else it must have been a glitch ftnref whenever someone uses the word glitch which means a fault of some kind in a system you should immediately be suspicious because it means that they dont know what it is a technician who uses the term glitch is like a doctor who tells you youre sufferering from a thingy except the doctor wont tell you to go home and try turning yourself on and off again it wasnt a glitch said ed he abandoned the game and began furiously tapping buttons on a keyboard on a second screen he pulled up another version of the visual representation checked the time then began running it backward twenty seconds into the rewind a small glowing particle came into view from the left of the screen and appeared to rejoin the whole ed paused the image then allowed it to run forward again at half speed together he and victor watched as the bit whizzed off thats not good said victor no said ed it shouldnt even be possible what do you think it is ed examined the data i dont know both men were now working on keyboards simultaneously they pulled up the same string of data on their screens as they tried to pinpoint a reason for the anomaly im not seeing anything said ed it must be buried deep wait said victor im seeing no whats this whats happening as he and ed watched the data seemed to rewrite itself strings of code changed zeros became ones and ones became zeros frantically both men tried to arrest the progress of the changes but to no avail it must be a bug said victor its covering its own tracks someone must have hacked into the system said ed i helped to build this system said victor and even i couldnt hack into it not like this and then less than a minute after it began the changes to the code were completed ed tried rerunning the image of the particle separating itself from the accelerator but this time only the great tunnel of energy appeared upon the screen filled with protons behaving exactly as they should have been behaving well have to report it said ed i know said victor but theres no evidence theres just our word wont that be enough victor nodded probably but he stared at the screen what did it mean and more to the point where did it go and what is that smell scientists were not the only ones who had been monitoring the collider down in the dark places where the worst things hid an ancient evil had been watching the construction of the collider with great interest the entity that existed in the darkness had many names satan beelzebub the devil to the creatures that dwelt with it he was known as the great malevolence ftnref malevolence for those of you who were off sick from school that day means hatred but hatred of a very vicious evil kind incidentally when you put inverted commas around a word in this way as i just did around the word sick it means that you dont really believe that the word in question is true in this case i know that you werent really sick that day you just felt like having a morning off to watch childrens television in your pajamas hence sick instead of well sick if you really want to annoy someone you can make little inverted commas by holding up two fingers of each hand and twitching them gently as though youre tickling an invisible elf under the armpits for example when your mother calls you for dinner and dinner turns out to be boiled fish and broccoli you can say to her well ill just eat my dinner then and do the little fingers sign shell love it seriously i can hear her laughing already the great malevolence had been squatting in the blackness for a very long time he was there billions of years before people or dinosaurs or small singlecelled organisms that decided one day to become larger multicelled organisms so they could at some point in the future invent literature painting and annoying ring tones for cell phones he had watched from the depths of space and timefor rock and fire and earth vacuums and stars and planets were no obstacle to himas life appeared on earth as trees sprouted and the oceans teemed and he hated all that he saw he wanted to bring it all to an end but he could not he was trapped in a place of flame and stone surrounded by those like him some of whom he had created from his own flesh and others who had been banished there because they were foul and evil although none quite as foul or as evil as the great malevolence himself few of the legions of demons who dwelt with him in that distant fiery realm had even laid eyes upon the great malevolence for he existed in the deepest darkest corner of hell brooding and plotting waiting for his chance to escape now after so long he had just made his first move iv in which we learn about the inadvisability of attempting to summon up demons and of generally messing about with the afterlife samuel and boswell sat on the wall outside the abernathy house and watched the world go by as it was a quiet evening and most people were indoors having their tea there wasnt a whole lot of the world to watch and what there was wasnt doing very much samuel shook his bucket and heard the sound of emptiness which as anyone knows is not the same thing as no sound since it includes all the noise that someone was expecting to hear but doesnt ftnref this is similar to the old problem about whether or not a tree falling in a forest makes any noise if there is nobody there to hear it this of course assumes that the only creatures worth being concerned about when it comes to falling trees are human beings and ignores the plight of small birds assorted rodents and rabbits who happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and find a tree landing on their headsin the eighteenth century a man named bishop berkeley claimed that objects only exist because people are there to see them this led a lot of scientists to laugh at bishop berkeley and his ideas because they found them silly but according to quantum theory which is the very advanced branch of physics involving atoms parallel universes and other such matters bishop berkeley may have had a point quantum theory suggests that the tree exists in all possible states at the same time burned sawdust fallen or in the shape of a small wooden duck that quacks as its pulled along you dont know what state its in until you observe it in other words you cant separate the observer from the thing being observed samuel didnt want to go home his mother had been preparing to go out for the evening when samuel left the house it was the first time that she had dressed up to go out since samuels dad had left and something about the sight of it had made samuel sad he didnt know who she was going to meet but she was putting on lipstick and making herself look nice and she didnt go to that kind of trouble when she was heading out to play bingo with her friends she hadnt questioned why her son was dressed as a ghost and carrying a halloween bucket when it was not yet halloween for she was well used to her son doing things that might be regarded as somewhat odd the previous week samuels teacher mr hume had phoned her at home to have what he described as a serious conversation about samuel samuel it emerged had arrived for show and tell that day carrying only a straight pin when mr hume had called him to the front of the class samuel had proudly held up the pin whats that mr hume had asked its a pin said samuel i can see that samuel but its hardly the most exciting of show and tells now is it i mean its not exactly a rocket ship like the one that bobby made or helens volcano samuel hadnt thought much of bobby goddards rocket ship which looked to him like a series of toilet paper rolls covered in foil or for that matter helens volcano even if it did produce white smoke when water was poured into its crater helens father was a chemist and samuel was pretty sure hed had a hand in creating that volcano helen kim samuel knew couldnt even put together a bowl made of lollipop sticks without detailed instructions and a large supply of solvent remover to get the glue and assorted lollipop sticks off her fingers afterward samuel had stepped forward and held the pin under mr humes nose its not just a pin he said solemnly mr hume looked unconvinced and also slightly nervous at having a pin rather closer to his face than he might have liked there was no telling what some of these kids might do given half a chance er what is it then said mr hume well if you look closely despite his better judgment mr hume found himself leaning forward to examine the pin really closely mr hume squinted someone had once given him a grain of rice with his name written upon it which mr hume had considered interesting but pointless and he wondered if samuel had somehow managed a similar trick you might just be able to see an infinite number of angels dancing on the head of this pin finished samuel ftnref it was st thomas aquinas a most learned man who died in who was supposed to have suggested that an infinite number of angels could dance on the head of a pin in fact he didnt although he spent a lot of time thinking about whether or not angels had bodies he seemed to think that they didnt and how many of them there might be up in heaven quite a lot he concluded the problem with st thomas aquinas was that he liked arguing with himself and its very hard to nail down exactly what he thought about anything at all still the question of how many angels can dance on the head of a pin is probably of interest mainly to philosophers and one presumes dancing angels since the last thing an angel doing the foxtrot wants to worry about is how crowded the pin is getting and the possibility of falling off the edge and doing himself an injury mr hume looked at samuel samuel looked back at him are you trying to be funny asked mr hume this was a question samuel heard quite often usually when he wasnt trying to be funny at all no said samuel i read it somewhere theoretically you can fit an infinite number of angels on the head of a pin that doesnt mean that theyre actually there said mr hume no but they might be said samuel reasonably equally they might not you cant prove that theyre not there though said samuel but you cant prove that they are samuel thought about this for a couple of seconds then said you cant prove a negative proposition what asked mr hume you cant prove that something doesnt exist you can only prove that something does exist did you read that somewhere too mr hume was having trouble keeping the sarcasm from his voice i think so said samuel who like most honest straightforward people had trouble recognizing sarcasm but its true isnt it i suppose so said mr hume he realized that he sounded distinctly sulky so he coughed then said with more force yes i suppose youre right ftnref actually this is not entirely true it may well be the case that one cannot prove the existence of a nineeyed multitentacled pink monster named herbert but that does not mean that somewhere in the universe there is not a nineeyed multitentacled pink monster named herbert wondering why nobody writes to him just because he hasnt been seen doesnt mean that he isnt out there this is known as an inductive argument but the argument is probable not definite if theres actually a pretty good chance he exists theres at least as good a chance that he doesnt exist so you can prove a negative at least as much as you can prove anything at allin addition again according to quantum theory there is a probability that all possible events no matter how strange may occur so there is a probability however small that herbert may exist after allstill its a good argument with which to confuse schoolteachers and parents and on that basis alone samuel is to be applauded samuel continued which means that i have as much chance of proving that there are angels on the head of this pin as you have of proving that there arent are you sure youre only eleven asked mr hume positive said samuel mr hume shook his head wearily thank you for that samuel you can take your pinand your angelsback to your desk now are you certain you dont want to keep it asked samuel yes im certain i have lots more sit down samuel said mr hume who had a way of making a hiss sound like a shout a sign of barely controlled rage that even samuel was able to recognize he went back to his chair and carefully impaled his desk with the pin so that the angels if they were actually there wouldnt fall off anyone else got anything theyd like to share with us asked mr hume an imaginary bunny perhaps an invisible duck named percy everyone laughed bobby goddard kicked the back of samuels seat samuel sighed so that was why mr hume had called samuels mother and afterward she had given samuel a talkingto about taking school seriously and not teasing mr hume who appeared to be she said a little sensitive samuel glanced at his watch his mother would be gone by now which meant that stephanie the babysitter would be waiting for him when he returned stephanie had been fine when she had first started looking after samuel a couple of years before but recently she had become horrible in the way that only certain teenage girls can she had a boyfriend named garth who would sometimes come over to keep her company which meant that samuel would be rushed off to bed well before his bedtime even when garth wasnt around stephanie would spend hours talking on the phone while watching reality tv shows in which people competed to become models singers dancers actors train drivers or anything other than what they really were and she preferred to do so without the benefit of samuels company it was now dark samuel should have been home fifteen minutes ago but the house wasnt the same anymore he missed his dad but he was also angry with him and his mum we should be getting back he told boswell boswell wagged his tail it was getting chilly and boswell didnt like the cold at which point there was a bright blue flash from somewhere behind them accompanied by a smell like a fire in a rottenegg factory boswell nearly fell off the wall in shock saved only by samuels arms right said samuel sensing an opportunity to delay returning home lets go and see what that was in the basement of crowley road a number of cloaked figures were covering their faces with their sleeves and spluttering oh thats disgusting said mrs renfield how horrid the smell really was terrible particularly in such an enclosed space even though mr abernathy had earlier opened the basement window a crack to let some air in now he rushed to open it wider and slowly the stench began to weaken or perhaps it was just that there was now something else to distract the attention of the four people in the basement from it hanging in the air at the very center of the room was a small rotating circle of pale blue light it twinkled then grew in strength and size slowly it became a perfect disk about two feet in diameter from which wisps of smoke were emerging it was mrs abernathy who took the first step forward careful dear said her husband oh do be quiet said mrs abernathy she kept advancing until she was mere inches from the circle i think i can see something she said wait a minute she drew closer theres land there its like a window i can see mud and stones and the bars of some huge gates and now theres something moving outside samuel crouched by the small window looking down on the basement boswell who was a very intelligent dog was hiding by the hedge in fact boswell was under the hedge and had he been a larger dog one capable of restraining an elevenyearold boy for example samuel would have been right there beside him that or both of them would have been well on their way home where there were no nasty smells no flashing blue lights and no hints that something bad had just happened and was likely to get considerably worse boswell also being a melancholic even pessimistic dog by nature the window was only a foot long and opened barely two inches on its metal hinge but the gap was wide enough for samuel to be able to view and hear all that was going on inside he was a little surprised to see the abernathys and two other people wearing what looked like black bathrobes in a cold basement but he had long ago learned not to be too shocked by anything adults did he heard mrs abernathy describe what she was seeing but all that was visible to samuel was the glowing circle itself it seemed to be filled with a white fog as if someone had blown a big dense smoke ring in the abernathys basement samuel was very anxious to discover what else mrs abernathy might have been able to glimpse unfortunately those details were destined to remain unknown apart from the fact that something on the other side had gray scaly skin and three large clawed fingers for that was what reached out from the circle grabbed mrs abernathys head and dragged her through she didnt even have time to scream mrs renfield screamed instead mr abernathy ran toward the glowing circle then seemed to think better of whatever he was planning to do and settled for calling out plaintively his wifes name evelyn he said are you all right there was no response from the hole but he could hear an unpleasant sound from within like someone squishing ripe fruit his wife had been correct though something was visible through the hole it did indeed look like a pair of enormous gates ones that had developed a small hole and were now bubbling with molten metal through it mr abernathy could see a dreadful landscape all ruined trees and black mud shapes moved across it shadowy figures that had no place except in horror stories and nightmares of his wife there was no sign lets get out of here said mr renfield he began bustling his wife toward the stairs then stopped as a movement in the corner of the basement caught his eye eric he said mr abernathy was too concerned with the whereabouts of his wife to pay any attention evelyn he called again are you in there dear eric said mr renfield again this time with more force i think you may want to see this mr abernathy turned and saw what mr renfield and his wife were looking at as soon as he did so he decided that all things considered he might rather not have seen it but by then of course it was too late there was a shape in the corner of the cellar rimmed with blue light it resembled a large mrs abernathyshaped balloon although one that was being filled with water and then jiggled by some unseen force so that it bulged in all the wrong places in addition its skin visible only on its face and hands where they emerged from the now tattered and bloodied cloak was gray and scaly and the fingernails of each hand were yellow and hooked as they watched the transformation was completed a tentacle its surface covered in sharp suckers that moved like mouths coiled around the figures legs for a moment and then was absorbed into the main body the skin became white the nails went from yellow to painted red and something that was almost mrs abernathy stood before them even samuel from where he watched could see that she wasnt the same mrs abernathy had been quite pretty for someone his mums age but now she was more attractive than ever she seemed to radiate beauty as though a light had been turned on inside her body and was glowing through her skin her eyes were very bright and some of that blue energy flickered in their depths like lightning glimpsed in the blackest night she was also samuel realized quite terrifying power he thought shes full of power evelyn said mr abernathy uncertainly the thing that looked like mrs abernathy smiled evelyn is gone she said her voice was deeper than samuel remembered and made him shiver well where is she demanded mr abernathy the woman raised her right hand and pointed her finger at the glowing circle in there on the other side of the portal and what is in there said mr abernathy to his credit he was being rather brave when faced with something that was clearly beyond his experience and indeed beyond this world in there is hell said the woman hell said mrs renfield entering the conversation are you sure it doesnt sound very likely she peered into the hole it looks a bit like that place on the moors where your mother lives reginald mr renfield took a careful look you know youre right it does a bit bring evelyn back said mr abernathy ignoring the renfields your wife is gone i will take her place mr abernathy regarded the thing in the corner what do you want asked mr abernathy who was cleverer than mr and mrs renfield and all the little renfields had they been there put together to open the gates the gates said mr abernathy in puzzlement then the expression on his face changed the gates of hell yes we have four days to prepare the way right said mr renfield were off come along doris he took his wifes arm and together they began ascending the steps from the basement thanks for an um interesting night eric we must do it again sometime mr and mrs renfield got as far as the third step when what looked like twin strands of spiderweb flew from the glowing blue hole wrapped themselves round the waists of the unfortunate pair then plucked them from the steps and dragged them through the portal with a puff of foulsmelling smoke they were gone the portal grew larger for an instant before the blue rim seemed to disappear entirely where is it shouted mr abernathy where has it gone its still there said the woman but its better that it should remain hidden for now mr abernathy reached toward where the circle had been and his hand vanished in midair quickly he pulled it back again then held it up before his face it was coated in a clear sticky fluid i want my wife back he said i want the renfields back he reconsidered actually you can keep the renfields i never liked them anyway i just want evelyn back please mr abernathy might not have been fond of his wife but having her around was easier than being forced to look after himself the woman merely shook her head there were twin flashes of blue behind her and two large hairy things moved in the shadows of the basement from where he crouched samuel glimpsed black eyes glitteringtoo many eyes for two peopleand some bony jointed limbs while samuel watched the shapes gradually assumed the forms of mr and mrs renfield although they seemed to have a bit of trouble finding somewhere to store all their legs i wont help you said mr abernathy you cant make me the woman laughed we dont want your help she said we just want your body with that a long pink tongue slithered from the portal and mr abernathy was yanked from his feet and disappeared into thin air moments later a fat blob green and large eyed assumed his shape and took its place beside what looked to the casual observer like mrs abernathy and the renfields by then samuel had seen enough and he and boswell were running as fast as they could for the safety of home had he waited samuel might have seen the creature that was now mrs abernathy staring in the direction of the small window and at the faint shape of a boy that hung in the still night air where samuel had been hiding v in which we meet nurd who is not quite as terrifying as he would like to be but a great deal unluckier nurd the scourge of five deities sat on his gilded throne his servant wormwood at his feet and his kingdom spread before him and yawned bored your scourgeness inquired wormwood actually said nurd i am extremely excited i cannot remember the last time i felt so enthused about anything really asked wormwood hopefully and received a painful tap on the head from nurds scepter of terrible and awesome might for his trouble no you idiot said nurd of course im bored what else is there to be it was an entirely understandable question for nurd was not in a happy place in fact the place in which nurd happened to be was so far from happy that even if one walked for a very long timecenturies millenniaone still would not even be able to see slightly less unhappy from wherever one ended up nurds kingdom the wasteland consisted of mile upon mile of flat gray stone entirely unbroken by anything very pretty at all apart from the odd rock that was marginally less gray and some pools of viscous bubbling black liquid at the horizon the rock met a slate gray sky across which lightning occasionally flashed without ever bringing the sound of thunder or the feel of rain it wasnt even a kingdom as such nurd the scourge of five deities had simply been banished to it for being as his name had it a scourge although the nature of nurds offenses was open to some doubt ftnref a deity pronounced dayittee is a kind of god there are good deities and bad deities nurd was a bad deity but in general none of them are to be trusted the playwright william shakespeare wrote in king lear that as flies to wanton boys are we to the gods they kill us for their sport nasty lot deities dont say that you havent learned something new by reading this page the title scourge of five deities which nurd had come up with all by himself was technically true nurd had been something of a bother to five different demonic entities but they were relatively minor ones schwell the demon of uncomfortable shoes ick the demon of unpleasant things discovered in plug holes during cleaning graham the demon of stale biscuits and crackers mavis the demon of inappropriate names for men and last and quite possibly least erics the demon of bad punctuation nurd had been less of a scourge to these worthies and more of a minor irritation like a fly buzzing against a window in summer or well like a stale biscuit that one had been quite looking forward to having with a nice cup of tea but thanks to the demon graham turns out to taste soggy and a bit dusty eventually because he wouldnt go away and kept trying to muscle in on their operations the five deities appealed to an aide to the great malevolence himself which was how nurd came to be occupying a notveryinteresting piece of nowhereinparticular with notverymuchtodo but had decided to make the best of it by calling it his kingdom to keep him company his faithful servant wormwood had been expelled along with him an expulsion that wormwood considered more than a bit unfair because he hadnt done anything wrong at all except to be careless in his choice of employer the great malevolence was not entirely without mercy or indeed a sense of humor for he had seen fit to give nurd a slightly used throne upon which to sit and a cushion for wormwood as well as a box in which nurd could keep various bits and pieces that had proved of no use whatsoever during his banishment thus it was that nurd and wormwood had been sitting in the middle of nowhere if not for eternity then since a few minutes past they had never had very much to talk about now they had even less wormwood rubbed his head where a new bump had been added to the already impressive collection that adorned his misshapen skull and not for the first time thought that nurd the scourge of five deities really was a bit of a sod nurd heedless of wormwoods resentment yawned once more and promptly disappeared there wasnt a name for the bundle of blue energy that had managed to escape from the large hadron collider it was part of that percent of matter and energy unknown to science and it wasnt an intended result of the collider experiment at all rather the great explosions in the collider had very briefly opened a portal and on the other side of the portal the great malevolence had been waiting for precisely that moment the little bundle of energy was the equivalent of a piece of wood that has been wedged beneath a door to keep it open now the challenge was to start putting pressure on the door in order to open it wider because the great malevolence was immense what mrs abernathy had glimpsed before she met her unfortunate end were the gates of hell which had been put in place to keep the great malevolence within the boundaries of that awful place the little piece of blue energy had created a small hole in those gates large enough for some of the great malevolences agents to pass through they were scouts and guardians of the portal they also represented the first step in the great malevolences plan to leave his own place of banishment which wasnt much better than that of nurd the scourge of five deities but did at least have a view and a few more chairs unfortunately as soon as anyone or anything starts sending random bursts of energy whizzing through portals between dimensions without being sure of the consequences theres a good chance that some of that energy may end up in places that it shouldnt like the sparks from a welders torch as he works on a piece of metal in an act of grave misfortune one of those sparks had created a small fissure between our world and the space occupied by nurds throne or more particularly nurd himself the great malevolence had managed to wedge open a door just as he had hoped he had also unintentionally managed to open a window nurd the scourge of five deities was free nurd was feeling dizzy and somewhat sick as though he had just climbed off a merrygoround ftnref there was a demon for that feeling too ulp the demon of things that go round for slightly too long with additional responsibility for the smell of cotton candy when youre not feeling yourself and the lingering odor of small children being unwell he wasnt sure what had happened except that it had been most painful but he knew that he was no longer occupying a throne in a dull gray world accompanied only by a small demon who looked like a weasel with mange which meant that this could only be a good thing he felt air on his skin nurd was vaguely human in appearance although his ears were too long and pointed and his head shaped like a quarter moon was too large for his body and bore a distinctly greenish tinge although he was in darkness his eyes were already beginning to make out the shapes of unfamiliar things im somewhere else said nurd although he had never been anywhere other than the wasteland and briefly until hed irritated the great malevolence certain farflung regions of hell itself he understood instinctively where he was he was in the place of people of humans he was a demon of great power let loose among those who next to him were powerless and insignificant he began to channel all his rage and hurt and loneliness creating from them an energy that he could use to rule this new world his skin cracked and glowed red like streams of lava glimpsed beneath the shifting rock of a volcanic eruption the glow moved to his eyes giving them a ferocity they had not had for a long long time steam erupted from his ears and he opened wide his jaws as he prepared to announce his presence on earth to all those who would soon know his wrath i am nurd he cried you will bow down before me light appeared it was disturbingly regular forming a huge rectangle the outline of a door larger than nurd had ever seen even in the depths of hell itself then the door opened flooding nurds new world with illumination a giant being towered above him a colossus in a pink skirt and white blouse it had something in its hands a squat eyeless creature with a long nose and square jaws oh for cry began nurd all he got to say before mrs johnsons vacuum cleaner dropped on him and everything went dark again back in the wasteland wormwood was still trying to work out what precisely had happened to his unloved master he poked the space on the throne that nurd usually occupied wondering if nurd had been hiding the art of invisibility for all this time and had only now decided to use it in order to break the monotony but there was nothing there nurd it appeared was gone and if nurd was gone then he wormwood was now ruler of all he surveyed wormwood picked up the scepter of terrible and awesome might from the foot of the throne with his other hand he grasped the crown of misdeeds which had fallen from nurds head as he slipped out of existence he stared at them both then faced the wasteland and raised the scepter and the crown above his head i am wormwood he cried i am there was a sound behind him as though a nurdshaped object were being forced through a decidedly small hole and wasnt feeling terribly happy about the process very happy to see you again master concluded wormwood as he turned and saw nurd seated once again on his throne and looking like an enormous thing of some kind had fallen on him he seemed bewildered and somewhat broken in places wormwood said nurd i feel ill and he sneezed a single dusty sneeze vi in which we encounter stephanie who is not a demon but is still not terribly nice the front door opened while samuel was fumbling for his key he had only recently been entrusted with his own house key and he was so terrified of losing it that he kept it around his neck on a piece of string unfortunately it was proving rather difficult to find it while dressed as a ghost and holding on to a small worried dog so he was still searching beneath various layers of sheet sweater and shirt when stephanie the babysitter appeared in his line of sight where have you been she said you should have been back half an hour ago the expression on her face changed and why are you dressed like a ghost samuel shuffled past her but didnt answer immediately first of all he set boswell free of his leash and divested himself of his sheet i thought id get an early start for halloween he said gasping but that doesnt matter now ive seen something forget it said stephanie but not interested its important go to bed what samuel was momentarily distracted from what he had witnessed in the abernathys basement by the injustice of this magnitude its half term i dont have to go to school tomorrow mum said mum said mum said mimicked stephanie well your mum isnt here now im in charge and i say that you have to go to bed but the abernathys their basement monsters gates you dont understand stephanie leaned in very close to samuels face and samuel recognized that there were things even more terrifying than what he had seen at the abernathys house if only because they were very close and their anger was directed entirely at him stephanies face was going red her nostrils were flaring and her eyes had grown narrow like the slits in a castle wall before someone begins firing flaming arrows out of them she spoke very precisely through gritted teeth go to bed the final word was delivered at such earsplittingly high volume that samuel felt certain his glasses were about to crack even boswell who was used to stephanie by now looked disturbed with no other option samuel stomped up the stairs to bed closely followed by boswell he was about to slam his door behind him when he heard stephanie shout and dont you dare slam that door although sorely tempted to disobey samuel decided to err on the side of discretion there was not a great deal that stephanie could do to him although he sometimes wondered what she might have done if she thought that she could get away with it like burying him in the back garden after drowning him in the bathtub ftnref it is a curious fact that small boys are more terrified of their babysitters than small girls are in part this is because small girls and babysitters who are usually slightly larger girls belong to the same species and therefore understand each other small boys on the other hand do not understand girls and therefore being looked after by one is a little like a hamster being looked after by a shark if you are a small boy it may be some consolation to you to know that even large boys do not understand girls and girls by and large do not understand boys this makes adult life very interesting still stephanie was a tattletale and when samuel had crossed her in the past he had found himself dealing with his mother the following morning unlike stephanie there were many things his mum could do to make his life uncomfortable such as denying him television or his allowance or as on one particularly grim occasion after he had dropped a plastic snake down stephanies back both of the above how was he to know that stephanie was afraid of snakes he had argued even though he had been fully aware of how much she disliked them and that had been half the fun he still treasured the memory of her leaping from the couch in shock and the strange noise that had come from deep within her a sound that was barely human as if someone were playing a violin inside her very very badly in fact he could trace the serious deterioration of his relationship with stephanie to that particular occasion not only had his mother punished him but the odious garth had threatened to stick his head down the toilet and flush him to china if he ever pulled a stunt like that again samuel having no great desire to be flushed to china had not pulled a stunt like that again ftnref it is not possible to flush someone to china or australia well not unless theyre already there it is not a good idea though to point this out to someone who is threatening to flush you to china or australia as there is a good chance that they will try it anyway just to prove you wrong samuel changed into his pajamas brushed his teeth and got into bed boswell curled up in his basket at the foot of the bed usually samuel would read before turning off the light and going to sleep but not tonight he was determined to stay up until his mother returned home and then he would confront her with what he had learned samuel managed to stay awake for two and a half hours before sleep eventually took him he thought of all that he had seen and heard in the abernathys basement he wondered if he should go to the police but he was not an unintelligent boy and he knew that the police would take a dim view of an elevenyearold with a dachshund who claimed that his neighbors had been transformed into demons intent upon opening the gates of hell so it was that samuel did not hear his mother come in nor did he hear stephanie leave after first informing samuels mother that samuel had broken curfew nor did he see after the lights were turned off and his mother was like him asleep in bed the figure of a woman standing at the garden gate staring intently at his bedroom window her eyes burning with a cold blue fire vii in which the scientists wonder what the bit was and where it might have gone while samuel slept a group of scientists huddled over a series of screens and printouts behind them an uncompleted game of battleships lay forgotten but theres no record of anything unusual occurring said one his name was professor hilbert and he had become a scientist for two reasons the first was that he had always been fascinated by science particularly physics which is science for people who like numbers more thanwell more than people probably the other reason professor hilbert had become a scientist was that he had always looked like a scientist even as a small boy he had worn glasses been unable to comb his hair properly and had a fondness for storing pens in his shirt pockets he was also very interested in taking things apart to find out how they worked although he had never discovered how to put any of them back together again in quite the same way instead he was always trying to find some means to improve them even if they had worked perfectly well to begin with thus it was that when he improved his parents toaster the toaster had incinerated the bread and then burst into flames so hot they had melted the kitchen counter the kitchen had always smelled funny after that and he was required to eat his bread untoasted unless supervised after he spent an hour with their radio it had begun picking up signals from passing military aircraft leading to a visit from a couple of stern men in uniforms who were under the impression that the hilberts were russian spies finally young hilbert was sent to a special school for very bright people where to his hearts content he was allowed to take things apart and put them together again in odd combinations he had started only one or two fires at the special school but they were small and easily extinguished now professor hilbert was trying to make sense of what ed and victor were telling him the collider had been shut down as a precaution which annoyed professor hilbert greatly turning the collider on and off wasnt like flipping a light switch it was a complicated and expensive business furthermore it generated bad publicity for everyone involved in the experiment especially as there were still people who were convinced that the collider would be responsible for the end of the world you say that a particle of some kind separated itself from the beams in the collider thats right said ed then passed through the walls of the collider itself and the solid rock around it before disappearing right again said ed then the system began rewriting itself to eliminate any evidence of this occurrence yes fascinating said professor hilbert what was strange about this conversation was that at no point did professor hilbert doubt the truth of what ed and victor were telling him nothing about the large hadron collider and what it was revealing about the nature of the universe was surprising to professor hilbert delightful yes troubling sometimes but never surprising he was not a man who was easily surprised and he suspected that the universe was a much stranger place than anyone imagined which made him anxious to prove just how extraordinary it really was what do you think it might be asked ed evidence said professor hilbert of what i dont know said professor hilbert and rambled off sucking his pencil hours later professor hilbert was still at his desk surrounded by pieces of paper on which he had constructed diagrams created complex equations and drawn little stick men fighting one another with swords he had also gone over the system records for the past few hours and had discovered something curious the system had overwritten itself as ed and victor had suggested but it had not done so perfectly like someone rubbing out a couple of lines written in pencil the shadow of what had been there before still remained slowly professor hilbert had begun reconstructing it while he was not able to recreate it completely he found that at the precise moment ed and victor had witnessed what was now being termed the event a batch of strange code had found its way into the system it was this code that professor hilbert was now attempting to reconstruct the problem was that the code was not in any known computer language in fact it didnt appear to be in any recognizable language at all professor hilberts particular area of interest was dimensions specifically he was fascinated by the possibility that there might be a great many universes out there of which ours was only one he was part of a group of scientists who believed that our universe might exist in an ocean of other universes some being born some already in existence and others about to come to an end instead of a universe he believed in the possibility of a multiverse his lifes work had been devoted to this belief which he hoped the collider might help him to prove if a mini black hole one that did not swallow up the earth say times the mass of an electron and existing for only seconds were created in the collider professor hilbert believed that it would provide evidence for the existence of parallel universes now as he sat at his desk he looked at the strange code written in symbols that seemed at once modern yet very very old and wondered is this the proof that i have been seeking is this a message from another universe another dimension and if it is then what does it mean some of you may know who albert einstein was for those who dont here is a picture of him einstein was a very famous scientist the kind of scientist even people who know nothing about science can probably name he is most famous for his general theory of relativity which concluded that mass is a form of energy and goes e mc or energy mass by the speed of light squared but he also had a sense of humor he once said that we were all ignorant but each of us was ignorant in a different way which is very wise when you think about it ftnref as you can see from his picture einstein didnt take himself too seriously at least not all of the time in general its a good idea to avoid people who take themselves too seriously as individuals we have only so much seriousness to go round and people who take themselves very seriously dont have enough seriousness left over to take other people seriously instead they tend to look down on them and are secretly pleased when they get stuff wrong because they just prove to the tooserious types that they were right not to take them seriously to begin with it was einstein who predicted the existence of black holes there is one at the heart of our milky way but its obscured by dust clouds otherwise it would be visible every night as a fireball in the constellation of sagittarius but einsteins black holes came with their own inbuilt problem they had at their center a singularity theres that word again remember footnote a point at which time came to an end and all known rules of physics broke down you cant make a rule that breaks all the rules science just doesnt work that way einstein wasnt happy about this at all he liked things to work according to the rules in fact the whole point of his lifes work was to prove that there were rules governing the known universe and he couldnt very well leave things like singularities hanging about making the place look untidy so like any good scientist einstein went back over his work and tried to find a way to prove the singularities didnt exist or if they did that they played by the rules so after a bit of fiddling with his sums he came to the conclusion that the singularities might in fact be bridges between two different universes this solved the problem of the singularities as far as einstein was concerned but nobody really believed that this bridge known as an einsteinrosen bridge could actually be used to travel between the universes mainly because if it existed at all it would be very unstable like building a bridge made from chewing gum and bits of chocolate over a very long drop then suggesting that someone in a big truck might like to give it a try the bridge would also be very small meters or so small that it would hardly be there at alland it would exist for only an instant so driving a truck across it a space truck obviously would be both difficult and frankly fatal mathematicians have also suggested the possibility of what are known as multiplyconnected spaces or wormholes literally tunnels between universesthat exist at the center of black holes ftnref in alice through the looking glass the book by lewis carroll the looking glass is in effect a wormhole carroll whose real name was charles dodgson was a mathematician and was aware of the theory of wormholes he liked injecting puzzles into his math classes one of his most famous goes as follows a cup contains spoonfuls of brandy and another contains spoonfuls of water a spoonful of brandy is taken from the first cup and added to the second cup then a spoonful of that mixture is taken from the second cup and mixed into the first is there more or less brandy in the second cup than there is water in the first cup if youd like to know the answerand i warn you it will make your head ache more than drinking all of the brandy wouldits at the end of this chapter fileposokay back to lewis carrolls brandy and water problem mathematically speaking the answer is that there will be just as much brandy in the water as there is water in the brandy so both mixtures will be the same butand this is where your head may start to achewhen equal quantities of water and alcohol are mixed the sum of them is more compact than their parts because the brandy penetrates the spaces between the water molecules and the water penetrates the spaces between the brandy molecules a bit like the way two matching pieces of a jigsaw puzzle fit together so that they occupy less space than if you just laid the same pieces side by side in other words the mixture becomes more concentrated so if you add spoonfuls of water and spoonfuls of brandy you actually end up with about spoonfuls of the mixture in total adding a spoonful of brandy to spoonfuls of water will give you less than spoonfuls of the mixture because like we said earlier its more concentrated if you take a spoonful from that mixture it will leave less than spoonfuls in the cup then if you add that spoonful from the concentrated mixture to the cup of brandy it means that theres more brandy in the brandy cup than there is more water in the water cup i warned you in a new zealand mathematician named roy kerr suggested that a spinning black hole would collapse into a stable ring of neutrons because the centrifugal force pushing out would cancel the inward force of gravity the black hole wouldnt fall in on itself and you wouldnt be crushed to death but it would be a oneway trip as the gravity would be sufficient to prevent you from returning the way you had come nevertheless the whole debate was another stage in the great discussion about wormholes and black holes and parallel universes places where the rules of physics might not be quite the same as ours but might work perfectly well in that universe now professor hilbert was wondering if something in a universe other than our own might have found a way of breaking through using a hole or a bridge as yet unthought of in our science and tried to make contact if that was the case then if the bridge still existed there would be an opening in its world and another opening in ours the questions that followed from this were where was that opening and what exactly was going to emerge from it back in the basement of crowley road four figures stood staring at where there had been until recently a spinning circle of blue mrs abernathy had returned from her visit to samuel johnsons house to find her three companions in a state of some distress the portal has closed said mr renfield who no longer looked or sounded quite like the mr renfield of old his voice emerged from his throat in a series of hoarse clicks and his skin had already taken on the wrinkled unhealthy appearance of a rotting apple the change in his appearance had begun almost as soon as the blue light had disappeared and a similar decay could be seen in mrs renfield and mr abernathy only mrs abernathy remained unaffected they have shut down the collider said mrs abernathy but there was a strange expression on her face as she spoke which she hid from the renfields as the great one predicted that they would but now we know that travel between this world and ours is possible even now our master is assembling his great army and when he is ready the portal will open once again and he will cross over and claim this place as his own but we grow weak said mrs renfield her breath smelled bad as if something inside her was festering you grow weak said mrs abernathy you are here only to serve my needs your energy will fuel me and when the portal opens once more you will be renewed this was not entirely true mrs abernathy was a more extraordinary demon than her three companions older and wiser and more powerful than ever they could have imagined the portal had not closed not entirely mrs abernathys great will and strength were keeping it open just a crack nevertheless she was content to suck energy from the others as required and to use the portal only when necessary she would be the one to explore this new world in advance of her masters coming and it was important that she blend in without attracting attention after so long in the darkness she wanted to experience something of the earth before it was turned to ash and fire viii in which samuel learns that someone trying to open the gates of hell is not of particular concern to his mum samuel awoke shortly after eight to the sound of plates banging in the kitchen he dressed quickly then went downstairs boswell was waiting expectantly for scraps from the breakfast table he glanced at samuel wagged his tail in greeting then went back to gazing intently at mrs johnson and the remains of the bacon on her plate mum samuel began but he was immediately cut off stephanie says that you came in late last night said his mother i know and im sorry but no buts you know i dont like you being out late by yourself but what did i just say no buts now sit down and eat your cereal samuel wondered if he would ever be allowed to complete a sentence again first stephanie and now his mother if this continued hed be forced to communicate entirely through sign language or notes scribbled on pieces of paper like someone in solitary confinement mum said samuel in his most serious and grownup of tones i have something important to tell you uhhuh his mother stood and carried her plate to the sink disappointing boswell considerably mother please samuel almost never called his mum mother it always sounded wrong but it had the effect on this occasion of attracting her attention she turned round and folded her arms well samuel gestured at the kitchen chair opposite him the way he saw grownups on television do when they invited people into their office to tell them they were about to be fired please take a seat mrs johnson gave a longsuffering sigh but did as she was asked its about the abernathys said samuel the abernathys the people at number yes and their friends what friends well i dont know their friends names but they were a man and a woman and they were both fat and they are no more said samuel solemnly he had read that phrase somewhere and had always fancied using it what does that mean theyve been taken taken where to hell oh samuel his mother rose and returned to the sink you had me worried there for a minute i thought you were being serious where do you get these ideas from i really will have to keep a closer eye on what youre watching on television but its true mum said samuel they were all in the abernathys basement dressed in robes and then there was a blue light and a hole in the air and a big claw reached out and pulled mrs abernathy inside and then she appeared again except it wasnt her but something that looked like her then spiderwebs took their fat friends and finally mr abernathy was yanked in by a big tongue and when it was all over there were four of them again but it wasnt them not really and he finished playing his trump card theyre trying to open the gates of hell i heard mrs abernathy say so or the thing that looks like mrs abernathy he took a deep breath and waited for a response and thats why you were half an hour late coming back last night asked his mother yes you know that youre not supposed to be out past eight especially now that the evenings are getting dark mum theyre trying to open the gates of hell you know hell demons and stuff monsters he paused for effect then added the devil and you didnt eat your dinner said his mum what samuel was floored he knew that his mother tended to ignore a lot of what he said but he had never lied to her well hardly ever there were some things she didnt need to know such as where her private stash of chocolate kept disappearing to or how the rug in the living room had been moved slightly to cover some nasty burn marks after an experiment involving match heads dont say what say pardon his mother corrected i said you didnt eat your dinner thats because stephanie sent me to bed early but thats not the point excuse me samuel johnson but thats precisely the point you came in so late that you couldnt eat your dinner there was spinach i know you dont like it a lot but its very healthy and you annoyed stephanie and its hard to get good babysitters these days samuel was by now completely bewildered his mother could be very strange according to her this was how the world worked things that are bad coming in late not eating spinach annoying stephanie trying to confuse mr hume with talk of angels and pins not wearing the hat his grandmother had knit for him even if it was purple and made him look like he had a swollen head lots of other stuff trying to open the gates of hell mum havent you heard anything ive said asked samuel ive heard everything that youve said samuel and its more than enough now eat your breakfast i have a lot to do today if you want to you can help me with the shopping later otherwise you can just stay here but no television and no video games i want you to read a book or do something useful with your time its all those cartoons and monsterkilling games that have given you these ideas honestly dear you live in a world of your own sometimes and then she did something completely unexpected having spent the last five minutes complaining about him and not believing anything that hed told her she came over and hugged him and kissed his hair you do make me laugh though she said she looked into his eyes and her face grew sad samuel all this stuffthese stories the angels on the pinits not to do with your dad is it i know you miss him and things have been a bit difficult since he left you know i love you dont you you dont need to go looking for attention from me im here and youre the most important person in my world you will remember that wont you samuel nodded his eyes felt hot they always did when his mum talked about his dad hed been gone for two months and three days now samuel wished that hed come back but at the same time he was angry with him he wasnt sure what had happened between his mum and dad but his dad was now living up north and samuel had only seen him twice since the breakup from a whispered but angry phone conversation that hed overheard between his mum and dad someone called elaine was involved samuels mum had called elaine a very bad name during the conversation and then had hung up the phone and started crying samuel was sometimes angry at his mum too because he wondered if she might have done something to drive his dad away and on occasion when he was feeling particularly sad samuel would wonder if he himself had done anything to make his dad leave if hed been bad or mean to him or had let his dad down in some way for the most part though he sensed that his dad was the one who was most to blame and he hated the fact that his dad made his mum cry now eat your bacon said samuels mum ive left it under the grill for you she kissed him on the head again then went upstairs samuel ate his bacon sometimes he just didnt understand adults he wondered if he ever would or if there would come a time after he became a grownup himself when it all made sense to him he finished his food fed the scraps to boswell then washed his plate and sat down at the table again he patted boswell thoughtfully there was still the notsosmall matter of the opening of the gates of hell to be dealt with and his mum had been no help at all with that now what are we supposed to do asked samuel if boswell could have shrugged he would have the doorbell rang at number it was mrs abernathy who answered standing before her was the postman holding a large parcel he wasnt the usual postman who was on holiday in spain and he had never seen mrs abernathy before but he thought she was very good looking parcel for mr abernathy he said that would be mymrs abernathy unused to talking to someone who wasnt another demon had to think for a momenthusband she finished hes not here at the moment no problem you can sign for it he handed mrs abernathy a pen and a form on a clipboard mrs abernathy looked confused just sign er there said the postman pointing to a line at the bottom of the form i dont seem to have my glasses said mrs abernathy would you mind stepping inside for a moment while i look for them its just a signature said the postman on a line that line once again he pointed helpfully at the line in question i dont like signing anything that i havent read said mrs abernathy it takes all sorts thought the postman right you are then maam ill wait here while you look for your glasses oh please come inside i insist its so cold out and it may take me a moment or two to find them she moved farther into the house still holding the clipboard the clipboard was very important to the postman it contained details of all of the parcels and registered letters that he had delivered that day and he wasnt supposed to let it out of his sight reluctantly he followed mrs abernathy into the house he noticed that the blinds and curtains were drawn in the rooms adjoining the hall and there was a funny smell like rotten eggs and recently struck matches bit dark in here he said really said mrs abernathy i happen to like it this way and the postman noticed for the first time that there seemed to be a blue glow to mrs abernathys eyes the door closed behind him but mrs abernathy was in front of him so who could have closed it he was turning to find out when a tentacle curled itself round his neck and lifted him off the floor the postman tried to say something but the tentacle was very tight he had a brief glimpse of a huge mouth and some big teeth and then everything went dark forever humans were puny thought mrs abernathy she had been sent to find out their strengths and weaknesses but already she could tell that the latter far outweighed the former on the other hand they didnt taste bad at all mrs abernathy licked her lips and went into the dining room where the curtains were drawn three figures sat upon chairs doing nothing in particular apart from smelling funny mr abernathy and the renfields were starting to turn an ugly shade of purple like meat that was going bad and their fingernails had begun to drop off that was the trouble with destroying the life force of another being and taking on its shape it was like opening a banana throwing away the fruit and then sewing up the skin in the hope that it would continue to look like a banana it would but only for a while and then it would start turning black im concerned about the boy said mrs abernathy her husband looked at her his eyes were milky why he asked his voice little more than a croak as his vocal cords began to decay hes just a child he will talk nobody will believe him somebody might and if they do we are more powerful than they can ever be mrs abernathy snorted in disgust have you looked in a mirror lately she said the only powerful thing about you is your smell she shook her head and walked away that was the problem with lower demons they had no cunning and no imagination mrs abernathy was of the highest order of demons only a level below the great malevolence himself she had knowledge of humans for the great malevolence had spoken of them to her and with him she had watched them from afar as if through a dark window what he saw fed his hatred and jealousy he rejoiced when men and women did bad things and howled with rage when they did good he wanted to reduce their world to rubble and scarred earth and destroy every living thing in it that walked crawled swam or flew it was mrs abernathy who would pave the way for him the great malevolence and the humans machine with its beams and particles would do the rest but there remained the problem of the boy children were dangerous mrs abernathy knew more so than adults they believed in things like right and wrong good and evil they were persistent they interfered first she would find out what samuel johnson knew if he had been a naughty little boy one who had been sticking his nose in where he had no business sticking it he would have to be dealt with ix in which we learn a little about the gates of hell none of which is entirely helpful after his mother left to do her shopping samuel spent some time at the kitchen table his chin cupped in his hands considering his options he knew that mrs abernathy or the entity that now occupied her body was up to no good but he was facing a problem encountered by young people the world over how to convince adults that you were telling the truth about something in which they just did not want to believe his mother had told him not to play computer games but that didnt mean he couldnt use his computer at all with boswell at his heels samuel went up to his bedroom sat at his desk and began to search the internet he decided to start with what he knew for certain so he typed gates of hell into the search engine the first reference that came up was to a huge bronze sculpture entitled la porte de lenfer which in english means the gate of hell by an artist named auguste rodin apparently rodin was asked to create the sculpture in and promised to deliver it by instead rodin had still been working on it when he died in samuel did a small calculation and discovered that rodin had been thirtytwo years late in delivering the sculpture he wondered if rodin might have been related to mr armitage their local painter who had been supposed to paint their living room and dining room over a single weekend and had in fact taken six months to do it and even then had left one wall and part of the ceiling unfinished samuels father and mr armitage had had a big argument about it when they met in the street its not the ceiling of the sistine chapel mr armitage had said ill get round to it when i can youll want me flat on my back painting angels next ftnref the artist michelangelo painted the ceiling of the sistine chapel in rome between and he had to use scaffolding to do it but because the ceiling was so high he couldnt build the scaffolding from the floor up so instead he made a special flat wooden platform that hung from bolts beside the windows painting the ceiling was a very uncomfortable business as you can probably imagine but its a myth that michelangelo had to lie flat on his back to do it instead he stood upright with his head bent back for four years by the end of it he was so sore that he wrote a poem about the experienceive grown a goiter by dwelling in this denas cats from stagnant streams in lombardyor in what other land they hap to bewhich drives the belly close beneath the chinmy beard turns up to heaven my nape falls infixed on my spine my breastbone visiblygrows like a harp a rich embroiderybedews my face from brush drips thick and thinand so it goes on for a few more verses which can be summarized basically as owww samuels father had suggested that if mr armitage had been asked to paint the ceiling of the sistine chapel he would have taken twenty years instead of four and still would have left god without a beard at that point mr armitage had said a rude word and walked away and samuels father had ended up finishing the ceiling and wall himself badly anyway while rodins gates looked very impressive they didnt seem to have a blue light around them and samuel read that they had been inspired by a writer named dante and his book the divine comedy samuel suspected that neither dante nor rodin had ever really seen the gates of hell and had just taken a guess ftnref the divine comedy is not funny but its not supposed to be despite its name in dantes time a comedy meant a work that reflected a belief in an ordered universe also serious books were written in latin and dante wrote in a new language italian some of shakespeares comedies are funny though but not if youre being forced to study them in school in school everything shakespeare wrote starts to seem like a tragedy even the ones that arent tragedies which is a bit unfortunate but thats just because of the way theyre taught stick with them in later life people will be impressed that you can quote shakespeare and you will sound very intelligent its harder to quote trigonometry or quadratic equations and not half as romantic after that samuel found some dodgy heavymetal groups who either had songs named after the gates of hell or simply liked putting images of demons on their album covers in order to make themselves seem more terrifying than they really were since most of them were just hairy chaps from nice families who had spent too much time alone in their bedrooms as teenagers samuel did discover that the romans and greeks believed the gates were guarded by a threeheaded dog called cerberus who made sure that nobody who entered could ever leave but they also believed a boatman took dead people across the river styx and samuel had seen no sign of a river in the abernathys basement he tried doors of hell but didnt have any more luck finally he just typed in hell and came up with lots of stuff some religions thought that hell was hot and fiery and others thought it was cold and gloomy samuel didnt think any of them could know for certain since by the time someone found out the truth he would be dead and the information would probably be too late to be useful what he did find interesting was that most of the worlds religions believed in hell even if they didnt always call it that and lots of them had names for whatever they felt ruled over it satan yanluo wang yamaraj the one thing on which everyone seemed to agree was that hell wasnt a very pleasant place and was not somewhere that you wanted to end up after an hour samuel stopped searching he was frustrated he wanted answers he wanted to know what to do next he wanted to stop mrs abernathy before she opened the gates samuels mother was trying to work out if two small cans of baked beans were better value than one big can when a figure appeared beside her it was mrs abernathy hello mrs johnson said mrs abernathy how lovely to see you mrs johnson didnt know why exactly it was lovely for mrs abernathy to see her she and mrs abernathy barely knew each other and had never exchanged more than a polite hello in the past ftnref adults say lots of things that they dont quite mean usually just to be polite which is no bad thing they also say things that are exactly the opposite of what they appear to mean such as to be perfectly honest which means i am lying through my teeth i hear what youre saying which means i hear it but im not really listening and i dont agree with you anywayand i dont mean to be rude which means i mean to be rudethere are some people who use phrases like this more often than anyone else and who become very good at using them to avoid answering questions or telling the entire truth these people are known as politicians well its lovely to see you too mrs johnson lied something about mrs abernathy was making her uneasy in fact now that she thought about it there were lots of things not quite right about the woman standing next to her she was wearing a lovely black velvet overcoat which was far too nice to wear for shopping unless you were shopping for an even lovelier black overcoat and wanted to impress the salesperson her skin although very pale paler than mrs johnson remembered from their previous brief meetings had a bluish tinge to it and the veins beneath her skin were more obvious than before her eyes too were very blue they seemed to burn with a faint flame like a gas fire mrs abernathy was wearing lots of strong perfume but she still smelled a little funny and not in a hoho way as mrs johnson looked at mrs abernathy and inhaled her perfume she felt herself becoming sleepy those eyes drew her in and the fire within them grew more intense how is your delightful son mrs abernathy asked samuel isnt it yes said mrs johnson who couldnt remember anyone calling samuel delightful before samuel i was wondering if he ever mentioned me to you mrs johnson heard the words emerge from her mouth before she was even aware that she was thinking them why yes she said he was talking about you only this morning mrs abernathy smiled but the smile died somewhere around her nostrils and what did he say he seemed to think yes that you were trying go on to open by now mrs abernathy was leaning in very close to mrs johnson mrs abernathys breath stank and her teeth were yellow her lipstick was bright red and slightly smeared in fact thought mrs johnson it looked a little like blood mrs abernathys tongue flicked out and for just a moment mrs johnson could have sworn that it was forked like a snakes tongue gates what gates said mrs abernathy what gates her hand reached for mrs johnson gripping her shoulder her nails dug into mrs johnsons arm causing her to wince the pain was enough to bring mrs johnson out of her daze she took a step back and blinked when she opened her eyes mrs abernathy was standing farther away from her a strange troubled look on her face try as she might mrs johnson couldnt remember what it was they had been talking about something about samuel she thought but what are you all right mrs johnson asked mrs abernathy you look a little unwell no im fine said mrs johnson although she didnt feel fine she could still smell mrs abernathys perfume and worse whatever it was the perfume was being used to disguise she wanted mrs abernathy to go away in fact she felt that it was very important for her to stay as far from mrs abernathy as possible well take care said mrs abernathy it was nice talking to you we should do it more often yes said mrs johnson meaning no no no no no no when she arrived home samuel was sitting at the kitchen table drawing on a sheet of paper using crayons he hid it away when she entered but she glimpsed a blue circle samuel looked at her with concern are you okay mum yes dear why you look sick mrs johnson glanced in the mirror by the sink yes she said i suppose i do she turned to samuel i met she began to say then stopped she couldnt remember who she had met a woman yes a woman but the name wouldnt come to her then she wasnt certain that it had been a woman at all and seconds later she wasnt sure shed met anyone it was as though her brain were a big house and someone was turning off the lights in every room one by one met who mum asked samuel i dont know said mrs johnson i think im going to lie down for a while mrs johnson was beginning to wonder if she might not be coming down with something the day before she could have sworn that shed heard a voice coming from the cupboard beneath the stairs just as she was putting away the vacuum cleaner on the way out to meet her friends she left the kitchen and samuel heard her go upstairs when he went to check on her minutes later his mother was already asleep her lips were moving and samuel thought she might have been having bad dreams he wondered if he should call one of her friends maybe auntie betty from up the road then decided that he would just keep a close eye on his mother he would let her sleep for now samuel went back downstairs and finished his drawing he worked very slowly and carefully trying to capture exactly what he had seen in the abernathys basement it was the third such drawing he had done he had thrown the first two away because they werent quite accurate but this one was better it was nearly right or as close to it as he was going to get from a distance it looked more like a photograph than a drawing for if there was one thing that samuel was good at it was art when he was done he hid it carefully in his big atlas he would show it to someone he just had to decide who that someone should be mrs johnson didnt get up until later that evening samuel stayed downstairs and watched television reckoning that his mum wouldnt mind despite what she had said earlier after a time he got bored and did something else that he wasnt supposed to do he went out to the garage at the back of the house to sit in his dads car the aston martin db coupe was his dads pride and joy and samuel had been for only a handful of trips in it before his dad left and even then his dad had seemed to resent samuels presence slightly like a child forced to allow another child to play with his favorite toy because his dad was living in an apartment in the north with no garage he had decided to leave the car in biddlecombe for now in a way samuel was pleased because he believed that meant his dad might return home at some point if he took the car away permanently though there would be nothing of him left it would be a sign thought samuel a sign that the marriage was over and it was now just samuel and his mum when mrs johnson rose they ordered in pizza but his mum couldnt finish hers and went back to bed every time she tried to recall what had happened at the supermarket her head began to hurt and intermingled smells came to her perfume and something rotten and bad that the scent would be able to hide for only so long that night mrs johnson had bad dreams but they were only dreams samuel johnsons nightmares on the other hand came alive x in which we learn of the difficulties involved in being a demon without a clearly defined form samuel woke to find there was a monster under his bed he didnt just think there was a monster under there the way very small boys and girls sometimes do samuel was no longer a very small boy and had accustomed himself to believe that in all probability monsters did not inhabit the spaces under beds they particularly did not occupy the space under samuels bed because there wasnt any every spare inch being taken up by games shoes candy wrappers unfinished model aircraft and a large box of toy soldiers with which samuel no longer played but which he was most reluctant to get rid of just in case now all those objects were scattered across his bedroom floor and a sound was coming from beneath his bed that resembled pieces of jelly being tossed from hand to hand by a troupe of tiny jugglers in addition boswell was standing on the bed trembling and growling samuel felt a sneeze coming on he tried every trick he knew to stop it he held his nose he took deep breaths he pressed the tip of his tongue against the top row of his teeth the way that japanese samurai used to do when they didnt want to reveal their presence to an enemy all to no avail samuel sneezed it sounded like a rocket taking off instantly all noise and movement from below his bed ceased samuel held his breath and listened he had the uncomfortable sense that a very squishy creature was also holding its breath if it had any to hold even if it didnt it was definitely listening maybe i imagined it thought samuel even though he knew that he hadnt you didnt imagine something squishing under your bed either it squished or it didnt and something had definitely squished he looked around and saw one of his socks lying at the end of his bed as an experiment he leaned down to pick up the sock then dangled it over the edge of the mattress before dropping it on the floor a long pink thing that might have been a tongue or an arm or even a leg grabbed the sock and pulled it under the bed samuel heard chewing and then the sock was spat out and a voice said ewwwww hello said samuel there was no reply i know youre under there still no reply look this is silly said samuel im not getting off this bed you can stay there for as long as you like its just not going to happen he counted to five in his head before he heard a sigh from beneath the mattress how did you know said a voice i heard you squish oh im new at this still getting the hang of it you tricked me with that sock thing very clever that tasted horrible you need to get something done about your feet by the way they must stink something awful its a gym sock i think its been there for a while well i suppose that explains it but still you could knock someone dead with a sock like that lethal weapon that sock its made me feel quite ill serves you right said samuel you shouldnt be hanging around under peoples beds well its a job innit not much of a job agreed but you try being a demon of no set form in this day and age its not like im going to get work looking after puppies or singing babies to sleep frankly its this or nothing what do you mean no set form the demon cleared its throat technically im a freeroaming ectoplasmic entity which is asked samuel a little impatiently which is said the demon huffily if youll wait for me to finish a demon capable of assuming almost any shape or form based on psychic vibrations given off by its victim youve lost me said samuel oh look its not that complicated im supposed to become whatever scares you i just picked the whole slushy tentacled thing because well its a classic isnt it is it asked samuel so youre a bit like an octopus then a bit i suppose admitted the demon i quite like octopi octopodes corrected the demon dont they teach you anything at school theres no need to be rude said samuel im a demon what do you expect me to be pleasant tuck you in and read you a story youre not very bright are you no youre not very bright turning up here in the dead of night and being caught out by an old sock and you havent assumed a form that scares me youre an octopus im like an octopus said the demon but scarier i think its hard to see under here whatever said samuel if its all about psychic vibrations then why didnt you take the form of something else the demon muttered something i beg your pardon said samuel i didnt quite catch that i said i cant do psychic vibrations the demon sounded embarrassed why not theyre hard thats why not you try it see how much luck you have so you just take a form and hope that it will be scary that all sounds a bit casual to be honest look its my first time said the demon are you happy now its my first time and i have to say that youre being very hurtful youre not making this easy you know im not supposed to make it easy said samuel what would be the point in that just saying thats all said the demon samuel heard it sniff dismissively okay said samuel im not very keen on spiders really said the demon yes youre not just saying no i really dont like them very much at all why dont you start with that and see how you get along oh i will thanks very much very nice of you give me a minute will you take your time right you are much appreciated dont go anywhere now wouldnt dream of it said samuel he sat on the bed humming to himself and patting boswell from under the mattress came various squelching sounds and the occasional grunt of effort finally there was silence er a question said the demon yes do spiders have ears ears you know huge big flappy things no they feel vibrations with the hairs on their legs all right all right i didnt ask for a lecture it was just a simple question there was silence again what are the things with big flappy ears then said the demon samuel thought about the question elephants he suggested elephants theyre the ones right are you scared of them no said samuel awwww said the demon i give up lets forget about the whole shapeshifting thing just climb off the bed and well get this over with samuel didnt move what will you do if i climb off the bed well i can eat you or i can drag you down to the depths of hell never to be seen or heard from again depends really on what lots of things hygiene for a start after tasting that sock i dont fancy eating any part of you to be honest so itll have to be the depths of hell for you im afraid but i dont want to go to the depths of hell nobody wants to go to the depths of hell im a demon and even i dont want to go there thats the point isnt it if i told you that i was going to take you for a nice holiday or on a trip to the zoo it wouldnt be much of a threat would it but why do you have to drag me off to hell orders whose orders cant say cant say or wont say both why not she wouldnt want me to mrs abernathy the demon didnt reply oh come on i know its her said samuel youve already given most of it away right then said the demon its her happy now not really i still dont want to be dragged off to hell then we have whats known as an impasse said the demon how long can you stay down there first sign of daylight then i have to depart thems the rules just like i cant get you unless you step on the floor so if i just stay up here then you cant touch me i just said that didnt i i dont make the rules i wish i did this whole business would run a lot more smoothly i can tell you then ill simply stay here great you do that samuel folded his arms and stared at the far wall from under the bed he heard what sounded like tentacles being folded lots of tentacles not much point in you hanging around though is there if im not going to set foot on the floor until youre gone said samuel the demon thought about this suppose not it said so why dont you just leave it cant be very comfortable under there its not smells funny too and theres something poking into me samuel heard scuffling from beneath the bed and moments later a stray toy soldier was tossed against the wardrobe you dont even want to know where that was said the demon whatever said samuel are you going to leave not much else i can do really said the demon not if youre going to be difficult about it off you go then said samuel right bye there was a great deal of squelching then silence youre still under there arent you said samuel no said a small voice slightly ashamedly fibber fine ill go dont know what im supposed to tell her though dont tell her anything just keep a low profile until dawn then say that i didnt get up during the night might work said the demon might work you promise not to get up to use the bathroom or anything cross my heart said samuel cant ask for more than that said the demon well pleasure doing business with you nothing personal about all this you know just following orders youre not going to come back are you oh no i shouldnt think so took a lot of power for her to summon me up cant imagine shell try that one again she has a lot on her mind what with keeping the portal open and all very unstable that portal someone could do themselves an injury in there if theyre not careful she might look for another way to get at you though then again she might not soon it wont matter much either way why not said samuel end of the world said the demon wont be any beds left to hide under and with a squish and a pop it was gone xi in which we encounter the scientists again no good ever comes of someone sticking his head round his bosss door a worried expression on his face and a piece of paper in one hand that if it could talk would shout very loudly bad this is bad run away now but thus it was that when professor stefan cerns head of particle physics saw professor hilbert hovering on his doorstep with both a a worried expression and b a piece of paper that despite being white and bearing only a series of numbers and a small diagram also managed to look worried he began to feel worried too what is it hilbert said professor stefan in the tone of one who would rather not know what it is at all thank you very much its the portal said professor hilbert he had always liked the sound of that word which fit in with his theories of the universe anyway since they still didnt know for certain what it was he could call it anything he liked so youve found out what it is no not exactly do you know if its ongoing were not sure have you even found out if thats actually what opened oh we know it opened said professor hilbert that parts easy so youve proved that it exists professor stefan liked things to be proved before he accepted the fact of their existence this made him a good scientist if not a very imaginative one er no but we strongly suspect that it exists a portal has been opened and it hasnt closed not entirely how do you know if you cant find it a smile of immense satisfaction appeared on professor hilberts face because we can hear it speak he said if you listen hard enough theres almost no such thing as silence theres just noise that isnt very loud yet oh yes in space no one can hear you scream or blow up a big spaceship because space is a vacuum and sound cant travel in a vacuum although think how dull most science fiction films would be if there were no explosions so pay no attention to grumps who criticize star wars because you can hear the death star explode at the endspoilsports but otherwise there is noise all around us even if we cant hear it terribly well but noises arent the same as sounds noises are random and disorganized but sounds are made deep in the lhcs command center a group of scientists was clustered around a screen the screen displayed a visual representation of what had occurred on the night that the collider had apparently malfunctioned the scientists had painstakingly recreated the circumstances of that evening restoring lost and rewritten code and had attempted to trace without success the trajectory of the unknown energy particle which now expressed itself as a slowly revolving spiral so this is what you think happened to our collider said stefan its still happening said hilbert what but weve shut down the collider i know but i suppose you could say that the damage if thats what it is has been done i thinkand i stress think that somehow enough energy was harnessed from the collider to blow a hole between our world and for want of a better term somewhere else when we shut down the collider we took away that energy source the portal collapsed but not entirely theres a pinhole where there used to be a tunnel but its there nonetheless listen beside the screen was a speaker currently emitting what sounded like static its static said professor stefan i dont hear anything the static whooshed slightly its pattern changing as though in response to the professors words we wanted you to hear the signal before we cleaned it up explained hilbert signal said stefan actually a voice said hilbert flipping a switch and instantly the static was replaced by something that professor stefan had to admit sounded a great deal like a low voice whispering the professor didnt like the sound of that voice at all even if he had no idea what it was saying it was like listening to the mutterings of a madman in a foreign tongue someone who had spent too long locked in a dark place feeling angry with all those responsible for putting him there it gave the professor who was as we have already established not an imaginative man a distinct case of the collywobbles its effect on the other listeners was less disturbing most of them looked excited in fact dr carruthers appeared to be having trouble keeping his tea cup from rattling against its saucer his excitement was so great professor stefan leaned in closer to the speaker frowning whatever it is it sounds like the same thing being said over and over are you sure its not someones idea of a joke perhaps theres a bug in the system hilbert shook his head its not in the system weve checked well whats it saying professor hilbert looked puzzled thats the thing he said its a known language weve had it examined its early aramaic probably from around one thousand bc weve established that its a version of the same language we found embedded in our code so its coming from somewhere on earth no said professor hilbert he pointed at the image of the event its definitely coming from somewhere on the other side of that professor we may just have proved the existence of the multiverse stefan looked doubtful but whats it saying he repeated professor hilbert swallowed what might have been worry creased his face we think its saying fear me xii in which we meet once again the unfortunate nurd who is about to take another unexpected trip nurd the scourge of five deities had been devoting a lot of thought to his recent experiences given that he didnt have a whole lot else to think about beyond whether or not wormwood was looking even mangier than usual or my isnt it flat around here it was quite a welcome distraction among the subjects under consideration was his size was he nurd wondered very very small small enough to be crushed by what he now believed was a mechanism of some kind he had never really speculated about this before since demons came in all shapes and sizes indeed some of them came in more than one shape or size all by themselves such as odear the demon of people who look in mirrors and think theyre overweight and his twin oreally the demon of people who look in mirrors and think theyre slim when theyre not a great many demons were little more than ethereal beings wisps of nastiness that floated around like bad thoughts in a dark mind some chose physical forms just so that they could hold on to things which made tea breaks much more satisfying others were given form by the great malevolence himself for his own nefarious purposes ftnref nefarious means very wicked indeed in a cunning way if you plan on being nefarious it pays to look the part dress in black wear a hat preferably one with a wide brim and no flowers and perhaps grow a mustache that you can twirl it also helps to have a deep and sinister laugh to indicate when youre being nefarious you know the kind bwahhahahaha that kind nurd wasnt privy to the great malevolences plans for the conquest of earth few were except those closest to him the great malevolence had been stuck in hell for an extraordinarily long time marooned in that desolate place with only his fellow demons for company he had managed to carve out a kingdom for himself but it was a kingdom of rock and dirt and pain he could hardly be blamed for wanting to get away from it the great malevolence was extremely angry and unfathomably cruel and what the great malevolence hated more than anything else was people people had trees and flowers and dragonflies they had dogs and footballs and summers most of all they were free to do pretty much whatever they liked where they liked and as long as they didnt hurt anybody else along the way or break the law life wasnt bad the great malevolence wanted nothing more than to bring that to an end preferably an end that involved wailing and screaming and big fires and demons with pitchforks poking people where they didnt like being poked even though nurd was a demon the great malevolence frightened him a lot if nurd had been the great malevolence he would have been afraid to look at himself in a mirror so frightening was the great malevolence the great malevolence probably didnt even have a reflection nurd thought any mirror would be too scared to show it nurd stared out at the wasteland anywhere had to be better than here if he could make his way to the place of people then he could rule it in his own manner and perhaps be a little nicer about it than the great malevolence once hed got some of the fireballs and general terrifying of the population out of his system but he would need to be ready for his journey if it were to happen again he tried to remember the sensations he had experienced as he was dragged from one world to the next but couldnt he had been so confused and so terrified that the journey was over before hed realized what was happening and then someone had of course dropped a heavy object on him and that had been the end of that he did his best to recall whether he had been given any indication that he was about to pop out of existence in one place and pop up in another not very long afterward and decided that the tips of his fingers had begun to itch something terrible in the seconds before he went off on his unanticipated trip actually just like they were itching now oh oh dear nurd barely had time to concentrate on making himself significantly larger before there was a loud pop and he vanished from his throne as professor hilbert suspected the large hadron collider had through only some fault of its own managed to open a hole between our world and somewhere else entirely it wasnt quite a black hole since it obeyed only some of the rules of a black hole while rudely ignoring others which would have greatly irritated einstein and other scientists like him neither was it quite a wormhole although it obeyed some of the characteristics of a wormhole too nevertheless it would do nicely until a black hole or wormhole came along here are some things that are worth remembering about black holes should it ever seem likely that youre going to encounter one the first is that if at some time in the future a group of nice scientists in white coats suggest that youyes youhave been chosen as the lucky candidate to enter a black hole and find out whats going on at the other side it would be a very good idea for youyes youto find something else to do preferably far away and not involving even peripherally black holes space suits or scientists with an unsettling gleam in their eyes perhaps youve already worked this out for yourself being a clever person after all if sticking a head or any other part of oneself into a black hole is such a great idea then scientists would be queuing up to do it instead of tapping someone else on the shoulder and inviting him to have a go which brings us to the second thing worth noting about black holes your life is likely to be very short although spectacularly eventful if you go messing about with one there may well be all kinds of quite fascinating stuff at the other side of a black hole but youre unlikely to be able to tell anyone what it is the gravitational force of a black hole is subject to quite dramatic changes so just as youre thinking to yourself wow a black hole how interesting and swirly it is wait until i tell those nice scientists all about it your body will be ripped to shreds and then compacted to a point of infinite density which will probably hurt a lot although not for very long figure you in a black hole then again you might be lucky enough to plummet into a supermassive black hole where the gravitational changes are a little gentler in that case youll still be torn apart but more slowly so you might have time to come to terms with what it feels like before you are crushed to that point of infinite density it all depends upon the sacrifices one is willing to make for the sake of science really its your choice frankly id find a less risky job if i were you like being an accountant or cleaning the teeth of great white sharks with a toothpick and some floss as it happened nurd the scourge of five deities was learning a great deal about the nature of notquiteblack holes since he was at that moment plunging through one he really didnt want to be either because he felt that no good was going to come of it he was pretty certain that he was falling even though he had no sensation that he was doing so and he was rapidly approaching a point of light in the distance that didnt seem to be getting any closer which was very confusing he did his best to pull himself back in the direction from which he had come like a swimmer kicking against a strong tide but here is another interesting thing about black holes the more you struggle to escape the force of one the quicker youll reach that whole part about infinite density and crushing and stuff due to time and space being all muddled up ftnref if that sounds confusing it isnt really the equivalent effect can be found on earth such as when you havent studied for a test in school and the more you want that test to be put off the faster the time for the test seems to arrive the same is true for painful dental appointments visiting that aunt you dont like at christmas and waiting for your mum to come home while you try to stick back together her favorite vase that youve just broken the opposite occurs for events to which youre rather looking forward like christmas your birthday or the first snows of winter someday a very bright child will create an equation for all this in order to explain it and other even brighter children will look at him in a funny way and wonder why he bothered since everyone instinctively understood it anyway the awareness that even though he was trying to move away from whatever he was falling toward he was still approaching it with increasing rapidity gave nurd a headache fortunately he was distracted from it by the feeling that every atom of his demonic form was being stretched on an infinite number of tiny racks each of which had helpfully been fitted with a selection of very sharp pins then that particular pain came to an end to be replaced by the way a banana might feel if someone peeled it briefly balanced it upright on a table and then dropped a rock on it just as nurd began to think that this was the end for him all the pain stopped and he felt something firm beneath his feet his eyes were squeezed shut he opened one of them carefully then another and then a third which he kept for special occasions he was standing in the middle of a road and around him metal objects were whizzing by at what seemed like great speeds one of them he noticed was sleek and red and pretty i dont know what that is said nurd to himself but i want one he heard a sound behind him it was very loud like the bellowing of some great beast nurd turned just in time to be hit full in the face by a decidedly large version of one of the metal objects samuel was staring out of his bedroom window he had not yet changed out of his pajamas and was reflecting on what had taken place during the night the area beneath his bed had been a little slimy when he checked it once dawn came but other than that there was no sign of the demon that had until recently been occupying the space he was wondering if the demon might return despite its protestations to the contrary when a figure with greenish skin a large head and pointed ears wearing a red cloak and big boots appeared briefly on the street below in a flash of blue light the figure looked about its attention caught by a passing car and then was promptly hit by a truck there was another flash of blue light and the figure was gone the truck driver stopped climbed out of his cab tried to find a body and then quickly drove off samuel considered telling his mum but decided that it was probably better just to add it to the list of things nobody was likely to believe at least not until it was too late back in the wasteland wormwood was staring suspiciously at the throne the crown and the scepter once again all three tempted him but after what had happened the last time he didnt want to be caught waving them around if and when nurd returned say what you liked about nurd and wormwood had said most things under his breath but he wasnt entirely stupid it had not escaped his attention that he had rematerialized after his earlier disappearance to find a mangy demon waving his scepter and wearing his crown once nurd had recovered from the shock of what had occurred wormwood had earned an extra bump for each offense and one more between the eyes for good luck wormwood now decided to bide his time but he couldnt hide his disappointment when not very long after he had vanished nurd reappeared this time looking like an insect that had just been hit by the largest swatter ever created so how did that go master asked wormwood not terribly well actually replied nurd he was about to faint when his fingers and toes began to tingle again oh no said nurd who was hurting in so many places that he was wondering if hed somehow acquired new body parts simply so they could ache ive only just then he was gone again samuels bedroom was suddenly lit by a blue flash which was followed by a loud pop and a smell like eggs burning dank mist filled the room samuel dived to the floor closely followed by boswell and peered over the edge of his bed slowly the mist began to clear revealing a greenskinned figure in a red cloak the figure had one leg raised and his head covered with his hands as if he were expecting to receive a nasty blow at any moment when the blow didnt come he peered out cautiously from between his fingers then breathed a sigh of relief well that makes a pleasant change he said and started to relax unfortunately at that moment boswell decided to make his presence known and gave a bark causing the new arrival to leap onto a chair and cover his head again what are you doing asked samuel from behind the bed im cowering said the figure why because every time i shift into this world i get hurt frankly its starting to become wearing samuel stood boswell sensing that the figure on the chair wasnt half as threatening as it had at first seemed experimented with a growl and was pleased to see the greenskinned personage tremble didnt you just get run over by a truck asked samuel is that what it was said nurd i didnt get time to exchange pleasantries with it before it knocked me into another dimension the cheek what are you im a demon said nurd nurd the scourge of five deities really said samuel skeptically the demons clothes looked tatty and samuel didnt think that demons climbed on chairs to get away from small dogs are you sure no im a saucepan hissed nurd testily of course im a demon he coughed im actually a very important demon he looked at samuel who arched an eyebrow at him oh i give up said nurd no im not important i live in a wasteland with an irritating entity called wormwood nobody likes me and i have no power is that better i suppose said samuel who sent you here nobody sent me i just got dragged here very uncomfortably i might add nurd glanced at boswell whats that its my dog his name is boswell and im samuel boswell wagged his tail at the sound of his name then remembering that he was supposed to be ferocious showed some teeth and growled again he doesnt seem very happy to see me said nurd then again nobody ever is well you did pop up a little unexpectedly nurd sighed sorry about that not my fault would you mind if i stopped cowering now im beginning to get a cramp samuel had a good instinct for people he could tell a good person from a bad one often before the person in question had even spoken although his experience of demons was rather more limited something told him that if nurd wasnt exactly good and being a demon it was hardly part of the job description wanted demon must be goodhe was not entirely bad either he was just himself like most ordinary people all right said samuel then added because hed once heard someone say it in a police movie but no sudden movements does shooting off into another dimension count asked nurd no fine then nurd sat on the chair and looked around the room nice place thank you you decorate it yourself my dad did most of it oh they were silent for a time if you dont mind me saying so you dont look very happy said samuel i think im in shock said nurd you try being wrenched from one dimension to another then being hit by a truck sent back home again for long enough to start hurting and then have the whole thing begin all over its not conducive to a healthy outlook on life let me tell you nurd put his very large chin in his hands and frowned anyway he said its not like you look overjoyed either im not said samuel my dads left us my mum cries in the evenings and i think the woman down the road is trying to kill me are you sure she didnt send you quite sure said nurd and for the first time in many years he felt sorry for someone other than himself thats not very nice of her no it isnt well like i said i live in a wasteland theres nothing to see nothing to do and wormwood and i have run out of things to talk about in fact this interdimensional travel has brightened up my days no end or it would have if i didnt keep being injured by hard metal objects this is such an interesting place he moved to the window and gazed out look he said and there were eons of longing and sadness in his voice you have fluffy white clouds and sunshine what i wouldnt give to be able to see sunshine every day samuel picked up a bag of jelly beans from his nightstand would you like a sweet a what a sweetie theyre jelly beans tentatively nurd reached into the bag and came out with a red bean oh those ones are lovely said samuel popping an orange one into his mouth and chewing thoughtfully nurd followed his example and seemed pleasantly surprised by the result ooooh thats good he said thats very good fluffy clouds jelly beans big metal things that move fast what a world you live in samuel sat down on his bed leaving the window nurd returned to his chair youre not going to hurt me are you asked samuel nurd looked shocked why would i do that because youre a demon just because im a demon doesnt mean that im bad said nurd a piece of jelly bean had stuck to his teeth and he worked at it with a long fingernail i didnt ask to be a demon it just happened that way i opened my eyes one day and there i was nurd ugly bloke no friends even other demons dont care much for my company why you seem all right to me i suppose thats it really ive never been very demonic i dont want to torture or wreak havoc i dont want to be frightening or terrible i just want to potter along minding my own business but they told me i had to do something destructive or id be in trouble so i tried to find a role that wouldnt attract too much attention or cause a lot of bother to people but all those jobs were taken you know theres a demon who looks after the little bit of toothpaste that you cant squeeze out of the end of the tube even though you know its there and theres no other toothpaste in the house theres even a demon of shyness or theres supposed to be nobodys ever seen him so its hard to know for sure i quite fancied a job like that eventually some of the other demons just got irritated with me trying to muscle in on their action and i was banished it all seemed pretty hopeless and then suddenly i started popping up here i just feel like i could make something of myself in this world there are so many opportunities this world is hard too said samuel and there was something in the boys voice that made nurd want to reach out to him the demon picked up the bag of jelly beans and offered one to samuel he picked a green one you can have another too he said to nurd youre sure absolutely nurd tried a black one it tasted a bit funny but it was still better than anything else he had ever eaten except for that first jelly bean go on said nurd you were saying it doesnt matter said samuel no it does i want to know really so samuel told him he spoke of his mother and his father and of how his dad had left and maybe it was samuels fault and maybe it wasnt he spoke of how the world doesnt listen to children even when it should he spoke of boswell and of how he would be lost without the little dog for company and nurd who had never had a mother and father and who had never loved or been loved marveled at the ways in which a feeling so wonderful could also leave one open to so much pain in a strange way he envied samuel even that he wanted to care about someone so much that it could hurt thus the boy and the demon sat as the day grew brighter talking of places seen and unseen of hopes and fears the only shadow cast upon their conversation was samuels description of the events in the abernathys basement which made nurd uneasy even as he struggled to understand what they might mean it sounded to him as though there might be other demons in this world demons with a plan well nurd had plans of his own assuming he could find a way to stay in the world of men permanently and not simply spend the rest of his existence whizzing painfully between dimensions at last nurds fingers began to tingle again i have to go he said with regret he smiled a movement so unfamiliar that at first his muscles struggled with it it really has been very nice talking to you when i work out how to rule this world ill make sure that youre well looked after just as nurd was about to vanish samuel thrust the bag of jelly beans into his hand so that when nurd arrived back in the wasteland he might have something with which to cheer himself and wormwood up nurd reappeared on his throne he opened his eyes to find wormwood staring anxiously at him whats wrong with your face asked wormwood nurd tested his mouth with his fingers wormwood he said i appear to be smiling here have a jelly bean xiii in which samuel decides to consult an expert on demons and hell but doesnt get anywhere reverend ussher the vicar and mr berkeley the verger were standing outside the church of st timidus greeting the congregation as its members filed out on that bright sunday morning the church was named after st timidus of biddlecombe a very holy man who died in ad at the age of thirtyeight st timidus became famous when in ad he decided to go and live in a cave outside biddlecombe so that he would not be tempted to do bad things it wasnt a very large cave and when people came to bring him food timidus would sometimes be able to see them coming or hear what they were saying he decided to dig himself another cave next to the one in which he was living so that there would be absolutely no chance of seeing or hearing someone and being tempted to sin its not entirely clear what sins timidus was afraid of committing since he never said but it probably had something to do with ladies it often does in such cases unfortunately while he was digging the second cave timidus caused the first cave to fall in on him and he was buried alive under a large pile of rocks it was decided that timidus should be made a saint because of his commitment to avoiding bad things and also because biddlecombe didnt have any saints at the time and theres nothing like a good oldfashioned saint to bring believers to a place and encourage them to spend money so it was that plain old timidus became st timidus of biddlecombe now you or i might wonder if timidus might not have been better off leaving his cave and doing nice things for other people such as helping old ladies cross the road or feeding the poor instead of hiding himself away and not talking to anyone after all not doing bad things is not the same as doing good things but that is why you and i will never become saints on the other hand you and i are unlikely to be buried under a big pile of stones as a result of bad engineering practices so these things even themselves out in the end the bishop of biddlecombe at the time was named bernard but he was known far and wide as bishop bernard the bad obviously this wasnt what his parents named him as that would have been a bit foolish i mean if you name someone the bad then really youre just asking for trouble it would have led to conversations like the following bernards parents hello this is our son bernard the bad we hope hell become a bishop someday a nice one of course not a bad one not bernards parents er then why did you name him the bad bernards parents oh dear ftnref there are lots of people throughout history with the word the somewhere in their names some of these people were rather pleasant such as richard the lionheart ad the english king even if he didnt speak much english oddly enough although he was very good at french who commanded an army by the age of sixteen fought in the crusades and forgave the young boy who shot the arrow that fatally wounded him and alfred the great ad who defended his saxon kingdom of wessex against the danish invaders and was well greaton the other hand there were some people with the in their names who were very unpleasant indeed vlad the impaler ad of wallachia who was also known as dracula and inspired the name of the famous vampire liked to stick his enemies on big spikes ivan the terrible of russia ad was a tyrant and a bully who died while playing chess it wasnt the excitement of the game though he was probably poisoned with mercury finally certain historial figures with the in their names were just a bit lame ladies and gentlemen i give you heneage the dismal ad hugh the dull ad charles the silly died ad and wenceslas the worthless ad who once cooked a chef alive for serving a bad ragout bishop bernard the bad was given his nickname because he was extremely nasty bishop bernard didnt like people who disagreed with him especially if they disagreed with his decisions to steal lots of money kill people who had anything that he might want and have children even if he wasnt supposed to have children because he was a bishop in fact he wasnt supposed to do any of those things but that didnt stop bishop bernard bishop bernard also believed there were few problems in life that couldnt be solved by sticking a hot poker up somebodys bottom if that didnt work which was rare he would put his enemies on a rack and stretch them until they said ow very loudly or just kill them often in a slow and painful way bishop bernard knew that people called him bernard the bad behind his back but he didnt care he rather liked the idea that people were terrified of him by the time st timidus of biddlecombe who wasnt bad at all just a little confused died in his cave bishop bernard the bad was getting old he decided that a church should be built and named after st timidus and when he died bishop bernard would be buried in a special vault in the church that way bishop bernard could pretend that he had something in common with the saint and perhaps over time people might forget that he was bad as he would be the one buried in the church people arent that stupid instead when he died bishop bernard was buried beneath a little room at the side of the church and the only sign that he was there was a stone in the floor with his name on it thereafter he was always mentioned when visitors were brought on tours of the chapel but they were only told of the bad things that he had done mainly because he had never done anything good so there you have it the history of the church of st timidus why all that is so important we shall discover later for now it is enough to know that reverend ussher and mr berkeley were standing outside its doors being very polite when mr berkeley saw samuel approaching and nudged the vicar look out vicar he said its that strange johnson boy the vicar looked alarmed samuel johnson was only eleven years old but he sometimes asked the kinds of questions that would challenge elderly philosophers most recently the vicar recalled there had been a lengthy discussion about angels and pins which was something to do with a school project although he couldnt imagine what kind of school other than a theology college might require its students to debate the size and nature of the angelic host to be perfectly frank it had made reverend usshers head spin he thought that samuel johnson might be some kind of child prodigy or genius then again he might simply be a rather annoying small boy of which in reverend usshers experience there were already too many in the world now here samuel was again his brow furrowed in the kind of concentration that suggested the vicars knowledge of matters divine and angelic was about to be severely tested hello samuel said the vicar composing his face into some semblance of goodwill and whats on your mind this morning do you believe in hell vicar asked samuel um well reverend ussher paused why are you asking about hell samuel youre not worried about going there are you i cant imagine that a young man like you could have much cause to fear er eternal damnation or even temporary damnation come to that beside him mr berkeley stifled a cough suggesting that he would be quite happy to see samuel johnson suffer in a hot fiery place if only for long enough to discourage him from asking the vicar awkward questions its not so much that im afraid of ending up there said samuel its more that im afraid of it ending up here the vicar looked confused hed known that he was likely to become confused at some point in the conversation he just hadnt imagined that it would happen so fast im not sure that i follow you i mean is there a chance that hell could come here come here said the verger intervening its hell not the number fortyseven bus samuel ignored him hed never thought much of mr berkeley who always seemed to be scowling even on christmas morning when nobody had any business to be scowling at all the vicar quieted mr berkeley with a wave of his hand no samuel even if hell does exist and im not entirely convinced that it does it has nothing to do with this earthly realm it is distinct and of itself people may end up there but i can say with some confidence that it will never end up here he beamed beatifically at samuel samuel did not beam back instead he seemed about to offer some further argument but mr berkeley had had enough he gripped the vicar by the elbow and steered him toward less challenging company namely mr and mrs billingsgate who ran the local fishandchip shop and rarely asked anything more awkward than whether or not one might require vinegar with that samuel stared glumly as the two men walked away hed wanted to say much more to the vicar but it didnt look like that was going to happen the vicar seemed very certain about things he couldnt possibly know for sure but samuel supposed that was all part of being a vicar after all it wouldnt have done for the vicar to stand up before the congregation in church on sunday and ask if there was any point in their being here as a vicar you had to learn to take some things on trust as samuel returned to his mum who was chatting with friends he saw mrs abernathy by the church wall watching him he noticed that she was careful to remain outside the church grounds she hadnt been at the service either samuel would have noticed her she beckoned to samuel but samuel merely shook his head trying to ignore her samuel he heard her voice in his head as clearly as if she were standing next to him he glanced at her again she hadnt moved but a small smile was playing on her face samuel her voice came again we need to talk if you dont come to me im going to find your little dog and im going to kill him what do you think of that clever samuel johnson would you sacrifice your dogs life because youre too frightened to face me samuel swallowed mrs abernathy was like the witch in the wizard of oz threatening toto to get back at dorothy he left his mother and approached the woman at the wall how are you samuel she asked as though they were friends who had just happened to meet on a pleasant sunday morning im fine he answered im disappointed to hear that said mrs abernathy in fact i was hoping you wouldnt be here at all samuel shrugged mrs abernathys eyes already blue seemed to brighten a shade drawing his gaze toward them you sent the monster who hid under my bed said samuel yes and im going to have words with him when i find him i expended rather a lot of energy bringing him here the least he could have done was eat you alive well he didnt said samuel he seemed quite nice actually mrs abernathys calm expression altered for an instant she might have been a demon but in common with most of the human adults who had encountered samuel johnson she wasnt sure if he was being deliberately cheeky or was just a very unusual child im here to seek a truce i dont know what you saw or thought you saw in our basement that night but youre mistaken theres nothing for you to be concerned about were just visiting for a time samuel shook his head there was something strangely insistent about mrs abernathys voice samuel recalled a play that they had read about in school one in which a king was murdered by having poison poured into his ear listening to mrs abernathy he felt just as he imagined the king must have felt as he started to die i i dont want to hear it samuel you must learn to keep your mouth shut if you dont interfere with me then ill leave you in peace but if you cross me you wont even live long enough to regret it do you understand samuel nodded even as he knew that what mrs abernathy was saying was a lie there would be no peace for him or for anyone if she succeeded with her plans but her voice was so sweet and hypnotic and his eyelids were starting to feel so very heavy come closer samuel whispered mrs abernathy come closer and let me whisper in your ear whisper ear poison in that instant samuel sensed the danger he was in with a great effort of will he pinched himself hard on the hand using his nails so that the pain was sharp and he drew blood he took a step back from mrs abernathy his head clearing and he saw her face cloud with rage one of her hands reached for him almost as though it had a will of its own you nasty child she said dont think you can escape me that easily youd better be careful unless unless what said samuel goading her now unless i want something bad to happen to me is that it what could be worse than a monster under my bed waiting to eat me mrs abernathy got her anger under control she smiled almost sweetly oh you have no idea she said well then here it is something bad is going to happen to you no matter what you do the question is how bad will that something be when the time comes i can make it so that you simply fall asleep and never wake up again but if i choose i can ensure instead that you never sleep again and that every moment of your wretched existence is spent in searing agony gasping for breath and begging for the pain to stop it sounds like gym class said samuel with considerable feeling he was happy that his voice didnt tremble it made him appear braver than he was mrs abernathy looked past samuel he risked a glance in the same direction and saw his mother approaching youre so funny samuel said mrs abernathy beginning to move away when my master comes well see if he finds you quite so amusing in the meantime you keep your mouth shut remember when i said id kill your dog well if you speak of this to your mother then ill kill her instead ill smother her in her sleep and no one will ever know except you and i i met her in the supermarket yesterday i know youve been talking about my affairs remember this samuel careless talk costs lives with that she headed off in the direction of town trailing strong perfume and a faint whiff of burning what did she want asked mrs johnson she was staring at mrs abernathys back with illconcealed distaste she couldnt remember why she disliked mrs abernathy so much just that she did nothing mum said samuel resignedly she was just saying hello that evening samuel decided that there was no point in telling any grownup in biddlecombe of what he knew they simply wouldnt believe him but perhaps someone his own age might he could no longer deal with all this alone tomorrow at the risk of being laughed at he would call upon his friends for help xiv in which we learn that it is sometimes wise to be afraid of the dark samuels dad called the house that night to speak to his son samuel tried to tell his dad about the abernathys basement but his dad only said really and how interesting and asked samuel how he was enjoying his halfterm break and if his mum was okay samuel made one final effort dad he said this is serious im not making it up you think these people the abernathys are carrying out experiments in their basement said mr johnson not experiments said samuel i think they were messing about with something that they shouldnt have been messing about with and it all went wrong now theyve opened a kind of doorway into hell yes except its not working right yet the door is open but the gates arent dont you usually have to open the gates before the door said mr johnson yes said samuel but he stopped youre making fun of me arent you he said you dont believe me have you been playing those computer games again those ones where you have to kill demons samuel put your mum on the phone samuel did and heard one side of a conversation that seemed to revolve around whether or not he samuel knew the difference between reality and fantasy and if this was some kind of reaction to the difficulties in their marriage and if samuel should see a psychiatrist the conversation moved on to other matters and samuel drifted away his mum had a troubled expression on her face when she hung up the phone as though she realized that she was supposed to remember something important but couldnt quite recall what it was samuel go to bed early tonight said mrs johnson read something that doesnt involve demons or ghosts or monsters hmmm for me and darling be careful what you say to people then she started crying your dads buying a house with that woman samuel said his mum through her tears he wants a divorce and he wants to come down and collect that stupid bloody car of his samuel held his mum and didnt speak after a while she told him that it was time for bed he went up to his room and spent a long time staring out of the window but he didnt cry suddenly monsters and demons didnt seem so important anymore his dad wasnt coming home again meanwhile he was just a small boy and nobodynot his mum not his dad listened to small boys not ever shortly after nine he changed into his pajamas and climbed into bed eventually he fell asleep it was boswell who first sensed the coming of the darkness he woke at the end of samuels bed where he had now decided to sleep permanently after the nasty slimy thing had briefly taken up residence on the floor beneath boswells nose twitched and his hair stood on end although he was a very intelligent animal boswell like most dogs divided the world into things that were good to eat and things that were bad to eat with a small space in the middle for things that might potentially be either or just good or bad generally but about which he wasnt entirely certain as of yet thus boswells first impression upon waking up was that something was bad but he wasnt sure exactly what which confused him greatly he couldnt hear or smell anything out of the ordinary neither could he see anything out of the ordinary although his eyesight wasnt very good at the best of times so that a whole army of very bad things could have been standing a few feet away and unless they smelled bad or sounded bad he would have had no idea that they were there he jumped from the bed and sniffed around then trotted to the window and put his front paws on the sill so that he could peer out all seemed to be perfectly normal the road was empty nothing was moving the streetlight at the nearest corner flickered and went out creating a pool of darkness that stretched halfway to the next light boswell put his head to one side and whined softly then the next streetlight went out and seconds later the first light came back on again even with his weak eyesight boswell caught something slipping from one pool of darkness to the next the third streetlight the one directly in front of their house buzzed and then extinguished itself and this time it stayed out boswell stared at the pool of blackness and a figure in the shadows seemed to stare back at him boswell growled then the pool of blackness began to change it extended itself like oil running down a hill rivulets of it flowing from the base of the streetlight toward the garden gate of number it slid beneath the gate and oozed along the path until it reached the front door and boswell could no longer mark its progress boswell dropped down from the window padded to the halfclosed bedroom door and pushed his body through the gap he stood at the top of the stairs and watched as the darkness slipped under the door seemed to pause for a second to find its bearings and then flowed to the first step and began to climb the edge of the darkness forming fingers that pulled the rest of its mass along boswell heard a soft pop as the far end of the darkness slipped beneath the front door so that now he was staring at a puddle perhaps three feet long making its way inexorably toward him boswell began to bark but nobody came mrs johnsons bedroom door remained firmly closed and boswell could hear her snoring softly the darkness was now halfway up the stairs and at the sound of boswells barks it began to increase its rate of progress with no other option boswell beat a retreat to samuels bedroom door pushing his way in and then nudging the door closed with his nose he backed away still growling he could see a thin line of illumination between the door and the carpet and deep in his clever dog mind he sensed that this was not a good thing slowly the light disappeared diminishing from left to right until nothing of it remained for a couple of seconds all was still there was only the sound of samuels breathing and the distant buzz of mrs johnsons snores to disturb the silence boswell jumped onto the bed and barked in samuels ear mwff said samuel argle boswell tried licking him while at the same time keeping an eye on the door samuel just pushed him away not even waking up properly to do so s early he mumbled no school just then with a speed that caused boswell to jump backward in fright the darkness poured under the door moving swiftly toward where samuel lay it found the leg of the bed and climbed it like a snake winding its way round the wood before sliding across the blankets boswell could smell it now it reeked of old clothes and stagnant water and dead things it did not shine like oil even though it moved with the same relentless viscosity it was absence made solid nothingness given form and purpose and as it moved to smother samuel boswell knew what he had to do standing near the edge of the bed he gripped one end of the darkness with his teeth and pulled he felt it stretch like rubber in his mouth his tongue grew cold and his teeth began to hurt but he did not release his grip instead he dug his paws into the blanket and began working his way back to the end of the bed the darkness extended toward samuel by now almost within reach of his neck boswells paws tore at the blanket as he tried to maintain his position his teeth tugging with all his might even as he felt his back legs begin to slide and he fell off the edge of the bed his bite still hard upon the darkness the impact of boswell hitting the floor combined with the sensation of the blanket slipping away from him finally woke samuel up whats happening he asked rubbing his eyes from the floor came the sound of a struggle and he heard boswell whimper boswell samuel sat up and looked over the edge of the bed he saw what appeared to be a blanket of blackness and beneath it the shape of a small struggling dog the darkness or whatever was controlling it had recognized at last the threat posed by the little dachshund and was doing its level best to extinguish it boswell shouted samuel he reached down and began to pull at the shadow but even as he did so it froze his fingers and as he watched in horror it began to flow up his arms ugh said samuel meanwhile boswell now freed from the suffocating force was catching his breath seeing his master in trouble he recommenced his attack digging his aching teeth in once again simultaneously samuel began to move backward until at last the darkness was stretched between them dont let go boswell said samuel he pulled the darkness and boswell in the direction of the small bathroom that lay to the right of his bed it contained only a toilet and a small basin but it was enough for what samuel had in mind stay boswell he said as he reached the toilet and boswell was almost at the door holding on to the darkness with one hand so that it remained at full stretch samuel lifted the toilet seat and taking a deep breath told boswell to open his mouth the darkness sprang from boswells mouth the force sending its bulk flying in samuels direction as quickly as he could samuel released his own grip the darkness struck the cistern then fell into the bowl immediately tendrils of it extended upward as it tried to pull itself out but samuel was too quick for it he hit the flush and watched with satisfaction as the darkness swirled around the bowl for a time and then was swept into the sewers breathing heavily samuel leaned back against the sink im never using that toilet again he said to boswell but boswell was no longer at the door instead he had returned to the window where samuel now joined him together they watched as the streetlight across from the house came on once more and the next one extinguished itself and so on until at last the corner was plunged into darkness for a moment and something fled away into stoker lane before it disappeared samuel and boswell caught a glimpse of it it looked like a woman in fact it looked very much like mrs abernathy xv in which samuel johnson begins to fight back samuel didnt say much at breakfast the next morning his mother noticed how subdued her son was is everything all right dear she asked samuel just nodded and ate his cornflakes he wanted to tell his mother what had happened the night before with the pool of darkness but he couldnt she wouldnt believe him and he had no proof he had no idea where the darkness had ended up and was at first a little worried that it might be stuck in one of the household pipes waiting for a chance to emerge once he had thought about it for a while though he realized that it was probably lost in a smelly old sewer which was just fine by samuel still he had taken the precaution of gluing the toilet seat closed using superstrong adhesive he was the only one who ever used the little bathroom anyway and as long as he was careful nobody would discover for a while what he had done but samuel was also very frightened for his mother and for himself he remembered mrs abernathys threat to kill his mother if he continued to try to convince her of what he knew the demon under the bed had been bad enough but at least that could be reasoned with the darkness had been something else entirely he had been lucky last night boswells bravery had saved him but boswell might not be able to save him or his mum from whatever came next because samuel was sure of one thing mrs abernathy wasnt going to give up the darkness had simply been her latest attempt to silence samuel others would follow and eventually she would succeed samuel didnt want to die he quite liked being alive but as he tried to come to terms with how scared he was he began to feel angry mrs abernathy was evil she wanted to do something awful so awful that the world would never be the same after it if there was even any world left once the gates were opened she had to be stopped and samuel was determined to fight her until his last breath it was at that moment that fortune began to turn in samuels favor there was a small portable television in the corner of the kitchen samuels mother sometimes liked to watch it while she was having breakfast the volume was turned down low and the news was on samuel glanced up and saw a man in a white coat talking behind him was what looked like an enormous series of pipelines samuel knew what it was the large hadron collider in switzerland he had watched a documentary about it earlier in the year and although he hadnt understood everything that had been discussed he thought it all sounded like fascinating stuff he reached for the remote control and turned up the volume the scientist whose name was professor stefan looked a bit embarrassed it became clear that he was trying to explain why the collider had been shut down samuel knew the collider hadnt worked properly the first time it was turned on and the scientists had been forced to tinker with it for a while before it began running to their satisfaction now after all the money that had been spent on it it still didnt appear to be working the way that it should well said professor stefan when the reporter pointed this fact out to him thats not entirely true it was working perfectly but then there was an um unanticipated release of unknown energy what does that mean exactly asked the reporter well to put it in laymans terms a bit flew off and now were trying to find out what it was a bit said the reporter a particle of energy said professor stefan but one that has not been encountered before and appears to show unusual characteristics what kind of characteristics said the reporter well the collider is a vacuum and therefore its sealed it simply should not be possible for anything to find its way out of there but now you think that something has we believe so it may just be a leak so were checking every inch of the collider for possible breaches as you can imagine thats a timeconsuming procedure in the meantime were going back over our systems in an effort to determine precisely what were dealing with the reporter thought over what he had just been told is there any possibility that this energy might be dangerous oh none whatsoever said professor stefan samuel thought that he seemed very sure of this for someone who didnt know what exactly the energy was and when precisely did you become aware of this energy leak asked the reporter at precisely seven thirty pm on october twentyeighth said professor stefan the collider was shut down shortly afterward samuel paused a spoonful of cornflakes suspended between the bowl and his mouth seven thirty pm on october at seven thirty pm on october samuel and boswell had been sitting on the abernathys wall when theyd heard the bang from the abernathys basement when theyd seen the blue light and smelled that nasty smell it might be a coincidence of course but for the first time samuel sensed that there could be someone out there who might be prepared to listen to him samuel sat before his computer and examined the website for cern he couldnt find a telephone number but there was a section entitled ask an expert samuel didnt know how long an expert might take to answer his question or even if what he had to say counted as a question at all he thought hard then composed his message to cern dear cern my name is samuel johnson and i am eleven years old i have reason to believe that i may have found your missing energy particle or know where it ended up i think it is in the basement of number crowley road in the town of biddlecombe england it is owned by a couple named the abernathys it is very blue and smells of rotten eggs the energy that is not biddlecombe it materialized there at precisely seven thirty pm on october i enclose a drawing of what i saw in the basement scanned into the computer for your information yours sincerely samuel johnson ps i believe mr and mrs abernathy have become possessed by demons and may be using the energy to open the gates of hell when he was finished samuel checked his spelling and went over the letter once again to make sure that he had included all the important details he had considered leaving out the bit about hell but thought it might add a sense of urgency to his message after all he didnt know how many people wrote to ask an expert every day or if there was just one expert answering the questions or a whole team in any case he thought it was important to attract cerns attention and if nothing else the mention of demons and hell was likely to make his message stand out he pressed send and his missive shot off into cyberspace he considered staying at his computer and waiting for a reply but he suspected that even if someone read his message promptly a certain amount of discussion would still be required before it was answered samuel was not about to sit around doing nothing it was halloween and he had heard mrs abernathy say that she and her fellow demons had four days to prepare the way samuel didnt know precisely what preparing the way meant but by any calculation four days from october led to november he had a terrible feeling that at some time the next day the gates of hell would begin to open so samuel went to the telephone and began making some calls it would not be true to say that samuel was unpopular at school there were some boys and girls in his class who looked at him a little oddly especially when he began talking about angels and pins but for the most part he got on pretty well with nearly everyone he was also very happy to spend time by himself though and after sharing the same small schoolroom with a bunch of kids his own age for two months he had been rather enjoying being alone during midterm his closest friends were tom hobbes and maria mayer toms father delivered milk for the local dairy where his mum also worked and marias dad worked for the telephone company samuel tom and maria had planned to go trick or treating that evening and tom and maria had been a little surprised to hear from samuel so early in the day when samuel said he had something important to tell them they were both intrigued they agreed to meet outside the pie shop in the town center and samuel with boswell in tow was already waiting for tom and maria when they arrived together shortly after one pm the pie shop was called petes pies even though pete had died many years before and his son nigel now made all of the pies but nigels pies didnt sound right and anyway everyone would have just kept calling it petes pies even if nigel had changed the name people in small towns are funny that way there were always tables and chairs outside petes pies even in winter which made it a popular place for people to meet pete and then nigel never objected to people taking a seat there even if they didnt come along with the intention of buying a pie the smell from the pie shop would cause their mouths to water and usually in less than a minute they would be inside buying a pie for later about one minute after that they would be eating the pie and considering having another maybe the appleandraspberry for dessert it was one of these same appleandraspberry pies that samuel was eating when tom and maria strolled up to his table tom was taller than samuel by a couple of inches and never really seemed to have bad days he was always in good spirits except when the school cricket team of which he was one of the star batsmen lost tom didnt mind losing at most things but he drew the line at cricket tom and samuel only ever argued on the cricket pitch samuel was a good bowler with a strong right arm but his eyesight was poor and he had trouble catching balls when fielding this meant that he was both an asset and a liability on the cricket pitch and more than one match had ended with him and tom shouting at each other at the tops of their voices still they remained friends and tom was secretly a little in awe of samuel whose mind worked in ways that tom admired even if he did not understand maria meanwhile was smaller than both of them and had very long hair that she tied in a ponytail each day with one of a selection of bows she sometimes seemed shy and quiet to those who didnt know her well but samuel knew she was very clever and very funny she just didnt like showing off maria wanted to be a scientist when she grew up and was the only person samuel and tom knew who did homework for pleasure boswell wagged his tail in greeting at the two new arrivals then returned his attention to the pie on the table he knew that samuel would share some with him eventually samuel shared nearly all of his food with boswell except chocolate because that wasnt good for boswell and gave him wind and boswell could be a smelly dog if he was fed the wrong things all right then said tom once he and maria had bought pies of their own and settled down on their seats whats the big mystery boswell finished the piece of pie that samuel had fed to him licked up the last of the crumbs and began drooling over toms shoe instead tom decided to give him some pie to distract him before boswells spit started to soak through to his socks well its like this said samuel youre probably going to have trouble believing me and im not sure how im going to prove that what i have to say is true all im asking is that you listen to me because i really need your help he was so serious that tom stopped eating for a moment and tom like boswell didnt like to stop eating without a good reason wow that sounds serious he said off you go then im listening he looked at maria who nodded we both are so samuel told them everything right up to the point at which hed sent off his message to cern when he was finished nobody spoke for a time then tom said youre barmy tom maria scolded him no really youre trying to tell us that this mrs abernathy isnt really mrs abernathy but a thing with tentacles and that in her basement is a blue hole that somehow is a tunnel to hell and tomorrow some gates are going to open in that tunnel andwhat demons are going to come out something like that said samuel calmly you are barmy repeated tom samuel turned to maria and you he asked her what do you think it is a little hard to believe said maria gently im not lying said samuel he looked at them both his face serious on my life i promise you im not lying and he paused what said maria im scared said samuel im really scared and they both believed him when he said it well said tom theres only one thing for it whats that asked maria but she already knew the answer tom grinned well just have to take a look at the abernathys house meanwhile at cern the technician who had been monitoring the ask an expert section of the website approached professor hilbert holding a printed message at the bottom of which was a drawing of a blue spiral professor he said nervously this may be nothing but xvi in which we visit the abernathy house and decide that we wouldnt want to live there it was determined that they should leave the visit to the abernathys house until the light had begun to fade so samuel and maria spent the early part of the afternoon helping tom to practice his batting when it began to grow dark they paid a brief visit to samuels house to check his email but there was no reply to his message from cern maybe theyre very busy said tom what with their big collider thing being broken its not broken said samuel well not exactly theyve shut it down while they investigate the energy leak the one that you say has turned up in the abernathys basement said tom thats a long way from switzerland theyre not swiss are they no i dont think so mr abernathy didnt sound swiss when i spoke to him mrs abernathy just smells funny then again samuel had never to his knowledge spoken to a swiss person he just suspected that swiss people didnt sound like mr abernathy who spoke with a gruff northern accent or mrs abernathy who seemed quite posh maria looked out of samuels bedroom window its getting dark now she said are you sure we should be doing this it doesnt seem right creeping around somebodys garden in the dark i mean what is it that you hope well see samuel shrugged just something something that will make you believe me and if we do believe you asked maria what then well youll know im not mad said samuel or a liar maria smiled fondly i know youd never lie to us samuel she said although you might still be mad added tom but he too was smiling well come on then i have to get home for tea or ill catch hell from my mum he realized what he had just said catch hell get it see im funny even when im not trying to be maria and samuel rolled their eyes oh please yourselves said tom some people have no sense of humor the abernathys house appeared to be empty when they reached it boswell somewhat reluctantly in tow doesnt seem like theres anybody home said tom it looks creepy said maria i know its just a normal house but maybe its because of what youve told us about the people who live there no said tom his tone subdued youre right i can sense it the hairs on the back of my neck are standing up theres something wrong here boswell senses it too said samuel and indeed boswell was whimpering the dog planted his small bottom firmly on the ground outside the garden gate as if to say right this is as far as i go if you want me to go any farther youll have to drag me samuel tied boswells leash to the garden gate wed best leave him here he said can i stay with him asked tom only half joking come on silly said maria taking tom by the arm and pulling him into the garden samuel close behind them werent you scared just a minute ago whispered tom im still scared said maria but this is interesting the expression on marias face had changed she looked excited mr hume had once said that she had the perfect brain for a scientist she was both curious and careful and once she got the scent of something that intrigued her she would pursue it right to the end samuel led them to the basement window a bare bulb glowed orange in the ceiling casting a dim light on the room they crouched down and peered inside but apart from the usual junk that accumulated in peoples basements there was nothing out of the ordinary to be seen thats where it happened said samuel the blue circle the big clawed hand all of it well its quiet now said tom mind you it smells disgusting here he was right a stink of rotten eggs hung around the basement and the area of the garden nearest it a concentrated breeze was blowing carrying the stink on it as though a hole had been bored in a wall behind which a great wind was blowing do you feel that said maria she raised her hand so that it was very close to the glass the two boys did likewise it feels like static electricity said tom he moved his hand farther forward as though to touch the glass but maria reached out to stop him no she said i dont think thats a good idea its just static said tom no said maria its not she pointed at the frame of the window there barely visible to the naked eye was the faintest blue glow maria moved on following the wall of the house wheres she off to said tom samuel didnt know but he decided to follow maria nonetheless tom not wanting to be left alone was soon trotting along behind the abernathys house stood in the center of a large garden so that there was nothing to stop someone walking from the front of the house to the back maria was pointing at the windows as she went there she said softly and there if they concentrated hard each time they looked they saw that faint blue glow around the window frames i think it might be a kind of alarm said maria theyve secured the place somehow by this time they had reached the back of the house to the left of the back door was a kitchen which was empty to the right was a living room with a tv some couches and a pair of armchairs a lamp was lit in the room casting a square of light upon the lawn together the three children made their way to the window and peered inside boswell was very unhappy at having his leash tied to a garden gate like most dogs he didnt like being tied to anything if you were tied to something it was hard to fight if a bigger dog came along and impossible to run away if fighting wasnt an option boswell was not much of a fighter to be honest he wasnt even very good at running away given his short legs and long body but if there was anything worse than having his leash tied to a garden gate it was having it tied to this particular one the big house smelled wrong to boswell it wasnt just the stink that the children had also picked up no boswells sense of smell was far more sensitive than that of any human he had twentyfive times more smell receptors than a person and he could sense odors at concentrations one hundred million times lower than a human could as he sniffed the air around the big house drawing it deep down to the receptors at the back of his snout he picked up hints of tainted meat of disease of dead things that shouldnt be touched or tasted or even sniffed for very long for fear of being sick lurking behind them all was one smell in particular one that every animal hated and feared it was the smell of burning suddenly boswell stood up he had heard something the sound of footsteps approaching one of the bad smells started to grow stronger although it was mixed up with another that wasnt quite so bad as though the notsobad smell was being used to hide the really bad one the notsobad smell was familiar to boswell although that didnt mean he liked it it was too strong and sweet and sickly it reminded him of the scent that sometimes came from mrs johnson the scent that emerged from some of the little bottles she kept in her bedroom it smelled of too many flowers even with his poor eyesight boswell was able to identify the woman as soon as she turned the corner he had already built up a picture of her using his nose and now his worst fears were confirmed it was the nasty lady the one who had brought the darkness boswell began to whine there were three people two men and a woman sitting in the living room the walls of which were covered with a strange orange mold that was spreading from the carpet and extending toward the ceiling the mold covered the chairs on which the three people were sitting as though they were rotting and their decay was slowly infecting the room they were not moving or speaking but they all had strange fixed smiles on their faces like people who had seen something that only someone with a very strange sense of humor would think was funny samuel recognized the men as mr abernathy and his friend mr renfield the woman was mrs renfield they had changed since last he had seen them they appeared fatter bloated as if by a great internal swelling he could see mr abernathy the most clearly mr abernathys skin was a graygreen color and there were blisters on it he looked so sick that samuel wondered if mr abernathy might actually be worse than sick despite the time of year the room was filled with flies and samuel knew immediately that the people in the room stank badly samuel thought he saw a fly land on one of mr abernathys eyeballs and crawl across it a black speck against the milky white of the eye mr abernathy didnt even blink it was tom who voiced what samuel had been thinking are they dead he asked as he spoke the fly buzzed away from mr abernathys eyeball at the same instant a long tongue unrolled from mr abernathys mouth like a party favor it was pink and covered with little spines that looked sharp and sticky it plucked the fly from midair then rolled back into mr abernathys mouth he chewed on the fly for a moment before swallowing it down oh i think im going to be sick said maria was that a tongue asked tom that was a tongue people dont have tongues that long things have tongues that long then they heard the sound of frantic barking from the front of the house and knew that they were in trouble as soon as boswell saw mrs abernathy he began trying to wriggle out of his collar it was never kept very tight mainly because boswells neck was so thin that no collar fit him right he tugged hard against the leash and felt the collar begin to rise up against the back of his head it hurt his ears but he didnt stop he knew that if he was still tied to the gate when the bad lady came she would hurt him and then she would hurt samuel nobody was going to hurt samuel not if boswell had anything to do with it the collar was halfway over his ears when the sound of the nasty ladys footsteps started to come faster mrs abernathy spotted the dog as soon as she rounded the corner it took her only a moment to identify it as samuel johnsons pet oh you naughty boy she whispered you naughty naughty little boy she began to run boswell risked a glance to his left and saw the nasty lady drawing nearer he gave a final hard tug against the collar and felt it pull free almost taking his ears with it he barked alternating glances between the path leading into the garden of the big house and the bad lady he kept hoping that samuel and his friends would come yet they didnt run he barked nasty lady run still there was no sign of them he looked to his left and saw the nasty ladys shape begin to change there were things moving beneath her coat suddenly the material began to tear and long pink feelers burst through the holes each one ending in sharp pincers that snapped at the cold air one extended itself toward him the pincers making a clicking sound and dripping foulsmelling liquid on the ground instinctively he snapped back at it and it withdrew but only for a moment it rose up like a snake about to strike boswell sensed the danger with no other choice he put his tail between his legs and ran away as fast as his little legs would carry him he thought he felt something graze his coat but he didnt look back not until he had reached the corner he hid under a car and peered out from behind the wheels the nasty lady stood for a moment at the garden gate the long pink tentacles waving against the night sky then turned away and headed into the garden seconds later boswell heard a terrible sound one so sharp and piercing that it hurt his ears it was too high pitched for a human to detect but mrs abernathy wasnt trying to contact any human she was alerting her fellow demons xvii in which mrs abernathy changes her plans tom peered round the corner of the house and saw mrs abernathy enter the garden and close the gate carefully behind her the tentacles moved in the still evening air the moonlight catching the fluid that dripped from their pincers tom counted twelve of them on the ground at mrs abernathys feet lay boswells empty collar mrs abernathy took three steps forward then stopped she cocked her head to one side as though listening for something but she did not move any closer to the house she was waiting guarding the gate tom ran back to where samuel and maria were waiting beneath the window were in trouble he said theres a woman in the garden with tentacles sticking out of her back mrs abernathy said samuel what about boswell theres no sign of him his collar is there but its empty samuel looked worried she couldnt have he began to say then trailed off he didnt want to utter the words didnt want to think about what mrs abernathy might have done to his dog seconds later he heard boswells bark it sounded farther away than before but it was definitely him hes okay said samuel yeah but were not said tom if she recognized boswell shell know that youre here samuel swallowed hard she doesnt know you and maria are with me i could distract her so you two can get away tom looked at samuel with something approaching admiration then hit him hard on the arm ow said samuel what was that for for being stupid said tom were not going to leave you here alone suddenly marias hand was pushed against his mouth silencing him she put a finger to her lips then withdrew it and pointed at the rectangle of light from the window the shadow of a man could now be seen against it they remained very still hardly daring to breathe the shadow began to alter as they watched eight spiny limbs like spider legs emerged from it then the shadow turned and began to recede as whoever or whatever it was moved away from the window we have to make a run for it said samuel we cant go out the way we came in said tom that womans guarding the gate and we cant go over the garden wall said maria its too high now noises were coming from inside the house they heard a vase break and then shambling footsteps as though someone who was having trouble walking was approaching the back door to their left tom saw two plastic boxes filled with empty wine bottles ready for recycling do you think you could hit those wine bottles with a stone he asked samuel if i had a stone said samuel tom gestured to samuels right where there was a small rockery dotted with plants samuel immediately reached for a stone that was roughly the size of a cricket ball took a breath and threw it overarm at the boxes of bottles the stone landed slap bang in the middle of them breaking the necks of the longest and scattering glass on the ground now said samuel they ran to the right past the rockery and along the side of the house from behind them came the sound of the back door opening but by then they were already at the corner house the front gate before them mrs abernathy was gone and when maria risked a glance she saw the shape of a woman moving quickly away from them and toward the other end of the house they took their chance and sprinted for the gate leaping over the flowerbeds and the bushes that had been carefully tended by mr abernathy before he was taken over by a thing with no appreciation for the finer points of gardening tom was bringing up the rear when his foot caught on a length of trailing ivy and he stumbled then fell samuel and maria stopped at the gate maria preparing to go back and help tom when mrs abernathy alerted by the noise appeared at the side of the house bad children she said you shouldnt trespass on other peoples property two of the tentacles grew longer than the rest then shot at speed toward tom as he tried to get to his feet he could see how sharp their pincers were and could smell the stuff that dripped like spittle from them as they came he was raising his hand to protect himself when something slashed through the air before him it was a garden rake which caught the tentacles a hard blow and drove them to the ground they remained pinned there beneath the rakes teeth writhing feebly and spraying thick black blood on the lawn mrs abernathy screamed in shock and pain as maria let go of the rake and pulled tom to his feet come on said maria and the three children accompanied by a happy and very relieved boswell disappeared into the dusk mrs abernathy walked across the lawn her face contorted with rage and agony the tentacles had retreated back into her body except for the two that the horrid girl had pierced with the rake mrs abernathy knelt down and pulled the rake free then tossed it away slowly like wounded animals the tentacles grew smaller withdrawing into her flesh where they left a series of small holes that bled black against her ruined coat mr renfield shuffled toward her eight spiny legs now receding into his body and what looked like mandibles disappearing back into his mouth the same bland humorless smile was still on his face behind him mrs renfield and mr abernathy appeared followed by a cloud of flies mr abernathy stopped beside his wife he turned to look at her and she hit him so hard across the face with the back of her hand that his neck broke and his head hung at a strange angle on his shoulders he raised his hands and tried to put his head back into place but it wouldnt stay eventually he gave up and left it hanging it didnt seem to cause him any great discomfort and his smile remained unchanged you fool said mrs abernathy now three of them know about us mrs renfield joined her what shall we do she asked kill them we cant wait any longer said mrs abernathy we have to begin but all is not ready enough will have gathered said mrs abernathy the gates will open and the first will pour through they will prepare the way for the great malevolence and he will finish what they have begun go i will join you in a moment mr and mrs renfield moved away followed by mr abernathy and his wobbling head mrs abernathy strolled to the garden gate and looked toward the direction in which the three children and the dog had run she saw the ghosts of them still hanging in the air before they drifted away like fog perhaps the others were right she thought it was not yet time the great malevolence had wanted to enter this new world in glory provoking awe and terror as he came his demonic army arrayed behind him instead their attack upon the world of men would commence more slowly as the demons began to pour through the portal would grow larger they would draw the energy that they needed from the collider it would only be a matter of hours before the gates would melt away and the great malevolence would be unleashed upon the earth a small figure wearing a devils horns and mask appeared before her trick or treat said a voice from behind the mask mrs abernathy regarded him curiously then began to smile the smile turned to a fearsome terrible laughter she put the back of her hand to her mouth and said how delightful oh this is just perfect like small boys the world over the small boy behind the mask whose name was michael didnt care much for things that were delightful or grownups who seemed to find things funny when they werent funny at all look are you going to give me something or arent you he asked impatiently oh ill give you something she said ill give you all something and it will be the last thing you will ever receive ill give you death no sweeties then said the small boy mrs abernathys laughter faded and she squatted down before him he saw a faint blue glow to her eyes it grew brighter and brighter until there was nothing in the womans eye sockets but cold blue light that made him wince with pain when she opened her mouth he smelled the foulness of her insides no sweeties said mrs abernathy no sweeties ever again she watched the small boy run away and thought flee flee while you can but there will be no escape not from me and not from my master xviii in which the portal opens wide mrs johnson sat on the couch smiling awkwardly at her visitor whose name was dr planck dr planck was small and dark with a pointed beard and blackrimmed glasses mrs johnson had made him tea and offered him a biscuit now she was trying to understand why he was with her in the first place all she knew was that it had something to do with samuel these things always did dr planck worked at the local university as part of the experimental particle physics research program and had been involved with cern for a number of years when the message from switzerland about samuels email had come through to him he had rushed to biddlecombe he wasnt certain that a small boy could be entirely helpful to them but there was something about his drawing and the description of the rotten egg smell that had caught the attention of the scientists at cern now here he was drinking tea and eating bourbon cream biscuits and trying to establish if mrs johnsons son might just have given them the help they had been seeking samuel hasnt done anything wrong has he said mrs johnson no not at all said dr planck he just sent us a very interesting email and wed like to talk to him about it by us you mean the cern people said mrs johnson thats right has samuel solved one of the mysteries of the universethen dr planck smiled politely and nibbled on his biscuit not exactly he said tell me what do you know about the people at number mrs abernathy stood in the basement mr abernathy and the renfields behind her a pinpoint of blue light hung in the air pulsing softly mrs renfield growled in disapproval it was there all along she said to mrs abernathy and yet you hid it from us you did not need to know said mrs abernathy who are you to decide such things mrs abernathy turned on her for an instant her mouth grew so large that it threatened to engulf her entire head revealing row upon row of jagged teeth the huge jaws snapped at mrs renfield who staggered backward in alarm then almost as soon as it had revealed itself the monstrous mouth was gone and mrs abernathy was restored to her former beauty you will keep a civil tongue in your head or you will find yourself deprived of both warned mrs abernathy remember to whom you are speaking i have the ear of our master and i am his emissary here on earth any disrespect shown to me will be communicated to him and the punishment will be great mrs renfield hung her head quaking at the thought of what punishments might befall her she belonged to a lower order of demons than mrs abernathy ftnref it is generally agreed that there are three orders of demons a book named le dragon rouge the red dragon possibly written in the sixteenth century classified the demons of hell in three tiers from officers to generals books like le dragon rouge are known as grimoires and to have power they must be written in red ink and some say bound in human skin which means that they probably wont be stocked by your local bookstore yet she was envious of mrs abernathys power and her closeness to the great malevolence for that which is evil is always jealous and seeks constantly to advance itself now her display of anger had left open the possibility of retribution from their master because mrs abernathy would surely tell him of mrs renfields impertinence but if she could overcome mrs abernathy and take her place if she and not mrs abernathy could pave the way for their master then she would be rewarded not punished and so she made her move her jaws widened and from between her lips her spider chelicerae emerged two appendages ending in hollow points each loaded with poison she approached mrs abernathy from behind her eyes fixed on the pale skin at the base of mrs abernathys neck suddenly mrs renfield froze unable to advance she felt her throat tighten as though a hand had gripped it and was slowly choking her mrs abernathy turned her eye ablaze with blue fire you foolish creature she said now you will suffer pain for all eternity mrs abernathy waved her fingers in front of mrs renfields face the chelicerae continued to grow from mrs renfields mouth but now they began to curl down toward her own neck mrs renfields eyes widened in panic but she could do nothing to stop what was about to occur the twin points pierced her skin and she began to pump poison into her own system her eyes bulged and her face blackened until at last she fell to the floor her bodyjerked once before it turned to dust and smoke mrs abernathy returned her attention to the blue light master said mrs abernathy your servant calls the blue light grew larger and the basement became colder mrs abernathys breath plumed whitely her fingertips were so chilled that they began to hurt and then a voice spoke it seemed to come at once from everywhere and nowhere echoing around the basement it was deep and sibilant like the hissing of a giant snake in a dank cave yessssss it said speak master said mrs abernathy again and her voice trembled even now after she had spent so long in the presence of this great evil so close to an eternity that the difference hardly mattered it still had the power to terrify her we must act now we can wait no longer why there has been a difficulty said mrs abernathy choosing her words carefully our presence has become known to whom a child why was this child not dealt with we tried he was lucky now he has shared his knowledge with others there was silence mrs abernathy could almost feel her masters rage building you disappoint me he said at last there will be a reckoning for this yes master mrs abernathy bowed her head as though the great malevolence were standing before her ready to visit his wrath upon her so be it said the voice let it begin but before they could proceed any further the doorbell rang deep in the bowels of cern the chief scientists were gathered in professor stefans office is there any word yet from dr planck asked professor stefan professor hilbert glanced at his watch he should be with the boy by now he said if its some kind of joke ill have that childs hide said professor stefan he reached for his pen if only to give him something to do with his hands the pen lay close to the edge of his desk but before he could get his fingers to it the pen dropped to the floor professor stefan looked at it curiously thats odd he said just as he began to feel the vibrations running through his desk a great humming filled the entire facility and all the lights dimmed for a moment computer screens throughout the facility began displaying huge amounts of data aramaic mixed with binary code whats happening said professor stefan but he already knew somehow the collider had started up again mrs abernathy answered the door standing on the step was a small man with a pointed beard he was sucking on the frame of a pair of darkrimmed glasses mrs abernathy he said yes im dr planck id like to talk with you for a moment if its convenient actually said mrs abernathy im rather busy right now dr planck sniffed the air he smelled rotten eggs then he noticed a faint blue glow coming from the basement a light that also seemed to be flickering on the window frames of the house and around the door a wind blew in his face its force increasing as it did so the blue glow became brighter what are you doing said dr planck this isnt right run said mrs abernathy what i said run her eyes filled with cold fire her mouth opened and the light shone like a beam from it it felt like ice on dr plancks skin he ran the basement of number was filled with a vast swirling mass of light and dark of blue beams and a blackness that was so thick as to be almost tangible little tendrils of electricity flickered deep within it like bolts of lightning against the night sky then shot out to strike mr abernathy and mr renfield they began to change shape shedding their human skins and assuming once again their true demonic forms mr abernathy looked like a gray toad with unblinking eyes that protruded from his head on long stalks mr renfield became spiderlike his body covered with spiny hairs eight black eyes appearing on his head two large ones at the front two smaller ones on either side then four more behind eight long jointed legs burst from his torso each ending in a sharp claw yet he remained standing on his human legs which were stronger and thicker than the rest pointed fangs burst from his jaws their tips glistening with poison mrs abernathy joined them but she remained unchanged the blue fire in her eyes aside she did not want to assume her true shape not yet although she was restricted by this human body it had its uses if necessary it would allow her to move freely through the world of men during the early stages of the attack only when victory was secured did she intend to reveal herself as she really was the walls of the house began to shudder dust fell from the ceiling of the basement and old paint cans and boxes of nails dropped from shelves and spilled their contents on the floor the mortar between the bricks crumbled and the bricks started to float away as the house came apart more tendrils of blue light appeared shooting through the gaps and disappearing into the ground the wind grew stronger blowing from one universe into another across the portal that was now opening mrs abernathy watched as the gates those hated prison bars began to glow white hot dripping molten metal as her master harnessed the power of the collider to begin to free himself now the first of the demons appeared they were simple entities little more than skulls with black wings their mouths appeared to have too many teeth so that the top and bottom rows were snagged and uneven yet sharp as needles there were four of them and they hovered in the air before mrs abernathy their jaws snapping and their wings flapping i have work for you she said she reached out to touch the nearest one imparting through her fingers knowledge of the three children the ones who had hurt her and forced her to appear weak before her master and the little man with the beard who she sensed meant her harm find them she said find them all and tear them apart samuel maria and tom were in samuels bedroom sitting in front of samuels computer and staring at the email message that samuel had accessed through his google account samuels mother stood over them the message from dr planck read very interested in your email i will come to your house this evening at five thirty to discuss it hope this is convenient if there is a problem i can be contacted at the number below he waited here for a while then said he wanted to take a look at the abernathys house said mrs johnson what have you been telling people samuel what ive been trying to explain to you all along said samuel the abernathys are about to do something terrible and they have to be stopped this time his mother didnt contradict him listening to dr planck she had begun to remember her encounter with mrs abernathy at the supermarket and how frightened she had been to see samuel talking to her by the churchyard even if she hadnt understood why at the time now she knew that samuel was telling the truth mrs abernathy was bad mrs abernathy was in fact quite horrid there was a cell phone number with the message using his home phone samuel dialed the number the phone was answered on the second ring hello said a mans voice he sounded out of breath is that dr planck asked samuel indeed it is is that samuel yes i got your email samuel im rather busy right now oh yes it appears that im being chased by a flying skull before samuel could say anything more they were cut off mrs johnson looked worried is everything all right she asked samuel tried redialing the number but there was no tone he handed the phone to tom its gone dead what did he say that he was being chased by a flying skull oh said tom thats not good but before he could say anything else they heard the sound of glass breaking from somewhere downstairs what was that said mrs johnson it sounded like one of your windows breaking said tom he grabbed samuels cricket bat from beside the bedroom door they listened but could hear no further noise slowly they advanced down the hallway toward the stairs tom in the lead careful said mrs johnson oh samuel i wish your dad was here they were halfway to the stairs when a white object flew round the corner and then stopped in midair its wings flapping just hard enough to keep it from falling to the floor its jaws never stopped snapping opening wide enough for a moment to take a mans fist before the twin rows of sharp teeth closed on each other again two unblinking black eyes were set like dark jewels in its bony sockets what is that said mrs johnson it looks like a skull with wings said samuel whats it doing in our house said mrs johnson it was maria who spoke i think its looking for us as if in response the wings of the chattering skull began to beat faster it changed its position slightly then shot forward so fast that it was almost a blur samuel maria and mrs johnson dived to the floor but tom remained standing instinctively he drew back his bat and struck the flying skull when it was about two feet from his face there was a loud crack and the skull fell to the floor its jaws still moving but with most of its teeth now knocked out one wing had broken off while the other was beating feebly against the carpet tom stood over it and hit it once again with the bat the skull broke into fragments the jaws ceased snapping and its eyes went from black to a milky gray tom shouted maria look out a second skull appeared at the end of the hallway followed by a third the three children and mrs johnson backed away until they came to the wall tom took a few steps forward tapped his bat on the carpet and then took up a stance that would have been frowned upon on a cricket field the bat raised to shoulder level ready to strike tom said mrs johnson pulling samuel and maria into the nearest bedroom please be careful i know what im doing said tom right then he shouted at the skulls come and have a go if you think youre hard enough the two skulls flew toward him at the same moment one traveling slightly faster and lower than the other tom crouched and caught the lead skull with a perfect swing the bat striking so hard that the skull immediately shattered into three pieces but tom wasnt quick enough to destroy the second skull as well he was forced to drop to the floor as it zoomed over his head and hit the wall leaving a mark on the paintwork and dislodging a chunk of plaster it seemed a little dazed by the collision but recovered quickly and was preparing to attack again when samuel flung a blue towel over it blinding it now tom shouted samuel tom brought the bat down as hard as he could on the top of the skull it dropped to the floor still covered by the towel and he struck at it until he had virtually flattened it samuel maria and mrs johnson joined him and all four of them stared at the remains of the skulls that now littered the hallway well said samuel i think its begun xix in which assorted foul things begin to arrive and nurd discovers the joys of motoring nurd felt his fingertips begin to tingle again but this time he was ready he was wearing an assortment of rusty armor some of the few possessions he had been permitted to retain in exile to protect himself from any unseen eventualities as he was about to be torn out of one world and hurled into another this meant just about every possible eventuality was unseen only his head remained uncovered because the helmet no longer fit correctly maybe your head has swollen wormwood had suggested somewhat unhelpfully as he tried for the third and last time to force the helmet over nurds ears nurd had responded by hitting wormwood hard on the head with his scepter now your head is swollen nurd had replied leave the helmet it must have taken a dent the tingling spread to the rest of his body it was time nurd wondered if he would get to see samuel again he hoped so samuel was the only creature who had ever been kind to nurd and the memory of the boys company made the demon smile he was determined to become friends with samuel if he could avoid being crushed by household appliances or hit by trucks goodbye wormwood said nurd id like to say that ill miss you but i wont with that he blinked out of existence leaving wormwood alone once again good riddance said wormwood i never liked you anyway he looked around at the great wasteland which stretched emptily in every direction he felt very lonely at cern the collider was generating impacts at a startling rate creating a constant stream of explosions as the collisions released their energy the collider filled with more blue light in the main control room professor hilbert and his team were frantically trying to turn the collider off to no avail were not in control of it he told professor stefan who was pacing anxiously in the manner of someone who sees his job about to go up in smoke given the amount of energy being given off by the collider it wasnt the only thing in danger of doing so if we arent then who is asked professor stefan professor hilbert reached for the volume button on the nearest computer and turned it up to full the control room filled with the sound of whispering many voices speaking in an assortment of ancient tongues despite their panic all activity ceased as the scientists listened their faces betraying confusion yet also curiosity after all this was fascinating dangerous and very possibly fatal to all of mankind but undoubtedly fascinating then a single voice rose above the babble a deep voice filled with eons of loneliness and jealousy and rage it spoke just two words it said it begins i think said professor hilbert his face palethat he is nurd popped into existence again in the world of men just at the point where his body felt as though it were about to be crushed to the size of a pea he immediately began running wary of standing still for too long after what had happened to him on his previous visits he got three steps before the ground disappeared beneath him and he fell down an open manhole and into a sewer there was a wail then a splash followed by a long smelly silence finally nurds voice spoke from the darkness it said somewhat unhappily i appear to be covered in poo the portal in the abernathys basement was growing larger with every minute the flying skulls had been followed by more demonic forms most were still primitive and not very smart but some of them were big and strong and all of them were frightening to look at mrs abernathy watched them stumble forth into the halloween night to sow terror a pair of pig demons their snouts moist with mucus great boar tusks on either side their little eyes glinting with menace three winged creatures with the bodies of lizards and the heads of beautiful women their fingers tipped with nails of steel and a quartet of horned devils their bodies entirely black from shoveling coals into the fires of hell their eyes transformed into red orbs from centuries of staring into the flames there were creatures that looked like fossils come to life their insides protected by hard exoskeletons carried along on short plated legs others were warped versions of earthly animals as though the things emerging had once caught a brief but imperfect glimpse of life on this planet goatheaded men with long curved horns beasts with the heads of dinosaurs and the bodies of mammals and winged crocodiles with the tails of lions and then there were those that bore no resemblance to any living thing that had ever existed pale nightmarish visions consisting of little more than legs and bone and teeth with no urge other than to consume go said mrs abernathy begin our masters work kill and destroy until there is no building left standing and nothing left alive turn this world to blood and ash make it smell of death ftnref mrs abernathy did not like the smell of earth her demonic senses made her acutely sensitive to all pleasant scents so that she was even aware that the milky way itself smelled bad to her actually astronomers who were recently sifting through thousands of signals from sagittarius b a big dust cloud at the center of our galaxy found a substance there called ethyl formate which is the chemical responsible for the flavor of raspberries and the smell of rum the drink popular with pirates therefore our galaxy tastes a bit of raspberries and smells of rum which is nice they lumbered away and mrs abernathy resumed her vigil at the portal through the mists she could see more forms approaching more demons sent to prepare the way for the great malevolence soon the gates would disintegrate entirely and then their master would be free at last free to lead his great army into this world nurd climbed from the sewer unpleasant substances dripping from his armor he had also managed to hurt his head and there was a large lump behind his left ear but at least he was still in one piece he looked to his right and instantly forgot his aches and the nasty smells that were troubling his nostrils and his plans to take over this place and rule it in front of him was a sign that read biddlecombe car sales it stood on the roof of a building filled with a number of the small fast metal things that ran on wheels one of them a blue one with stripes along the sides was particularly lovely nurd ran toward it with great joy and smacked his face hard against the glass of the showroom he stumbled back his hand pressed to his nose it was bleeding the pain made his eyes water right said nurd thats it no more mister nice demon using an ironbooted foot he smashed the glass somewhere a bell began to sound but nurd ignored it he laid his hand on the fast blue stripy thing and stroked it lovingly concentrating hard trying to come to an understanding of what he was touching car he thought engine fuel keys porsche he explored its workings in his mind until they became clear to him there was a locked box in a small office at the back of the dealership when he touched it he knew that it held the keys to the cars he ripped the door from it and instantly found the ones he wanted porsche mine minutes later with a screech of tires and the smell of burning rubber nurd was in car heaven xx in which it becomes increasingly clear that the demons are not going to have things all their own way all across the town some very strange things were starting to happen while tom used flying skulls for cricket practice a pair of old ladies were called rude names by a darkeyed entity that appeared to be living in a drain one of the old ladies poked at it with her umbrella until it gave up and went away still calling out rude names some of which she had never heard before but which she was certain were meant to be offensive in her statement to local police some time later she claimed that it looked and smelled like a big diseased fish two men on their way to a halloween party dressed as schoolboysonly grownups think that its fun to dress up in school uniforms young people who have no choice in the matter dont think its fun at allreported that a hunched shape resembling a lump of frog spawn albeit frog spawn with arms like trumpets was squatting on the roof of the hardware shop and absorbing pigeons a taxi or something that had taken the form of a taxi stopped to pick up a young lady on benson road and subsequently tried to eat her she escaped by spraying perfume into its mouth at least she told a puzzled street sweeper i think it was its mouth meanwhile in a house on blackwood grove stephanie the babysitter so unbeloved of samuel heard noises coming from the wardrobe in her bedroom she approached it warily wondering if a mouse might have become trapped inside but when she opened the door she saw not a mouse but a very long very thick snake a snake oddly enough with elephant ears boo said the snake er i mean hiss stephanie promptly fainted for a moment the snake looked pleased or as pleased as a demon in the form of a snake can look until it noticed that the girl had not been alone there was now a large young man staring angrily into the wardrobe the demon tried to discover some creature of which the young man was frightened in order to transform itself into the relevant animal but the young man didnt appear to be afraid of anything instead he reached out and grabbed the demon by the neck its the ears isnt it said the demon i just cant seem to get those right the young man leaned forward and whispered something threateningly into one of the ears in question you know said the demon in reply i dont think you can flush something all the way to china from here as it turned out the demon was right you couldnt flush something all the way from biddlecombe to china still he had to give the young man credit he certainly tried over on lovecraft grove marias mum mrs mayer was washing the teatime dishes when she saw movement among the rosebushes in her back garden the rosebushes were her husbands pride and joy mr mayer was not a man with very green fingers in fact he was the kind of man who by and large couldnt even grow weeds and yet something strange and wonderful had happened as soon as he put his mind to the cultivation of roses when he and mrs mayer had bought the house on lovecraft grove there had been a solitary sadlooking rosebush at the end of the back garden somehow it had survived neglect bad weather and the deaths of the other rosebushes that had judging by the rotting stumps once grown there mr mayer seemed to find a soul mate in that rosebush and was determined to save it mrs mayer didnt hold out much hope given her husbands previous forays into horticulture but she held her tongue and did not suggest that he try a cactus instead so mr mayer had bought every book on the cultivation of roses that he could find he consulted experts and haunted garden centers and lavished the little rosebush mrs mayer sometimes felt with more care and attention than he did his wife and children and the rosebush began to flourish mrs mayer could still recall the morning that they had woken to find the first bud poking tentatively from its branches soon to be followed by others that burst into bright red bloom it was the only time she had ever seen her husband cry his eyes shone and a pair of big salty tears rolled down his cheeks and she believed that she had loved him more in that moment than ever before over the years other bushes had been added to the garden mr mayer had even begun hybridizing creating strange new flowers of his own now it was the experts who came to mr mayer and he would make them mugs of strong tea and they would spend hours in the garden in all weathers examining the rosebushes mr mayer was generous with both his expertise and the flowers themselves and rarely did a visitor leave the garden without a cutting from one of the roses in his hand mr mayer would watch them go happy in the knowledge that the sisters and brothers of his roses would soon flourish in strange new gardens only one bush was not permitted to be touched and that was the original one that mr mayer had found in the garden now big and strong its flowers were the brightest and prettiest in the beds it was mr mayers pride and joy if he could have taken it to bed with him each night to keep it warm in winter then he would have even if it meant being pricked occasionally by its thorns that was how much mr mayer loved the rosebush now there were shapes moving through the beds it was foggy out so mrs mayer could not discern precise forms but they looked big teenage trickortreaters she thoughtpretending to be monsters silly sods her husband would have their hides barry she shouted bareeeeee oooh hed teach them a lesson make no mistake about that upstairs the mayers son christopher was putting together a model aircraft at the desk by his bedroom window actually he was sort of putting it together he had been distracted by a message from his sister on his cell phone it had been a bit garbled but a few words had stood out those words had been monsters hell demonic horde and warn mum and dad christopher had not of course warned his mum and dad he might have been younger than his sister but he wasnt stupid if he started babbling about demons and hell to his dad hed be locked up or at the very least given a sound telling off still maria had sounded very serious about it all if it was a joke shed clearly been doing her best to convince her brother otherwise he was mulling over all this and wondering how he was going to separate two parts of a tank that had accidentally stuck to each other when he caught sight of the figures in the rose garden christophers eyesight was very keen and aided by a brief break in the fog he had a different impression from his mum of the beings currently trampling his fathers beloved bushes they werent trickortreaters not unless trickortreaters had somehow found a way to grow seven feet tall add spectacular horns to their heads and contrive to make their eyes glow a deep disturbing red crikey he said aloud he knew that maria hadnt been lying maria never lied it was the demonic horde there were really were demons here bar eeeeeeeeeeeee mrs mayer called for the third time just as her son burst into the kitchen mum he said its not now christopher said mrs mayer there are people trampling around in your dads rose garden she walked to the end of the stairs and shouted barry im talking to you what is it came an irritated voice from upstairs im in the bathroom theres someone in your rose garden i said its not people mum christopher interrupted its things its the demonic horde the what the demonic horde oh she walked to the kitchen door barry christopher says the demonic horde are in your rose garden they must be a band or something what in my rose garden they heard scuffling from above and a toilet flushing seconds later mr mayer appeared at the top of the stairs fixing the belt on his trousers i hope you washed your hands said mrs mayer washed my hands said mr mayer i know what ill do with my hands christophers dad was a big man who had boxed at the amateur level until he started being knocked down too often for his liking he now worked for the telephone company and christopher and his mum had once passed in the car while his father and another man who was nearly as big were together lifting wooden telephone poles unaided by machinery it was one of the most impressive sights christopher had ever seen unfortunately while mr mayer might have been the equal of most men and was still pretty good with his fists christopher didnt believe that he was fully aware of the threat currently making its way toward the house from the direction of the rose garden dad he said i think you should hang on for a moment hang on said his father incredulously hang on there are roses at stake son nobody and i mean nobody messes with my roses thats just it said christopher his frustration growing didnt anyone in this family listen its not a body its a but it was too late his dad had flung open the back door and was preparing to unleash the full force of his rage upon the unfortunates who had trespassed on the most sacred patch of his little empire his face was bright red and his mouth was open but no sound was coming out instead he was staring at the enormous demon standing five feet away from him it looked like a hairy black yak that had managed to stand up on its hind legs and modify its hooves with hooked claws along the way it had clearly decided that chewing grass was infinitely less fun than chewing something much meatier so its blunt vegetarian molars had been replaced with sharp white tearing teeth its eyes were bright red and smoke was pouring from its nostrils it drew back its lips from its teeth and growled at mr mayer right said mr mayer well well say no more about it then he closed the door and said in a very small voice run sorry barry said mrs mayer whose view of what lay on the other side of the door had been blocked by her husband and who was still under the impression that something needed to be done about the trickortreaters in their back garden run said mr mayer in a slightly louder voice then run a heavy body hit the back door very hard rattling it in its frame mr mayer grabbed his wife with one hand his son with the other and dragged them into the hallway just as the door burst from its hinges and landed on the kitchen floor mrs mayer looked over her shoulder and screamed but her scream was drowned out by a bellowing from behind them its okay love said mr mayer slamming the kitchen door although he wasnt entirely sure how much good that would do given what had just happened to the back door dont be frightened he didnt know why he was telling his wife not to be frightened as there seemed a perfectly good reason to be very frightened but that was what one did at times like this frightened said mrs mayer yanking herself free from her husbands grasp and storming into the living room im not frightened thats a new kitchen that is im not just going to stand by while some bull thing destroys it she moved with determination to the fireplace and picked up a poker mum said christopher its a demon i dont think a poker will hurt it it will where im going to put it said mrs mayer mr mayer looked at christopher and shrugged you have to stop her dad said christopher i think id rather face the demon said mr mayer as his wife pushed past him you know your mum when she has her mind set on something he grabbed a pair of coal tongs and followed his wife from behind the kitchen door came another bellow and the sound of dishes smashing on the tiled floor mrs mayer entered the kitchen to find the demon standing amid the wreckage of her secondbest crockery right you said mrs mayer thats quite enough of that the demon turned bared its teeth and caught a poker straight between the eyes it staggered slightly then seemed about to recover itself when the next blow sent it to its knees meanwhile a second demon smaller than the first had just entered through the back door mr mayer caught it by the snout with the coal tongs and twisted hard the demon let out a pained howl as mr mayer forced it backward and then holding on to the tongs with his left hand began to bang the demon across the head with a dustbin lid thats crash for smash messing thud around whack with thump my whomp roses when he had finished the demon lay unmoving upon the ground the red light faded from its eyes before disappearing entirely in the kitchen mrs mayer was growing tired of hitting the demon with the poker which was just as well as it had stopped moving some time before and its eyes had also gone dark mr mayer stood in the yard the tongs in one hand the dustbin lid in the other like a knight of old albeit one who couldnt afford proper weapons from the rose garden two more demons watched him warily as their fallen comrades began to disappear in wisps of foulsmelling purple smoke now listen here said mr mayer im going to count to five and by then youd better be off those roses or youll get what your friends got one while the demons had no idea what mr mayer was saying they were smart enough to understand what he meant two he began moving in their direction mrs mayer appeared behind him brandishing the poker the demons exchanged a look and the universal nod of those who have decided that it would be a smart thing to make themselves very scarce as soon as demonically possible they squatted down and with a single leap propelled themselves over the sixfoothigh garden wall then not to put too fine a point on it scarpered mr mayer walked to the rose garden where he stared down upon his beloved bushes now trampled into the dirt only one remained standing the original bush it had survived everything that man and nature could throw at it and it wasnt about to be crushed by any horde demonic or otherwise mr mayer lay down his tong sword and dustbin lid shield and patted its bare branches fondly its all right little one he said well start again come spring xxi in which the verger is assaulted and a very unpleasant person comes back to life the vicar and verger were preparing the church of sttimidus for the following days early morning service when they heard what sounded like a brick dislodging from the stonework high above their heads and falling to the ground outside both men looked a little concerned as well they might the church was very old and in a poor state of repair reverend ussher was always worried about the roof falling in or the brickwork collapsing now it seemed that his worst fears were coming true what was that he asked the verger a slate falling it sounded a bit heavier than a slate said mr berkeley who was a fat little man both the vicar and the verger were fat little men they had played tweedledum and tweedledee in the local drama societys version of alice in wonderland earlier that year and very good they were too the two men went to the front door of the church and unlocked it they were about to step outside when a small stunned stone gargoyle staggered from a nearby holly bush its heavy wings beating slowly it was a most ugly creature more so even than the average gargoyle bishop bernard the bad had supervised its creation just as he had every other detail of the churchs construction this explained why it was a dark gloomy building and why all of the faces and creatures carved on its stonework were hideous and scary the vicar and verger watched openmouthed as the gargoyle rubbed its head small streaks of blue lightning flashed across its body it coughed once and spat out what looked like old pigeon feathers the gargoyle was very confused it had wings but it didnt seem able to fly when it had come to life the first thing it had done was attempt to soar elegantly into the air unfortunately things made out of stone dont tend to soar terribly well so the gargoyle had simply dropped off its perch even though it wasnt very intelligent it knew the difference between flying and falling it now also knew the difference between landing and just hitting the ground very hard more gargoyles each one uglier than the last began to descend upon the church lawn one of them struck a tree and broke on impact but most seemed to survive the drop more or less intact once they had recovered from their shock they began to converge on the main door of the church where reverend ussher and mr berkeley were standing rooted to the spot in amazement they might have remained that way too had the verger not been hit on the side of the head with a sharp piece of masonry oh youre in trouble now said a voice mr berkeley looked to his left and saw that the faces carved into the stonework of the church had also come to life and the head of a monk with a pair of hands supporting his chin was talking to him at least the hands should have been supporting his chin but one of them had clearly just thrown a piece of brickwork at the vergers head the verger tapped the vicars shoulder the monk on the wall is talking to us he said oh said the vicar he tried to sound surprised but couldnt quite manage it oi said the stone monk fatties i said youre in trouble now why would that be asked the vicar tearing his eyes from the approaching gargoyles end of the world said the stone monk hell is opening up the big bad is coming the great malevolence wouldnt want to be in your shoes he doesnt like humans the stone monk seemed to consider something for a moment actually he doesnt like anyone but especially not humans i say said the vicar youre part of the churchs stonework arent you supposed to be on our side nah said the stone monk infused with the bishops evil we are couldnt be nice if we tried the bishops evil said reverend ussher he thought about that for a moment until another piece of masonry was picked from the church and thrown hard at the verger who did a little skip in order to avoid it oooh said the monk tubbys a dancer youre a nasty piece of stonework said the verger the monk stuck its fingers in its ears and blew a raspberry at him sticks and stones tubby it said sticks and stones one of the gargoyles reached the vicars foot opened its mouth and bit down hard fortunately the vicar had been working in his garden that afternoon and was still wearing his favorite steeltoed work boots the gargoyle lost its fangs and immediately looked a bit sorry for itself inside said reverend ussher quickly he and the verger retreated into the church and locked the door outside they could hear gargoyles beating against the wood and scratching at the lock but the door was very old and very thick and it would take more than a bunch of foothigh stone monsters to break it down what do we do now asked the verger well call the police said the vicar and whatll we tell them that the church is under siege from gargoyles said the vicar as if this was the most obvious thing in the world right said the verger thatll work but before he could say anything else he was distracted by another sound as of one stone rubbing against another coming from the little room to the right of the main altar used mainly to store old candlesticks spare chairs and the vergers broken bicycle the room was kept unlocked since there was little in it that anyone would be bothered to steal the floor was made entirely of stone but one of the slabs had a name on it and it was this slab that was now moving up and down as though something was pushing at it from beneath after almost seven hundred years bishop bernard the bad had woken up xxii in which the forces of law and order take an interest in nurd nurd was alternating between jubilation and absolute terror he had discovered a crucial detail about fast cars they can go fast when he touched a foot to the accelerator the porsche shot off like a speeding bullet and nurds braking technique like his driving left a lot to be desired the first time nurd hit the brake he bashed his face against the windshield since he had neglected to fasten his seat belt now his already injured nose had swollen painfully and there was blood on his hands where he had tried to wipe it he had thus confirmed an interesting if alarming fact about this world while he was an immortal being theoretically incapable of being killed he could experience pain here pain and if he wasnt careful something a bit like death except without the nice long rest afterward still he was having the time of his very long life and the wasteland and wormwood seemed to belong to another faroff era not for the first time a pair of red lights whizzed by on either side of the road sometimes those lights were green or even amber but nurd liked the red ones best they reminded him of the fires of hell fires that he might never have to see again if he could terrify this world or even a little part of it into submission but before that there was more driving to be done a pair of flashing blue lights appeared in nurds rearview mirror accompanied by a howling noise despite his speed they appeared to be drawing closer and closer hmmm thought nurd i wonder what they are then the blue lights came near enough for him to see that they were stuck on the top of another car nurd wondered if the lights came in red if they did he might try to find some and stick them on the top of his car as well they would look splendid the car with the flashing blue lights pulled alongside nurd it was white with writing on the side and wasnt even half as pretty as nurds car there were two men in uniform in the car one of whom was waving at nurd not wishing to seem impolite even if he was a demon nurd waved back the men in the other car looked quite annoyed at this nurd suspected that perhaps he had given them the wrong wave but he didnt know enough about the habits of this world to be sure of what might be the correct variety the white car pulled ahead of him and then braked forcing nurd to slam his foot down hard on his own brake pedal if his seat belt hadnt been fastened this time nurd would probably have gone through the windshield instead the belt pulled him up short winding him now nurd didnt know a lot about driving but he could tell that the men in the white car had just performed a distinctly dangerous maneuver and he had half a mind to tell them what he thought of them and their little blue lights then the two men got out of the car and put hats on and a little warning signal went off in nurds brain he knew authority when he saw it his lips moved as he tried to read the word on the back of the car police one of the police tapped on nurds window while the other walked round the car holding a notebook and still looking annoyed nurd found the button that rolled the window down evening sir said the man at the window wrinkling his nose at the unpleasant odor emerging from the vicinity of nurd nurd saw that the man had three little stripes on his shoulder nurd thought they looked very fetching hello said nurd are you a police i prefer policeman sir came the reply thats quite the outfit off to a costume party are we nurd didnt know what a costume party was but the policemans tone of voice suggested that yes might be a good answer yes said nurd a costume party any idea how fast you were going back there sir oh nurd knew the answer to this one he could tell from the little red numbers on the dashboard one hundred and twelve miles per hour he said proudly very fast oh yes very fast sir too fast one might say nurd thought about this in his current mood it didnt seem possible that one could go too fast there was just slow and very fast no said nurd i dont think so one of the policemans eyebrows shot up like a startled crow can i see your license please sir license piece of paper with a photograph of you on it without your halloween mask says you can drive a car although in your case it might have a picture of a rocket ship on it as well i dont have a license said nurd he frowned he liked the sound of a piece of paper that said he could drive although he couldnt imagine to whom he might show it policemen aside wormwood might have been impressed by it but wormwood wasnt here oh dear sir said the policeman who had just been joined by his colleague thats not good is it no said nurd id like a license he composed his monstrous features into something resembling a smile you wouldnt have one that you could give me would you even if it doesnt have my picture it would still be lovely to own the policemans face went very still whats your name sir nurd said nurd then added the scourge of five deities scourge of five motorways more like said the second policeman very witty constable peel said the first policeman very witty indeed he returned his attention to nurd a foreign gentleman are we sir he said visiting perhaps yes said nurd visiting from where sir the great wasteland said nurd hes from the midlands then sarge said constable peel the one called sarge hid a smile thats enough constable dont want to offend anyone do we not only does he not have a license sarge he doesnt appear to have any license plates said peel sarge frowned is this a new car sir i think so said nurd it smells new is it your car sir it is now nurd said sarge took a step back right you are sir step out of the car please nurd did as he was told he towered at least a foot above the two policemen hes a big lad sarge said peel dont know how he managed to fit in there in the first place mind you he smells funny nurd had to admit that it had been a bit of a squeeze getting into the porsche but he was quite a squishy demon some demons were all hard bone or thick shells nurd was softer mainly because he hadnt taken any exercise in centuries thats quite a costume you have there sir said sarge what exactly are you supposed to be then nurd said nurd the scourge of we got all that the first time said sarge do you have any form of identification nurd concentrated on his forehead a mark began to glow a deep fiery red it looked like a capital b that had been drawn by a very drunk person its appearance on his skin was accompanied by a faint smell of burning flesh you dont see that very often sarge said constable peel he looked quite impressed no you dont said sarge what exactly is that supposed to be sir it is the mark of nurd said nurd hes a nutter sarge said constable peel nurd the nutter sarge sighed wed like you to come along with us sir if you dont mind can i bring my car said nurd well leave er your car here for the moment sir you can come along with us in ours its got pretty lights on the top explained constable peel helpfully and it makes a noise nurd looked at the policemens car it still wasnt as nice as his not by a long shot but it was different and nurd felt that he should be open to new experiences especially having spent so long in the wasteland with no new experiences at all some curious noises from wormwood apart all right he said i will travel in your car theres a good nurd said constable peel opening one of the rear doors nurd got the uncomfortable feeling that constable peel was making fun of him constable peel also made sure to keep the windows rolled down in order to let the smell out of the car when i assume my throne said nurd and i rule this world you shall be my slave and your life will be one of pain and misery until i choose to end it by turning you to a small mass of red jelly that i will crush beneath my heel constable peel looked hurt as he closed the door behind nurd thats not very nice he said sarge mr nurd here is threatening to turn me to jelly really said sarge what flavor then with nurd squashed in the back they began the drive back to the station xxiii in which we learn that one should be careful about accepting anything that is offered for nothing the fig and parrot pub was well known in the village for its halloween celebrations the owners meg and billy decorated it with cobwebs skeletons and other ghoulish oddities the grass square outside the pubs main doors was dotted with polystyrene tombstones and a noose dangled from the thickest branch of the old oak tree at its center the rope tight round the neck of a scarecrow inside the festivities were in full swing as meg and billy had arranged for the local brewery spiggits to offer free pints to those who arrived in costume and there was nothing that the regulars at the fig and parrot appreciated more than free pints hence everyone had made an effort at dressing up even if in the case of mangy old bob as he was known to most people except mangy old bob himself it consisted of nothing more than sticking a sprig of holly on his hat and claiming to be the spirit of christmas for the most part the villagers in attendance favored the old reliables and had come dressed as vampires ghosts mummies wrapped in bandages and toilet paper and the odd french maid the french maids were not it must be said terribly frightening except for mrs minsky who was a very large lady and who had not been constructed to occupy anything as small and frilly as a french maids outfit the two demons who approached the fig and parrot that night were not intellectually gifted this was true of most of the demons that had so far poured through the interdimensional doorway into the village they were foot soldiers nothing more the real horrors had yet to come this was not to say that the demons who were already in place were not terrifying seen in the right light and at an unexpected moment they might have proved bedwettingly frightening unfortunately they had arrived on the one evening of the year when lots of people were doing their utmost to look as frightening as possible and therefore many of the demons were simply blending in the two demons in question were called shan and gath facially they resembled warthogs although their bodies were those of men albeit rather overweight ones whose leather clothing was a couple of sizes too small for them their eyes like those of a great number of the other minor hellish entities currently exploring the village and its environs glowed a deep red from exposure to the fiery pits of hades large tusks jutted over their snouts from their bottom jaws and their heads and faces were covered in short rough hair they had two thick fingers on each hand but no thumbs they were clumsy vicious creatures intent only on doing harm to whoever happened to come their way the girl employed by spiggits to hand out the freebeer vouchers a young lady named melody prossett was dressed as a pink fairy and wearing a short dress a disguise that did little to hide the fact that melody was jolly lovely melody was studying the history of art at the local university which made few demands upon her time or it must be said her intelligence which was probably just as well melody was as sweet and beautiful asoh all right thena melody but she was by no means the brightest bulb in the box in fact even a box of very dark bulbs buried in a windowless coal shed might have given melody some competition in the brightness stakes when shan and gath entered the fig and parrot the first person they encountered was melody prossett guys what great outfits melody shouted shan and gath looked as confused as only a pair of destructionbent demons can look when faced by a leggy fairy with a cardboard wand admittedly thought melody the new arrivals smelled a bit odd even worse than mangy old bob who could kill flies with his breath and had mold in his armpits but perhaps it had something to do with whatever they had used to make their costumes then again those hog heads were very realistic melody wondered if they had somehow managed to hollow out real hog heads and fit them over their own if so she admired their efforts although it wasnt something that she would have been inclined to do not for all the beer in spiggits brewery somewhat awkwardly she managed to fit six vouchers into the demons cloven hands im only supposed to give you one each she whispered conspiratorially but youve gone to such trouble shan raised the vouchers to his snout and sniffed them warily urk he said oh i expect youre having trouble seeing through your mask said melody the bars over here let me give you a hand she took each demon by an arm and began to steer them toward the bar along the way shan and gath passed an assortment of beingsvampires ghouls and the likethat looked vaguely familiar from the depths of hell somewhere in their tiny minds they began to wonder if they might possibly have been better employed elsewhere given that this place seemed to have plenty of foul creatures to be getting along with unfortunately they were now firmly in the grip of melody prossett who was determined to be as helpful as possible because that was the kind of girl she was melody prossett was so helpful that people even quite elderly people often ran fast in the opposite direction when they saw her coming just to avoid melodys particular form of helpfulness now each voucher entitles you to a free pint of spiggits old peculiar melody explained its new ive tasted it and its wonderful this was not entirely true spiggits old peculiar was indeed very new but melody had not in fact tasted it she had put it close to her nose and decided that it smelled like something a cat might have done a cat furthermore that wasnt feeling at all well it had also scorched her nasal hairs and when a drop fell on her hand it had turned her skin a funny color ftnref be wary of anything that is offered to you for nothing especially if it is a new product that the makers are anxious to test usually they will have discovered that the bunny rabbits dogs or ironstomached employees who have already tried it have not died or gone blind as a result and therefore its about time to try it on people who might at some point be expected to pay for it unless youve always wanted to be a human guinea pig it might be wise to think twice before saying yes to something that a stranger hands to you with a smile free of charge especially if there is a doctor or a lawyer hovering nervously nearby spiggits old peculiar was an aptly named beer even those at the brewery who rather liked it took the view that something needed to be done about its nose the technical term for its smell and while the brewers were about it perhaps its taste which veered somewhere between not very nice and pretty nasty and the fact that if left too long on the skin it tended to burn it was though quite amazingly strong and after the first sip issues of flavor tended to be forgotten since spiggits old peculiar managed temporarily to deaden the drinkers taste buds leaving only the sensation that he had just accidentally consumed a naked flame fortunately that sensation was quickly replaced by one of complete intoxication and a sense of goodwill toward anyone within hugging distance until after a second pint he fell over and went to sleep shan and gath had never tasted alcohol of any kind given that they were demons and therefore not troubled by normal appetites they had never eaten anything other than the odd chunk of coal or grit and occasionally other smaller demons although mostly they just preferred to chew them before spitting them out so when meg handed them their first two free pints carefully removing a pair of vouchers from their misshapen fists along the way they just stared at them suspiciously to begin with gath was about to shatter the glasses and start being properly demonic when shan noticed a vampire take a long drink from a similar glass for a moment the vampire looked as though he had just been hit through the heart with a large stake as the unusual taste of spiggitts old peculiar seared his mouth and erased a few memories then a strange happy smile appeared on his face and he hugged the nearest mummy shan lifted the glass to his snout and sniffed it shan was used to the stench of hell itself but whatever was in the glass smelled a bit odd even to him he took a tentative sip something exploded in shans head and he looked around to see who had hit him and then poked him in the eyes as his vision began to return and he found there was nobody nearby shan realized that it was the stuff in the glass that had somehow managed to hit him he was considering throwing it at the wall and laying waste to all around him when he began to feel very mellow he took another sip longer this time now gath raised his glass and drank he staggered a bit when the beer started knocking out brain cells and almost fell over hurh hurh said shan it was a sound that he had never made before and it took him a while to recognize it as laughter hurh hurh said gath as he too began to recover they drank a little more someone began playing the piano meg and billy dispensed free french fries and shan and gath got their first taste of greasy deepfried potato gath put an arm round shan shan was his best mate he loved shan no he really loved shan they moved on to their second pints of spiggets old peculiar and all thoughts of world domination faded away meanwhile back at crowley road mrs abernathy was unhappy the destruction of the flying skulls she had sent after samuel johnson and his friends had not gone unnoticed for each demon that passed through the portal was linked to mrs abernathys consciousness so she could see through their eyes and assess the progress of the invasion she was also aware that two hellbulls had been beaten into nonexistence with household implements over what appeared to be some trampled rosebushes but that was not a primary concern increasingly she found herself infuriated by the johnson boy why couldnt he simply die after all he was just a child his continued refusal to accept his fate was like a splinter under one of her fingernails she recalled something she had learned from her interrogation and subsequent torture of the demon that had so unsuccessfully occupied the space under samuel johnsons bed and her unhappiness began to ease oh yes she thought i know what frightens you little boy she closed her eyes and her lips moved as she issued her summons xxiv in which nurd puts on an unexpected show for the police the call came through on the police cars radio while nurd constable peel and the sarge whose real name nurd had now learned was rowan were still some way from the station base to tango one base to tango one over said a male voice it sounded somewhat panicked this is tango one said sergeant rowan everything all right back there constable wayne over er not exactly sarge said constable wayne over he added with a tremor in his voice clarify the situation constable theres a good lad said sergeant rowan over well sarge were under attack over sergeant rowan and constable peel exchanged a look what do you mean attack over were being attacked by flying women sarge with the bodies of lizards biddlecombes police station was a small building set in a field on the outskirts of the town it had replaced an older building on the main street that had become infested with rats and which was now a chip shop that nobody frequented unless they were very drunk or very hungry or rats visiting their relatives the station consisted of a small waiting area and a large desk behind which was an openplan office and a single cell that was rarely used for prisoners currently it was filled with christmas decorations and an artificial tree the village had only six policemen two of whom would generally be on duty at any one time on this particular night four were on duty as it was halloween and people tended to get up to all sorts of mischief involving fireworks and occasionally fires pc wayne and wpc hay were currently holding the fort at the station holding the fort is usually a turn of phrase a bit like manning the barricades or fighting a losing battle in other words people use it to describe perfectly mundane situations like staying at home on a cold night or keeping an eye on the local shop while the shopkeeper goes for a wee unfortunately pcs wayne and hay were now literally holding the fort literally manning the barricades and also literally fighting a losing battle the first of the flying lizard women had appeared in the station car park while pc wayne was having a crafty smoke outside almost causing him to swallow his cigarette and choke the woman had a green saurian body and long sharp nails her wings were like those of a bat with curved talons in the middle and at the ends and she had a long tail that terminated in a viciouslooking spike her hair was dark and flowing and for a moment constable wayne thought that she wasnt bad looking the whole lizard body and wings thing excepted then she opened her mouth and a forked black tongue flicked at the air between the kind of jagged yellow teeth that crop up in dentists nightmares and any thoughts of dating her vanished from constable waynes mind at that point constable wayne decided that the best course of action would be to head back inside and lock the door which is precisely what he did there was a large bolt and he pulled that across as well just to be sure what are you doing that for asked constable hay the sarge will spit nails if he comes back and finds that youve locked the front door constable hay was small and blond and constable wayne was a little in love with her he had always thought she was very pretty but now after being confronted with a woman who appeared to be made up of bits of other creatures that really didnt belong together he decided that constable hay was quite possibly the loveliest girl in the world theres a woman outside said constable wayne with wings and a tail its halloween said constable hay slowly as though she were talking to an idiot she liked constable wayne but he really could be very thick sometimes on my way here i saw a man dressed as a toadstool no this isnt a woman dressed up to look like she has wings and a tail she does have wings and a tail there was a massive thud on the door constable wayne backed away from it thats her he said the lizard lady lizard lady said constable hay dismissively youll be telling me she can fly next a womans face appeared at the barred window to the right of the door constable hay walked determinedly toward it her finger wagging now listen here miss it may be halloween but well have no more nonsense or she stopped talking when she noticed that the woman was hovering two feet from the ground her huge wings flapping hard to keep her in place then bracing her feet against the outside wall the flying woman gripped two of the bars with her claws and tried to pull them from the wall see said constable wayne i told you so from above their heads came the sound of something landing on the roof seconds later the first of the slates began to fall into the car park as whatever it was tried to force its way into the station call the sarge said constable hay constable wayne ran to the radio where are you going he asked as constable hay ran past him to lock the back door inside the police car there was a long pause following constable waynes description of the attackers constable peel made a gesture of someone drinking from a bottle followed by an imitation of that same someone being very drunk then over the radio they heard the sound of glass breaking constable whats that noise have you been drinking said sergeant rowan over i wish i had said constable wayne one of them has broken the front window and theres another on the roof oh crikey the back door get here sargequickly please we need help er over over and out the woman at the window had injured herself breaking the glass and black blood now covered the shattered pane but the bars had held the woman appeared to give up and flew upward constable wayne heard her land on the roof and then followed the sound of her footsteps as she ran across the slates in the direction of the rear of the station there constable hay was using the full force of her body to try to force the back door closed when constable wayne joined her the problem quickly became apparent a claw was clutching at the door as the thing outside tried to push its way in the gap widened slightly and a gnarled foot appeared and then constable wayne saw one of those terrible female faces pressed against the wood its teeth bared help me cried constable hay i cant hold it much longer constable wayne reached for his truncheon and began using it to smack the creature on the knuckles it screeched in pain and withdrew the claw but its foot remained in place constable wayne tried stamping on it with his size shoes its claw appeared again slashing at him hold the door said constable hay and suddenly constable wayne was alone with only his weight to keep the creature at bay where are you going he cried just hold it i have an idea it had better be a great one thought constable wayne as he heard more footsteps above his head followed by the sound of flapping wings as a second creature flew down to aid the first oh no said constable wayne to himself thats not good thats not good at the door was struck with such force that constable wayne was flung headfirst across the room he scrambled to his feet in time to see two of the lizard women trying to force their way through the narrow door at the same time and getting tangled up in each others wings along the way then the larger of the pair pushed aside her smaller sister and stalked inside her claws raised and her mouth open wide as she advanced on constable wayne constable hay appeared beside the demon her arm outstretched and a small bottle in her hand hey she said over here the winged woman turned and constable hay sprayed perfume straight into her eyes she screeched and tried to rub at the irritant but that just made things worse at the same time constable wayne picked up a hat stand and swung it at the second demon which was trying to sneak around her sister the hat stand caught the demon a vicious blow on the side of the head she reeled away stunned but still dangerous constable wayne now using the hat stand like a spear began poking at her forcing her back outside meanwhile constable hay continued to spray perfume mercilessly into the first demons face until she stumbled blindly toward the door constable wayne helped her on her way with a sharp kick to the behind then slammed the door closed a series of loud shrieks came from outside and the two coppers watched through a window as the lizard women ascended into the night sky off to seek easier prey great said constable wayne the sarge will never believe us now sergeant rowan had just hit the lights and constable peel was about to put his foot on the accelerator when nurd tapped on the sheet of toughened plastic that partially separated him from the men in the front seats he had heard the exchange over the radio and he had also noticed some things that the policemen had not the first were the little tendrils of blue energy that were shooting across a field in the direction of what looked like a nearby church the second was a small being about two feet in height that appeared to be a yellow ball on legs although most yellow balls didnt have two mouths and a multitude of eyeballs the yellow ball was chasing a rabbit which jumped down a burrow the ball in hot pursuit unfortunately for the ball the hole was smaller than it was and now it seemed to be stuck its stumpy legs waving wildly this isnt a positive development thought nurd he recalled what samuel had told him about the woman in the basement and about her friends who no longer seemed to be human nurd had been rather hoping that samuel was mistaken or that the four people or demons or whatever they were might just have conveniently vanished or returned home now there were yellow balls with eyes chasing rabbits which disturbed nurd greatly its all very well if im the only demon here he mused but if there are lots of demons well then there could be problems and that blue energy that wasnt just regular old electricity or even transdimensional residue no it was energy of a very particular kind nurd had once glimpsed the great malevolence it was shortly before nurds banishment and he had been summoned to the great malevolences lair to be dealt with by his most trusted lieutenant the ferocious demon named baal in the darkness behind baal a huge shape had lurked taller than the tallest building wider than the greatest chasm and for an instant nurd had seen his face eyes so red that they were almost black great fanged jaws and a horned crown upon his head that seemed to have grown out from his skull the sight had so frightened nurd that he had almost welcomed his banishment for there could have been worse punishments he could have been taken by the great malevolence himself deep into his lair there to be slowly torn apart for eternity always suffering and never dying compared to that prospect banishment was a doddle but there was one other thing that he recalled about the great malevolence the contours of his body had rippled with blue energy it was his power made visible and now it was here on earth where nurd was and most certainly was not supposed to be hello he said knocking on the glass again i think theres been some mistake not now sir said sergeant rowan were a bit busy you dont understand said nurd id really like to go home you can forget about the car actually you can have it i dont want it im not sure that its yours to give away sir now youll have to be quiet were a little concerned about our colleagues at the station nurd sat back in his seat this isnt a costume he said softly having at last figured out what the word meant the two policemen ignored him nurd said it again louder this time this isnt a costume beg your pardon sir said the sergeant look im not wearing a disguise this is me very droll sir said the sergeant if it was a costume said nurd patiently could i do this nurds head split evenly in half down the center exposing his skull his eyes popped from their sockets extended themselves on lengths of pink flesh and examined sergeant rowan very intently then nurds skull separated revealing his brain it was held in place by twelve curved purple muscles which immediately stood upright and wiggled finally nurd stuck out his tongue which was three feet long at its fullest extension the top of the tongue had a hole in it through which nurd played a short fanfare before restoring his head to its regular form constable peel drove off the road he braked suddenly and both he and sergeant rowan jumped from the car and backed away from it sarge stammered constable peel hes a m hes a mo hes a mons yes he is constable said sergeant rowan trying to sound calmer than he felt demon actually said nurd shouting to make himself heard dont mean to be fussy about it but theres a big difference what are you doing here nurd finished for him well i was going to try to conquer your world and rule it for eternity but i dont think thatll happen now why not asked sergeant rowan carefully drawing a little closer to the car once more funny you should ask but someone else has his eye on this place and i dont think hell fancy any competition id really prefer not to be around when he gets here so if you could see your way clear to letting me out ill be about my business sergeant rowan stared at nurd nurd smiled back politely what exactly is happening asked sergeant rowan well its just a guess said nurd but i think its the end of the world as you know it xxv in which bishop bernard the bad makes his presence felt and the dead rise from their graves but only the nasty ones maria tom samuel and samuels mother watched from the darkened house as all manner of infernal creature slid jumped flew or crawled from the direction of crowley road where a blue light hung over the adjoining rooftops they had already been forced to fend off two further attacks the first from a pair of footlong slug demons with mosquitolike proboscises for sucking blood which had oozed through the letter box the slime trail behind them eating away at the carpet as they approached their intended victims the judicious use of a container of table salt had caused them to dry up into withered husks before disappearing entirely in a puff of smoke the second attack was still ongoing as the house was being buzzed by a pair of giant flies with jaws in their bellies they struck the windows occasionally the hooked teeth in their abdomens leaving marks upon the glass and their pink saliva staining it like watery blood mrs johnson monitored their attempts to gain entry a can of bug spray in each hand all things considered samuel thought she was coping very well with being confronted by demons but he also felt angry at something she had said earlier she had wished his dad was with them and for a moment when he first saw the flying skulls samuel had wished that too but now he no longer felt the same way he had suggested using salt on the slugs and he had found the bug spray hidden away in the back of a closet with toms help he had secured all the doors and windows and set up a system of watches so that between the three children and samuels mother they were able to keep an eye on all the approaches to the house for the first time since his dad had left samuel was starting to feel that if necessary he could look after both his mother and himself what he couldnt do it seemed was stop mrs abernathy they were trapped inside the house and they had heard nothing further from dr planck soon samuel feared all would be lost back at the parish church of st timidus the thumping sounds continued from what should have been the final resting place of bishop bernard the bad but clearly wasnt since the last thing bishop bernard the bad appeared to be doing was resting clouds of dust rose from the stone bearing his name and the dates of his birth and death one end of the stone lifted from the floor it hung in the air and the vicar and verger could almost feel the dead man below straining to move it higher but then the stone fell down again and all was quiet hes very strong said the verger as he and reverend ussher peered through the small window in the door he was quite surprised after all bishop bernard couldnt have been much more than a collection of old bones and old bones tended to break easily they shouldnt have been able to move huge slabs of stone it just wasnt right limestone said the vicar beg your pardon the rock beneath the church is limestone said the vicar limestone preserves bodies not just that it mummifies them bishop bernard has been down there for a long long time i suspect that if you were to touch him his bones would feel as hard as rock i dont want to touch him said mr berkeley i really dont the burial slab began to move again but this time it rose and didnt fall a skeletal hand emerged from the crack and tried to get a grip on the edge of the stone you may not want to touch him said the vicar but i suspect that he would very much like to get his hands on you reverend ussher opened the door of the little room and threw himself on the stone hoping that his weight would push it back down his right hand reached out and found the vergers bicycle pump and with it he began hitting bishop bernard on the fingers it took four or five strikes but eventually the bishop was forced to release his grip the stone slammed back down and there was silence once more quick said the vicar to the verger give me some help here reluctantly mr berkeley joined him in one corner of the room was an old stone statue of st timidus it had fallen from its plinth beside the front door of the church the previous winter and its right hand had dropped off there hadnt been enough money to repair it or the plinth so it had joined the old bicycle and the chairs in the storage room with some difficulty the vicar and the verger together managed to move the statue onto bishop bernards marker stone there said the vicar that should keep him occupied for a while the verger leaned against the wall as he tried to get his breath back but why is all this happening now he asked i dont know said the vicar i dont even know what all this is do you really think its like the monk said the end of the world i think the end of the world is some way off yet mr berkeley said the vicar he tried to sound confident but he didnt feel it this was all very disturbing gargoyles running about on the church lawn bishop bernard the bad attempting to escape from his tomb if it wasnt quite the end of the world it might well be the beginning of the end bishop bernard began pounding on the floor once again oh i do wish hed stop that said the verger hes giving me a headache he knelt on the floor then put his mouth near the stone now bishop bernard your excellency be a nice bishop and go to sleep he said theres been a bit of a misunderstanding but well get everything sorted out and you can go back to being dead that sounds lovely doesnt it you dont want to be up here in the land of the living its all changed since your time theres pop music and computers and you know you wont be able to go around sticking hot pokers up people because thats not allowed anymore not even for bishops no youre much better off where you are believe you me the verger looked at the vicar then nodded and smiled see said the verger all he needed was for someone to have a quiet word with him there came a muffled roar of rage and then the thud of stone upon stone as bishop bernard flung himself hard upward the statue of st timidus shifted slightly oh wonderful mr berkeley said the vicar that was most helpful bishop bernard attacked the stone again and the statue moved a little more the verger tried to hold on to it but it was no use he gave up and retreated to the window we should make a break for it said the vicar those gargoyles seemed rather clumsy and slow we can easily outrun them and my car is parked around the back but the verger didnt appear to be listening instead he was looking out of a small side window i say mr berkeley said the vicar did you hear what i said i think we should run for it i dont think that would be a good idea vicar said the verger and why is that asked the vicar now quite annoyed that his plan had been shot down without even a discussion the verger turned to him his face white because i think the dead are coming back to life he said and not the nice ones the church of st timidus had been in its present location for centuries much of its grounds were taken up with old gravestones because for many generations most of the people of the town had been buried beside the church when they died unfortunately not everybody had been buried under the church lawn church grounds were known as consecrated which meant that they had been set aside for holy use but people who committed serious crimes and were executed for them were not allowed to be buried on consecrated ground for that reason a second graveyard existed not far from the old church though beyond its walls no gravestones were placed there and no markers but everybody knew of it the townspeople called it the dead field and nobody built houses on it or walked their dogs there or had picnics on its grass during the summer even birds didnt nest in its bushes and trees it was everybody felt a bad place now as the vicar and verger watched shambling shapes began to emerge from the dead field their progress lit by the lights of the church grounds some still wore the tattered remains of old clothing although there was precious little of it left thankfully their modesty was preserved by the fact that most of them were just bones the verger saw one skeleton with part of a rope round its neck and knew that here was someone who had been hanged the end of the rope dangled at its chest so that it looked a bit like a necktie another skeleton appeared to have lost both its arms it tripped on a stone and couldnt get back up so instead began to wriggle its way along the ground like a bony worm with legs occasionally flashes of blue light were visible in otherwise empty eye sockets i wonder what that blue light is said the vicar maybe theyve stuck candles in there said the verger sarcastically after all it is halloween well we cant go outside now said the vicar ignoring him no we cant said the verger and from beneath their feet came what sounded like laughter xxvi in which constable peel wishes he had pursued some other profession and dr planck reappears constable peel and sergeant rowan were debating their options they could a let nurd go which didnt seem like a very good idea given that he was quite clearly not a human being and also if he was to be believed a demon b take nurd back to the police station and wait for someone with a little more authority to decide what should be done with him or c and this was constable peels suggestion run away because constable peel didnt want to see nurd do that thing with his head again it had made him feel quite ill hes a demon sarge and he doesnt half smell bad said constable peel im not sure i want to be driving around with a stinky demon in the back of the car hello said nurd through the open car window i can hear you less of the stinky please i fell down a hole you have been driving around with a stinky demon in the back of the car sergeant rowan replied trying to ignore nurd nothing happened nothing happened said constable peel his head split open sarge his tongue played a tune i dont know how you usually spend your evenings but in my book that counts as something happening careful now son youre getting worked up over he almost said nothing then realized this might not be entirely helpful given constable peels current mood over um constable peel folded his arms and waited then said over what exactly sarge over over let me see a demon in the back of the car finished constable peel that about covers it i think oh and he says the world is coming to an end that qualifies as something too well there you have it then said sergeant rowan we cant just sit around doing nothing while the world is coming to an end so what are we going to do sarge were going to put a stop to it constable said sergeant rowan with the kind of assurance that had kept the british empire running for a lot longer than it probably should have the sergeant walked over to the car and leaned in close to the window where nurd waited expectantly now look here sir he began whats all this stuff about the world coming to an end well said nurd i thought i was the only one whod come through through from where sir from hell the hell thats the one whats it like then asked constable peel who had reluctantly joined them not very nice said nurd you wouldnt like it theres a surprise said sergeant rowan what did you think hed say constable that it was pleasant on a sunny day its not the beach at eastbourne you know i was just asking said constable peel anyway back to the issue at hand said sergeant rowan so youve come from hell and you thought you were alone but youre not no im not and these er ladies who may have attacked our police station friends of yours are they no they came some other way how exactly i dont know how said nurd someone must have opened a portal and now theyre spilling through this portal sir what would it look like nurd considered the question i think it would be sort of bluish he said finally it probably started off quite small but now its getting bigger and bigger and when it gets big enough then then then what then hell come through our master the source of all evil the great malevolence along with his army and thatll be that really hell on earth do you think you could find this portal sir nurd nodded he thought that he could already sense it he felt the presence of the blue energy it made the hairs on the back of his neck tingle he knew that the closer he got to its source the more hed be aware of it he was like a walking evil energy detector now his hope was that if he could get near enough he might be able to sneak back to the wasteland unobserved better yet if hell was empty because all the demons had moved here he might find a way to leave the wasteland altogether he could go and live somewhere else perhaps in a cozy cave with a nice view of some burning lakes thats decided then said sergeant rowan this gentleman will show us where the portal is and we can set about stopping all this nonsense get on the radio constable make sure everything is fine back at the station and then tell wpc hay to alert the army well need all the help we can get constable peel prepared to do as he was told before he could make the call wpc hay came on the radio herself base to tango one over this is tango one said constable peel is everything all right liz over those flying women have gone and weve got the doors locked but now were getting calls left right and center peoples houses are being attacked there are monsters crawling and flying all over the place and theres some trouble over at the church over what kind of trouble over according to the verger the dead have started to rise over constable peel who already looked unhappy now looked very very unhappy hed joined the police to stop bank robberies and solve the odd murder neither of which he had yet managed to do as biddlecombe was rather quiet and so far the combined total of bank robberies and murders in the town was precisely nil ftnref this is unlike the small towns in television detective shows where so many people die that its a wonder theres anyone left in the town to kill by the end of the first series youd imagine that some of the residents might wonder about this and think hmmm our town appears to be populated entirely by murderers or people who are about to be murdered and since were not murderers then we must be potential victims marjorie grab the kids and the dog were going to live in new zealand constable peel had most certainly not joined the police to fight demons not unless he was going to be paid overtime and danger money and given a great big gun he was about to ask another question and possibly begin shouting at sergeant rowan to call out the air force the us marines the swiss guard and perhaps the pope vampire hunters and anyone else who might be able to sort out dead people popping up from the ground when a bolt of blue lightning shot across the radio seconds later the radio exploded in a shower of sparks and went dead he looked up and saw that the telephone lines along the road were also glowing blue and sparking at their connections he reached for his cell phone but it too was dead constable peel banged his forehead against the steering wheel a very bad situation had just got much worse mrs abernathy stood in the garden of crowley road her arms outstretched blue energy flying from the tips of her fingers and out of her eyes she was smiling as she brought down all communications within a tenmile radius of biddlecombe she felt the power surge through her as she set about creating a barrier around the town invisible to the naked eye but completely impenetrable it would remain in place until the great malevolence himself emerged and then he would unleash himself upon this miserable planet behind her the walls and roof of the house expanded as though the whole structure had taken a deep breath and then most of it fell to pieces to be replaced by a great tunnel of blue light twenty feet across from which more and more creatures began to pour imps and small dragons hooded serpents and hunched gnomelike figures armed with axes and blades and those were just the ones that could be described in recognizable terms there were other things that bore no resemblance to anything ever seen or imagined on earth monstrous things that had lived so long in total darkness they struggled to accommodate themselves to their new environment creatures that had never had a form because there hadnt been any point it would have been too dark to see them now they were trying to construct shapes for themselves resembling balls of fleshy dough from which arms and claws and tails and legs occasionally emerged before retreating again accompanied by the odd eyeball to enable them to see what they were becoming mrs abernathy turned to face them as they streamed past she stared into the portal and saw the gates were now almost half gone a huge hole gaping at the heart of them soon soon he would be here and then she would receive her reward but first there was one small matter to attend to she turned to mr abernathy now a toad and the spider demon by his side the one that had until recently been crammed into mr renfields skin and instructed them to find samuel johnson to find the interfering boy who was frightened of spiders and suck his insides dry tom was keeping watch on the street and maria and samuel the back of the house when dr planck appeared at the front gate mrs johnson called tom theres a man coming up the garden path are you sure hes a man asked mrs johnson pretty sure said tom dr planck hadnt seen the huge flies but the flies had seen him with a loud buzzing they descended upon the scientist but so intent were they that they didnt notice the front door opening and maria and tom emerging each with a can of bug spray before the flies could get within chomping distance of dr planck they had fallen to the ground writhing and spitting then had ceased moving entirely before they like the other demons who had run afoul of their intended victims vanished samuel joined mrs johnson as she approached the front door clutching a broom handle tom waited at the living room door his cricket bat at the ready hurry up mrs johnson told dr planck we dont know what else is out here as if to confirm her worst suspicions a batlike shadow flew over the house seconds later a creature the size of an eagle but with spines instead of feathers and a head that consisted of dozens of wriggling worms with a single eye at the end of each got tangled up in the telephone lines and fell crashing to the ground boswell who had been watching it suspiciously barked with delight dr planck looked upon its demise with relief until the door slammed shut cutting off his view and almost cutting off his nose as well thank goodness he said that thing has been chasing me ever since i locked the skull in a shed right said mrs johnson waving the broom handle in a threatening manner whats going on none of your scientific nonsense now keep it simple dr planck kept it very simple indeed i dont know well fat lot of good you are then said mrs johnson actually i was hoping samuel might be able to help me in that regard said dr planck samuel stepped forward im samuel at that moment the lights went out as mrs abernathy deprived the town of its power samuel and dr planck sat at the kitchen table while mrs johnson lit candles and samuel told him of almost everything that had happened from the time that samuel had gone trick or treating at the abernathys house to the battle with the flying skulls dr planck said nothing until samuel was finished although he did raise his eyebrow when samuel described mrs abernathys tentacles then sat back and tapped an index finger against his lip its incredible he said at last somehow the power of the collider has been harnessed to create a rip in the fabric of time and space i mean on one level its wonderful weve proved the existence of other dimensions even if it was by accident and weve discovered a way to travel between them on the other hand if this mrs abernathy creature is right and it is a gateway between this world and for want of a better word hell then were in a lot of trouble a lot of trouble seemed like an understatement to samuel but then he wasnt a scientist mrs johnson didnt look very impressed with this description either so all of this is your fault she said not exactly said dr planck we were trying to discover something of the truth about the nature of the universe well now something has discovered you instead and the truth is that it doesnt like any of us i hope youre happy what can we do asked samuel if the phones were working or i had access to a computer i could contact cern said dr planck unfortunately the last i heard they were having troubles of their own what do you mean asked samuel i got a call on my way to the abernathys house it seemed that the collider had started up again and they couldnt shut it down could mrs abernathy have done that mrs abernathy or whatever this thing is whose will she is obeying dr planck said assuming the two events are linked then if they can shut the collider down it should close the portal as well so all we can do is wait asked mrs johnson im afraid so what if they dont manage to shut it down in time asked maria well just have to hope that they do by now maria had joined them and it was she who spoke next it cant be very stable though can it what asked dr planck the portal said maria its not said samuel the monster under the bed told me as much he said that mrs abernathy was expending a lot of power keeping it open monster under the bed said dr planck its a long story said samuel i mean there are only so many possibilities maria continued it could be an einsteinrosen bridge but that doesnt sound likely given its size and duration or a wormhole of some kind or even a combination of both either way its stability is dependent on the energy resulting from the explosions in the collider and there was that wind we felt when we spied on the abernathy house wind said dr planck thoughtfully yes i felt it too it smelt of elsewhere so perhaps it was coming from the other side of the portal said maria but its force wasnt very strong youre the expert dr planck but isnt it true that in theory a portal like that would allow only a oneway trip well according to some theories yes and assuming the portal was sufficiently stable its to do with the force of gravity dr planck added to a confusedlooking mrs johnson and an even more confusedlooking tom but that kind of force would hurl the travelers out the far side wouldnt it said maria there should be a howling gale tearing this town apart but there isnt you may be right said professor planck i mean this is all speculative so there isnt that force of gravity said maria it appears not theres some but not sufficient to suggest a perfect balance between gravity and centrifugal force then suppose that we collapse it but how asked dr planck even as he asked the question he seemed to come up with an answer for his face cleared for the first time since he had arrived at the house nevertheless it was maria who was left to make the suggestion by sending something in the opposite direction she said like two cars meeting on a bridge and destroying themselves and the bridge said samuel two cars meeting on a narrow unstable bridge said maria you know said dr planck that just might work the questions are where do we find our car and who will drive it xxvii in which we meet bishop bernard the bad at last and constable peel enjoys himself immensely over at the fig and parrot shan and gath were having a rare old time someone had started playing the piano and shan and gath were doing their best to grunt along to my old mans a dustman earlier someone had sung danny boy which although they had never heard it before shan and gath sensed was a very sad song it had caused a tear to well up in gath s eyes leading shan to give him a consoling hug one more for the road asked someone waving a handful of beer vouchers in their faces why shan and gath thought spying the vouchers we dont mind if we do reverend ussher and mr berkeley were in real trouble in the first place the risen dead were proving to be a great deal cleverer than skeletons whose brains had rotted and turned to mush centuries before had any right to be the main windows of the church were set about eight feet above the ground which made them hard to reach without the aid of a stepladder in the absence of said stepladder some of the dead had formed a skeleton pyramid with three corpses providing support for two further corpses while a final corpse on top was using one of the stone gargoyles which was complaining loudly to break the glass two of the small panes had already broken and reverend ussher could see a mouth grinning at him through the gap a mouth with only a couple of broken black teeth still visible which said a lot about dental care in olden days at the same time more of the dead were thumping at the front door of the church and at the back door that led into the vestry from which the verger had called the police to inform them of all that was occurring the verger thought that the policeman who answered the phone had sounded a lot less surprised than he might have done under the circumstances in fact he sounded like the dead rising was the least of his worries the vicar and verger had taken the precaution of pushing chairs and pews up against the doors in an effort to hold off the attacking corpses if they did manage to break through there also continued to be worrying sounds from the vicinity of bishop bernard the bads tomb the marker stone of which was piled high with just about every available piece of furniture and statuary stored in the little room between the pounding and the laughing they could also hear what sounded like free me along with the occasional swear word bishop bernard seems most irate said reverend ussher as mr berkeley returned from checking on the storeroom i do hope you havent been trying to reason with him again and he does swear a lot for a bishop he shouldnt be able to talk at all said mr berkeley limestone or no limestone hes a corpse mr berkeley said the vicar patiently in case you havent noticed the dead have arisen there are gargoyles bouncing around on the church lawn and we have been insulted by a stone monk under those circumstances bishop bernards conversational skills are unremarkable i suppose youre right said the verger we need to do something about those skeletons though theyll be on top of us in a minute if were not careful the vicar grabbed a brass candlestick and moved to the wall of the church help me up he said the verger leaned down cupped his hands and with some effort boosted reverend ussher up close to the windowsill onto which the vicar managed to haul himself with some effort there were now four broken panes in the window and the dead had succeeded in breaking the lead that had surrounded them leaving a considerable gap as reverend ussher steadied himself a bony hand reached through and grabbed his trouser leg oh no you dont he said as he brought the candlestick down hard upon the skeletal hand it smashed into pieces scattering dismembered bones the rest of the arm was quickly withdrawn through the stained glass reverend ussher could see the pyramid of skeletons tottering he waited for it to draw closer once again and for the lead skeleton to reach for the glass when it did so the vicar opened the lower half of the window from inside whacking the skeleton on the head and overbalancing the pyramid entirely the three top corpses tumbled hard and broke various limbs when they hit the ground reverend ussher whooped in triumph but his delight was shortlived dozens of bodies in various stages of decay looked from the vicar to the broken skeletons then back again it was hard for skulls without much flesh to look any angrier than they already did but somehow these managed it oh dear oh dear what asked mr berkeley from below i think ive annoyed them and it wasnt like they werent miffed to begin with well done vicar hurriedly reverend ussher began to close the window but it now appeared to be stuck he tugged but it just wouldnt move oh dear he said again dont tell me said the verger i really think that i should said the vicar go on then the window wont close below him the dead began to form not one but two more pyramids they were about to attack on twin fronts at the same time there came a great crashing noise from the storeroom and a single word was roared from within that word was free oh dear said the vicar and the verger together and then just as the two pyramids of the dead began to approach the wall a police car shot around the corner and ran straight at them turning twelve rather innovative dead people into a pile of rotting limbs and broken bones the car spun and came to rest facing the skeleton host and sergeant rowans voice resounded across the churchyard right you dead lot it said this is the police were giving you five seconds to get back to wherever you came from or theres going to be trouble the dead did not move to be fair their hearing wasnt great in addition none of them had ever seen a police car before or indeed anything with four wheels that wasnt being pulled by a horse or an ox your choice said sergeant rowan dont say we didnt warn you constable peel gunned the accelerator and then released the brake hed had enough of demons and hell he was tired of the car smelling like poo this was payback the car shot toward the ranks of the dead now the dead may not have known a lot about mechanized vehicles but theyd seen what had happened to the last bunch whod been hit by the big white cart and were pretty certain they didnt want the same thing to happen to them unfortunately being dead they couldnt move very fast in fact it had been all that they could manage to move at all thus the vicar was treated to the sight of a police car chasing skeletal figures across the churchyard none of whom was in a position to avoid being run over the vicar was rather enjoying the show until mr berkeley reminded him that some of their troubles were only beginning er vicar said mr berkeley just as the door of the storeroom was hit with such force that it split in half the two pieces shooting across the church floor and coming to rest against the far wall a shadow appeared then became a shape as bishop bernard the bad made his entrance bishop bernard had never been a handsome man he had to be honest been uglier than a wart on a toads bottom and the centuries spent buried beneath the church had done nothing to improve his looks his skin was a dirty brown color like old leather his nose was gone leaving only a hole and his eye sockets were empty although they now glowed with a cold blue light he had kept a lot of his teeth which were long and yellow and reverend ussher thought a bit sharper than they should have been as though bishop bernard had spent some of his time underground working on them with a file one leathery hand held a long staff the bishops crosier with which he had been buried he was also wearing the remains of his robes of office on his head was his bishops miter it was a bit tattered and the front half lolled forward like a tongue but it was undeniably there as regrettably was bishop bernard himself who was now looking at the verger from out of those empty eye sockets following his progress as mr berkeley tried to hide behind the pews he can see said the verger how can he see hes got no eyes thats not right above him reverend ussher leaned against the wall hiding himself from the bishops view and pressing a finger to his lips urging mr berkeley to remain quiet oh wonderful said mr berkeley to himself leave me to face him on my own without even a bishop bernard raised his hand which like the rest of him looked like old bones wrapped in brown paper and extended a finger in the vergers direction thou said bishop bernard in a voice like gravel in a liquidizer thou art the one he began to advance on the verger who understood immediately that in this case being the one wasnt a good thing he hadnt won the lottery or if he had he wished that he hadnt bought the ticket because the prize wasnt going to be very pleasant im really not said the verger imprisoned in darkness continued bishop bernard still advancing my name a jest thou art to blame mr berkeley had made the odd joke about bishop bernard he had to admit but it wasnt as if he thought the bishop was listening after all he was supposed to be dead this just didnt seem entirely fair im very sorry about that your excellency said the verger i thought you were um resting it wont happen again no it will not said bishop bernard drawing closer and closer thou wilt be punished thou wilt have hot pokers inserted into thy bottom thou wilt the vicar landed squarely on top of the bishop and felt something crack he rolled across the floor and scrambled to his feet the candlestick raised to defend himself bishop bernard the bad had broken in half at the waist to his credit it had barely taken the wind out of him as the saying goes not that there was much wind in bishop bernard to begin with he released his grip on his crosier and began to crawl along the floor his hands clutching at the ends of the pews as he pulled himself along his attention still fixed upon the verger meanwhile his bottom half climbed to its feet and began bumping into things vicar cried mr berkeley hes still coming bottoms shouted bishop bernard pokers the vicar approached bishop bernard from behind im very sorry said the vicar but this really must stop he brought the candlestick down hard on bishop bernards head it made a ringing sound and bishop bernards miter fell off the bishop ceased crawling then twisted his head to look back at the vicar bottoms he said again thy bottom oh do be quiet said the vicar and hit bishop bernard a second time then a third he kept hitting him until there wasnt much left of bishop bernard and even his severed legs had stopped moving and had just toppled over like two pillars joined at the top the vicar wiped sweat from his brow he put his hands on his knees and tried to catch his breath i dont think he said that a vicar is supposed to beat a bishop to death or even back to death mr berkeley looked down upon the remains of bishop bernard if anyone asks well say he fell over he said lots of times there was a knocking at the door all safe inside said sergeant rowan its the police the vicar and the verger went to open the door sergeant rowan and constable peel stood on the step looking quizzically at them we are most happy to see you sergeant said the vicar happy and relieved sergeant began the verger but he was interrupted let me finish mr berkeley said the vicar spoilsports said the voice of the stone monk from above their heads just ignore him said the vicar now perhaps sergeant said the verger again i said let me finish the vicar insisted please now sergeant rowan weve had the most extraordinary experience one that you might have found hard to believe had you not seen it with your own eyes sergeant said mr berkeley with such force that even the vicar was forced to concede the floor to him well what is it asked the vicar out with it sergeant said mr berkeley i think your demon is running away xxviii in which nurd makes a new friend and meets some old acquaintances nurd had been very much enjoying his trip in the police car with its flashing lights and interesting whooping noise furthermore constable peel was a much better driver than nurd although in his own defense nurd had just been getting the hang of the porsche when the police stopped him and confiscated it still he had been learning a lot just from watching constable peel control the machine and he was wondering how he might go about making his excuses and leaving the policemen in order to apply what he had learned to his own driving when they had turned into the churchyard and nurd had seen the risen dead that wasnt helpful it was all very well for demons to start pouring into this world from their ownactually it wasnt very well at all come to think of it but compared to the dead rising from their graves it was a picnic in the park it took a lot of serious demonic energy to raise corpses and nurd could tell that this was a particularly nasty bunch of dead people if hed been wearing a watch nurd would have hidden it in his pocket before passing this lot on the street thieves and cutthroats all of them but that wasnt what concerned nurd what he was witnessing was not the result of some accidental breach between this world and hell itself no there was intent at work here evil corpses just didnt rise up of their own accord they had to be willed back into existence and only one being was inclined to go around summoning brigands and murderers from the grave which suggested to nurd that a personal appearance by the great malevolence was imminent it has already been established that nurd was not in the great malevolences good books in fact nurd wasnt sure that the great malevolence had any good books since he was the font of all evil it would be a bit like someone who hated flowers secretly filling his house with pansies nevertheless he had a list of demons who had disappointed him and he wasnt the forgiving type he also didnt care much for demonic entities that disobeyed his commands when you were banished by the great malevolence you stayed banished if you decided that youd had enough of banishment and were tempted to sneak back into hells inner circles in the hope of finding a comfortable dark spot in which to mind your own business then the great malevolence would inevitably find out because that was the kind of bloke he was demons couldnt die but they could be made to suffer and one of the problems with being immortal was that you could suffer for a very very long time nurd didnt like suffering he was quite sensitive for a demon he realized that the great malevolence must have been planning this attack on the earth for quite some time and nurd hadnt known about it after all it wasnt as if hed received a note saying no nurd had received no such communication which meant that he was very much not part of the great malevolences plans if he were still here when the big guy arrived nurd would be given an opportunity to discover just how sensitive he really was as the great malevolence would do his best to inflict as much pain on him as possible for disobeying orders even if nurd hadnt done so intentionally it was nurd had decided time to go home and pretend that nothing had happened his plan if you could call it that was to find the portal and sneak back through it to hell where he would return to his nice wasteland until everything calmed down a bit nurd wasnt quite sure how he was going to sneak back given that he would be moving in the opposite direction to every other demon and foul creature perhaps he could tell them that hed forgotten his keys or had neglected to pack clean underwear anyway hed work it out when he got there so once the policemen had finished mowing down corpses and had gone to see what was happening inside the church nurd had simply slipped out of the car and not to put too fine a point on it done a runner constable peel briefly gave chase but gave up very quickly nurd suspected that constable peel was quite happy to see the back of nurd especially given how badly he smelled by now nurd was getting tired of smelling himself so the first thing he did was to take a dip in a local pond to clean himself off scaring one of the nearby ducks half to death he was just finishing washing off his underarms when a large eyeball on the end of an arm popped out of the murk and blinked at him a second arm quickly followed this one sporting a mouth i say said a cultured voice do you mind this is my home not a public washroom very sorry said nurd didnt know this pond was occupied suppose i should put up a sign really not to worry old boy just trying to keep a low profile for the moment dontcha know lot of pillaging and terrifying going on up there no place for a gentledemon still cant have every tom dick and harry demon washing his socks in my water as it were no offense meant of course none taken said nurd ill be on my way then rightyho if anyone asks you can tell them that this pond has been claimed a third arm appeared this one holding a homemade flag depicting an eyeball on a red background it waved the flag in the air made it mself said the demon proudly all mown design very nice said nurd very imaginative maybe you should put it where people can see it though what a jolly good thought said the demon youre a clever one sir make no mistake a fourth arm grabbed a passing duck and tied the flag to its neck using a piece of pond weed before depositing the startled duck back in the water the duck made an attempt to fly away but the demon held it in place until eventually the duck gave up and paddled off with the flag hanging limply from its neck nurd stepped onto the bank smelling faintly of pond which was better than what he had reeked of before good luck with everything said nurd much appreciated said the demon youre always welcome to visit the arms plopped back beneath the surface leaving the pond still and quiet what a nice chap said nurd to himself if only all demons were like him unfortunately not all demons were like the thing in the pond as nurd sneaked through the town trying to make his way to the portal it became clear that the great malevolences advance guard consisted mainly of some spectacularly vile entities there was clear evidence of demonic nastiness to be seen three elderly male members of the biddlecombe shooting club who had been taking potshots at clay pigeons when the invasion began had made the mistake of turning their shotguns on a gorgon its hair a mass of hissing serpents and its eyes so black that they were less organs of sight than dark vacuums or jellied orbs of nothingness the shotgun pellets had bounced off the gorgons body and the three old gents had immediately been turned to stone when they caught sight of the creatures face so that they now formed an unusual piece of public statuary outside the post office there was a lot more blood in the butchers shop than there should have been as the smell of raw meat had attracted a troop of unpleasant carnivores hunched beings with white flesh that hung from their frames like wax from a melting candle their heads smooth but eyeless their nostrils stretched back against their skulls as though unseen fingers had inserted themselves into the holes and pulled hard the butcher mr morrissey had only a few seconds to register the awfulness of the creatures that were invading his premises before their mouths opened and their fine sharp teeth were revealed and they descended upon the hanging carcasses and in their frenzy upon mr morrissey himself when they were done only bare bones animal and human remained along with mr morrisseys tattered straw hat two members of the biddlecombe first xv rugby team had been swallowed up during evening training when somewhat against the laws of nature and for that matter rugby a pair of fins had erupted from the ground and the unfortunate players were dragged beneath it by what very much resembled sharks armed with webbed claws for digging the rest of the team had promptly harpooned the monsters with the corner flags a platoon of imps twofoothigh red demons armed with small pitchforks had attacked a florists shop only to discover that they were all allergic to pollen now they were staggering and wheezing all over the street their eyes streaming and their noses running this made them easy prey for what was presumably the irate owner a large woman wearing an apron depicting a smiling sunflower who was beating the imps into submission with a broom that was another thing nurd noticed the demonic forces were not having an easy time of it the humans were fighting back he saw a man on a lawn mower chase a snake demon and turn it into something mushy beneath his blades a group of schoolchildren dressed as ghouls had encountered half a dozen real ghouls in a park the ghouls who were thin and pale and not very interesting looking seemed a lot less terrifying than the schoolchildren who had gone heavy on the artificial blood this impression was confirmed when they began pelting the real ghouls with stones forcing them to beat a hasty retreat and barricade themselves in a hat shop the members of the biddlecombe ladies choral society had trapped a raiding party of demon dwarfs in a car park and using their handbags and songbooks had reduced them to small piles of pulp wearing hats with bells on the end nurd saw parties of humans armed with pitchforks bats and brush handles determined looks on their faces as they marched out to reclaim their town he wished them luck knowing that when the great malevolence came it would all be over for them nurd stepped over a wheezing imp that had staggered into his alleyway the imp sneezed once then expired turning to wisps of smoke that drifted away on the night air nurd wondered if the great malevolence had anticipated what would happen to his forces once they crossed over from their world into this one they could be killed oh not permanently killed but temporarily disposed of as it were mortal rules applied in this world there was simply not enough demonic energy here to sustain the entities so that when they died their essence was dispersed to be absorbed into the larger energy surrounding the great malevolence there to be reconstituted and sent back into battle the humans couldnt win not in the end all they could hope for were small victories over an enemy that would simply return again in time and even that would change once the great malevolence crossed over for he would bring with him all of his evil power and this world would be transformed into a new hell in the distance behind some houses nurd could see a haze of blue lightning and he knew that there lay the portal the gateway between worlds it was his way home he thought almost fondly of wormwood almost then he remembered samuel and hoped that the boy was safe he wondered if he should try to look for him but what could he do if he did find samuel take him back to the wasteland even if such a thing were possible no samuel would just have to fend for himself but the thought of the boy in danger or in pain made nurd feel guilty and sad nurd left the alleyway and began moving in the direction of the light he decided that it would be best to stay off the streets so he climbed a garden wall and used the hedges and bushes for cover advancing from garden to garden sticking to the shadows he was in his third garden when his skin began to tingle there was great power nearby he could sense it he peered through a gap in a hedge and spied a pair of creatures one spiderlike the other a huge toad scuttling and hopping down the street he recognized them both nurd sank to the ground and tried to make himself as small as possible this was grave news those two demons were bad enough but they were merely servants of a greater evil where they went a being infinitely worse inevitably followed a being intimately acquainted with nurd and his wrongdoings that being was baal baal the great malevolences trusted lieutenant the one who had condemned nurd to eternal banishment had already crossed over and nurd had a pretty good idea of where the senior demon would be baal would be waiting at the portal for its master to arrive xxix in which nurd proves to be rather decent actually it was samuel who spotted what appeared to be a demon hiding behind the hedge in the front garden crouching behind a hedge didnt seem like very demonic behavior to samuel whose experiences of demons until now had shown him that they were variously frightening puzzling or in the case of the one that had briefly occupied the space beneath his bed simply not very good at their jobs but so far he had encountered only one that appeared to be cowardly what do you think of that maria asked him as they stood in the darkened kitchen watching the demon maybe its planning to jump out at someone said tom its a him not an it said samuel his name is nurd and hes the one who popped up in my bedroom hes obviously frightened you can see that from here well i dont really fancy asking this nurd about his problems said tom excuse me mister demon is oo frightened is oo having a bad day i mean hes a demon hes supposed to be frightening us it would have to be something pretty terrible to make a demon tremble they were silent as they considered the implications of what tom had just said what could be so frightening that even a demon would be terrified by it samuel watched nurd he now appeared to be biting his nails nervously nurd may have been a demon but samuel knew that there was some good in him even if nurd had wanted to rule the world anyway what was that old saying something about an enemys enemy being your friend he moved to the kitchen door im going to talk to him are you sure about this samuel asked mrs johnson dr planck tried to protest but the others shushed him its worth a try if he looks like hes about to turn nasty we can just lock the door again or tom can wave his bat at him but i dont think thats going to happen to be honest i rather like him samuel opened the door and put his head to the crack psssst nurd who was already somewhat tense almost wet himself at the sound he looked around to see the head of a small boy wearing glasses poking through a gap in a doorway what are you doing in my garden said samuel what does it look like replied nurd im hiding go away samuel its dangerous why are you hiding arent they your friends out there that lot said nurd gesturing with a big thumb theyre no friends of mine in fact if some of them found out i was here id be in terrible trouble which brings us back to the whole hiding thing said samuel exactly said nurd look said samuel if we let you hide in here will you help stop all this nurd risked another glance through the hedge he clearly didnt like what he saw because he nodded briskly ill do my best he said i really would just like to go home well come on then said samuel he opened the door wider and stepped aside as nurd shuffled across the lawn and shot through the gap once the door had closed behind him nurd took a relieved breath and looked around he saw samuel looking thoughtful tom holding a bat as though he were aching for an excuse to use it maria who was sucking on a pencil and wrinkling her nose at the faint smell of pond that was coming off nurd and um was that poo and mrs johnson who was clutching a frying pan determinedly in one corner of the kitchen a man with a beard was trying to hide under a blanket nurd knew exactly how he felt hello said nurd im nurd nurd the scourge of five deities actually just plain old nurd will be fine i dont think i want to be the scourge of deities anymore if i never see a demonic deity again it will be too soon mind if i get up from the floor the people in the kitchen looked dubiously at him except for samuel who said honestly everyone we can trust him eventually tom said okay but do it slowly nurd did do it slowly because he had hurt his knee while diving into the kitchen he took a seat at the table and rested his chin in his hands he seemed very miserable and entirely unthreatening while samuel and the others watched a single big tear trickled down one of his cheeks im really sorry said nurd wiping it away in embarrassment its been a funny old evening everyone looked sympathetic even if he was a demon mrs johnson put down her frying pan and pointed to a kettle that was currently simmering on a camping gas stove perhaps youd like a cup of tea she said everything feels better after a cup of tea nurd didnt know what tea was but it couldnt taste any worse than the stuff in the sewer that would be very nice he said thank you mrs johnson poured him a cup of strong tea and added a digestive biscuit to the saucer nurd sipped carefully if noisily and nibbled at the biscuit he was pleasantly surprised by both its nicer if you dunk it said samuel demonstrating with his fingers nurd dipped the biscuit into the tea that is good actually he said he dunked the biscuit a second time but on this occasion he left it in for too long and half of it fell into his cup he looked like he was about to cry again just my luck he said never mind said mrs johnson rescuing the soggy biscuit with a spoon plenty more where that came from so said samuel perhaps you could tell us whats happening well its hell on earth isnt it said nurd gates have opened demons are pouring out end of the world and all that can we stop it dunno if youre going to do something youd best do it quickly because this lot are just the advance guard as soon as the great malevolence himself comes through itll be too late hell be too strong for anyone to stop nurd chewed glumly on his second biscuit he really isnt very friendly at all but you came through the gates with the others didnt you said samuel no thats just it said nurd i came on my own like i told you before i keep popping from one dimension into the next one minute i was sitting on my throne in the wasteland hitting wormwood on the head and minding my own business and the next moment i was here now i appear to have ended up here permanently i tried to make the best of it in fact nurd coughed slightly ashamedly into his hand i had hoped to rule the world oh id have been very decent about it none of this terrorizing and demonic nonsense all i really wanted was a bit of adoration and a nice car apart from that id hardly have bothered anybody unfortunately i think theres going to be some competition for the position so ive decided to abandon my hopes and go home so you just sort of teleported ftnref actually teleportation is not nearly as farfetched as you might think scientists at the joint quantum institute in maryland recently managed to teleport the quantum identity of one atom to another a few feet away however teleportation of humans is a long way off as the experiment only works once in every one hundred million attempts therefore the chances of you being teleported and arriving as interesting goo at the other end if you arrive at all are very high indeed you dont want to be the subject of the following conversationis he there yetwell bits of him are here asked tom who was a big fan of star trek and quite fancied the idea of being transferred from one place to another instantly nurd shrugged not entirely understanding the question then looked at maria who was still sucking her pencil and regarding him with an intense gaze whys she looking at me like that said nurd whatve i done apart from being a demon and planning to rule the world you mean said tom yep apart from all that said nurd maria asked samuel what are you thinking nurd here said that he flipped back and forth between worlds im just wondering what that might mean for our plan it may be that were wrong about the nature of the portal plan said nurd what plan nobody spoke oh i see said nurd dont trust the demon he sighed well cant say i blame you with that lot outside and for your information i didnt just flip back and forth happy as a demon with two tails the first time i got crushed and found myself back in the wasteland and the second time a big truck hit me and the same thing happened the third time i was with samuel and then i wasnt with him that was the only time that something bad didnt happen he gave samuel a little embarrassed smile maria looked pleased oh so the rest of the time you died sort of thats all right then thanks very much said nurd it wasnt all right for me you should try dying some time i guarantee that you wont care much for it but now maria was really interested whats it like traveling through a portal she asked nurd it hurts said nurd with feeling its like being stretched for miles and then squeezed into a tiny little ball thats because of this said maria pointing at a drawing she had made of an hourglass shape her pencil poised where the hourglass was at its narrowest thats the point of compression you shouldnt have been able to pass through it at all because you should have been torn apart or squashed to almost nothing it sounds like this portal has some of the qualities of a black hole and some of a wormhole theoretically again it shouldnt exist but then demons shouldnt exist either and yet one is drinking tea with us at this precise moment your point being asked tom now getting somewhat impatient because he couldnt follow most of what maria was saying my point being said maria patiently that nurd here may be the solution to our problems solution said nurd nervously this solution isnt going to hurt is it might do a bit said maria scientifically it has lots of holes in it it may not work at all well its better than no plan said samuel assuming nurd is willing to try it cant be any worse than whats happened to me already said nurd gloomily explain away so they did right said nurd when they had finished that sounds so foolhardy dangerous and completely impossible that it just might work now all we need is a car he looked up from the table and his expression changed there is just one more problem he said whats that asked samuel nurd pointed a shaking finger at the window to where a pair of demons one a toad the other a spider now stood at the garden gate them xxx in which mrs abernathy loses the battle but sets out to win the war the children crowded at the window staring out at the demons ugh said maria wrinkling her nose at the sight of the tenlegged spider and the great toad theyre horrid the servants of baal said nurd they look awful and they are awful but baal is like a thousand of them rolled into one with added nastiness im in trouble now samuel stared at the two demons there was something strangely familiar about them it took him a second to realize that they both still wore the remains of tattered black robes theyre not after you he said to nurd im not even sure they know youre here then who are they after asked tom me i think said samuel theyre two of the people from the abernathys basement or they used to be mrs abernathy must have sent them why asked tom you didnt even manage to stop her the gates are open she has what she wanted i got in her way i dont think she likes people crossing her im not sure if anyone has ever crossed her before not like that she wants to punish me and you lot as well if youre caught with me he turned to maria and tom im sorry i should never have got you involved in all this tom patted him on the back youre right you shouldnt have tom said maria appalled i was only joking said tom i really was he added as maria continued to glare at him so what do we do now asked maria run away running away sounds good said dr planck from somewhere beneath the blanket no said samuel we have to face them look said tom hitting little flying skulls was all very well but i dont think those two are going to let any of us get close enough to knock them on the head with a bat we go ahead with the plan said samuel we send nurd through the portal there is just one thing said nurd id rather if they didnt know it was me could create difficulties at the other end assuming i dont get spread over half the universe if the portal collapses perhaps you have a disguise of some kind that i could use mrs johnson whipped the blanket from dr planck made two holes in it with a pair of scissors and handed it to nurd but where do we get a car asked tom mum said samuel keep an eye on those things tom stay with her nurd maria come with me where are you going asked tom to steal my dads car said samuel and saw his mum smile samuel maria and nurd stood in the garage at the back of the house looking at the car that samuels father had spent years lovingly restoring aston martin read nurd he stroked the car gently its lovely is it like a porsche no said samuel its better than a porsche because its british right said nurd he wasnt sure that he agreed he really had liked the porsche but this was still a splendid car are you sure you can drive one of these asked maria i drove a porsche said nurd i got the hang of that fairly quickly samuel was having second thoughts about letting nurd have the car samuels dad would go crazy when he found out you will look after it said samuel to nurd its such a beautiful car samuel said maria hes going to drive it through a transdimensional portal and if things go right end up back in hell or if things go wrong in tiny little pieces scattered throughout a wormhole or even compressed to almost nothing its not entirely fair to ask him if hes going to look after it samuel nodded perhaps its better not to know samuel handed nurd his fathers spare car keys nurd climbed into the drivers seat and put the key in the ignition as samuel raised the garage door that opened onto a lane at the rear of the house maria stood beside the open passengerside window and spoke to nurd do you know where youre going toward the big blue light said nurd it wont be hard to find no i suppose not youll need to build up quite a head of speed if this is to work i dont think that will be a problem he said right good luck then said maria and nurd yes please dont let us down i wont he said your dad is going to have a meltdown when he finds out isnt he said maria to samuel as he returned from opening the door if nurd fails or if youre wrong my dad will have better things to worry about said samuel youd think so said maria but hell still find time to kill you i dont care said samuel he was not frightened but neither was he quite as angry as before in a terrible way he was getting his own back on his dad for leaving if they werent quite even they were getting there give us a few minutes then get going said samuel to nurd well distract those things at the gates just in case they have come for you nurd gripped the steering wheel expectantly ill count to one hundred he said great said samuel well like maria said dont let us down he patted the car once more in farewell is your dad really going to be annoyed asked nurd hell get over it after all its for a good cause i hope he understands said nurd you just seem like the sort of person who should be understood i wish you could stay around said samuel id like to have gotten to know you a little better you were the first person who was nice to me ever said nurd that counts for something whatever happens they shook hands and then samuel gave nurd a hug that after a moment of surprise the demon returned for the first time nurd began to understand how it was to feel sorrow at parting with a friend and even as it hurt him he was grateful to samuel for giving him the chance to experience something of what it was to be human come on said maria lets go and help the others that will keep your mind off things i expect so said samuel being eaten by a spider or a toad will do that the demons had not moved they were simply staring at the house but it was the huge spider that most concerned samuel its mouthparts moving dripping clear venom that turned the leaves black samuels brain was filled with shrieking voices telling him to run he had always been frightened of spiders ever since he was a very small child he couldnt explain why now he was being forced to confront a spider so vile that even in his worst nightmares he couldnt have come up with anything like it even if it did have a pair of human legs sticking somewhat incongruously out of its bottom samuel opened the front door and stepped into the garden from the back of the house he heard the sound of the aston martin starting up a flickering figure like a picture shown on a cinema screen apppeared on the path before him surrounded by blue light it was mrs abernathy or a projection of herself hello samuel she said im sorry i cant be there in person to witness your death but im sure my servants will make it as uncomfortable as possible her head turned as though she were listening to something then she clicked her fingers and the toad demon in response to her command hopped away was that the sound of your little friends trying to escape sneered mrs abernathy and samuel knew he had been right mrs abernathy had not been aware of nurds presence samuel shrugged well they wont get very far naroth will find them and kill them it will be a swift death pleasant compared to what i have planned for you her ghostly hand touched the remaining spider demon causing the hairs on its body to stand on end chelom she said eat him slowly nurd was approaching the end of poe street when a large dark shape appeared on the road before him its body tensed to jump naroths face was not capable of showing feeling but if it had been it would have displayed utter astonishment instead of the expected children and the adult woman there was a single figure behind the wheel of the car its body draped with a blanket in which two eyeholes had been cut naroths senses detected something familiar about the figure but it couldnt decide what it was nurd stopped the car and stared at naroth horrid thing said nurd as though it had heard the words naroth jumped on the hood causing nurd to shriek in fright nurd put his foot down on the accelerator and the car jerked forward but naroth was holding on tight with its sticky toes it spat concentrated venom onto the windshield which immediately began to smoke and melt oh no you dont said nurd im not having you ruining this nice car he braked hard and naroth was thrown off with such force that it left one of its legs caught in the side mirror it landed on its back and began to twist in an effort to right itself it heard the sound of the engine growling and redoubled its efforts finding its feet just as its head was struck by the front of the aston martin and its body was dragged beneath its wheels it had just enough time to think ouch that before it stopped thinking altogether and everything went black nurd looked in the rearview mirror at the mangled remains of naroth and the satisfying green smear that the toad demon had left along the lower half of poe street serves you right for messing with my motor said nurd you should have more respect chelom began to climb over the garden wall the weight of its body causing the hedge to collapse it landed heavily and lumbered toward samuel as it did so an arrow whistled by samuels ear and buried itself in the spider demons body causing yellow liquid to spurt from the wound the spider demon reared up then resumed its progress as a second arrow flew toward it this time it struck one of the black eyes on the demons head and the demon arched its body in agony one leg raised as if in an effort to dislodge the arrow from its flesh maria appeared beside samuel samuels toy bow raised and another arrow already nocked its tip sharpened with a blade now tom she shouted tom emerged from the kitchen carrying a container of liquid from which a plastic pipe connected to a nozzle in his hand he squeezed the nozzle and a jet of fluid landed on the grass at cheloms feet the spider demon reacted as though the ground were hot when the sensitive taste buds at the tips of its legs came into contact with the liquid tom kept pumping and more of the fluid squirted onto the demons body and into its eyes and mouth it tried to retreat but tom pursued it relentlessly until at last the demon began to twist and writhe before falling on its back its legs curled in upon its body and it stopped moving samuel wrinkled his nose what is that stuff ammonia and water said tom maria thought of it but maria was not listening and neither suddenly was samuel their attention was now concentrated on the image of mrs abernathy who was gazing upon them in fury come and get me said samuel he wanted to distract mrs abernathy from the portal he had to buy nurd some time but mrs abernathy simply disappeared xxxi in which mrs abernathy reveals her true colors mrs abernathy stood outside what remained of the house it was almost time she had wanted to kill samuel but that would have to wait she would find him though and when she did he would wish that the spider had consumed him again and again he had defied her and mrs abernathy was not one to tolerate defiance the portal had grown to such an extent that all that was left of the house were two walls and a chimney breast the doors and windows were entirely gone replaced by a huge spinning vortex with a dark hole at its center there were no longer creatures coming through it all such activity had ceased for a time and those demons and monsters not otherwise occupied in sowing chaos throughout the town were waiting expectantly for the arrival of their master the great malevolence himself winged purple forms dangled upside down from lampposts like great bats their heads simply elongated beaks filled with jagged teeth around them flew insects as big as seagulls their iridescent green bodies ending in long barbed stingers a phalanx of vaguely human figures had assembled by the corner of derleth crescent dressed in ornate gold armor that was itself alive as the dragons and snake heads with which it was decorated slithered and snapped at the night air the armor both a means of defense and a weapon the armor had no face guard and beneath each jeweled helmet there was blackness broken only by the flickering of red hostile eyes above their heads a banner flew flames in the shape of a flag burning in honor of he who was to come mrs abernathy raised her arms in the air and closed her eyes in ecstasy as a great cheer arose from the demons before her nurd watched all that was happening from a side street nearby the aston martin purring softly underneath him he shivered as the woman lifted her arms blue energy crackling around her there were ranks of demons in hell but the very worst of them had hidden themselves away with the great malevolence and were rarely seen by the rest they were monstrous beings their appearance so awful that they shrouded themselves in darkness unable to tolerate even the reaction of other lesser demons to their blighted state yet there was one great demon that felt no such shame that did not seek to hide itself it had become the great malevolences most trusted lieutenant the demon that knew his every secret and to whom he revealed all of his thoughts a demon that had studied the humans with hateful fascination altering itself as it did so its mind becoming both male and female although it had always preferred the female side sensing that the female was smarter and shrewder than the male even dressed in the skin of mrs abernathy nurd recognized the entity before him after all it had been responsible for his banishment it was baal he sank back against the wall ill never get past her he said bitterly im done for were all done for mrs abernathy began to speak our time has come she said our long exile in the void is at an end tonight we have begun to claim this world as our own and soon we will reduce it to a charred ruin see our master approaches gaze upon his might feel his majesty behold him the destroyer of worlds she stepped aside and the center of the vortex grew larger the dark hole at its heart simultaneously expanding and becoming lighter the gates were almost entirely gone and the melting metal steamed and boiled slowly shapes became visible through the murk they were blurred at first and shrouded in mist but gradually they became clearer it was an army the largest army ever assembled in any world and in any universe all the peoples of the earth were as nothing before it its ranks outnumbered every grain of sand on the planet every leaf on every tree every molecule of water in every ocean demons of every shape and size things formed and without form had assembled behind the remains of the gates above the great army towered a black mountain so tall its top could never be seen its base so wide that a man might walk for a lifetime and never circumnavigate it at the heart of the mountain was a massive cave unseen fires glowing within and then a dark form appeared at the entrance to the cave from its head sprouted a crown of bone it wore black armor carved with the name of every man and woman who had ever been born on earth and who ever would be born in order that it would never forget its hatred for them in its right hand it held a flaming spear and on its left arm it bore a shield made from the skulls and bones of the damned for in every evil man and woman there was something of the great malevolence and when they died he claimed their remains for himself he towered above his army so that they were like insects before him he opened his mouth and roared and they shook before him for his glory was terrible to behold another cheer arose from the assembled masses mrs abernathy basked in the sound so consumed was she by the imminent success of their invasion and the impending arrival of her master that she failed to notice that the cheers had started to fade to be replaced by mutterings of confusion and a voice that appeared to be saying very politely excuse me mrs abernathy opened her eyes standing before her was samuel johnson i have a question said samuel mrs abernathy was so taken aback that she couldnt reply her brow furrowed her mouth opened and tried to form words but none would come the gates of hell were about to be opened at last the earth destroyed and all of its inhabitants torn to pieces and here was a small boy who seemed to have well a question eventually mrs abernathy responded in the only way that she could what is it she said i just dont see the point said samuel the point yes the point said samuel i mean if youve all been stuck in horrible old hell for ages and now youre about to come here instead why would you reduce it to a ruin and turn it into somewhere thats just as bad as the place youve left it doesnt seem to make any sense beside him a pink demon with four legs scratched itself in puzzlement its form had the consistency of marshmallow so its fingers got rather lost in the process and jabbed themselves into the demons brain but at least it was thinking or giving the impression of doing so and what would you have us do asked mrs abernathy leave it as it is well yes said samuel i mean its got trees and birds and elephants everybody likes elephants you cant not like an elephant or a giraffe and personally im very fond of penguins the pink demon gave a little shrug of agreement or as much of a shrug as something without a neck can give which isnt very much at all if you destroy it continued samuel then youll just be back where you started with a big lump of rock that doesnt have a whole lot in it except demons its not exactly going to be beautiful is it mrs abernathy took a step toward him and why do you imagine that we would want beauty she said beauty mocks us for we have none goodness appalls us because we have no goodness we are all that this world is not and we are all that you are not she raised a hand to the stars above her and this world is just the first we have a universe to conquer we have suns to extinguish and planets to crush in time each of those lights in the sky will fade to nothing we will extinguish them like candle flames between our fingers until there is only blackness the little pink demon still thinking about penguins gave a disappointed sigh mrs abernathy flicked a finger and he exploded in a puff of pink and red he goes to the back of the line said mrs abernathy as samuel wiped a piece of demon from his sleeve and as for you i am strangely glad to see you it means i can kill you now and enjoy our triumph with the knowledge that you are not alive to spoil it mrs abernathy grinned her body began to bulge her skin stretched under the pressure opening tears in her face and on her arms but no blood came instead something moved in the spaces revealed now samuel johnson she said look upon me look upon baal and weep nurds finger was poised over the ignition key he saw mrs abernathy step away from the portal but not far enough come on samuel he whispered the little boy was brave so very brave nurd hoped that samuel wouldnt die but the odds in his favor werent good the odds in nurds favor werent much better but he was determined to try he would be brave if not for his own sake then for samuels mrs abernathy took another step toward samuel samuel retreated in turn then mrs abernathy started to shudder and swell oh no said nurd here we go mrs abernathys skin fell away in clumps withering and turning to dry flakes as it hit the ground a grayblack form was exposed wrapped up in tentacles that now began to stretch and move as they were freed from the constraints of skin only her face and hair remained in place like a rubber mask but it was stretched so tightly over what was beneath that it bore no resemblance to the woman who had once worn it one of the tentacles reached up separated itself into claws and wrenched the skin mask away and still baal grew six feet then eight then ten on and on larger and larger two legs appeared bent backward at the knees from which sharp spurs of bone erupted four arms emerged from the torso but only two ended in clawed fingers the second pair ended in blades of bone yellowed and scarred a great mass of tentacles sprouted from the demons back all of them twisting and writhing like snakes finally baal reached its full height towering thirty feet above samuel there was a cracking sound and what had looked like a bump in its chest was revealed as its head which now untucked itself it appeared to have no mouth merely two dark eyes buried deep in its skull but then the front of the skull split into four parts like a segmented orange and samuel realized that it was all mouth the four parts lined with row upon row of teeth a gaping red hole at its center from which a multiplicity of dark tongues emerged samuel was too frightened to move he wanted to run but his feet wouldnt respond in any case his back was against the garden hedge he could go right or left but he couldnt go any farther backward he felt something brush his leg and looked down to see boswell who had escaped from the house and followed his master even now the little dog wanted to be near samuel run boswell he whispered theres a good boy run home but boswell didnt run he wished to but he wasnt going to desert his beloved samuel he barked at the horrid unknown thing before him nipping at its heels one of its bladed limbs shot out in an effort to impale him but boswell skipped out of the way just in time and the long bone buried itself in the pavement lodging firmly baal tried to free itself but the bone was stuck something in its struggles snapped samuel out of his trance he looked around for a weapon and saw a half brick that had been dislodged from the house as the portal expanded he picked it up and hefted it in his hand it wasnt much but it was better than nothing with a great wrench baal managed to pull the blade free even as boswell continued to bark and snap a tentacle larger than the rest lashed out at him catching the little dog around the chest and tossing him into the air the pincers at the tentacles end shot out to cut him in two but they missed him by inches and boswell fell to the ground stunned he tried to get up but one of his legs was broken and he was unable to raise himself he yelped in pain and the sound cut through samuel filling him with rage you hurt my dog he shouted by now he didnt know if he was more angry than scared or more scared than angry it didnt matter he hated the thing before him hated it for hurting boswell hated it for what it had done to the abernathys and their friends hated it for what it wanted to do to the whole world behind it the portal was visible and samuel could see the great malevolence approaching his army parting before him so that he could lead the legions of darkness into this new kingdom baal bent down before samuel surrounding him with tentacles those four limbs poised to finish him off its skull opened up once more breathing its stink upon him as it hissed and samuel saw himself reflected in those dark pitiless orbs he threw the half brick straight into its mouth it was a perfect shot the lump of stone landed in the demons throat it was too far down to be spat out and too big to be swallowed baal staggered back black blood and drool dripping from its jaws as it began to choke around it the assembled creatures watching the unequal battle waiting for the boy to be destroyed gave a collective gasp of shock baal tried to reach into its mouth with its tentacles to free the blockage but the gap was too narrow for them to gain purchase it collapsed to its knees as smaller demons ran to its aid climbing up its body in an effort to reach its mouth carefully three of them entered its jaws and began working at the brick trying to free it samuel felt hands grasp his arms two of the figures in gold armor were securing him their red eyes glaring as he was held in place he struggled against them but they were too strong there was a thud and something landed before him it was the half brick samuel looked up to see baal rising from its knees and in its eyes he saw his doom at that moment a vintage aston martin driven by a moonheaded figure in a blanket sped behind baal and disappeared into the portal leaving behind it only exhaust fumes and a fading goodbyyyyyyyyye for a second nothing happened everyone and everything simply stared at the portal unsure of what they had just seen flashes of white light appeared at its edges and the portal which had been spinning in a clockwise direction reversed its flow and began to move counterclockwise there was a sense of suction as though a vacuum cleaner had just been switched on but it seemed to affect only the demons not samuel first the smaller ones then the larger were lifted from their feet and pulled inexorably into the portal some struggled against its force holding on to lampposts garden gates even cars but the portal began to spin faster and faster and one by one they found themselves wrenched from one world and back to the next until the portal was filled with a mass of legs and tentacles and claws and jaws demons bouncing off one another as they were drawn toward the center two of them oddly were desperately trying to hold on to glasses of beer at last only one remained the thing that had once been mrs abernathy was heavier and stronger than anything else that had passed into this world and it did not want to leave every limb and every tentacle was stretched to its limit each clinging to something however insubstantial in an effort to fight against the force of the portal which was now spinning so fast that it was nothing more than a blue blur finally it proved too much even for the great demon until at last only one tentacle remained clinging to the bottom of the garden gate the rest of the demons body suspended in midair its legs pointing to the void samuel stepped forward he stared into baals eyes and raised his right foot go to hell he said and stamped down hard on the tentacle with his heel the demon released its hold on the gate and was sucked back to the place from which it had come the portal instantly collapsed to a small pinpoint of blue light then disappeared entirely samuel knelt by boswell and cradled the little dogs head in his arms a police car pulled up and people began to emerge from their homes but samuel cared only for boswell brave boswell he whispered and despite his pain boswells tail wagged at the sound of samuels voice speaking his name brave boy then samuel looked up at the night sky and he spoke another name and his voice was filled with regret and fondness and hope brave nurd xxxii in which everyone lives happily ever after or so it seems it took a long time for biddlecombe to return to normal people had died or like the abernathys and the renfields simply disappeared for months afterward there were scientists and television crews and reporters cluttering up the town and asking all sorts of questions that the townsfolk quickly grew tired of answering nutcases and people with nothing better to do made journeys to the town to see the place in which for a time a gateway between worlds had opened the problem was that all damage to people and property aside and the stories told by those who had encountered the demons no actual evidence survived of what had occurred apart from the stone statue of the three old gentlemen with shotguns there were no physical remains of monsters and those who had taken cell phone pictures of flying creatures or who had used video cameras to take shots of demonic entities trampling flowerbeds in the local park found that there was nothing but static to be seen oh everyone accepted that something had happened in biddlecombe but officially nobody seemed entirely sure of what that something might have been not even the scientists responsible for the large hadron collider who in the wake of what had occurred decided that in future they needed to keep a very close eye on their experiments for now though the collider would remain powered off and ed and victor were left to play battleships in peace while professor hilbert dreamed of traveling to other dimensions but only ones that didnt have demons in them the collider did have three very special visitors in the weeks that followed samuel maria and tom were treated with a great deal of curiosity and respect as they toured the facility and they did their best to answer all of the scientists questions as politely as possible samuel and maria decided that they quite liked the idea of becoming scientists although they were pretty certain that after all theyd seen theyd be more careful about what they got up to than the cern people had been i still want to be a professional cricketer said tom after their visit at least i can understand cricket and nobody ever accidentally opened the gates of hell during a test match eventually biddlecombe began to fade from the headlines and that suited everyone in the town just fine they wanted their dull pretty old biddlecombe back and that was what they got more or less over at miggins pond a boy named robert oppenheimer was throwing stones at ducks it wasnt that he had anything against ducks in particular had there been a dog or a lemur or a meerkat at which to throw stones instead he would happily have done so but in the absence of any more exotic creatures ducks would just have to do he had managed to hit a few birds and was looking for more stones when he was lifted up into the air by one leg and found himself dangling over the surface of the pond an eyeball appeared on the end of an arm and well eyeballed him then a very polite voice said i say old chap i do wish you wouldnt do that the ducks dont like it and frankly i dont much care for it either if you persist i will have no choice but to disassemble you and put you back together the wrong way as you can imagine that will hurt a lot do i make myself clear robert nodded albeit with some difficulty as he was still upside down yes he said perfectly now say sorry to the ducks theres a good chap sorry ducks said robert right then off you go toodlepip robert was put back surprisingly gently on the bank he found that all of the ducks were watching him and quacking if he hadnt known better he might have thought that they were laughing over time other people reported similar odd encounters at miggins pond but instead of calling in investigators or selling tickets the people of biddlecombe simply kept quiet about it and gave miggins pond a wide berth whenever they could in the staff room at montague rhodes james secondary school mr hume sat staring intently at the head of a pin during the halloween disturbances mr hume had been forced to lock himself in a closet while a band of sixinchhigh demons dressed as elves shouted at him through the keyhole the whole experience had shaken him a great deal and when he had learned of samuel johnsons involvement in the affair he began to consider that the boy might know something about angels and pins that he didnt so he stared hard at the pin and wondered and on the head of the pin two angels who had been performing a very nice waltz surrounded by lots of other waltzing angels suddenly stopped what they were doing as one turned to the other and said dont look now but that blokes back one night almost a month after the events of halloween when everyone was getting ready for december and christmas samuel was in the bathroom brushing his teeth boswell watched him from the doorway his leg still encased in plaster but otherwise his clever contented self samuel had just taken a bath and the mirror was steamed up he reached out and wiped some of the steam away he glimpsed his reflection and standing behind him the reflection of another it was mrs abernathy samuel looked round in fright the bathroom was empty yet mrs abernathy was still visible in the mirror her lips moved speaking words that samuel could not hear as he watched she moved forward a finger reached out and began to write from behind the glass in the steam of the mirror when she was finished there were four words visible they were this is not over a blue light flickered in her eyes and then she was gone xxxiii in which we bid farewell to nurd for now in the great wasteland wormwood stared at the aston martin that had accompanied nurd back to his kingdom what is it asked wormwood its a car said nurd its called an aston martin nurd was surprised that the car had made it to the wasteland in one piece although not as surprised as he was that he himself had done so with only minor injuries after all it wasnt every day that one went the wrong way through an interdimensional portal wearing a blanket and driving a very fast car he had already decided that if any curious demons asked him how the car had got here assuming any of them could be bothered to investigate the wasteland hell being a very big place with more interesting areas to explore he would tell them that it had dropped out of the sky after all who would suspect nurd that most inept of demons of being responsible for thwarting the great malevolence and his invading army what does it do asked wormwood it moves it moves very fast oh and we watch it move fast do we it sounded like fun to wormwood although not much fun actually he was quite pleased that nurd was back it had been a bit quiet without him and the throne hadnt been very comfortable to sit on funny that for so long wormwood had desired the throne and then when hed had it it hadnt been worth desiring after all no wormwood said nurd patiently his trip to the world of men and his encounter with samuel had mellowed him and he was no longer immediately inclined to hit wormwood for being a bit dim although he had a feeling that this wouldnt last we sit in it and then we go fast too wormwood looked doubtful but eventually he was convinced to sit in the passenger seat his seat belt fastened and a concerned expression on his face beside him nurd started the engine it growled pleasantly but where will we go asked wormwood somewhere else said nurd after all anywhere is better than here and how far will we get nurd pointed at one of the bubbling black pools that broke the monotonous landscape of the wasteland you see those pools wormwood wormwood nodded hed been looking at the pools for so long that they almost qualified as old friends if hed known his birthday hed have invited the pools to the party well nurd continued whats in those pools is remarkably similar to what makes this car go hell wormwood is our oyster whats an oyster nurd who didnt know either but had seen the phrase the world is your oyster in the car showroom and had rather liked the sound of it began to reconsider his decision not to hit wormwood quite so often it doesnt matter he said he took a paper bag from his pocket the bag contained the last of the jelly beans that samuel had given to him nurd had been saving them but now he offered one to wormwood and took the final sweetie for himself to samuel he said and wormwood who had heard so much about the boy from nurd echoed his master to samuel the multiverse was unfathomably huge thought nurd but it was still small enough to allow two strangers like samuel and himself to find each other and become friends together nurd and wormwood drove off the car growing smaller and smaller disappearing into the distance until all that was left to indicate that anyone had ever been there was a throne
