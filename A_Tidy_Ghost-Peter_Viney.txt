their nightclothes on the floor they were usually very tidy people but there wasnt enough time when they got home rick went upstairs first marilyn he said come up here marilyn walked into the bedroom

their coffee cups on the table when they got home the coffee cups had been washed up and were standing on the table rick laughed maybe theres a ghost in the house he said a very tidy ghost dont be silly she said its a new house not an old castle theres no ghost suddenly there was a flash of lightning and the noise of thunder it started raining she looked out of the window rick she said there

to be high trees farm they knocked down the farm five maybe six years ago have you got an old map she asked yes ill find it for you said the man when rick came out of the office marilyn was waiting in the car she opened the door rick she said i went to the library today why he said you dont believe there really is a ghost do you i found an old map of the area she said there used to be a farm the estate is built on an old farm so said rick i looked at the map the farmhouse used to be where balmoral avenue is now it used to be right in the middle of balmoral avenue yes well our house number thirtyfive is right in the middle of the avenue perhaps our house is just where the farmhouse used to be i looked in another book the farmhouse was built about two hundred years ago that doesnt mean theres a ghost there are thousands of old houses with no ghost stories anyway i dont believe in ghosts and neither do you until today said marilyn can you explain about the newspaper in the cupboard the letters the bed that was made the clean coffee cups the light in the bathroom weve been very busy said rick weve been busy at work and weve been working hard in our free time on the house were forgetting things thats all i hope so rick she said i hope so they arrived home marilyn opened the door and turned on the light there on the hall table was a neat pile of letters chapter six murder at the old farm a week later there was another surprise and this time they had a row it was the worst row since they had got married they got home as usual at six oclock rick went into the living room

history of this area well the farm belonged to old giles varley he lived there by himself since his wife died that is he was a strange man nobody liked him very much i didnt he used to be a very difficult boss you see everything had to be in the right place dont put that on the shelf he used to say to me put it in the cupboard and the house ive never seen a place as clean and tidy as that house his wife had always been a very tidy woman and he wanted to keep the house the same yes poor old varley what happened to him said marilyn dont you remember said the old man it was in all the

man marilyn turned round and walked home very slowly when she got home rick was in the garden they had bought a small tree at the weekend and rick was putting it in the front garden he called to her marilyn come here look at this she walked over to him there was a hole in the ground for the tree there were a lot of old bricks in the hole so he said there was a building here before they built this

looked up whats that she said they heard voices outside the front door then they heard the sound of a key in the lock rick jumped up what they heard footsteps in the hall its a very nice hall it was a mans voice rick and marilyn looked at each other then the living room door began to open marilyn took ricks hand two men and a woman walked into the room they stopped in surprise what are you doing
