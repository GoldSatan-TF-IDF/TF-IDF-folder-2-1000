cathedral courtship by kate douglas wiggin illustrated by charles e brock gay and bird bedford street strand london all rights reserved originally published in with penelopes english experiences and reprinted twice preface a cathedral courtship was first published in appearing in a volume with penelopes english experiences in course of time the latter story finding unexpected favour in the public eyes left its modest companion and was promoted to a separate existence with pictures and covers of its own then something rather curious occurred one of those trifles which serve to make a publishers life an exciting if not a happy one when the gentle reader bless his or her warm and irrational heart could no longer buy a cathedral courtship a new desire for it sprang into being and when the demands became sufficiently ardent and numerous it was decided to republish the story with illustrations by mr charles e brock an artist who can be relied upon to put new energy into a live tale or resuscitate a dead one at this point the author having presumably grown in knowledge of grammar spelling and punctuation was asked to revise the text and being confronted with the printed page was overcome by the temptation to add now and then a sentence line or paragraph while the charming shade of miss kitty schuyler perched on every exclamation point begging permission to say a trifle just a trifle more you might allow me to explain myself just there she coaxed and if you have told them all i was supposed to be thinking in winchester or salisbury or oxford why not tell them what i thought in bath or peterborough or ely it was awfully interesting jack copley too clamoured to be heard still further on the subject of his trueloves charms so the author yielded to this twofold pressure and added a few corroborative details the little courtship running its placid course through sleepy cathedral towns has not been altered in the least by these new pages it is only as if the storyteller meeting a new pair of interested eyes had almost unconsciously drifted into fresh confidences kate douglas wiggin this is all quite true and anyway we have said nothing that we are a bit ashamed of kitty schuyler x jack copley their mark london july list of illustrations jack jack save me frontispiece it would ardly be a substitute for gooseberrytart miss i offered it to her with distinguished grace i was disconcerted at being found in a dramshop alone she ignores the babble of contemporaneous lovers lor miss said farmer hendry he havent been pastured there for three weeks a cathedral courtship she winchester may the royal garden inn we are doing the english cathedral towns aunt celia and i aunt celia has an intense desire to improve my mind papa told her when we were leaving cedarhurst that he wouldnt for the world have it too much improved and aunt celia remarked that so far as she could judge there was no immediate danger with which exchange of hostilities they parted we are travelling under the yoke of an iron itinerary warranted neither to bend nor break it was made out by a young high church curate in new york and if it were a creed or a document that had been blessed by all the bishops and popes it could not be more sacred to aunt celia she is awfully high church and i believe she thinks this tour of the cathedrals will give me a taste for ritual and bring me into the true fold mamma was a unitarian and so when she was alive i generally attended service at that church aunt celia says it is not a church that the most you can say for it is that it is a belief rather loosely and carelessly formulated she also says that dear old dr kyle is the most dangerous unitarian she knows because he has leanings towards christianity long ago in her youth aunt celia was engaged to a young architect he with his triangles and tsquares and things succeeded in making an imaginary scaledrawing of her heart up to that time a virgin forest an unmapped territory which enabled him to enter in and set up a pedestal there on which he has remained ever since he has been only a memory for many years to be sure for he died at the age of twentysix before he had had time to build anything but a livery stable and a country hotel this is fortunate on the whole because aunt celia thinks he was destined to establish american architecture on a higher plane rid it of its base timeserving imitative instincts and waft it to a height where in the course of centuries it would have been revered and followed by all the nations of the earth i went to see the stable after one of these miriamlike flights of prophecy on the mighthavebeen it isnt fair to judge a mans promise by one modest performance and so i shall say nothing save that i am sure it was the charm of the man that won my aunts affection not the genius of the builder this sentiment about architecture and this fondness for the very toppingest high church ritual cause aunt celia to look on the english cathedrals with solemnity and reverential awe she has given me a fat notebook with katharine schuyler stamped in gold letters on the russialeather cover and a lock and key to conceal its youthful inanities from the general public i am not at all the sort of girl who makes notes and i have told her so but she says that i must at least record my passing impressions if they are ever so trivial and commonplace she also says that ones language gains unconsciously in dignity and sobriety by being set down in black and white and that a liberal use of pen and ink will be sure to chasten my extravagances of style i wanted to go directly from southampton to london with the abbotts our ship friends who left us yesterday roderick abbott and i had had a charming time on board ship more charming than aunt celia knows because she was very ill and her natural powers of chaperoning were severely impaired and the prospect of seeing london sights together was not unpleasing but roderick abbott is not in aunt celias itinerary which reads winchester salisbury bath wells gloucester oxford london ely peterborough lincoln york durham these are the cathedrals aunt celias curate chose to visit and this is the order in which he chose to visit them canterbury was too far east for him and exeter was too far west but he suggests ripon and hereford if strength and time permit aunt celia is one of those persons who are born to command and when they are thrown in contact with those who are born to be commanded all goes as merry as a marriage bell otherwise not so here we are at winchester and i dont mind all the roderick abbotts in the universe now that i have seen the royal garden inn its pretty coffeeroom opening into the oldfashioned garden with its borders of clovepinks its aviaries and its blossoming horsechestnuts great towering masses of pink bloom aunt celia has driven to st cross hospital with mrs benedict an estimable lady tourist whom she picked up en route from southampton i am tired and stayed at home i cannot write letters because aunt celia has the guidebooks so i sit by the window in indolent content watching the dear little school laddies with their short jackets and wide white collars they all look so jolly and rosy and clean and kissable i should like to kiss the chambermaid too she has a pink print dress no fringe thank goodness its curious our servants cant leave that deformity to the upper classes but shining brown hair plump figure soft voice and a most engaging way of saying yes miss anythink more miss i long to ask her to sit down comfortably and be english while i study her as a type but of course i mustnt sometimes i wish i could retire from the world for a season and do what i like surrounded by the general comfort of being thought mad an elegant irreproachable highminded model of dignity and reserve has just knocked and inquired what we will have for dinner it is very embarrassing to give orders to a person who looks like a justice of the supreme court but i said languidly what would you suggest how would you like a clear soup a good spring soup to begin with miss very much and a bit of turbot next miss with anchovy sauce yes turbot by all means i said my mouth watering at the word and what else miss would you enjoy a young duckling miss with new potatoes and green peas just the thing and for dessert i couldnt think what i ought to order next in england but the highminded model coughed apologetically and correcting my language said i was thinking you might like gooseberrytart and cream for a sweet miss oh that i could have vented my new world enthusiasm in a sigh of delight as i heard those intoxicating words heretofore met only in english novels ye es i said hesitatingly though i was palpitating with joy i fancy we should like gooseberrytart here a bright idea entered my mind and perhaps in case my aunt doesnt care for the gooseberrytart you might bring a lemonsquash please now i had never met a lemonsquash personally but i had often heard of it and wished to show my familiarity with british culinary art it would ardly be a substitute for gooseberrytart miss but shall i bring one lemonsquash miss oh as to that it doesnt matter i said haughtily bring a sufficient number for two persons aunt celia came home in the highest feather she had twice been mistaken for an englishwoman she said she thought that lemonsquash was a drink i thought of course it was a pie but we shall find out at dinner for as i said i ordered a sufficient number for two persons and the headwaiter is not a personage who will let transatlantic ignorance remain uninstructed at four oclock we attended evensong at the cathedral i shall not say what i felt when the whitesurpliced boy choir entered winding down those vaulted aisles or when i heard for the first time that intoned service with all its witchcraft of harmonic sound i sat quite by myself in a high carved oak seat and the hour was passed in a trance of serene delight i do not have many opinions it is true but papa says i am always strong on sentiments nevertheless i shall not attempt to tell even what i feel in these new and beautiful experiences for it has been better told a thousand times illustration it would ardly be a substitute for gooseberrytart miss there were a great many people at service and a large number of americans among them i should think though we saw no familiar faces there was one particularly nice young man who looked like a bostonian he sat opposite me he didnt stare he was too well bred but when i looked the other way he looked at me of course i could feel his eyes anybody can at least any girl can but i attended to every word of the service and was as good as an angel when the procession had filed out and the last strain of the great organ had rumbled into silence we went on a tour through the cathedral a heterogeneous band headed by a conscientious old verger who did his best to enlighten us and succeeded in virtually spoiling my pleasure after we had finished think of finishing a cathedral in an hour or two aunt celia and i with one or two others wandered through the beautiful close looking at the exterior from every possible point and coming at last to a certain ruined arch which is very famous it did not strike me as being remarkable i could make any number of them with a pattern without the least effort but at any rate when told by the verger to gaze upon the beauties of this wonderful relic and tremble we were obliged to gaze also upon the beauties of the aforesaid nice young man who was sketching it as we turned to go away aunt celia dropped her bag it is one of those detestable allabsorbing alldevouring thoroughly respectable but never proud boston bags made of black cloth with leather trimmings c van t embroidered on the side and the top drawn up with stout cords which pass over the boston wrist or arm as for me i loathe them and would not for worlds be seen carrying one though i do slip a great many necessaries into aunt celias i hastened to pick up the horrid thing for fear the nice young man would feel obliged to do it for me but in my indecorous haste i caught hold of the wrong end and emptied the entire contents on the stone flagging aunt celia didnt notice she had turned with the verger lest she should miss a single word of his inspired testimony so we scrambled up the articles together the nice young man and i and oh i hope i may never look upon his face again there were prayerbooks and guidebooks a bath bun a bottle of sodamint tablets a church calendar a bit of gray frizz that aunt celia pins into her cap when she is travelling in damp weather a spectaclecase a brandyflask and a bonbonbox which broke and scattered cloves and peppermint lozenges i hope he guessed aunt celia is a dyspeptic and not intemperate all this was hopelessly vulgar but i wouldnt have minded anything if there had not been a duchess novel of course he thought that it belonged to me he couldnt have known aunt celia was carrying it for that accidental mrs benedict with whom she went to st cross hospital after scooping the cloves out of the cracks in the stone flagging and of course he neednt have done this unless he had an abnormal sense of humour he handed me the tattered disreputablelooking copy of a modern circe with a bow that wouldnt have disgraced a chesterfield and then went back to his easel while i fled after aunt celia and her verger memoranda the winchester cathedral has the longest nave the inside is more superb than the outside izaak walton and jane austen are buried here he winchester may the white swan as sure as my name is jack copley i saw the prettiest girl in the world today an american too or i am greatly mistaken it was in the cathedral where i have been sketching for several days i was sitting at the end of a bench at afternoon service when two ladies entered by the sidedoor the ancient maiden evidently the head of the family settled herself devoutly and the young one stole off by herself to one of the old carved seats back of the choir she was worse than pretty i made a memorandum of her during service as she sat under the dark carvedoak canopy with this latin inscription over her head carlton cum dolby letania ix solidorum super flumina confitebor tibi duc probati there ought to be a law against a womans making a picture of herself unless she is willing to allow an artist to fix her properly in his gallery of types a blackandwhite sketch doesnt give any definite idea of this charmers charms but sometime ill fill it in hair sweet little hat gown and eyes all in golden brown a cape of tawny sable slipping off her arm a knot of yellow primroses in her girdle carvedoak background and the afternoon sun coming through a stainedglass window great jove she had a most curious effect on me that girl i cant explain it very curious altogether new and rather pleasant when one of the choirboys sang oh for the wings of a dove a tear rolled out of one of her lovely eyes and down her smooth brown cheek i would have given a large portion of my modest monthly income for the felicity of wiping away that teardrop with one of my new handkerchiefs marked with a tremendous c by my pretty sister an hour or two later they appeared again the dragon who answers to the name of aunt celia and the nutbrown mayde who comes when she is called katharine i was sketching a ruined arch the dragon dropped her unmistakably boston bag i expected to see encyclop–∂dias and russian tracts fall from it but was disappointed the nutbrown mayde who has been trained in the way she should go hastened to pick up the bag for fear that i a stranger should serve her by doing it she was punished by turning it inside out and i was rewarded by helping her gather together the articles which were many and illassorted my little romance received the first blow when i found that she reads the duchess novels i think however she has the grace to be ashamed of it for she blushed scarlet when i handed her a modern circe i could have told her that such a blush on such a cheek would almost atone for not being able to read at all but i refrained it is vexatious all the same for though one doesnt expect to find perfection here below the nutbrown mayde externally considered comes perilously near it after she had gone i discovered a slip of paper which had blown under some stones it proved to be an itinerary i didnt return it i thought they must know which way they were going and as this was precisely what i wanted to know i kept it for my own use she is doing the cathedral towns i am doing the cathedral towns happy thought why shouldnt we do them together we and aunt celia a fellow whose mother and sister are in america must have some feminine society i had only ten minutes to catch my train for salisbury but i concluded to run in and glance at the registers of the principal hotels found my nutbrown mayde at once in the guestbook of the royal garden inn miss celia van tyck beverly mass usa miss katharine schuyler new york usa i concluded to stay over another train ordered dinner and took an altogether indefensible and inconsistent pleasure in writing john quincy copley cambridge mass directly beneath the charmers autograph she salisbury june the white hart inn we left winchester on the train yesterday and here we are within sight of another superb and ancient pile of stone i wanted so much to stop at the highflyer inn in lark lane but aunt celia said that if we were destitute of personal dignity we at least owed something to our ancestors aunt celia has a temperamental distrust of joy as something dangerous and ensnaring she doesnt realize what fun it would be to date ones letters from the highflyer inn lark lane even if one were obliged to consort with poachers and trippers in order to do it better times are coming however for she was in a melting mood last evening and promised me that wherever i can find an inn with a picturesque and unusual name she will stop there provided it is clean and respectable if i on my part will agree to make regular notes of travel in my russialeather book she says that ever since she was my age she has asked herself nightly the questions pythagoras was in the habit of using as a nightcap what have i learned thats worth the knowing what have i done thats worth the doing what have i sought i should have shunned and into what new follies run i asked her why pythagoras didnt say runned and make a consistent rhyme and she evaded the point by answering that pythagoras didnt write it in english we attended service at three the music was lovely and there were beautiful stainedglass windows by burnejones and morris the verger when wound up with a shilling talked like an electric doll if that nice young man is making a cathedral tour like ourselves he isnt taking our route for he isnt here if he has come over for the purpose of sketching he wouldnt stop with one cathedral unless he is very indolent and unambitious and he doesnt look either of these perhaps he began at the other end and worked down to winchester yes that must be it for the ems sailed yesterday from southampton too bad for he was a distinct addition to the landscape why didnt i say when he was picking up the collection of curios in aunt celias bag you neednt bother about the novel thank you it is not mine and anyway it would be of no use to anybody june we intended to go to stonehenge this morning but it rained so we took a growler and went to the earl of pembrokes country place to see the pictures had a delightful morning with the magnificent antiques curios and portraits the van dyck room is a joy for ever but one really needs a guide or a friend who knows something of art if one would understand these things there were other visitors nobody who looked especially interesting dont like salisbury so well as winchester dont know why we shall drive this afternoon if it is fair and go to bath and wells tomorrow i am glad to say must read baedeker on the bishops palace oh dear if one could only have a good time and not try to know anything memoranda this cathedral has the highest spire remember winchester longest nave salisbury highest spire the lancet style is those curved lines meeting in a rounding or a sharp point like this inverted u shape and then joined together like this the way they scallop babies flannel petticoats gothic looks like triangles meeting together in various spots and joined with a beautiful sort of ornamented knobs i think i recognise gothic when i see it then there is norman early english fully developed early english early and late perpendicular transition and for aught i know a lot of others aunt celia can tell them all apart he salisbury june the red lion i went off on a long tramp this afternoon and coming on a pretty river flowing through green meadows with a fringe of trees on either side i sat down to make a sketch i heard feminine voices in the vicinity but as these are generally a part of the landscape in the tourist season i paid no special notice suddenly a dainty patentleather shoe floated towards me on the surface of the stream it evidently had just dropped in for it was right side up with care and was disporting itself most merrily did ever joves tree drop such fruit i quoted as i fished it out on my stick and just then i heard a distressed voice saying oh aunt celia ive lost my smart little london shoe i was sitting in a tree taking a pebble out of the heel when i saw a caterpillar and i dropped it into the river the shoe you know not the caterpillar illustration i offered it to her with distinguished grace hereupon she came in sight and i witnessed the somewhat unusual spectacle of my nutbrown mayde hopping like a divine stork on one foot and ever and anon emitting a feminine shriek as the other clad in a delicate silk stocking came in contact with the ground i rose quickly and polishing the patent leather ostentatiously inside and out with my handkerchief i offered it to her with distinguished grace she sat hurriedly down on the ground with as much dignity as possible and then recognising me as the person who picked up the contents of aunt celias bag she said dimpling in the most distracting manner thats another thing there ought to be a law against thank you again you seem to be a sort of knighterrant shall i assist you i asked i might have known that this was going too far of course i didnt suppose she would let me help her put the shoe on but i thought upon my soul i dont know what i thought for she was about a million times prettier today than yesterday no thank you she said with polar frigidity goodafternoon and she hopped back to her aunt celia without another word i dont know how to approach aunt celia she is formidable by a curious accident of feature for which she is not in the least responsible she always wears an unfortunate expression as of one perceiving some offensive odour in the immediate vicinity this may be a mere accident of high birth it is the kind of nose often seen in the first families and her name betrays the fact that she is of good old knickerbocker origin we go to wells tomorrow at least i think we do she salisbury june i didnt like salisbury at first but i find it is the sort of place that grows on one the longer one stays in it i am quite sorry we must leave so soon but aunt celia is always in haste to be gone bath may be interesting but it is entirely out of the beaten path from here she bath june the best hotel i met him at wells and again this afternoon here we are always being ridiculous and he is always rescuing us aunt celia never really sees him and thus never recognises him when he appears again always as the flower of chivalry and guardian of ladies in distress i will never again travel abroad without a man even if i have to hire one from a feebleminded asylum we work like galleyslaves aunt celia and i finding out about trains and things neither of us can understand bradshaw and i cant even grapple with the lesser intricacies of the a b c railway guide the trains so far as i can see always arrive before they go out and i can never tell whether to read up the page or down it is certainly very queer that the stupidest man that breathes one that barely escapes idiocy can disentangle a railway guide when the brightest woman fails even the boots at the inn in wells took my book and rubbing his frightfully dirty finger down the row of puzzling figures found the place in a minute and said there ye are miss it is very humiliating i suppose there are bradshaw professorships in the english universities but the boots cannot have imbibed his knowledge there a traveller at table dh—Ñte dinner yesterday said there are three classes of bradshaw trains in great britain those that depart and never arrive those that arrive but never depart and those that can be caught in transit going on like the wheel of eternity with neither beginning nor end all the time i have left from the study of routes and hotels i spend on guidebooks now im sure that if any one of the men i know were here he could tell me all that is necessary as we walk along the streets i dont say it in a frivolous or sentimental spirit in the least but i do affirm that there is hardly any juncture in life where one isnt better off for having a man about i should never dare divulge this to aunt celia for she doesnt think men very nice she excludes them from conversation as if they were indelicate subjects but to go on we were standing at the door of ye crowne and keys at wells waiting for the fly which we had ordered to take us to the station when who should drive up in a fourwheeler but the flower of chivalry aunt celia was saying very audibly we shall certainly miss the train if the man doesnt come at once pray take this cab said the flower of chivalry i am not leaving for an hour or more aunt celia got in without a murmur i sneaked in after her not daring to lift my eyes i dont think she looked at him though she did vouchsafe the remark that he seemed to be a civil sort of person i was walking about by myself this afternoon aunt celia and i had taken a long drive and she had dropped me in a quaint old part of the town that i might have a brisk walk home for exercise suddenly it began to rain which it is apt to do in england between the showers and at the same moment i espied a sign martha huggins licensed victualler it was a nice tidy little shop with a fire on the hearth and flowers in the window and i thought no one would catch me if i stepped inside to chat with martha until the sun shone again i fancied it would be delightful and dickensy to talk quietly with a licensed victualler by the name of martha huggins just after i had settled myself the flower of chivalry came in and ordered ale i was disconcerted at being found in a dramshop alone for i thought after the bag episode he might fancy us a family of inebriates but he didnt evince the slightest astonishment he merely lifted his hat and walked out after he had finished his ale he certainly has the loveliest manners and his hair is a more beautiful colour every time i see him and so it goes on and we never get any further i like his politeness and his evident feeling that i cant be flirted and talked with like a forward boardingschool miss but i must say i dont think much of his ingenuity of course one cant have all the virtues but if i were he i would part with my distinguished air my charming ease in fact almost anything if i could have in exchange a few grains of commonsense just enough to guide me in the practical affairs of life illustration i was disconcerted at being found in a dramshop alone i wonder what he is he might be an artist but he doesnt seem quite like an artist or just a dilettante but he doesnt look in the least like a dilettante or he might be an architect i think that is the most probable guess of all perhaps he is only going to be one of these things for he cant be more than twentyfive or twentysix still he looks as if he were something already that is he has a kind of selfreliance in his mien not selfassertion nor selfesteem but belief in self as if he were able and knew that he was able to conquer circumstances aunt celia wouldnt stay at ye olde bell and horns here she looked under the bed which i insist was an unfair test and ordered her luggage to be taken instantly to the grand pump room hotel memoranda bath became distinguished for its architecture and popular as a fashionable resort in the th century from the deserved repute of its waters and through the genius of two men wood the architect and beau nash master of ceremonies a true picture of the society of the period is found in smolletts humphry clinker which aunt celia says she will read and tell me what is necessary remember the window of the seven lights in the abbey church the one with the angels ascending and descending also the rich perp chantry of prior bird s of chancel it is murray who calls it a perp chantry not i she june it was very wet this morning and i had breakfast in my room the maids name is hetty precious and i could eat almost anything brought me by such a beautifully named person a little parcel postmarked bath was on my tray but as the address was printed i have no clue to the sender it was a wee copy of jane austens persuasion which i have read before but was glad to see again because i had forgotten that the scene is partly laid in bath and now i can follow dear anne and vain sir walter hateful elizabeth and scheming mrs clay through camden place and bath street union street milsom street and the pump yard i can even follow them to the site of the white hart hotel where the adorable captain wentworth wrote the letter to anne after more than two hundred pages of suspense with what joy and relief did i read that letter i wonder if anne herself was any more excited than i at first i thought roderick abbott sent the book until i remembered that his literary taste is puck in america and pickmeup and titbits in england and now i dont know what to think i turned to captain wentworths letter in the last chapter but one oh it is a beautiful letter i wish somebody would ever write me that he is half agony half hope and that i pierce his soul of course it would be wicked to pierce a soul and of course they wouldnt write that way nowadays but there is something perfectly delightful about the expression well when i found the place what do you suppose some of the sentences in the letter seem to be underlined ever so faintly so faintly indeed that i cannot quite decide whether its my imagination or a leadpencil but this is the way it seems to look i can listen no longer in silence underlined i must speak to you by such means as are within my reach you pierce my soul i am half agony half hope tell me not that i am too late that such precious feelings are gone for ever i offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it eight years and a half ago dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman that his love has an earlier death i have loved none but you unjust i may have been weak and resentful i have been but never inconstant underlined you alone have brought me to bath for you alone i think and plan have you not seen this can you fail to have understood my wishes i had not waited even these ten days could i have read your feelings as i think you must have penetrated mine i can hardly write i am every instant hearing something which overpowers me you sink your voice but i can distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others too good too excellent creature you do us justice indeed you do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men believe it to be most fervent most undeviating in f w of course this means nothing somebody has been reading the book and marked it idly as he or she read i can imagine someones underlining a splendid sentiment like dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman but why should a reader lay stress on such a simple sentence as you alone brought me to bath he gloucester june the golden slipper nothing accomplished yet her aunt is a van tyck and a stiff one too i am a copley and that delays matters much depends upon the manner of approach a false move would be fatal we have seven more towns as per itinerary and if their thirst for cathedrals isnt slaked when these are finished we have the entire continent to do if i could only succeed in making an impression on the retina of aunt celias eye though i have been under her feet for ten days she never yet has observed me this absentmindedness of hers serves me ill now but it may prove a blessing later on i made two modest moves on the chessboard of fate yesterday but they were so very modest and mysterious that i almost fear they were never noticed she gloucester june in impossible lodgings chosen by me something else awfully exciting has happened when we walked down the railway platform at bath i saw a pink placard pasted on the window of a firstclass carriage it had van tyck reserved written on it after the english fashion and we took our places without question presently aunt celias eyes and mine alighted at the same moment on a bunch of yellow primroses pinned on the stuffed back of the most comfortable seat next the window they do things so well in england said aunt celia admiringly the landlord must have sent my name to the guard you see the advantage of stopping at the best hotels katharine but one would not have suspected him capable of such a refined attention as the bunch of flowers you must take a few of them dear you are so fond of primroses oh i am having a delicious time abroad i do think england is the most interesting country in the world and as for the cathedral towns how can anyone bear to live anywhere else she oxford june the mitre it was here in oxford that a grain of commonsense entered the brain of the flower of chivalry you might call it the dawn of reason we had spent part of the morning in high street the noblest old street in england as our dear hawthorne calls it as wordsworth had written a sonnet about it aunt celia was armed for the fray a volume of wordsworth in one hand and one of hawthorne in the other i wish baedeker and murray didnt give such full information about what one ought to read before one can approach these places in a proper spirit when we had done high street we went to magdalen college and sat down on a bench in addisons walk where aunt celia proceeded to store my mind with the principal facts of addisons career and his influence on the literature of the something or other century the cramming process over we wandered along and came upon him sketching a shady corner of the walk aunt celia went up behind him and van tyck though she is she could not restrain her admiration of his work i was surprised myself i didnt suppose so goodlooking a youth could do such good work i retired to a safe distance and they chatted together he offered her the sketch she refused to take advantage of his kindness he said he would dash off another that evening and bring it to our hotel so glad to do anything for a fellowcountryman etc i peeped from behind a tree and saw him give her his card it was an awful moment i trembled but she read it with unmistakable approval and gave him her own with an expression that meant yours is good but beat that if you can she called to me and i appeared mr john quincy copley cambridge was presented to her niece miss katharine schuyler new york it was over and a very small thing to take so long about too he is an architect and of course has a smooth path into aunt celias affections theological students ministers missionaries heroes and martyrs she may distrust but architects never he is an architect my dear katharine and he is a copley she told me afterwards i never knew a copley who was not respectable and many of them have been more after the introduction was over aunt celia asked him guilelessly if he had visited any other of the english cathedrals any others indeed this to a youth who had been all but in her lap for a fortnight it was a blow but he rallied bravely and with an amused look in my direction replied discreetly that he had visited most of them at one time or another i refused to let him see that i had ever noticed him before that is particularly i wish i had had an opportunity of talking to him of our plans but just as i was leading the conversation into the proper channels the waiter came in for breakfast orders as if it mattered what one had for breakfast or whether one had any at all i can understand an interest in dinner or even in luncheon but not in breakfast at least not when more important things are under consideration memoranda the very stones and mortar of this historic town seem impregnated with the spirit of restful antiquity extract from one of aunt celias letters among the great men who have studied here are the prince of wales duke of wellington gladstone sir robert peel sir philip sidney william penn john locke the two wesleys ruskin ben jonson and thomas otway look otway up he oxford june the angel i have done it and if i hadnt been a fool and a coward i might have done it a week ago and spared myself a good deal of delicious torment how sweet must be loves self possessed when but loves shadows are so rich in joy or something of that sort i have just given two hours to a sketch of addisons walk and carried it to aunt celia at the mitre object to find out whether they make a long stay in london our next point and if so where it seems they stop only a night i said in the course of conversation so miss schuyler is willing to forego a london season marvellous selfdenial my niece did not come to europe for a london season replied miss van tyck we go through london this time merely as a cathedral town simply because it chances to be where it is geographically we shall visit st pauls and westminster abbey and then go directly on that our chain of impressions may have absolute continuity and be free from any disturbing elements oh but she is lovely is aunt celia london a cathedral town now for my part i should like to drop st pauls for once and omit westminster abbey for the moment and sit on the top of a bus with miss schuyler or in a hansom jogging up and down piccadilly the hansom should have bouquets of paperflowers in the windows and the horse should wear carnations in his headstall and miss schuyler should ask me questions to which i should always know the right answers this would be but a prelude for i should wish later to ask her questions to which i should hope she would also know the right answers heigho i didnt suppose that anything could be lovelier than that girls smile but there is and it is her voice i shall call there again tomorrow morning i dont know on what pretext but i shall call for my visit was curtailed this evening by the entrance of the waiter who asked what they would have for breakfast miss van tyck said she would be disengaged in a moment so naturally i departed with a longing to knock the impudent waiters head against the uncomprehending wall breakfast indeed a fellow can breakfast regularly and yet be in a starving condition he oxford june the angel i have just called they have gone gone hours before they intended how shall i find her in london he london june walsingham house hotel as a cathedral town london leaves much to be desired there are too many hotels too many people and the distances are too great for ten hours i kept a hansom galloping between st pauls and westminster abbey with no result i am now going to ely where i shall stay in the cathedral from morning till night and have my meals brought to me on a tray by the verger she ely june at miss kettlestrings lodgings i have lost him he was not at st pauls or westminster in london great cruel busy brutal london that could swallow up any precious thing and make no sign and he is not here they say it is a very fine cathedral memoranda the octagon is perhaps the most beautiful and original design to be found in the whole range of gothic architecture remember also the retrochoir the lower tier of windows consists of three long lancets with groups of purbeck shafts at the angles the upper of five lancets diminishing from the centre and set back as in the clerestory within an arcade supported by shafts i dont believe even he could make head or tail of this remember the curious bosses under the brackets of the stone altar in the alcock chapel they represent ammonites projecting from their shells and biting each other if i were an ammonite i know i should bite aunt celia look up ammonite he ely june the lamb hotel i cannot find her am racked with rheumatic pains sitting in this big empty solitary hollow reverberating damp desolate deserted cathedral hour after hour on to peterborough this evening she peterborough june he is not here the cathedral even the celebrated west front seems to me somewhat overrated catherine of aragon or one of those henry the eighth wives is buried here also mary queen of scots but i am tired of looking at graves viciously tired too of writing in this trumpery notebook we move on this afternoon he peterborough june a few more days of this modern love chase will unfit me for professional work tried to draw the roof of the choir a good specimen of early perp and failed studied the itinerary again to see if it had any unsuspected suggestions in cipher no go york and durham were doublestarred by the aunt celias curate as places for long stops perhaps we shall meet again there lincoln june the black boy inn i am stopping at a beastly little hole which has the one merit of being opposite miss schuylers lodgings for i have found her at last my sketchbook has deteriorated in artistic value during the last two weeks many of its pages while interesting to me as reminiscences will hardly do for family or studio exhibition if i should label them the result would be something like this sketch of a footstool and desk where i first saw miss schuyler kneeling sketch of a carved oak chair miss schuyler sitting in it angel choir heads of miss schuyler introduced into the carving altar screen a row of fulllength miss schuylers holding lilies tomb of a bishop where i tied miss schuylers shoe tomb of another bishop where i had to tie it again because i did it so badly the first time sketch of the shoe the shoelace worn out with much tying sketch of the blessed verger who called her madam when we were walking together sketch of her blush when he did it the prettiest thing in the world sketch of j q copley contemplating the ruins of his heart how are the mighty fallen she lincoln june at miss smallpages castle garden this is one of the charmingest towns we have visited and i am so glad aunt celia has a letter to the canon in residence because it may keep her contented we walked up steep hill this morning to see the jews house but long before we reached it i had seen mr copley sitting on a campstool with his easel in front of him wonderful to relate aunt celia recognised him and was most cordial in her greeting as for me i was never so embarrassed in my life i felt as if he knew that i had expected to see him in london and ely and peterborough though of course he couldnt know it even if he looked for and missed me in those three dreary and overestimated places he had made a most beautiful drawing of the jews house and completed his conquest of aunt celia by presenting it to her i should like to know when my turn is coming but anyway she asked him to luncheon and he came and we had such a cosy homelike meal together he is even nicer than he looks which is saying a good deal more than i should even to a locked book aunt celia dozed a little after luncheon and mr copley almost talked in whispers he was so afraid of disturbing her nap it is just in these trifling things that one can tell a true man courtesy to elderly people and consideration for their weaknesses he has done something in the world i was sure that he had he has a little income of his own but he is too proud and ambitious to be an idler he looked so manly when he talked about it standing up straight and strong in his knickerbockers i like men in knickerbockers aunt celia doesnt she says she doesnt see how a wellbroughtup copley can go about with his legs in that condition i would give worlds to know how aunt celia ever unbent sufficiently to get engaged but as i was saying mr copley has accomplished something young as he is he has built three picturesque suburban churches suitable for weddings and a state lunatic asylum aunt celia says we shall have no worthy architecture until every building is made an exquisitely sincere representation of its deepest purpose a symbol as it were of its indwelling meaning i should think it would be very difficult to design a lunatic asylum on that basis but i didnt dare say so as the idea seemed to present no incongruities to mr copley their conversation is absolutely sublimated when they get to talking of architecture i have just copied two quotations from emerson and am studying them every night for fifteen minutes before i go to sleep im going to quote them some time offhand just after matins when we are wandering about the cathedral grounds the first is this the gothic cathedral is a blossoming in stone subdued by the insatiable demand of harmony in man the mountain of granite blooms into an eternal flower with the lightness and delicate finish as well as the aerial proportion and perspective of vegetable beauty then when he has recovered from the shock of this here is my second nor can any lover of nature enter the old piles of english cathedrals without feeling that the forest overpowered the mind of the builder and that his chisel his saw and plane still reproduced its ferns its spikes of flowers its locust elm pine and spruce memoranda lincoln choir is an example of early english or first pointed which can generally be told from something else by bold projecting buttresses and dogtooth moulding round the abacusses the plural is my own and it does not look right lincoln castle was the scene of many prolonged sieges and was once taken by oliver cromwell he york june the black swan kitty schuyler is the concentrated essence of feminine witchery intuition strong logic weak and the two qualities so balanced as to produce an indefinable charm willpower large but docility equal if a man is clever enough to know how to manage her knowledge of facts absolutely nil but she is exquisitely intelligent in spite of it she has a way of evading escaping eluding and then gives you an intoxicating hint of sudden and complete surrender she is divinely innocent but roguishness saves her from insipidity her looks she looks as you would imagine a person might look who possessed these graces and she is worth looking at though every time i do it i have a rush of love to the head when you find a girl who combines all the qualities you have imagined in the ideal and who has added a dozen or two on her own account merely to distract you past all hope why stand up and try to resist her charm down on your knees like a man say i im getting to adore aunt celia i didnt care for her at first but she is so deliciously blind anything more exquisitely unserviceable as a chaperon i cant imagine absorbed in antiquity she ignores the babble of contemporaneous lovers that any man could look at kitty when he could look at a cathedral passes her comprehension i do not presume too greatly on her absentmindedness however lest she should turn unexpectedly and rend me i always remember that inscription on the backs of the little mechanical french toys quoiquelle soit tr–∏s solidement mont–πe il faut ne pas brutaliser la machine and so my courtship progresses under aunt celias very nose i say progresses but it is impossible to speak with any certainty of courting for the essence of that gentle craft is hope rooted in labour and trained by love illustration she ignores the babble of contemporaneous lovers i set out to propose to her during service this afternoon by writing my feelings on the flyleaf of the hymnbook or something like that but i knew that aunt celia would never forgive such blasphemy and i thought that kitty herself might consider it wicked besides if she should chance to accept me there was nothing i could do in a cathedral to relieve my feelings no if she ever accepts me i wish it to be in a large vacant spot of the universe peopled by two only and those two so indistinguishably blended as it were that they would appear as one to the casual observer so i practised repression though the wall of my reserve is worn to the thinness of threadpaper and i tried to keep my mind on the droning minor canon and not to look at her for that way madness lies she york june high petergate street my taste is so bad i just begin to realize it and i am feeling my growing pains like gwendolen in daniel deronda i admired the stained glass in the lincoln cathedral the other day especially the nuremberg window i thought mr copley looked pained but he said nothing when i went to my room i consulted a book and found that all the glass in that cathedral is very modern and very bad and the nuremberg window is the worst of all aunt celia says she hopes that it will be a warning to me to read before i speak but mr copley says no that the world would lose more in one way than it would gain in the other i tried my quotations this morning and stuck fast in the middle of the first mr copley thinks i have been feeing the vergers too liberally so i wrote a song about it called the ballad of the vergers and the foolish virgin which i sang to my guitar mr copley thinks it is cleverer than anything he ever did with his pencil of course he says that only to be agreeable but really whenever he talks to me in that way i can almost hear myself purring with pleasure we go to two services a day in the minster and sometimes i sit quite alone in the nave drinking in the music as it floats out from behind the choirscreen the litany and the commandments are so beautiful heard in this way and i never listen to the fresh young voices chanting write all these thy laws in our hearts we beseech thee without wanting passionately to be good i love too the joyful burst of music in the te deum thou didst open the kingdom of heaven to all believers i like that word all it takes in foolish me as well as wise aunt celia and yet with all its pomp and magnificence the service does not help me quite so much nor stir up the deep places in me so quickly as dear old dr kyles simpler prayers and talks in the village meetinghouse where i went as a child mr copley has seen it often and made a little picture of it for me with its white steeple and the elmtree branches hanging over it if i ever have a husband i should wish him to have memories like my own it would be very romantic to marry an italian marquis or a hungarian count but must it not be a comfort to two people to look back on the same past we all went to an evening service last night it was an occasion and a famous organist played the minster organ i wonder why choirboys are so often playful and fidgety and uncanonical in behaviour does the choirmaster advertise naughty boys preferred or do musical voices commonly exist in unregenerate bodies with all the opportunities they must have outside of the cathedral to exchange those objects of beauty and utility usually found in boys pockets there is seldom a service where they do not barter penknives old coins or tops generally during the old testament reading a dozen little blacksurpliced probationers sit together in a seat just beneath the choirboys and one of them spent his time this evening in trying to pull a loose tooth from its socket the task not only engaged all his own powers but made him the centre of attraction for the whole probationary row coming home aunt celia walked ahead with mrs benedict who keeps turning up at the most unexpected moments shes going to build a gothicky memorial chapel somewhere and is making studies for it i dont like her in the least but four is certainly a more comfortable number than three i scarcely ever have a moment alone with mr copley for go where i will and do what i please as aunt celia has the most perfect confidence in my indiscretion she is always en –πvidence just as we were turning into the quiet little street where we are lodging i said oh dear i wish that i really knew something about architecture if you dont know anything about it you are certainly responsible for a good deal of it said mr copley i how do you mean i asked quite innocently because i couldnt see how he could twist such a remark as that into anything like sentiment i have never built so many castles in my life as since ive known you miss schuyler he said oh i answered as lightly as i could aircastles dont count the building of aircastles is an innocent amusement enough i suppose he said but im committing the folly of living in mine i then i was frightened when all at once you find you have something precious that you only dimly suspected was to be yours you almost wish it hadnt come so soon but just at that moment mrs benedict called to us and came tramping back from the gate and hooked her supercilious patronizing arm in mr copleys and asked him into the sittingroom to talk over the ladychapel in her new memorial church then aunt celia told me they would excuse me as i had had a wearisome day and there was nothing for me to do but to go to bed like a snubbed child and wonder if i should ever know the end of that sentence and i listened at the head of the stairs shivering but all that i could hear was that mrs benedict asked mr copley to be her own architect her architect indeed that woman ought not to be at large so rich and goodlooking and unconscientious he york july i had just established myself comfortably near to miss van tycks hotel and found a landlady after my own heart in mrs pickles no micklegate when miss van tyck aided and abetted i fear by the romantic miss schuyler elected to change her quarters and i of course had to change too mine is at present a laborious but not unpleasant life the causes of miss schuylers removal as i have been given to understand by the lady herself were some particularly pleasing windowboxes in a lodging in high petergate street boxes overflowing with pink geraniums and white fielddaisies no one she explains could have looked at this house without desiring to live in it and when she discovered during a somewhat exhaustive study of the premises that the maids name was susan strangeways and that she was promised in marriage to a brewers apprentice called sowerbutt she went back to her conventional hotel and persuaded her aunt to remove without delay if miss schuyler were offered a room at the punchbowl inn in the gillygate and a suite at the grand royal hotel in broad street she would choose the former unhesitatingly just as she refused refreshment at the best caterers this afternoon and dragged mrs benedict and me into the little snug where an alluring sign over the door announced a homely cup of tea for twopence but she would outgrow all that or if she didnt i have commonsense enough for two or if i hadnt i shouldnt care a hang is it not a curious dispensation of providence that just when aunt celia is confined to her room with a cold mrs benedict should join our party and spend her days in our company she drove to the merchants hall and the cavalry barracks with us she walked on the city walls with us she even dared the homely tea at the little snug and at that moment i determined i wouldnt build her memorial church for her even at a most princely profit on crossing lendal bridge we saw the river ouse running placidly through the town and a lot of little green boats moored at a landingstage how delightful it would be to row for an hour exclaimed miss schuyler oh do you think so in those tippy boats on a strange river remonstrated mrs benedict the moment i suspected she was afraid of the water i lured her to the landingstage and engaged a boat its a pity that that large flat one has a leak otherwise it would have held three nicely but i dare say we can be comfortable in one of the little ones i said doubtfully shant we be too heavy for it mrs benedict inquired timidly oh i dont think so well get in and try it if we find it sinks under our weight we wont risk it i replied spurred on by such twinkles in miss schuylers eyes as blinded me to everything else i really dont think your aunt would like you to venture miss schuyler said the marplot oh as to that she knows i am accustomed to boating replied miss schuyler and miss schuyler is such an excellent swimmer i added whereupon the marplot and killjoy remarked that if it were a question of swimming she should prefer to remain at home as she had large responsibilities devolving upon her and her life was in a sense not her own to fling away as she might like i assured her solemnly that she was quite quite right and pushed off before she could change her mind after a long interval of silence miss schuyler observed in the voice accompanied by the smile and the glance of the eye that did for me the moment i was first exposed to them you oughtnt to have said that about my swimming because i cant a bit you know i was justified i answered gloomily i have borne too much today and if she had come with us and had fallen overboard i might have been tempted to hold her down with the oar whereupon miss schuyler gave way to such wholehearted mirth that she nearly upset the boat i almost wish she had i want to swim sink die or do any other mortal thing for her we had a heavenly hour it was only an hour but it was the first time i have had any real chance to direct hot shot at the walls of the maiden castle i regret to state that they stood remarkably firm of course i dont wish to batter them down i want them to melt under the warmth of my attack she york july we had a lovely sail on the river ouse this afternoon mrs benedict was timid about boating and did not come with us as a usual thing i hate a cowardly woman but her lack of courage is the nicest trait in her whole character i might almost say the only nice trait mr copley tried in every way short of asking me a direct question to find out whether i had received the marked copy of persuasion in bath but i evaded the point just as we were at the door of my lodging and he was saying goodbye i couldnt resist the temptation of asking why before you knew us at all did you put miss van tyck reserved on the window of the railway carriage at bath he was embarrassed for a moment and then he said well she is you know if you come to that and besides i didnt dare tell the guard the placard i really wanted to put on i shouldnt think a lack of daring your most obvious fault i said cuttingly perhaps not but there are limits to most things and i hadnt the pluck to paste on a pink paper with miss schuyler engaged on it he disappeared suddenly just then as if he wasnt equal to facing my displeasure and i am glad he did for i was too embarrassed for words memoranda in the height of roofs nave and choir york is first of english cathedrals she durham july something or other at farmer hendrys we left york this morning and arrived in durham about eleven oclock it seems there is some sort of an election going on in the town and there was not a single fly at the station mr copley looked about in every direction but neither horse nor vehicle was to be had for love or money at last we started to walk to the village mr copley so laden with our handluggage that he resembled a pack mule we called first at the three tuns where they still keep up the old custom of giving a wee glass of cherrybrandy to each guest on his arrival but alas they were crowded and we were turned from the hospitable door we then made a tour of the inns but not a single room was to be had not for that night nor for two days ahead on account of that same election hadnt we better go on to edinburgh aunt celia i asked as we were resting in the door of the jolly sailor edinburgh never she replied do you suppose that i would voluntarily spend a sunday in those bare presbyterian churches until the memory of these past ideal weeks has faded a little from my memory what leave out durham and spoil the set in her agitation and disappointment she spoke of the cathedrals as if they were souvenir spoons i intended to stay here for a week or more and write up a record of our entire trip from winchester while the impressions were fresh in my mind and i had intended doing the same thing said mr copley that is i hoped to finish off my previous sketches which are in a frightful state of incompletion and spend a good deal of time on the interior of this cathedral which is unusually beautiful at this juncture aunt celia disappeared for a moment to ask the barmaid if in her opinion the constant consumption of malt liquors prevents a more dangerous indulgence in brandy and whisky she is gathering statistics but as the barmaids can never collect their thoughts while they are drawing ale aunt celia proceeds slowly for my part said i with mock humility i am a docile person who never has any intentions of her own but who yields herself sweetly to the intentions of other people in her immediate vicinity are you asked mr copley taking out his pencil yes i said so what are you doing merely taking note of your statement thats all now miss van tyck of course aunt celia appeared at this delightful moment i have a plan to propose i was here last summer with a couple of harvard men and we lodged at a farmhouse about a mile distant from the cathedral if you will step into the coffeeroom for an hour ill walk up to farmer hendrys and see if they will take us in i think we might be fairly comfortable can aunt celia have apollinaris and black coffee after her morning bath i asked i hope katharine said aunt celia majestically i hope that i can accommodate myself to circumstances if mr copley can secure apartments for us i shall be more than grateful so here we are all lodging together in an ideal english farmhouse there is a thatched roof on one of the old buildings and the dairyhouse is covered with ivy and farmer hendrys wife makes a real english curtsey and there are herds of beautiful sleek durham cattle and the butter and cream and eggs and mutton are delicious and i never never want to go home any more i want to live here for ever and wave the american flag on washingtons birthday i am so happy that i feel as if something were going to spoil it all twenty years old today i wish mamma were alive to wish me many happy returns the cathedral is very beautiful in itself and its situation is beyond all words of mine to describe i greatly admired the pulpit which is supported by five pillars sunk into the backs of squashed lions but mr copley when i asked him the period said pure brummagem there is a nice old cell for refractory monks that we agreed will be a lovely place for mrs benedict if we can lose her in it she arrives as soon as they can find room for her at the three tuns memoranda casual remark for breakfasttable or perhaps for luncheon it is a trifle heavy for breakfast since the sixteenth century and despite the work of inigo jones and the great wren not jenny wren christopher architecture has had in england especially no legitimate development this is the only cathedral with a bishops throne or a sanctuary knocker he durham july o child of fortune thy name is j q copley how did it happen to be election time why did the inns chance to be full how did aunt celia relax sufficiently to allow me to find her a lodging why did she fall in love with the lodging when found i do not know i only know fate smiles that kitty and i eat our morning bacon and eggs together that i carve kittys cold beef and pour kittys sparkling ale at luncheon that i go to matins with kitty and dine with kitty and walk in the gloaming with kitty and aunt celia and after a day of heaven like this like lorna doones lover ay and like every other lover i suppose i go to sleep and the roof above me swarms with angels having kitty under it she was so beautiful on sunday she has been wearing her favourite browns and primroses through the week but on sunday she blossomed into blue and white topped by a wonderful hat whose brim was laden with hyacinths she sat on the end of a seat in the nave and there was a capped and gowned crowd of university students in the transept i watched them and they watched her she has the fullest whitest eyelids and the loveliest lashes when she looks down i wish she might never look up and when she looks up i am never ready for her to look down if it had been a secular occasion and she had dropped her handkerchief seveneighths of the students would have started to pick it up but i should have got there first well all this is but a useless prelude for there are facts to be considered delightful warm breathing facts we were coming home from evensong kitty and i i am anticipating for she was still miss schuyler then but never mind we were walking through the fields while mrs benedict and aunt celia were driving as we came across a corner of the bit of meadow land that joins the stable and the garden we heard a muffled roar and as we looked around we saw a creature with tossing horns and waving tail making for us head down eyes flashing kitty gave a shriek we chanced to be near a pair of low bars i hadnt been a college athlete for nothing i swung kitty over the bars and jumped after her but she not knowing in her fright where she was nor what she was doing supposing also that the mad creature like the villain in the play would still pursue her flung herself bodily into my arms crying jack jack save me it was the first time she had called me jack and i needed no second invitation i proceeded to save her in the usual way by holding her to my heart and kissing her lovely hair reassuringly as i murmured you are safe my darling not a hair of your precious head shall be hurt dont be frightened she shivered like a leaf i am frightened she said i cant help being frightened he will chase us i know where is he what is he doing now looking up to determine if i need abbreviate this blissful moment i saw the enraged animal disappearing in the sidedoor of the barn and it was a nice comfortable durham cow that somewhat rare but possible thing a sportive cow is he gone breathed kitty from my waistcoat yes he is gone she is gone darling but dont move it may come again my first too hasty assurance had calmed kittys fears and she raised her charming flushed face from its retreat and prepared to withdraw i did not facilitate the preparations and a moment of awkward silence ensued might i inquire i asked if the dear little person at present reposing in my arms will stay there with intervals for rest and refreshment for the rest of her natural life she withdrew entirely now all but her hand and her eyes sought the ground i suppose i shall have to that is if you think at least i suppose you do think at any rate you look as if you were thinking that this has been giving you encouragement i do indeed decisive undoubted barefaced encouragement i dont think i ought to be judged as if i were in my sober senses she replied i was frightened within an inch of my life i told you this morning that i was dreadfully afraid of bulls especially mad ones and i told you that my nurse frightened me when i was a child with awful stories about them and that i never outgrew my childish terror i looked everywhere about the barn was too far the fence too high i saw him coming and there was nothing but you and the open country of course i took you it was very natural im sure any girl would have done it to be sure i replied soothingly any girl would have run after me as you say i didnt say any girl would have run after you you neednt flatter yourself and besides i think i was really trying to protect you as well as to gain protection else why should i have cast myself on you like a catamount or a catacomb or whatever the thing is yes darling i thank you for saving my life and i am willing to devote the remainder of it to your service as a pledge of my gratitude but if you should take up lifesaving as a profession dear dont throw yourself on a fellow with jack jack she cried putting her hand over my lips and getting it well kissed in consequence if you will only forget that and never never taunt me with it afterwards ill ill well ill do anything in reason yes even marry you he canterbury july the royal fountain i was never sure enough of kitty at first to dare risk telling her about that little mistake of hers she is such an elusive person that i spend all my time in wooing her and can never lay the flattering unction to my soul that she is really won but after aunt celia had looked up my family record and given a provisional consent and papa schuyler had cabled a reluctant blessing i did not feel capable of any further selfrestraint it was twilight here in canterbury and we were sitting on the vineshaded veranda of aunt celias lodging kittys head was on my shoulder there is something very queer about that when kittys head is on my shoulder i am not capable of any consecutive train of thought when she puts it there i see stars then myriads of stars then oh i cant begin to enumerate the steps by which ecstasy mounts to delirium but at all events any operation which demands exclusive use of the intellect is beyond me at these times still i gathered my stray wits together and said kitty yes jack now that nothing but death or marriage can separate us i have something to confess to you yes she said serenely i know what you are going to say he was a cow i lifted her head from my shoulder sternly and gazed into her childlike candid eyes you mountain of deceit how long have you known about it illustration lor miss said farmer hendry he havent been pastured there for three weeks ever since the first oh jack stop looking at me in that way not the very first not when i not when you not when we no not then but the next morning i said to farmer hendry i wish you would keep your savage bull chained up while we are here aunt celia is awfully afraid of them especially those that go mad like yours lor miss said farmer hendry he havent been pastured here for three weeks i keep him six mile away there bent nothing but gentle cows in the home medder but i didnt think that you knew you secretive person i dare say you planned the whole thing in advance in order to take advantage of my fright never i am incapable of such an unnecessary subterfuge besides kitty i could not have made an accomplice of a cow you know then she said with great dignity if you had been a gentleman and a man of honour you would have cried unhand me girl you are clinging to me under a misunderstanding she chester august the grosvenor jack and i are going over this same ground next summer on our wedding journey we shall sail for home next week and we havent half done justice to the cathedrals after the first two we saw nothing but each other on a general background of architecture i hope my mind is improved but oh i am so hazy about all the facts i have read since i knew jack winchester and salisbury stand out superbly in my memory they acquired their ground before it was occupied with other matters i shall never forget for instance that winchester has the longest spire and salisbury the highest nave of all the english cathedrals and i shall never forget so long as i live that jane austen and isaac newt oh dear was it isaac newton or izaak walton that was buried in winchester and salisbury to think that that interesting fact should have slipped from my mind after all the trouble i took with it but i know that it was isaac somebody and that he was buried in well he was buried in one of those two places i am not certain which but i can ask jack he is sure to know the end billing and
