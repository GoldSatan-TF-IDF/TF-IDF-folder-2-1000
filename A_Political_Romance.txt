a political romance sir in my last for want of something better to write about i told you what a world of fending and proving we have had of late in this little village of ours about an oldcastpairofblackplushbreeches which john our parishclerk about ten years ago it seems had made a promise of to one trim who is our sexton and dogwhipper to this you write me word that you have had more than either one or two occasions to know a good deal of the shifty behaviour of this said master trim and that you are astonished nor can you for your soul conceive how so worthless a fellow and so worthless a thing into the bargain could become the occasion of such a racket as i have represented now though you do not say expressly you could wish to hear any more about it yet i see plain enough that i have raised your curiosity and therefore from the same motive that i slightly mentioned it at all in my last letter i will in this give you a full and very circumstantial account of the whole affair but before i begin i must first set you right in one very material point in which i have misled you as to the true cause of all this uproar amongst us which does not take its rise as i then told you from the affair of the breeches but on the contrary the whole affair of the breeches has taken its rise from it to understand which you must know that the first beginning of the squabble was not between john the parishclerk and trim the sexton but betwixt the parson of the parish and the said master trim about an old watchcoat which had many years hung up in the church which trim had set his heart upon and nothing would serve trim but he must take it home in order to have it converted into a warm underpetticoat for his wife and a jerkin for himself against winter which in a plaintive tone he most humbly beggd his reverence would consent to i need not tell you sir who have so often felt it that a principle of strong compassion transports a generous mind sometimes beyond what is strictly right the parson was within an ace of being an honourable example of this very crime for no sooner did the distinct words petticoat poor wife warm winter strike upon his ear but his heart warmed and before trim had well got to the end of his petition being a gentleman of a frank and open temper he told him he was welcome to it with all his heart and soul but trim says he as you see i am but just got down to my living and am an utter stranger to all parishmatters know nothing about this old watchcoat you beg of me having never seen it in my life and therefore cannot be a judge whether tis fit for such a purpose or if it is in truth know not whether tis mine to bestow upon you or not you must have a week or ten days patience till i can make some inquiries about it and if i find it is in my power i tell you again man your wife is heartily welcome to an underpetticoat out of it and you to a jerkin was the thing as good again as you represent it it is necessary to inform you sir in this place that the parson was earnestly bent to serve trim in this affair not only from the motive of generality which i have justly ascribed to him but likewise from another motive and that was by way of making some sort of recompence for a multitude of small services which trim had occasionally done and indeed was continually doing as he was much about the house when his own man was out of the way for all these reasons together i say the parson of the parish intended to serve trim in this matter to the utmost of his power all that was wanting was previously to inquire if any one had a claim to it or whether as it had time immemorial hung up in the church the taking it down might not raise a clamour in the parish these inquiries were the very thing that trim dreaded in his heart he knew very well that if the parson should but say one word to the church wardens about it there would be an end of the whole affair for this and some other reasons not necessary to be told you at present trim was for allowing no time in this matter but on the contrary doubled his diligence and importunity at the vicaragehouse plagued the whole family to death pressed his suit morning noon and night and to shorten my story teazed the poor gentleman who was but in an ill state of health almost out of his life about it you will not wonder when i tell you that all this hurry and precipitation on the side of master trim produced its natural effect on the side of the parson and that was a suspicion that all was not right at the bottom he was one evening sitting alone in his study weighing and turning this doubt every way in his mind and after an hour and a halfs serious deliberation upon the affair and running over trims behaviour throughout he was just saying to himself it must be so when a sudden rap at the door put an end to his soliloquy and in a few minutes to his doubts too for a labourer in the town who deemd himself past his fiftysecond year had been returned by the constable in the militialist and he had come with a groat in his hand to search the parish register for his age the parson bid the poor fellow put the groat into his pocket and go into the kitchen then shutting the study door and taking down the parish register who knows says he but i may find something here about this selfsame watchcoat he had scarce unclasped the book in saying this when he poppd upon the very thing he wanted fairly wrote on the first page pasted to the inside of one of the covers whereon was a memorandum about the very thing in question in these express words memorandum the great watchcoat was purchased and given above two hundred years ago by the lord of the manor to this parishchurch to the sole use and behoof of the poor sextons thereof and their sucessors for ever to be worn by them respectively in wintery cold nights in ringing complines passingbells c which the said lord of the manor had done in piety to keep the poor wretches warm and for the good of his own soul for which they were directed to pray c c c c just heaven said the parson to himself looking upwards what an escape have i had give this for an underpetticoat to trims wife i would not have consented to such a desecration to be primate of all england nay i would not have disturbd a single button of it for half my tythes scarce were the words out of his mouth when in pops trim with the whole subject of the exclamation under both his arms i say under both his arms for he had actually got it rippd and cut out ready his own jerkin under one arm and the petticoat under the other in order to be carried to the taylor to be made up and had just steppd in in high spirits to shew the parson how cleverly it had held out there are many good similies now subsisting in the world but which i have neither time to recollect or look for which would give you a strong conception of the astonishment and honest indignation which this unexpected stroke of trims impudence impressd upon the parsons looks let it suffice to say that it exceeded all fair description as well as all power of proper resentment except this that trim was ordered in a stern voice to lay the bundles down upon the table to go about his business and wait upon him at his peril the next morning at eleven precisely against this hour like a wise man the parson had sent to desire john the parishclerk who bore an exceeding good character as a man of truth and who having moreover a pretty freehold of about eighteen pounds a year in the township was a leading man in it and upon the whole was such a one of whom it might be said that he rather did honour to his office than that his office did honour to him him he sends for with the churchwardens and one of the sides men a grave knowing old man to be present for as trim had withheld the whole truth from the parson touching the watchcoat he thought it probable he would as certainly do the same thing to others though this i said was wise the trouble of the precaution might have been spared because the parsons character was unblemishd and he had ever been held by the world in the estimation of a man of honour and integrity trims character on the contrary was as well known if not in the world yet at least in all the parish to be that of a little dirty pimping pettifogging ambidextrous fellow who neither cared what he did or said of any provided he could get a penny by it this might i say have made any precaution needless but you must know as the parson had in a manner but just got down to his living he dreaded the consequences of the least ill impression on his first entrance amongst his parishioners which would have disabled him from doing them the good he wished so that out of regard to his flock more than the necessary care due to himself he was resolvd not to lie at the mercy of what resentment might vent or malice lend an ear to accordingly the whole matter was rehearsed from first to last by the parson in the manner ive told you in the hearing of john the parishclerk and in the presence of trim trim had little to say for himself except that the parson had absolutely promised to befriend him and his wife in the affair to the utmost of his power that the watchcoat was certainly in his power and that he might give it him if he pleased to this the parsons reply was short but strong that nothing was in his power to do but what he could do honestly that in giving the coat to him and his wife he should do a manifest wrong to the next sexton the great watchcoat being the most comfortable part of the place that he should moreover injure the right of his own successor who would be just so much a worse patron as the worth of the coat amounted to and in a word he declared that his whole intent in promising that coat was charity to trim but wrong to no man that was a reserve he said made in all cases of this kind and he declared solemnly in verbo sacerdotis that this was his meaning and was so understood by trim himself with the weight of this truth and the great good sense and strong reason which accompanied all the parson said upon the subject poor trim was driven to his last shift and beggd he might be suffered to plead his right and title to the watchcoat if not by promise at least by services it was well known how much he was entitled to it upon these scores that he had blackd the parsons shoes without count and greased his boots above fifty times that he had run for eggs into the town upon all occasions whetted the knives at all hours catched his horse and rubbed him down that for his wife she had been ready upon all occasions to charr for them and neither he nor she to the best of his remembrance ever took a farthing or any thing beyond a mug of ale to this account of his services he beggd leave to add those of his wishes which he said had been equally great he affirmed and was ready he said to make it appear by numbers of witnesses he had drank his reverences health a thousand times by the bye he did not add out of the parsons own ale that he not only drank his health but wishd it and never came to the house but askd his man kindly how he did that in particular about half a year ago when his reverence cut his finger in paring an apple he went half a mile to ask a cunning woman what was good to stanch blood and actually returned with a cobweb in his breeches pocket nay says trim it was not a fortnight ago when your reverence took that violent purge that i went to the far end of the whole town to borrow you a closestool and came back as my neighbours who flouted me will all bear witness with the pan upon my head and never thought it too much trim concluded his pathetick remonstrance with saying he hoped his reverences heart would not suffer him to requite so many faithful services by so unkind a return that if it was so as he was the first so he hoped he should be the last example of a man of his condition so treated this plan of trims defence which trim had put himself upon could admit of no other reply but a general smile upon the whole let me inform you that all that could be said pro and con on both sides being fairly heard it was plain that trim in every part of this affair had behaved very ill and one thing which was never expected to be known of him happening in the course of this debate to come out against him namely that he had gone and told the parson before he had ever set foot in his parish that john his parish clerk his churchwardens and some of the heads of the parish were a parcel of scoundrels upon the upshot trim was kickd out of doors and told at his peril never to come there again at first trim huffd and bounced most terribly swore he would get a warrant then nothing would serve him but he would call a byelaw and tell the whole parish how the parson had misused him but cooling of that as fearing the parson might possibly bind him over to his good behaviour and for aught he knew might send him to the house of correction he let the parson alone and to revenge himself falls foul upon his clerk who had no more to do in the quarrel than you or i rips up the promise of the oldcastpairofblackplushbreeches and raises an uproar in the town about it notwithstanding it had slept ten years but all this you must know is lookd upon in no other light but as an artful stroke of generalship in trim to raise a dust and cover himself under the disgraceful chastisement he has undergone if your curiosity is not yet satisfied i will now proceed to relate the battle of the breeches in the same exact manner i have done that of the watchcoat be it known then that about ten years ago when john was appointed parishclerk of this church this said master trim took no small pains to get into johns good graces in order as it afterwards appeared to coax a promise out of him of a pair of breeches which john had then by him of black plush not much the worse for wearing trim only begging for gods sake to have them bestowed upon him when john should think fit to cast them trim was one of those kind of men who loved a bit of finery in his heart and would rather have a tatterd rag of a better bodys than the best plain whole thing his wife could spin him john who was naturally unsuspicious made no more difficulty of promising the breeches than the parson had done in promising the great coat and indeed with something less reserve because the breeches were johns own and he could give them without wrong to whom he thought fit it happened i was going to say unluckily but i should rather say most luckily for trim for he was the only gainer by it that a quarrel about some six or eight weeks after this broke out between the late parson of the parish and john the clerk somebody and it was thought to be nobody but trim had put it into the parsons head that johns desk in the church was at the least four inches higher than it should be that the thing gave offence and was indecorous inasmuch as it approachd too near upon a level with the parsons desk itself this hardship the parson complained of loudly and told john one day after prayers he could bear it no longer and would have it alterd and brought down as it should be john made no other reply but that the desk was not of his raising that twas not one hair breadth higher than he found it and that as he found it so would he leave it in short he would neither make an encroachment nor would he suffer one the late parson might have his virtues but the leading part of his character was not humility so that johns stiffness in this point was not likely to reconcile matters this was trims harvest after a friendly hint to john to stand his ground away hies trim to make his market at the vicarage what passd there i will not say intending not to be uncharitable so shall content myself with only guessing at it from the sudden change that appeared in trims dress for the better for he had left his old ragged coat hat and wig in the stable and was come forth strutting across the churchyard yclad in a good creditable cast coat large hat and wig which the parson had just given him ho ho hollo john cries trim in an insolent bravo as loud as ever he could bawl see here my lad how fine i am the more shame for you answered john seriously do you think trim says he such finery gaind by such services becomes you or can wear well fye upon it trim i could not have expected this from you considering what friendship you pretended and how kind i have ever been to you how many shillings and sixpences i have generously lent you in your distresses nay it was but tother day that i promised you these black plush breeches i have on rot your breeches quoth trim for trims brain was half turnd with his new finery rot your breeches says he i would not take them up were they laid at my door give em and be dd to you to whom you like i would have you to know i can have a better pair at the parsons any day in the week john told him plainly as his word had once passd him he had a spirit above taking advantage of his insolence in giving them away to another but to tell him his mind freely he thought he had got so many favours of that kind and was so likely to get many more for the same services of the parson that he had better give up the breeches with good nature to some one who would be more thankful for them here john mentioned mark slender who it seems the day before had askd john for em not knowing they were under promise to trim come trim says he let poor mark have em you know he has not a pair to his a besides you see he is just of my size and they will fit him to a t whereas if i give em to you look ye they are not worth much and besides you could not get your backside into them if you had them without tearing them all to pieces every tittle of this was most undoubtedly true for trim you must know by foul feeding and playing the good fellow at the parsons was grown somewhat gross about the lower parts if not higher so that as all john said upon the occasion was fact trim with much ado and after a hundred hums and hahs at last out of mere compassion to mark signs seals and delivers up all right interest and pretentions whatsoever in and to the said breeches thereby binding his heirs executors administrators and assignes never more to call the said claim in question all this renunciation was set forth in an ample manner to be in pure pity to marks nakedness but the secret was trim had an eye to and firmly expected in his own mind the great green pulpitcloth and old velvet cushion which were that very year to be taken down which by the bye could he have wheedled john a second time out of em as he hoped he had made up the loss of his breeches sevenfold now you must know this pulpitcloth and cushion were not in johns gift but in the churchwardens c however as i said above that john was a leading man in the parish trim knew he could help him to them if he would but john had got a surfeit of him so when the pulpitcloth c were taken down they were immediately given john having a great say in it to william doe who understood very well what use to make of them as for the old breeches poor mark slender lived to wear them but a short time and they got into the possession of lorry slim an unlucky wight by whom they are still worn in truth as you will guess they are very thin by this time but lorry has a light heart and what recommends them to him is this that as thin as they are he knows that trim let him say what he will to the contrary still envies the possessor of them and with all his pride would be very glad to wear them after him upon this footing have these affairs slept quietly for near ten years and would have slept for ever but for the unlucky kickingbout which as i said has rippd this squabble up afresh so that it was no longer ago than last week that trim met and insulted john in the public town way before a hundred people taxd him with the promise of the old castpairofblackbreeches notwithstanding trims solemn renunciation twitted him with the pulpitcloth and velvet cushion as good as told him he was ignorant of the common duties of his clerkship adding very insolently that he knew not so much as to give out a common psalm in tune john contented himself with giving a plain answer to every article that trim had laid to his charge and appealed to his neighbours who remembered the whole affair and as he knew there was never any thing to be got in wrestling with a chimneysweeper he was going to take leave of trim for ever but hold the mob by this time had got round them and their high mightinesses insisted upon having trim tried upon the spot trim was accordingly tried and after a full hearing was convicted a second time and handled more roughly by one or more of them than even at the parsons trim says one are you not ashamed of yourself to make all this rout and disturbance in the town and set neighbours together by the ears about an oldwornoutpairofcastbreeches not worth half a crown is there a castcoat or a place in the whole town that will bring you in a shilling but what you have snappd up like a greedy hound as you are in the first place are you not sexton and dogwhipper worth three pounds a year then you beggd the churchwardens to let your wife have the washing and darning of the surplice and churchlinen which brings you in thirteen shillings and four pence then you have six shillings and eight pence for oiling and winding up the clock both paid you at easter the pinders place which is worth forty shillings a year you have got that too you are the bailiff which the late parson got you which brings you in forty shillings more besides all this you have six pounds a year paid you quarterly for being molecatcher to the parish aye says the luckless wight abovementioned who was standing close to him with his plush breeches on you are not only molecatcher trim but you catch stray conies too in the dark and you pretend a licence for it which i trove will be lookd into at the next quarter sessions i maintain it i have a licence says trim blushing as red as scarlet i have a licence and as i farm a warren in the next parish i will catch conies every hour of the night you catch conies cries a toothless old woman who was just passing by this set the mob a laughing and sent every man home in perfect good humour except trim who waddled very slowly off with that kind of inflexible gravity only to be equalled by one animal in the whole creation and surpassed by none i am sir yours c c finis postscript i have broke open my letter to inform you that i missd the opportunity of sending it by the messenger who i expected would have called upon me in his return through this village to york so it has laid a week or ten days by me i am not sorry for the disappointment because something has since happened in continuation of this affair which i am thereby enabled to transmit to you all under one trouble when i finished the above account i thought as did every soul in the parish trim had met with so thorough a rebuff from john the parish clerk and the towns folks who all took against him that trim would be glad to be quiet and let the matter rest but it seems it is not half an hour ago since trim sallied forth again and having borrowed a sowgelders horn with hard blowing he got the whole town round him and endeavoured to raise a disturbance and fight the whole battle over again that he had been used in the last fray worse than a dog not by john the parishclerk for i shoud not quoth trim have valued him a rush single hands but all the town sided with him and twelve men in buckram set upon me all at once and kept me in play at swords point for three hours together besides quoth trim there were two misbegotten knaves in kendal green who lay all the while in ambush in johns own house and they all sixteen came upon my back and let drive at me together a plague says trim of all cowards trim repeated this story above a dozen times which made some of the neighbours pity him thinking the poor fellow crackbraind and that he actually believed what he said after this trim droppd the affair of the breeches and begun a fresh dispute about the reading desk which i told you had occasioned some small dispute between the late parson and john some years ago this readingdesk as you will observe was but an episode wove into the main story by the bye for the main affair was the battle of the breeches and great watchcoat however trim being at last driven out of these two citadels he has seized hold in his retreat of this readingdesk with a view as it seems to take shelter behind it i cannot say but the man has fought it out obstinately enough and had his cause been good i should have really pitied him for when he was driven out of the great watchcoat you see he did not run away no he retreated behind the breeches and when he could make nothing of it behind the breeches he got behind the readingdesk to what other hold trim will next retreat the politicians of this village are not agreed some think his next move will be towards the rear of the parsons boot but as it is thought he cannot make a long stand there others are of opinion that trim will once more in his life get hold of the parsons horse and charge upon him or perhaps behind him but as the horse is not easy to be caught the more general opinion is that when he is driven out of the readingdesk he will make his last retreat in such a manner as if possible to gain the closestool and defend himself behind it to the very last drop if trim should make this movement by my advice he should be left besides his citadel in full possession of the field of battle where tis certain he will keep every body a league off and may pop by himself till he is weary besides as trim seems bent upon purging himself and may have abundance of foul humours to work off i think he cannot be better placed but this is all matter of speculation let me carry you back to matter of fact and tell you what kind of a stand trim has actually made behind the said desk neighbours and townsmen all i will be sworn before my lord mayor that john and his nineteen men in buckram have abused me worse than a dog for they told you that i playd fast and goloose with the late parson and him in that old dispute of theirs about the readingdesk and that i made matters worse between them and not better of this charge trim declared he was as innocent as the child that was unborn that he would be booksworn he had no hand in it he produced a strong witness and moreover insinuated that john himself instead of being angry for what he had done in it had actually thankd him aye trim says the wight in the plush breeches but that was trim the day before john found thee out besides trim there is nothing in that for the very year that thou wast made towns pinder thou knowest well that i both thankd thee myself and moreover gave thee a good warm supper for turning john lunds cows and horses out of my hardcorn close which if thou hadst not done as thou toldst me i should have lost my whole crop whereas john lund and thomas patt who are both here to testify and will take their oaths ont that thou thyself wast the very man who set the gate open and after all it was not thee trim twas the blacksmiths poor lad who turnd them out so that a man may be thankd and rewarded too for a good turn which he never did nor ever did intend trim could not sustain this unexpected stroke so trim marchd off the field without colours flying or his horn sounding or any other ensigns of honour whatever whether after this trim intends to rally a second time or whether trim may not take it into his head to claim the victory no one but trim himself can inform you however the general opinion upon the whole is this that in three several pitchd battles trim has been so trimmd as never disastrous hero was trimmd before him the key this romance was by some mischance or other droppd in the minster yard york and pickd up by a member of a small political club in that city where it was carried and publickly read to the members the last club night it was instantly agreed to by a great majority that it was a political romance but concerning what state or potentate could not so easily be settled amongst them the president of the night who is thought to be as clear and quick lighted as any one of the whole club in things of this nature discovered plainly that the disturbances therein set forth related to those on the continent that trim could be nobody but the king of france by whole shifting and intriguing behaviour all europe was set together by the ears that trims wife was certainly the empress who are as kind together says he as any man and wife can be for their lives the more shame for em says an alderman low to himself agreeable to this key continues the president the parson who i think is a most excellent character is his most excellent majesty king george john the parishclerk is the king of prussia who by the manner of his first entering saxony shewd the world most evidently that he did know how to lead out the psalm and in tune and time too notwithstanding trims vile insult upon him in that particular but who do you think says a surgeon and manmidwife who sat next him whose coatbutton the president in the earnestness of this explanation had got fast hold of and had thereby partly drawn him over to his opinion who do you think mr president says he are meant by the church wardens sidesmen mark slender lorry slim c who do i think says he why why sir as i take the thing the churchwardens and sides men are the electors and the other princes who form the germanick body and as for the other subordinate characters of mark slim the unlucky wight in the plush breeches the parsons man who was so often out of the way c c these to be sure are the several marshals and generals who fought or should have fought under them the last campaign the men in buckram continued the president are the grofs of the king of prussias army who are as stiff a body of men as are in the world and trims saying they were twelve and then nineteen is a wipe for the brussels gazetteer who to my knowledge was never two weeks in the same story about that or any thing else as for the rest of the romance continued the president it sufficiently explains itself the oldcastpairofblackplushbreeches must be saxony which the elector you see has left of wearing and as for the great watchcoat which you know covers all it signifies all europe comprehending at least so many of its different states and dominions as we have any concern with in the present war i protest says a gentleman who sat next but one to the president and who it seems was the parson of the parish a member not only of the political but also of a musical club in the next street i protest says he if this explanation is right which i think it is that the whole makes a very fine symbol you have always some musical instrument or other in your head i think says the alderman musical instrument replies the parson in astonishment mr alderman i mean an allegory and i think the greedy disposition of trim and his wife in ripping the great watchcoat to pieces in order to convert it into a petticoat for the one and a jerkin for the other is one of the most beautiful of the kind i ever met with and will shew all the world what have been the true views and intentions of the houses of bourbon and austria in this abominable coalition i might have called it whoredom nay says the alderman tis downright adulterydom or nothing this hypothesis of the presidents explaind every thing in the romance extreamly well and withall was delivered with so much readiness and air of certainty as begot an opinion in two thirds of the club that mr president was actually the author of the romance himself but a gentleman who sat on the opposite side of the table who had come pipinghot from reading the history of king williams and queen annes wars and who was thought at the bottom to envy the president the honour both of the romance and explanation too gave an entire new turn to it all he acquainted the club that mr president was altogether wrong in every supposition he had made except that one where the great watchcoat was said by him to represent europe or at least a great part of it so far he acknowledged he was pretty right but that he had not gone far enough backwards into our history to come at the truth he then acquainted them that the dividing the great watchcoat did and could allude to nothing else in the world but the partitiontreaty which by the bye he told them was the most unhappy and scandalous transaction in all king williams life it was that false step and that only says he rising from his chair and striking his hand upon the table with great violence it was that false step says he knitting his brows and throwing his pipe down upon the ground that has laid the foundation of all the disturbances and sorrows we feel and lament at this very hour and as for trims giving up the breeches look ye it is almost word for word copied from the french king and dauphins renunciation of spain and the westindies which all the world knew as was the very case of the breeches were renounced by them on purpose to be reclaimd when time should serve this explanation had too much ingenuity in it to be altogether slighted and in truth the worst fault it had seemd to be the prodigious heat of it which as an apothecary who sat next the fire observd in a very low whisper to his next neighbour was so much incorporated into every particle of it that it was impossible under such fermentation it should work its defined effect this however no way intimidated a little valiant gentleman though he sat the very next man from giving an opinion as diametrically opposite as east is from west this gentleman who was by much the best geographer in the whole club and moreover second cousin to an engineer was positive the breeches meant gibraltar for if you remember gentlemen says he tho possibly you dont the ichnography and plan of that town and fortress it exactly resembles a pair of trunkhose the two promontories forming the two slops c c now we all know continued he that king george the first made a promise of that important pass to the king of spain so that the whole drift of the romance according to my sense of things is merely to vindicate the king and the parliament in that transaction which made so much noise in the world a wholesale taylor who from the beginning had resolved not to speak at all in the debate was at last drawn into it by something very unexpected in the last persons argument he told the company frankly he did not understand what ichnography meant but as for the shape of a pair of breeches as he had had the advantage of cutting out so many hundred pairs in his lifetime he hoped he might be allowed to know as much of the matter as another man now to my mind says he there is nothing in all the terraqueous globe a map of which it seems hung up in his workshop so like a pair of breeches unmade up as the island of sicily nor is there any thing if you go to that quoth an honest shoemaker who had the honour to be a member of the club so much like a jackboot to my fancy as the kingdom of italy what the duce has either italy or sicily to do in the affair cries the president who by this time began to tremble for his hypothesis what have they to do why answered the partitiontreaty gentleman with great spirit and joy sparkling in his eyes they have just so much sir to do in the debate as to overthrow your suppositions and to establish the certainty of mine beyond the possibility of a doubt for says he with an air of sovereign triumph over the presidents politicks by the partitiontreaty sir both naples and sicily were the very kingdoms made to devolve upon the dauphin and trims greasing the parsons boots is a devilish satyrical stroke for it exposes the corruption and bribery made use of at that juncture in bringing over the several states and princes of italy to use their interests at rome to stop the pope from giving the investitures of those kingdoms to any body else the pope has not the investiture of sicily cries another gentleman i care not says he for that almost every one apprehended the debate to be now ended and that no one member would venture any new conjecture upon the romance after so many clear and decisive interpretations had been given but hold close to the fire and opposite to where the apothecary sat there sat also a gentleman of the law who from the beginning to the end of the hearing of this case seemd no way satisfied in his conscience with any one proceeding in it this gentleman had not yet opened his mouth but had waited patiently till they had all gone thro their several evidences on the other side reserving himself like an expert practitioner for the last word in the debate when the partitiontreatygentleman had finishd what he had to say he got up and advancing towards the table told them that the error they had all gone upon thus far in making out the several facts in the romance was in looking too high which with great candor he said was a very natural thing and very excusable withall in such a political club as theirs for instance continues he you have been searching the registers and looking into the deeds of kings and emperors as if nobody had any deeds to shew or compare the romance to but themselves this continued the attorney is just as much out of the way of good practice as if i should carry a thing slapdash into the house of lords which was under forty shillings and might be decided in the next countycourt for six shillings and eightpence he then took the romance in his left hand and pointing with the forefinger of his right towards the second page he humbly beggd leave to observe and to do him justice he did it in somewhat of a forensic air that the parson john and sexton shewed incontestably the thing to be tripartite now if you will take notice gentlemen says he these several persons who are parties to this instrument are merely ecclesiastical that the readingdesk pulpit cloth and velvet cushion are tripartite too and are by intendment of law goods and chattles merely of an ecclesiastick nature belonging and appertaining only unto them and to them only so that it appears very plain to me that the romance neither directly nor indirectly goes upon temporal but altogether upon churchmatters and do not you think says he softening his voice a little and addressing himself to the parson with a forced smile do not you think doctor says he that the dispute in the romance between the parson of the parish and john about the height of johns desk is a very fine panegyrick upon the humility of churchmen i think says the parson it is much of the same fineness with that which your profession is complimented with in the pimping dirty pettyfogging character of trim which in my opinion sir is just such another panegyrick upon the honestly of attornies nothing whets the spirits like an insult therefore the parson went on with a visible superiority and an uncommon acuteness as you are so happy sir continues he in making applications pray turn over a page or two to the black lawletters in the romance what do you think of them sir nay pray read the grant of the great watchcoat and trims renunciation of the breeches why there is downright lease and release for you tis the very thing man only with this small difference and in which consists the whole strength of the panegyric that the author of the romance has conveyd and reconveyd in about ten lines what you with the glorious prolixity of the law could not have crowded into as many skins of parchment the apothecary who had paid the attorney the same afternoon a demand of three pounds six shillings and eightpence for much such another jobb was so highly tickled with the parsons repartee in that particular point that he rubbd his hands together most fervently and laughd most triumphantly thereupon this could not escape the attorneys notice any more than the cause of it did escape his penetration i think sir says he dropping his voice a third you might well have spared this immoderate mirth since you and your profession have the least reason to triumph here of any of us i beg quoth he that you would reflect a moment upon the cobweb which trim went so far for and brought back with an air of so much importance in his breeches pocket to lay upon the parsons cut finger this said cobweb sir is a fine spun satyre upon the flimsy nature of one half of the shopmedicines with which you make a property of the sick the ignorant and the unsuspecting and as for the moral of the closestoolpan sir tis too plain does not nine parts in ten of the whole practice and of all you vend under its colours pass into and concenter in that one nasty utensil and let me tell you sir says he raising his voice had not your unseasonable mirth blinded you you might have seen that trims carrying the closestoolpan upon his head the whole length of the town without blushing is a pointed raillery and one of the sharpest sarcasms sir that ever was thrown out upon you for it unveils the solemn impudence of the whole profession who i see are ashamed of nothing which brings in money there were two apothecaries in the club besides the surgeon mentioned before with a chemist and an undertaker who all felt themselves equally hurt and aggrieved by this discourteous retort and they were all five rising up together from their chairs with full intent of heart as it was thought to return the reproof valiant thereupon but the president fearing it would end in a general engagement he instantly calld out to order and gave notice that if there was any member in the club who had not yet spoke and yet did desire to speak upon the main subject of the debate that he should immediately be heard this was a happy invitation for a stammering member who it seems had but a weak voice at the best and having often attempted to speak in the debate but to no purpose had sat down in utter despair of an opportunity this member you must know had got a sad crush upon his hip in the late election which gave him intolerable anguish so that in short he could think of nothing else for which cause and others he was strongly of opinion that the whole romance was a just gird at the late york election and i think says he that the promise of the breeches broke may well and truly signify somebodys else promise which was broke and occasiond to much disturbance amongst us thus every man turnd the story to what was swimming uppermost in his own brain so that before all was over there were full as many satyres spun out of it and as great a variety of personages opinions transactions and truths found to lay hid under the dark veil of its allegory as ever were discovered in the thricerenowned history of the acts of gargantua and pantagruel at the close of all and just before the club was going to break up mr president rose from his chair and beggd leave to make the two following motions which were instantly agreed to without any division first gentlemen says he as trims character in the romance of a shuffling intriguing fellow whoever it was drawn for is in truth as like the french king as it can stare i move that the romance be forthwith printed for continues he if we can but once turn the laugh against him and make him ashamd of what he has done it may be a great means with the blessing of god upon our fleets and armies to save the liberties of europe in the second place i move that mr attorney our worthy member be desired to take minutes upon the spot of every conjecture which has been made upon the romance by the several members who have spoke which i think says he will answer two good ends st it will establish the political knowledge of our club for ever and place it in a respectable light to all the world in the next place it will furnish what will be wanted that is a key to the romance in troth you might have said a whole bunch of keys quoth a whitesmith who was the only member in the club who had not said something in the debate but let me tell you mr president says he that the right key if it could but be found would be worth the whole bunch put together to esq of york sir you write me word that the letter i wrote to you and now stiled the political romance is printing and that as it was dropd by carelessness to make some amends you will overlook the printing of it yourself and take care to see that it comes right into the world i was just going to return you thanks and to beg withal you would take care that the child be not laid at my door but having this moment perused the reply to the dean of yorks answer it has made me alter my mind in that respect so that instead of making you the request i intended i do here desire that the child be filiated upon me laurence sterne prebendary of york c c and i do accordingly own it for my own true and lawful offspring my reason for this is plain for as you see the writer of that reply has taken upon him to invade this incontested right of another mans in a thing of this kind it is high time for every man to look to his own since upon the same grounds and with half the degree of anger that he affirms the production of that very reverend gentlemans to be the child of many fathers some one in his spight for i am not without my friends of that stamp may run headlong into the other extream and swear that mine had no father at all and therefore to make use of bayss plea in the rehearsal for prince prettyman i merely do it as he says for fear it should be said to be no bodys child at all i have only to add two things first that at your peril you do not presume to alter or transpose one word nor rectify one false spelling nor so much as add or diminish one comma or tittle in or to my romance for if you do in case any of the descendents of curl should think fit to invade my copyright and print it over again in my teeth i may not be able in a court of justice to swear strictly to my own child after you had so large a share in the begetting it in the next place i do not approve of your quaint conceit at the foot of the title page of my romance it would only set people on finding a page or two before i give them leave and besides all attempts either at wit or humour in that place are a forestalling of what slender entertainment of those kinds are prepared within therefore i would have it stand thus york printed in the year price one shilling i know you will tell me that it is set too high and as a proof you will say that this last reply to the deans answer does consist of near as many pages as mine and yet is all sold for sixpence but mine my dear friend is quite a different story it is a web wrought out of my own brain of twice the fineness of this which he has spun out of his and besides i maintain it it is of a more curious pattern and could not be afforded at the price that his is sold at by any honest workman in greatbritain moreover sir you do not consider that the writer is interested in his story and that it is his business to set it agoing at any price and indeed from the information of persons conversant in paper and print i have very good reason to believe if he should sell every pamphlet of them he would inevitably be a great loser by it this i believe verily and am dear sir your obliged friend and humble servant laurence sterne sutton on the forest jan to dr topham sir though the reply to the dean of york is not declared in the titlepage or elsewhere to be wrote by you yet i take that point for granted and therefore beg leave in this public manner to write to you in behalf of myself with intent to set you right in two points where i stand concerned in this affair and which i find you have misapprehended and consequently as i hope misrepresented the first is in respect of some words made use of in the instrument signed by dr herring mr berdmore and myself namely to the best of our remembrance and belief which words you have caught hold of as implying some abatement of our certainty as to the facts therein attested whether it was so with the other two gentlemen who signed that attestation with me it is not for me to say they are able to answer for themselves and i desire to do so for myself and therefore i declare to you and to all mankind that the words in the first paragraph to the best of our remembrance and belief implied no doubt remaining upon my mind nor any distrust whatever of my memory from the distance of time nor in short was it my intention to attest the several facts therein as matters of belief but as matters of as much certainty as a man was capable of having or giving evidence to in consequence of this explanation of myself i do declare myself ready to attest the same instrument over again striking out the words to the best of our remembrance and belief which i see have raised this exception to it whether i was mistaken or no i leave to better judges but i understood those words were a very common preamble to attestations of things to which we bore the clearest evidence however dr topham as you have claimed just such another indulgence yourself in the case of begging the deans authority to say what as you affirm you had sufficient authority to say without as a modest and gentlemanlike way of affirmation i wish you had spared either the one or the other of your remarks upon these two passages veniam petimus demusque vicissim there is another observation relating to this instrument which i perceive has escaped your notice which i take the liberty to point out to you namely that the words to the best of our remembrance and belief if they imply any abatement of certainty seem only confined to that paragraph and to what is immediately attested after them in it for in the second paragraph wherein the main points are minutely attested and upon which the whole dispute and main charge against the dean turns it is introduced thus we do particularly remember that as soon as dinner was over c in the second place you affirm that it is not paid that mr sterne could affirm he had heard you charge the dean with a promise in its own nature so very extraordinary as of the commissaryship of the dean and chapter to this i answer that my true intent in subscribing that very instrument and i suppose of others was to attest this very thing and i have just now read that part of the instrument over and cannot for my life affirm it either more directly or expresly than in the words as they there stand therefore please to let me transcribe them but being pressd by mr sterne with an undeniable proof that he dr topham did propagate the said story viz of a promise from the dean to dr topham of the dean and chapters commissaryship dr topham did at last acknowledge it adding as his reason or excuse for so doing that he apprehended or words to that effect he had a promise under the deans own hand of the dean and chapters commissaryship this i have attested and what weight the sanction of an oath will add to it i am willing and ready to give as for mr ricards feeble attestation brought to shake the credit of this firm and solemn one i have nothing to say to it as it is only an attestation of mr ricards conjectures upon the subject but this i can say that i had the honour to be at the deanery with the learned counsel when mr ricard underwent that most formidable examination you speak of and i solemnly affirm that he then said he knew nothing at all about the matter one way or the other and the reasons he gave for his utter ignorance were first that he was then so full of concern at the difference which arose between two gentlemen both his friends that he did not attend to the subject matter of it and of which he declared again he knew nothing at all and secondly if he had understood it then the distance would have put it out of his head by this time he has since scowerd his memory i ween for now he says that he apprehended the dispute regarded something in the deans gift as he could not naturally suppose c tis certain at the deanery he had naturally no suppositions in his head about this affair so that i with this may not prove one of the afterthoughts you speak of and not so much a natural as an artificial supposition of my good friends as for the formidable enquiry you represent him as undergoing let me intreat you to give me credit in what i say upon it namely that it was as much the reverse to every idea that ever was couchd under that word as words can represent it to you as for the learned counsel and myself who were in the room all the time i do not remember that we either of us spoke ten words the dean was the only one that askd mr ricard what he remembered about the affair of the sessions dinner which he did in the most gentlemanlike and candid manner and with an air of as much calmness and seeming indifference as if he had been questioning him about the news in the last brussels gazette what mr ricard saw to terrify him so sadly i cannot apprehend unless the deans gothic bookcase which i own has an odd appearance to a stranger so that if he came terrified in his mind there and with a resolution not to plead he might naturally suppose it to be a great engine brought there on purpose to exercise the peine fort et dure upon him but to be serious if mr ricard told you that this enquiry was most formidable he was much to blame and if you have said it without his express information then you are much to blame this is all i think in your reply which concerns me to answer as for the many coarse and unchristian insinuations scatterd throughout your reply as it is my duty to beg god to forgive you so i do from my heart believe me dr topham they hurt yourself more than the person they are aimed at and when the first transport of rage is a little over they will grieve you more too prima est haec ultio but these i hold to be no answerable part of a controversy and for the little that remains unanswered in yours i believe i could in another half hour set it right in the eyes of the world but this is not my business and is it is thought worth the while which i hope it never will i know no one more able to do it than the very reverend and worthy gentleman whom you have so unhandsomely insulted upon that score as for the supposed compilers whom you have been so wrath and so unmerciful against ill be answerable for it as they are creatures of your own fancy they will bear you no malice however i think the more positively any charge is made let it be against whom it will the better it should be supported and therefore i should be sorry for your own honour if you have not some better grounds for all you have thrown out about them than the mere heat of your imagination or anger to tell you truly your suppositions on this head oft put me in mind of trims twelve men in buckram which his disordered fancy represented as laying in ambush in john the clerks house and letting drive at him all together i am sir your most obedient and most humble servant lawrence sterne sutton on the forest jan ps i beg pardon for clapping this upon the back of the romance which is done out of no disrespect to you but the vehicle stood ready at the door and as i was to pay the whole fare and there was room enough behind it it was the cheapest and readiest conveyance i could think of finis
