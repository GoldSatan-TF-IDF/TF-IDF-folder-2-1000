jack higgins the keys of hell the third book in the paul chavasse series there are no keys to hell the doors are open to all men albanian proverb manhattan one the dream was always the same plunging into the marsh forcing his way through the reeds and mist pushing the punt hard guilio orsini standing at the front finding the way through and then the engine close by breaking into life and a burst of machinegun fire guilio went over headfirst always did and chavasse floundered through the reeds and the bitterly cold water and then mysteriously like a curtain the reeds parted and there was the lagoon and the boat the buona esperanza and orsini was at the rail leaning over a hand outstretched now paul now and chavasse reached and the mist seemed to increase and there was the roaring of the engine and the boat slapped away vanished and he was alone again chavasse was subject to dreams of the past and had always suspected it was a legacy of his breton father an old race the bretons an ancient people but this dream he had not had for some years still he got off the bed went to the window of his suite and looked down at manhattan the lights sparkled in the evening dusk he liked new york and always had there was an excitement there an infinite probability to things when the phone went he answered at once chavasse ah sir paul tino rossi good evening mr rossi listen i know were meeting later for dinner at the saddle room but i wondered whether youd mind coming round to my apartment at the trump tower first is there a purpose to this well my lawyer mario volpe as you may know is my nephew a couple of times removed he seems to think there are a few things he could take care of before our meeting you understand perfectly chavasse said ill send a limousine say half an hour no need as its only a couple of blocks ill walk fine ill look forward to seeing you for dinner later chavasse put down the phone and thought about it a slight frown on his face then he went to the wardrobe took out his rather oldfashioned carpetbag pulled open a flap in the bottom and produced a shortbarreled colt only a but deadly with hollowpoint rounds he checked it out went into the bathroom and turned on the shower in the magnificent sitting room of his trump tower apartment don tino rossi replaced the telephone he was seventysix years of age and still in good shape his silver hair almost shoulderlength his linen suit the best that savile row in london could provide the large man in the black suit with the shaven head came forward as the don nodded opened a silver box offered a cigarette and a light he was aldo vinelli the firms head of security don tinos nephew mario volpe stood by the terrace window smoking a cigarette thirty years of age medium height goodlooking and like rossi impeccably dressed so hes coming why wouldnt he his uncle asked he doesnt want a car hes walking you trust this chavasse as much as he trusts me our meeting in london made sense good ill make arrangements volpe nodded to vinelli i need you he went out the don said quietly aldo i assigned you to protect my nephew because i trust you and youve done a good job thank you don tino and where does your loyalty lie with you always good the don held out his hand aldo kissed it and went out rossi sighed strange that facility hed always had that told him when someone was lying to him a gift from god really before it was fashionable tino rossi alone amongst mafia leaders had realized that life had to change that the old days were long gone he had turned the rossi family to respectability real estate developments in new york the same on the thames in london investments in the electronics industry shipping banking his early start meant that these days his only rivals were the russian mafia the young man he called nephew mario was an important part of the organization hed never known his father and his mother had also died at a young age her widowed sister signora volpe had brought the boy to new york raised him in little italy as don tinos niece her mafia connection had assured the success of her caf√© mario had gone to columbia had taken a law degree later hed done the same thing at london university and was now indispensable to the family on both sides of the atlantic for his legal expertise he returned to the room the don said is everything in hand sure look ill go with aldo and monitor him so hes crazy enough to want to walk alone on a wet night in manhattan but that could be asking for it i mean this is an older guy sixtyfive so im ten years older heh uncle i didnt mean make this work mario nothing is more important you trust this chavasse as i told you no more than he trusts me sir paul chavasse knighted by the queen of england mario so this man is what half english half french he speaks more languages than youve had hot dinners university degrees coming out of his ears in spite of all that a killer by nature for twenty years a field agent for the bureau the most secret of british intelligence units youve seen his record shot three times knifed twice so he was hot stuff more than that mario for the past twenty years hes been belfast bureau chief and thats no desk job not with the ira and all those other problems now he has eastern europe on his back bosnia serbia kosova albania and we know who has the greatest input the russian mafia exactly and as they are not our friends we can help there in return chavasse will help us when possible of course look i suspended all drug operations there years ago and not for moral reasons as you well know if idiots want to kill themselves with heroin thats their affair we make more out of cigarette smuggling from europe into britain than we ever would have with drugs still illegal yes but as you being an expert in english law know a drug runner pulls ten or twelve years get done as the english say for cigarette smuggling and what would your client get twelve months and out in six marco volpe smiled still illegal running cigarettes by the millions up the thames so where does that leave sir paul chavasse exactly as he is a realist were not destroying the lives of stupid teenagers we arent harming the widows and orphans he can live with that as long as we provide the expertise on eastern europe that he needs youll see that we do of course uncle good boy the don nodded you take care of things tell sir paul ill see him later for dinner at the saddle room youd better go now you and aldo to make sure he gets here in one piece uncle mario volpe went out rain battering the window don tino reached for his unfinished glass of champagne such a clever boy all the virtues really and yet capable of such stupidity he swallowed the champagne got up and walked out leaning on his malacca cane when chavasse emerged from the plaza hotel it was raining slightly he wore a burberry trenchcoat in dark blue and an oldfashioned rain hat slanted across his head inside the colt rested in a special clip uncomfortable but also comforting in its own way just a feeling but thats why he was still here after all these years he declined the offer of a cab from the doorman went down the steps and started along fifth avenue waiting in a black mercedes town car mario volpe and vinelli watched him lets go aldo volpe said and dont lose him not that there was much chance of that as they pulled away from the sidewalk not too many people as the rain increased chavasse liked the rain somehow you could inhabit your own private world it was what he called the cinema of the mind time you considered the facts tried to make sense anticipate the other sides next move and there was certainly more to all this than met the eye all his senses the product of forty years of living on the edge told him that not that he distrusted don tino particularly it was more that he didnt trust anyone his special kind of life had taught him that the way eastern europe was the don could be useful which was what his meeting with rossi and vinelli at the dorchester hotel in london had indicated if a few favors in return was the price it was worth it always supposing the price wasnt too high so rossi was a gangster in essence that was what chavasse had been for years you had to be a kind of gangster to be an intelligence agent all that kept you alive really he paused produced a silver case from an inside pocket took out a cigarette and lit it in cupped hands he was standing at the entrance of a darkened mall at the time and for the moment the sidewalk was clear as he started forward a young man darted out of the mall and blocked his way heh buddy you got some change at that moment another one emerged his twin hardfaced in bomber jacket and jeans only he was holding a browning pistol this ones got more than change lets get him in here he rammed the barrel of the browning against chavasses spine and drove him into the darkness all this was seen from the mercedes volpe said those bastards why the gun there was the sound of a shot vinelli braked to a halt and got the door open in the mall the one with the browning rammed it even harder into chavasse a nice fat wallet here id say so lets stay friendly you can call me tommy chavasse raised his right elbow struck backwards into the face turned sideways pushing the browning away grabbed for the barrel twisted it free and had the gun in his hand you should never get that close to anyone he pivoted rammed the barrel of the browning into the back of tommys right knee and pulled the trigger tommy staggered into the wall and fell down with a cry the other one backed away hands raised heh man dont do it vinelli arrived a gun in his hand volpe behind him they looked at tommy lying on the ground and chavasse tendered the browning to vinelli not mine his he looked down at the boy terrible class of muggers these days not too competent volpe held out his hand mario volpe sir paul we were worried about you so i figured wed check the hotel aldo recognized you from london so we were following i mean scum like this what can i say not much i expect can we go now sure volpe turned to vinelli take care of this aldo ill drive sir paul to the trump you follow on foot he took chavasse by the arm and led him away aldo turned reached for the youth who was standing and pulled him close you were supposed to jump him and wait for us to come to the rescue and what do we get a gun for christs sake it was tommy hes on crack really vinelli headbutted him breaking his nose sending him staggering the youth started to weep blood everywhere im sorry mr vinelli but what do i do with tommy you get an ambulance three very large black guys beat up on you and no fairy stories for the cops or the rossi family will see to you on a more permanent basis he opened his wallet and took out ten hundreddollar bills i said a grand and im a man of my word he dropped the money on tommy ill do what you say mr vinelli you better had kid vinelli patted his face turned his collar up against the rain and walked away in the sitting room of the trump tower apartment volpe helped chavasse off with his burberry and placed it on a chair chavasse removed the rain hat and put it on the coat carefully drink sir paul martini champagne irish whisky chavasse told him bushmills for preference anything weve got it all good chavasse took a cigarette from his silver case and then you can tell me exactly what it is you want vinelli came in and stood by the door face impassive volpe got the whisky from the bar by the window and brought it over i dont really want anything sir paul my uncle and you laid it out pretty clear at your meeting in london at the dorchester i mean even aldo here met you but i didnt so i figured it was time i handle all the familys legal business on both sides of the atlantic this whole deal is very important i wanted to familiarize myself with you and why would you want to do that well on occasions well be working together but hell no problem there your record in the intelligence business is amazing and how would you know that bureau records are on file at the public records office in london sure maybe theyre on a fiftyyear hold but there are always ways round that the clerks arent very well paid give them a few bob as you brits say and its amazing what you can get a copy of chavasse finished his whisky he said calmly what you appear to be saying is that youve been checking up on my past record quite illegally yes but weve got to be careful with the london operation does the don know about this of course chavasse nodded so where are we at one case of yours really got to me volpe went to a side table and returned with a file this was so amazing i had it copied read it its good stuff i suppose you wrote it originally ive got phone calls to make to all four quarters of the globe ill be about an hour then ill take you to don tino at the saddle room anything you want aldo will get for you he went out and vinelli stood there face impassive another whisky sir paul i think champagne might be more appropriate chavasse said in excellent italian of course is he for real the boy he is young aldo produced a bottle of bollinger from the bar and chavasse lit another cigarette picked up the file and opened it it was a fiftypage r√©sum√© of certain events in albania in it was headed bureau case study field agent doctor paul chavasse aldo stood at the door still impassive it was very quiet only rain drumming against the window a long time ago chavasse told himself a hell of a long time ago he started to read rome and matano two when chavasse entered the grand ballroom of the british embassy he was surprised to find the chinese delegation clustered around the fireplace looking completely out of place in their blue uniforms and surrounded by the cream of roman society chou enlai surveyed the scene from a large gilt chair the ambassador and his wife beside him and his smooth impassive face gave nothing away occasionally guests of sufficient eminence were brought forward by the first secretary to be introduced the orchestra was playing a waltz chavasse lit a cigarette and leaned against a pillar it was a splendid scene the crystal chandeliers taking light to every corner of the creamandgold ballroom reflected again and again in the mirrored walls beautiful women handsome men dress uniforms the scarlet and purple of church dignitaries it was all strangely archaic as if somehow the mirrors were reflecting a dim memory of long ago dancers turning endlessly to faint music he looked across to the chinese and for a brief instant the white face of chou enlai seemed to jump out of the crowd the eyes fastening on his he nodded slightly as if they knew each other and the eyes seemed to say all these are doomed this is my hour and you and i know it chavasse shivered and for no accountable reason a wave of grayness ran through him it was as if some sixth sense that mystical element common to all ancient races inherited from his breton father were trying to warn him of danger the moment passed the dancers swirled on he was tired that was the trouble four days on the run with no more than a couple of hours of uneasy sleep snatched when it was safe he lit another cigarette and examined himself in the mirror on the wall the dark evening clothes were tailored to perfection outlining good shoulders and a muscular frame but the skin was drawn too tightly over the high cheekbones that were a heritage from his french father and there were dark circles under the eyes what you need is a drink he told himself and behind him in the mirror a young girl came in from the terrace through the french windows chavasse turned slowly her eyes were set too far apart the mouth too generous her dark hair hung loosely to her shoulders and the white silk dress was simplicity itself she wore no accessories none were needed like all great beauties she wasnt beautiful but it didnt matter a damn she made every other woman in the room seem insignificant she moved toward the bar heads turning as she passed and was immediately accosted by an italian air force colonel who was obviously slightly the worse for drink chavasse gave the man enough time to make a thorough nuisance of himself then moved through the crowd to her side ah there you are darling he said in italian ive been looking everywhere for you her reflexes were excellent she turned smoothly assessing him against the general situation in a split second and making her decision she reached up and kissed him lightly on the cheek you said youd only be ten minutes its really too bad of you the air force colonel had already faded discreetly into the crowd and chavasse grinned how about a glass of bollinger i really think we should celebrate i think that would be rather nice mr chavasse she said in excellent english on the terrace perhaps its cooler there chavasse helped himself to two glasses of champagne from the table and followed her through the crowd a slight frown on his face it was cool on the terrace the traffic sounds muted and far away and the scent of jasmine heavy on the night air she sat on the balustrade and took a deep breath isnt it a wonderful night she turned and looked at him and laughter bubbled out of her francesca francesca minetti she held out her hand and chavasse gave her one of the glasses of champagne and grinned you seem to know who i am already she leaned back and looked up at the stars when she spoke it was as if she were reciting a lesson hardlearned paul chavasse born paris father french mother english educated at sorbonne cambridge and harvard universities phd modern languages multilingual university lecturer until since then her voice trailed away and she looked at him thoughtfully chavasse lit a cigarette no longer tired since then well youre on the books as a third secretary but you certainly dont look like one what would you say i did look like he said calmly oh i dont know someone who got about a lot she swallowed some more champagne and said casually how was albania i was surprised you made it out in one piece when the tirana connection went dead we wrote you off she started to laugh again her head back and behind chavasse a voice said is she giving you a hard time paul murchison the first secretary limped across the terrace he was a handsome urbane man face bronzed and healthy the bar of medals a splash of bright color on the left breast of his jacket lets say she knows rather too much about me for my personal peace of mind should do murchison said francesca works for the bureau she was your radio contact last week one of our best operatives chavasse turned you were the one who relayed the message from scutari warning me to get out fast she bowed happy to be of service before chavasse could continue murchison took him firmly by the arm now dont start getting emotional paul your boss has just got in and he wants to see you you and francesca can talk over old times later chavasse squeezed her hand thats a promise dont go away ill wait right here she assured him and he turned and followed murchison inside they moved through the crowded ballroom into the entrance hall passed the two uniformed footmen at the bottom of the grand staircase and mounted to the first floor the long thickly carpeted corridor was quiet and the music echoing from the ballroom might have been from another world they went up half a dozen steps turned into a shorter side passage and paused outside a whitepainted door in here old man murchison said try not to be too long weve a cabaret starting in half an hour really quite something i promise you he moved back along the passage his footsteps silent on the thick carpet and chavasse knocked on the door opened it and went in the room was a small plainly furnished office its walls painted a neutral shade of green the young woman who sat at the desk writing busily was attractive in spite of her dark heavyrimmed library spectacles she glanced up sharply and chavasse smiled surprise surprise jean frazer removed her spectacles you look like hell how was albania tiresome chavasse said cold wet and with the benefits of universal brotherhood rather thinly spread on the ground he sat on the edge of the desk and helped himself to a cigarette from a teak box what brings you and the old man out here the albanian affair wasnt all that important we had a nato intelligence meeting in bonn when we got word that you were safely out the chief decided to come to rome to take your report on the spot not good enough chavasse said the old bastard wouldnt have another job lined up for me would he because if he has he can damn well think again why not ask him she said hes waiting for you now she nodded toward a green baize door chavasse looked at it for a moment sighed heavily and crushed his cigarette into the ashtray the inner room was half in shadow the only light a shaded lamp on the desk the man who stood at the window gazing out at the lights of rome was of medium height the face somehow ageless a strange brooding expression in the dark eyes here we are again chavasse said softly the chief turned taking in everything about chavasse in a single moment he nodded glad to see you back in one piece paul i hear things were pretty rough over there you could say that the older man moved to his chair and sat down tell me about it albania chavasse shrugged were not going to do much there no one can pretend the people have gained anything since the communists took over at the end of the war but theres no question of a counterrevolution even getting started the sigurmi the secret police are everywhere id say they must be the most extensive in europe you went in using that italian communist party friendship cover didnt you it didnt do me much good the italians in the party accepted me all right but the trouble started when we reached tirana the sigurmi assigned an agent to each one of us and they were real pros shaking them was difficult enough and the moment i did they smelt a rat and put out a general call for me what about the freedom party how extensive are they you can start using the past tense as of last week when i arrived they were down to two cells one in tirana the capital the other in scutari both were still in contact with our bureau operation here in rome did you manage to contact the leader this man luci only just the night we were to meet to really discuss things he was mopped up by the sigurmi apparently they were all over his place waiting for me to show my hand and how did you manage to scrape out of that one the scutari cell got a radio signal from luci as the police were breaking in they relayed it to bureau headquarters here in rome luckily for me they had a quick thinker on duty a girl called francesca minetti one of our best people at this end the chief said ill tell you about her one of these days my back way out of albania was a motor launch called buona esperanza run by a man called guilio orsini hes quite a boy was one of the original torpedo merchants with the italian navy during the war his best touch was when he sank a couple of our destroyers in alexandria harbor back in got out again in one piece too hes a smuggler now runs across to albania a lot his grandmother came from there as i recall the original plan he was to wait three nights running in a cove near durres thats about thirty miles by road from tirana isnt it chavasse nodded when francesca minetti got the message from scutari she took a chance and put it through to orsini on his boat the madman left his crewman in charge landed stole a car in durres and drove straight to tirana he caught me at my hotel as i was leaving for the meeting with luci getting back to the coast must have been quite a trick we did run into a little trouble had to do the last ten miles on foot through coastal salt marshes not good with the hounds on your heels but orsini knew what he was doing once we were on board the buona esperanza it was easy the albanians dont have much of a navy half a dozen minesweepers and a couple of subchasers the buona esperanza has ten knots on any one of them it would seem that orsini is due for a bonus on this one thats putting it mildly the chief nodded opened the official file that contained chavasses report and leafed through it so were wasting our time in albania chavasse nodded im afraid so you know the way things have been since the twentieth party congress in and now the chinese are in there with both feet anything to worry about chavasse shook his head the most backward european country ive visited and the chinese are too far from home to be able to do much about it what about this naval base the russians were using at valona before they pulled out the word was that theyd built it into a sort of red gibraltar on the adriatic albtourist took us on an official trip on our second day port is hardly the word for the place good natural shelter but only used by fishing boats certainly no sign of submarine pens and enver hoxha you think hes still firmly in control and then some we saw him at a military parade on the third day he cuts an impressive figure especially in uniform hes certainly the peoples hero at the moment heaven knows how long for the chief closed the file with a quick gesture that somehow dismissed the whole affair placing it firmly in the past good work paul at least we know where we stand another piece in the jigsaw youre due for some leave now arent you thats right chavasse said and waited the chief got to his feet walked to the window and looked out over the glittering city down toward the tiber what would you like to do spend a week or two at matano chavasse said without hesitation thats a small fishing port near bari theres a good beach and guilio orsini owns a place on the front called the tabu hes promised me some diving im looking forward to it im sure you are the chief said sounds marvelous do i get it the old man looked out over the city an abstracted frown on his face oh yes paul you can have your leave after youve done a little chore for me chavasse groaned and the older man turned and came back to the desk dont worry it wont take long but youll have to leave tonight is that necessary the old man nodded ive got transport laid on and youll need help preferably this chap orsini from the sound of him well offer a good price chavasse sighed thinking of francesca minetti waiting on the terrace of the good food and wine in the buffet room below he sighed again and stubbed out his cigarette carefully what do i do the chief pushed a file across enrico noci a double agent whos been working for us and the albanians i didnt mind at first but now the chinese have got to him which isnt healthy they never are too damned earnest for my liking theres a boat waiting at bari to take noci over to albania tomorrow night all the details are in there chavasse studied the picture the heavy fleshy face the weak mouth a man who was probably a failure at everything he had put his hand to except perhaps women he had the sort of tanned beachboy good looks that some of them went for do i bring him in what on earth for the chief shook his head get rid of him a swimming accident anything you like nothing messy of course chavasse said calmly he glanced through the file again memorizing the facts it contained then pushed it across and stood up ill see you in london the chief nodded in three weeks paul enjoy your holiday dont i always the chief pulled a file across opened it and started to study the contents and chavasse crossed to the door and left quietly three enrico noci lay staring through the darkness at the ceiling smoking a cigarette beside him the woman slept her thigh warm against his once she stirred turning into him in her sleep but didnt awaken he reached for another cigarette and there was a slight distinctive rattle as something was pushed through the letter box in the outer hall he slid from beneath the blankets careful not to waken the woman and padded across the tiled floor in his bare feet a large buff envelope lay on the mat at the front door he took it into the kitchen lit the gas under the coffeepot and opened the envelope quickly inside there was a smaller sealed envelope the one he was to take with him and a single typed sheet containing his movement orders he memorized them then burned it quickly at the stove he glanced at his watch just before midnight time for a hot bath and something to eat he stretched lazily a conscious pleasure seeping through him the woman had really been quite something certainly a diverting way of spending his last evening he was wallowing up to his chin in hot water the small bathroom half full of steam when the door opened and she came in yawning as she tied the belt of his silk dressing gown come back to bed caro she said plaintively for the life of him he couldnt remember her name and he grinned another time angel i must get moving scrambled eggs and coffee like a good girl ive got to be out of here in twenty minutes when he left the bathroom ten minutes later he was freshly shaved his dark hair slicked back and he wore an expensive handknitted sweater and slacks she had laid a small table in the window and placed a plate of scrambled eggs in front of him as he sat down as he ate he pulled back the curtain with one hand and looked down across the lights of bari to the waterfront the town was quiet and a slight rain drifted through the yellow street lamps in a silver spray will you be coming back she said who knows angel he shrugged who knows he finished his coffee went into the bedroom picked up a dark blue nylon raincoat and a small canvas grip and returned to the living room she sat with her elbows on the table a cup of coffee in her hands he took out his wallet extracted a couple of banknotes and dropped them on the table its been fun angel he said and moved to the door you know the address when he closed the outside door and turned along the street it was half past twelve exactly the rain was falling quite heavily now and fog crouched at the ends of the streets reducing visibility to thirty or forty yards he walked briskly along the wet pavement turning confidently out of one street into another and ten minutes later halted beside a small black fiat sedan he opened the door lifted the corner of the carpet and found the ignition key at once a few moments later he was driving away on the outskirts of bari he stopped and consulted the map that he found in the glove compartment matano was about twelve miles away on the coast road running south to brindisi an easy enough run although the fog was bound to hold him up a little he lit a cigarette and started off again concentrating on his driving as the fog grew thicker he was finally reduced to a cautious crawl his head out of the side window it was almost an hour later when he halted at a signpost that indicated matano to the left as he drove along the narrow road he could smell the sea through the fog and gradually it seemed to clear a little he reached matano fifteen minutes later and drove through silent streets toward the waterfront he parked the car in an alley near the club tabu as instructed and went the rest of the way on foot it was dark and lonely on the waterfront and the only sound was the lapping of water against the pilings as he went down a flight of stone steps to the jetty it was quiet and deserted in the yellow light of a solitary lamp and he paused halfway along to examine the motor cruiser moored at the end she was a thirtyfooter with a steel hull probably built by akerboon he decided she was in excellent trim her seagreen paintwork gleaming not at all what he had expected he examined the name buona esperanza on her counter with a slight frown when he stepped over the rail the stern quarter was festooned with nets still damp from the days labor and stinking of fish the deck slippery with their scales somewhere in the distance the door of an allnight caf√© opened and music drifted out faint and far away and for no accountable reason noci shivered it was at that moment that he realized he was being watched the man was young slim and wiry with a sunblackened face that badly needed a shave he wore denims and an old oilskin coat and a seamans cap shaded calm expressionless eyes he stood at the corner of the deckhouse a coiled rope in one hand and said nothing as noci took a step toward him the door of the wheelhouse opened and another man appeared he was at least six feet three great shoulders straining the seams of his blue pilot coat and wore an old italian navy officers cap the gold braid tarnished by exposure to salt air and water he had perhaps the ugliest face noci had ever looked upon the nose smashed and flattened the white line of an old scar running from the right eye to the point of the chin a thin cigar of the type favored by dutch seamen was firmly clenched between his teeth and he spoke without removing it guilio orsini master of the buona esperanza noci felt a sudden surge of relief flow through him as tension ebbed away enrico noci he held out his hand orsini took it briefly and nodded to the young deckhand lets go carlo he jerked his thumb toward the companionway youll find a drink in the bar dont come up until i tell you as noci moved toward the companionway carlo cast off and moved quickly to the stern the engine burst into life shattering the quiet and the buona esperanza turned from the jetty and moved into the fog the salon was warm and pleasantly furnished noci looked around approvingly placed his canvas grip on the table and helped himself to a large whisky from a cabinet in one corner he drank it quickly and lay on one of the bunks smoking a cigarette a warm pleasurable glow seeping through him this was certainly an improvement on the old tub in which he had done the run to albania before orsini was a new face but then there was nothing surprising in that the faces changed constantly in this business it didnt pay to take chances the boat lifted forward with a great surge of power and a slight smile of satisfaction touched nocis mouth at this rate they would be landing him on the coast near durres before dawn by noon he would be in tirana more dollars to his account in the bank of geneva and this was his sixth trip in as many months not bad going but you could take the pitcher to the well too often after this a rest was indicated a long rest he decided he would go to the bahamas white beaches blue skies and a lovely tanned girl wading thigh deep from the sea to meet him american for preference they were so ingenuous had so much to learn the engines coughed once and died away and the buona esperanza slowed violently as her prow sank into the waves noci sat up head to one side as he listened the only sound was the lapping of the water against her hull it was some sixth sense a product of his years of treachery and double dealing of living on his wits that warned him that something was wrong he swung his legs to the floor reached for the canvas grip unzipped it and took out a pistol he released the safety catch and padded across to the foot of the companionway above him the door opened and shut creaking slightly as the boat pitched in the swell he went up quickly one hand against the wall paused and raised his head cautiously the deck seemed deserted the drizzle falling in silver cobwebs through the navigation lights he stepped out and on his right a match flared and a man moved out of the shadows bending his head to light a cigarette the flame revealed a handsome devils face eyes like black holes above high cheekbones he flicked the match away and stood there hands in the pockets of his slacks he wore a heavy fishermans sweater and his dark hair glistened with moisture signor noci he said calmly in fluent italian who the hell are you noci demanded my name is chavasse paul chavasse it was a name noci was completely familiar with an involuntary gasp rose in his throat and he raised the pistol a hand like iron clamped on his wrist wrenching the weapon from his grasp and guilio orsini said i think not carlo moved out of the shadows to the left and stood waiting noci looked about him helplessly and chavasse held out his hand ill have the envelope now noci produced it reluctantly and handed it across trying to stay calm as chavasse examined the contents they could be no more than half a mile from the shore no distance to a man who had been swimming since childhood and noci was under no illusions as to what would happen if he stayed chavasse turned over the first sheet of paper and noci ducked under orsinis arm and ran for the stern rail he was aware of a sudden cry an unfamiliar voice obviously carlos and then he slipped on some fish scales and stumbled headlong into the draped nets he tried to scramble to his feet a foot tripped him and then the soft clinging stinking meshes seemed to wrap themselves around him he was pulled forward onto his hands and knees and looked up through the mesh to see chavasse peering down at him the devils face calm and cold orsini and carlo had a rope in their hands and in that terrible moment noci realized what they intended to do and the scream rose in this throat orsini pulled hard on the rope and noci lurched across the deck and cannoned into the low rail a foot caught him hard against the small of the back and he went over into the cold water as he surfaced the net impeding every movement he tried to make he was aware of orsini running the end of the line around the rail of carlo leaning out of the wheelhouse window waiting a hand went up the buona esperanza surged forward noci went under with a cry surfaced on a wave choking for breath he was aware only of chavasse at the rail watching face calm in the fogshrouded light and then as the boat increased speed he went under for the last time as he struggled violently water forcing the air from his lungs he was aware of no pain no pain at all he seemed to be floating on soft white sand beneath a blue sky and a beautiful suntanned girl waded from the sea to join him and she was smiling four chavasse was tired and his throat was raw from too many cigarettes smoke hung in layers from the low ceiling spiraling in the heat from the single bulb above the green baize table drifting into the shadows there were half a dozen men sitting in on the game chavasse orsini carlo arezzi his deckhand a couple of fishing boat captains and the sergeant of police orsini lit another of his foulsmelling dutch cheroots and pushed a further two chips into the center chavasse shook his head and tossed in his hand too rich for my blood guilio there was a general murmur and guilio orsini grinned and raked in his winnings bluff paul always the big bluff thats all that counts in this game chavasse wondered if that explained why he was so bad at cards for him action had to be part of a logical progression from a carefully reasoned calculation of the risk involved in the great game of life and death he had played for so long a man could seldom bluff more than once and get away with it he pushed back his chair and stood up thats me for tonight guilio ill see you on the jetty in the morning orsini nodded seven sharp paul maybe well get you that big one the cards were already on their way round again as chavasse crossed to the door opened it and stepped into a whitewashed passage in spite of the lateness of the hour he could hear music from the front of the club and careless laughter he took down an old reefer jacket from a peg pulled it on and opened the side door the cold night air cut into his lungs as he breathed deeply to clear his head and moved along the alley a thin sea fog rolled in from the water and except for the faint strains of music from the tabu silence reigned he found a crumpled packet of cigarettes in his pocket extracted one and struck a match on the wall momentarily illuminating his face a woman emerged from a narrow alley opposite hesitated then walked down the jetty the clicking of her high heels echoing through the night a moment later two sailors moved out of the entrance of the tabu crossed in front of chavasse and followed her chavasse leaned against the wall feeling curiously depressed there were times when he really wondered what it was all about not just this dangerous game he played but life itself he smiled in the darkness three oclock in the morning on the waterfront of any kind of port was one hell of a time to start thinking like that the woman screamed and he flicked his cigarette into the fog and stood listening again the screaming sounded curiously muffled and he started to run toward the jetty he turned a corner and found the two sailors holding her on the ground under a street lamp as the nearest one turned in alarm chavasse lifted a boot into his face and sent him back over the jetty the other leapt toward him with a curse steel glinting in his right hand chavasse was aware of the black beard blazing eyes and strange hooked scar on the right cheek and then he flicked his cap into the mans face and raised a knee into the exposed groin the man writhed on the ground gasping for breath and chavasse measured the distance and kicked him in the head in the water below the jetty there was a violent splashing and he moved to the edge and saw the first man swimming vigorously into the darkness chavasse watched him disappear then turned to look for the woman she was standing in the shadow of a doorway and he went toward her are you all right i think so she replied in a strangely familiar voice and stepped out of the shadows his eyes widened in amazement francesca francesca minetti what in the world are you doing here her dress had been ripped from neck to waist and she held it in place a slight smile on her face we were supposed to have a date on the terrace at the embassy a week ago what happened something came up he said the story of my life but what are you doing on the matano waterfront at this time of the morning she swayed forward and he caught her just in time holding her close to his chest for a brief moment she smiled up at him wanly sorry about that but all of a sudden i felt a little lightheaded have you far to go she brushed a tendril of hair back from her forehead i left my car somewhere near here but all the streets look the same in the fog better come back with me to my hotel he said its just around the corner he slipped off his jacket and draped it round her shoulders i could probably fix you up with a bed laughter bubbled out of her and for a moment she was once again the gay exciting girl he had met so briefly at the embassy ball im sure you could he grinned and put an arm round her i think youve had quite enough excitement for one night there was the scrape of a shoe on the cobbles behind them and he swung round and saw the other man lurching into the fog hands to his smashed face chavasse took a quick step after him and francesca caught his sleeve let him go i dont want the police in on this he looked down into her strained and anxious face if thats the way you want it there was something strange here something he didnt understand they walked along the jetty and turned onto the waterfront as port towns went matano was reasonably tame but not so tame that pretty young girls could walk around the dock area at three am and expect to get away with it one thing was certain francesca minetti must have had a pretty powerful reason for being there the hotel was a small stuccoed building on a corner an ancient electric sign over the entrance but it was clean and cheap and the food was good the owner was a friend of orsini he slept at the desk head in hands and chavasse reached over to the board without waking him and unhooked the key they crossed the hall mounted narrow wooden stairs and passed along a whitewashed corridor the room was plainly furnished with a brass bed a washstand and an old wardrobe as elsewhere in the house the walls were whitewashed and the floor highly polished francesca stood just inside the door one hand to the neck of her dress holding it in place and looked around approvingly this is nice have you been here long almost a week now my first holiday in a year or more he opened the wardrobe rummaged among his clothes and finally produced a black polo neck sweater in merino wool try that for size while i get you a drink you look as if you could do with one she turned her back and pulled the sweater over her head as he went to a cupboard in the corner he took out a bottle of whisky and rinsed a couple of glasses in the bowl on the washstand when he turned she was standing by the bed watching him looking strangely young and defenseless the dark sweater hanging loosely about her sit down for gods sake before you fall down he said there was a cane chair by the french window leading to the balcony and she slumped into it and leaned her head against the glass window staring into the darkness out at sea a foghorn boomed eerily and she shivered i think that must be the loneliest sound in the world thomas wolfe preferred a train whistle chavasse said pouring whisky into one of the glasses and handing it to her she looked puzzled thomas wolfe who was he he shrugged just a writer a man who knew what loneliness was all about he swallowed a little of his whisky girls like you shouldnt be on the waterfront at this time of the morning i suppose you know that if i hadnt arrived when i did youd have probably ended up in the water after theyd finished with you she shook her head it wasnt that kind of assault i see he drank some more of his whisky and considered the point if it would help im a good listener she held her glass in both hands and stared down at it a troubled look on her face and he added gently is this something official a bureau operation perhaps she looked up real alarm on her face and shook her head vigorously no they know nothing about it and they mustnt be told you must promise me that its a family matter quite private she put down her glass stood up and walked restlessly across the room when she turned there was an expression of real anguish on her face she pushed her hair back with a quick nervous gesture and laughed the trouble is ive always worked inside never in the field i just dont know what to do in a situation like this chavasse produced his cigarettes put one in his mouth and tossed the packet across to her why not tell me about it im a great one for pretty girls in distress she caught the packet automatically and stood there looking at him a slight frown on her face she nodded slowly all right paul but anything i tell you is confidential i dont want any of this getting back to my superiors it could get me into real trouble agreed he said she came back to her chair took a cigarette from the packet and reached up for a light how much do you know about me paul he shrugged you work for us in rome my own boss told me you were one of the best people we had out here and thats good enough for me ive worked for the bureau for two years now she said my mother was albanian so i speak the language fluently i suppose thats what first interested them in me she was the daughter of a gegh chieftain my father was a colonel of mountain troops in the italian occupation army in he was killed in the western desert early in the war is your mother still alive she died about five years ago she was never able to return to albania once enver hoxha and the communists took over two of her brothers were members of the legaliteri in north albania which had royalist aims they fought with abas kupi during the war in hoxha called them in from the hills to a peace conference at which they were immediately executed there was no pain on her face no emotion at all except a calm acceptance of what must have been for a long time quite simply a fact of life at least that explains why you were willing to work for us chavasse said softly it was not a hard decision to make there was only an old uncle my fathers brother who raised us and until last year my brother was still in paris studying political economy at the sorbonne where is he now when i last saw him he was facedown in a mud bank of the buene marshes in northern albania with a machinegun burst in his back out of the silence chavasse said carefully when was this three months ago i was on leave at the time she held out her glass could i have some more he poured until she raised her hand she sipped a little apparently still perfectly in control of her emotions and continued you were in albania not so long ago yourself you know how things are he nodded as bad as ive seen them did you notice any churches on your travels one or two still seemed to be functioning but i know the official party line is to clamp down on religious observances of any sort theyve almost completely crushed islam she said in a dry matteroffact voice the albanian orthodox church has come out of it a little better because they deposed their archbishop and put in a priest loyal to communism its the roman catholic church that has been most harshly persecuted a familiar pattern chavasse said the organization communism fears most out of two archbishops and four bishops arrested two have been shot and anothers on the books as having died in prison the church has almost ceased to exist in albania or so the authorities hoped i must admit that was the impression i got during the past year theres been an amazing revival in the north she said headed by the franciscan fathers at scutari even noncatholics have been swarming into the church there its had the central government in tirana quite worried they decided to do something about it something spectacular such as theres a famous shrine outside the city dedicated to our lady of scutari a grotto and medicinal spring the usual sort of thing a place of pilgrimage since the crusades the statue is ebony and leafed with gold very ancient they call her the black madonna its traditionally said that it was only because of her miraculous powers that the turkish overlords of ancient times allowed christianity to survive at all in the country what did the central government intend to do destroy the shrine seize the statue and burn it publicly in the main square at scutari the franciscan fathers were warned and managed to spirit the madonna away on the very day the authorities were going to act where is it now somewhere in the buene marshes at the bottom of a lagoon in my brothers launch what happened its easily told she shrugged my brother marco was interested in a society of albanian refugees living in taranto one of them a man called ramiz got word about the madonna through a cousin living in albania at tama thats a small town on the river ten miles inland and this society decided to go in and bring her out the black madonna is no ordinary statue paul she said seriously she symbolizes all the hope thats left for albania in a hard world they realized what a tremendous psychological effect it would have upon the morale of albanians everywhere if it were made public in the italian press that the statue had reached italy in safety and you went in with them with marco its an easy passage and the albanian navy is extremely weak so getting into the marshes is no problem we picked up the statue at a prearranged spot on the first night unfortunately we ran into a patrol boat next morning on the way out there was some shooting and the launch was badly damaged she sank in a small lagoon and we took to the rubber dinghy they hunted us for most of the day marco was shot toward evening i didnt want to leave his body but we didnt have much choice later that night we reached the coast and ramiz stole a small sailing boat thats how we got back and where is this man ramiz now chavasse asked somewhere in matano he telephoned me in rome yesterday and told me to meet him at a hotel on the waterfront you see hes managed to get hold of a launch chavasse stared at her an incredulous frown on his face are you trying to tell me you intend to go back into those damned marshes that was the general idea just the two of you you and ramiz he shook his head you wouldnt last five minutes perhaps not but its worth a try he started to protest but she raised a hand im not going to spend the rest of my life living with the thought that my brother died for nothing when i could at least have tried to do something about it the minettis are a proud family paul we take care of our dead i know what marco would have done and i am the only one left to do it she sat there her face very pale in the lamplight chavasse took her hands reached across and kissed her gently on the mouth this lagoon where the launch sank you know where it is she nodded frowning slightly why he grinned you surely didnt think id let you go in on your own there was a look of complete bewilderment on her face but why paul give me one good reason why you should risk your life for me lets just say im bored stiff after a week of lazing around on the beach and leave it at that this man ramiz youve got his address she took a scrap of paper from her handbag and handed it to him i dont think its far from here he slipped it into his pocket right lets get going to see ramiz he shook his head that comes later first well call on a good friend of mine the kind of friend you need for a job like this someone with no scruples who knows the albanian coast like the back of his hand and runs the fastest boat in the adriatic at the door she turned looked up at him searchingly something glowed in her eyes and color flooded her cheeks quite suddenly she seemed confident sure of herself again its going to be all right angel i promise you he raised her hand briefly to his lips opened the door and gently pushed her into the corridor five the air in the room was still heavily tainted by cigarette smoke but the card players had gone in the light of the shaded lamp a british admiralty chart of the drin gulf area of the albanian coast was unfolded across the table chavasse and orsini leaned over it and francesca sat beside them the buene river runs down to the coast from lake scutari or shkoder as they call it these days orsini said what about these coastal marshes are they as bad as francesca says orsini nodded one hell of a place a maze of narrow channels saltwater lagoons and malariainfested swamps unless you knew where to look you could search for a year for that launch and never find it anyone living there a few fishermen and wildfowlers mainly geghs the reds havent done too well in those parts the whole areas always been a sort of refuge for people on the run you know it well orsini grinned id say ive made the run into those marshes at least half a dozen times this year penicillin sulphonamide guns nylons theres a lot of money to be made and the albanian navy cant do much to stop it still a risky business though for amateurs anything is risky orsini turned to francesca this man ramiz what did he do for a living he was an artist i believe he did most of his sailing at weekends orsini looked at the ceiling and raised his hands helplessly my god what a setup that he got you back safely to italy is a miracle signorina the door opened and carlo came in carrying cups on a tray he handed them round and chavasse sipped hot coffee he frowned down at the map following the main channel then turned to francesca you say you know where the launch went down how can you be sure these lagoons all look the same marco took a cross bearing just before we sank she said i memorized it orsini pushed a piece of paper and a pencil across and she quickly wrote the figures down he examined them with a slight frown and then calculated the position he drew a circle round the central point x marks the spot chavasse examined it quickly about five miles in another three or four to this place tama whats it like there used to be quite a thriving little river port years ago but its gone down the slot in a big way since the trouble started between albania and the satellite countries orsini traced a finger along the line of the river the buene forms part of the boundary between albania and yugoslavia most of the main streams been allowed to silt up that means you have to know the estuary and delta region well to get as far inland as tama but could you get us there orsini turned to carlo what do you think weve never had any trouble before why should we now the pitcher can go to the well too often francesca observed softly orsini shrugged for all men death makes the last appointment he chooses his own time that only leaves the question of the price to be settled chavasse said no problem there francesca put in quickly signorina please orsini took her hand and touched it to his lips this thing i will do because i want to and for no other reason she seemed close to tears and chavasse interrupted quickly one thing im not happy about is ramiz are you sure it was his voice on the telephone she nodded he came from the province of vlore they have a distinctive accent im sure it was him chavasse decided that it didnt look too good for ramiz quite obviously the sigurmi had traced them with no difficulty maybe theyd recovered marco minettis body or what was more probable had got their hands on the people who had passed on the madonna in albania itself each man had his limits his specific tolerance to pain once past that point most would babble all they knew before dying and it was natural that the albanians should go to so much trouble to trace the madonna its disappearance must have meant a big loss of prestige politically and the knowledge that it must still be in their own territory would be an added spur to recover it if ramiz did make that phone call it was probably because he was made to either that or he was known to have made it he produced the slip of paper francesca had given him at the hotel do you know this place orsini nodded its not far from here the sort of fleabag where whores rent rooms by the hour and no questions asked he turned to francesca no place for a lady she started to protest but chavasse cut in quickly guilios right in any case youre out on your feet what you need is about eight hours solid sleep you can use my room at the hotel he turned to carlo see she gets there safely he pulled on his reefer jacket and she stood up youll be careful arent i always he gave her a little push lock yourself in the room and get some sleep ill be along later she went reluctantly and carlo followed her out when chavasse turned orsini was grinning hugely ah to be young and handsome something you never were chavasse said lets get moving it was still raining a thin drizzle that beaded the iron railings of the harbor wall like silver as they walked along the pavement the old stuccoed houses floated out of the fog unreal and insubstantial and each street lamp was a yellow oasis of light in a dark world the hotel was no more than five minutes from the tabu a seedy tenement plaster peeling from the brickwork beside the open door they entered a dark and gloomy hall there was no one behind the wooden desk and no response to orsinis impatient push on the bell did she give you the room number chavasse nodded twentysix the italian moved behind the desk and examined the board he came back shaking his head the key isnt there he must still be in his room they went up a flight of rickety wooden stairs to the first floor there was an unpleasant musty smell compounded of cooking odors and stale urine and a strange brooding quiet they moved along the passage checking the numbers on the doors and chavasse became aware of music and high brittle laughter he paused outside the room from which it came and orsini turned from the door opposite this is it the door swung open to his touch and he stepped inside and reached for the light switch nothing happened he struck a match and chavasse moved in beside him the room was almost bare there was a rush mat on the floor an iron bed and a washstand a wooden chair lay on its side beside the mat as chavasse reached down to pick it up the match orsini was holding burned his fingers and he dropped it with a curse chavasse rested on one knee waiting for him to strike another and was aware of a sudden dampness soaking through the knee of his slacks as the match flared he raised his hand the fingers sticky and glutinous with halfdried blood so much for ramiz they examined the room quickly but there was nothing to be found not even a suitcase and they went back into the passage highpitched laughter sounded from opposite and orsini raised his eyebrows enquiringly nothing to lose chavasse said the big italian knocked on the door there was a sudden silence and then a womans voice called come back later im busy orsini knocked even harder there was a quick angry movement inside and the door was jerked open the woman who faced them was small with flaming red hair the black nylon robe she wore did little to conceal her ample charms she recognized orsini immediately and the look of anger on her face was replaced by a ready smile eh guilio its been a long time too long cara he said patting her face you still look as good as ever my friend and i wanted a word with the man opposite but he doesnt appear to be at home oh that one she said in disgust sitting around his room like that wouldnt even give a girl the time of day he must have been blind orsini said gallantly a couple of men came looking for him earlier she said i think there was some trouble when i looked out they were taking him away between them he didnt look good you didnt think of calling the police chavasse asked i wouldnt cut that bastard of a sergeant down if he were hanging there was an angry call from inside the room and she grinned some of them get really impatient i bet they do chavasse said she smiled you i definitely like bring him round sometime guilio well have ourselves a party maybe ill do that orsini told her there was another impatient cry from inside and she raised her eyebrows despairingly and closed the door orsini and chavasse went back downstairs and out into the street the italian paused to light a cheroot and flicked the match into the darkness what now chavasse shrugged there isnt really much we can do i know one thing i could do with some sleep orsini nodded go back to your hotel stay with the girl and behave yourself well sort something out in the morning he punched chavasse lightly on the shoulder dont worry paul youre in the hands of experts he turned away into the fog and as chavasse watched him go tiredness seemed to wash over him in a great wave he walked along the pavement footsteps echoing between narrow stone walls and paused on a corner fumbling for a cigarette as the match flared in his hands something needlesharp sliced through his jacket to touch his spine a voice said quietly please to stand very still mr chavasse he waited while the expert hands passed over his body checking for the weapon that wasnt there now walk straight ahead and dont look round and do exactly as you are told it would desolate me to have to kill you it was only as he started walking that chavasse realized the voice had spoken in albanian six there were two of them he could tell that much from their footfalls echoing between the walls of the narrow alleys as they moved through the old quarter of the town the harsh voice of the man who had first spoken occasionally broke the silence to tell him to turn right or left but otherwise there was no conversation and they stayed well behind him fifteen minutes later they emerged from an alley onto the sea wall on the far side of the harbor from the jetty a house several floors high reared into the night and beside it a flight of stone steps led down to a landing stage an old naval patrol boat was moored there shabby and neglected paint peeling from her hull across her stern ran the faded inscription stromboli taranto the landing stage was deserted in the light of a solitary lamp and there was no one to help him he turned slowly and faced the two men one of them was small and rather nondescript he wore a heavy jersey and a knitted cap was pulled over his eyes the other was a different proposition a big dangerouslooking man badly in need of a shave he had a scarred brutal face cropped hair and wore a reefer coat and seaboots he slipped a cigarette into his mouth and struck a match on the seawall down we go mr chavasse down we go chavasse descended the steps slowly as he reached the landing stage the little man moved past him and led the way to the far end where he opened a door set in the thickness of the wall a flight of stone stairs lifted into the gloom and chavasse followed him the big man a couple of paces behind they arrived on a stone landing and the little man opened another door and jerked his head chavasse moved past him and stood just inside the entrance the room was plainly furnished with a wooden table and several chairs a narrow iron bed stood against one wall the man who sat at the table writing a letter was small and dark and dressed in a suit of blue tropical worsted his skin was the color of fine leather the narrow fringe of beard combining to give him the look of a conquistadore chavasse paused a couple of feet away hands in pockets small black shining eyes had swivelled to a position from which they could observe him the man half turned and smiled mr chavasse a distinct pleasure sir his english was clipped and precise hardly any accent at all chavasse decided that he didnt like him the eyes were cold and merciless in spite of the polite birdlike expression the eyes of a killer im beginning to find all this rather a bore the little man smiled then we must try to make things more interesting how would you like to earn ten thousand pounds at the other end of the table was a tray containing a couple of bottles and several glasses chavasse walked to it calmly aware of a slight movement from the big man over by the door one of the bottles contained smirnoff his favorite vodka he half filled a glass and walked casually to the window gazing forty feet down into the harbor as he drank assessing the position of the stromboli to the left her outline showing dimly through the fog well the little man asked chavasse turned how are things in tirana these days the little man smiled very astute but i havent seen tirana in five years a slight difference of opinion with the present regime he produced a white card and flicked it across my card sir i am adem kapo agent for albtourist in taranto among other things im sure kapo took out a case and extracted a cigarette which he fitted into a holder you could describe me as a sort of middleman people come to me with their requirements and i try to satisfy them for a fee but of course he extended the case cigarette chavasse took one ten thousand pounds thats a lot of money what makes you think id be interested knowing who people are is part of my business and i know a great deal about you my friend more than you could dream of men like you are a gun that is for sale to the highest bidder in any case the money would be easily earned my principals will pay such a sum in advance if you will agree to lead them to the position of a certain launch which recently sank in the marshes of the buene river in northern albania you are interested i could be if i knew what you were talking about im sure signorina minetti has already filled you in on the details come now mr chavasse all is discovered as they say in the english melodramas according to the information supplied to me by my clients the body of an italian citizen one marco minetti was discovered on a mud bank at the mouth of the buene recently after an attempt had been made to smuggle a priceless religious relic from the country you dont say chavasse said kapo ignored the interruption a few hours earlier his launch had disappeared into the wastes of the buene marshes later a priest and two men were taken into custody by the sigurmi at the town of tama apparently the priest was stubborn to the end a bad habit they have but the two men talked they named minetti his sister and an albanian refugee an artist called ramiz i was offered what i must admit was a very handsome fee to trace them and did you weve been watching ramiz for weeks waiting for him to make his move incredible though it may seem he apparently intended to go in again you see he was an intellectual one of those rather irritating people who feel they have a mission in life you speak of him in the past tense yes its really quite sad kapo sounded genuinely moved i decided to have a little chat with him earlier this evening when haji and tasko were bringing him here there was some sort of struggle he fell from the seawall and broke his neck just an unfortunate accident i suppose but of course and quite unnecessary its surprising how easily ones motives can be misunderstood im afraid an earlier attempt to get in touch with signorina minetti also met with a conspicuous lack of success which leaves you with me one can hardly be blamed for thinking it rather more than coincidental that mr paul chavasse of the british secret service just happened to be on the spot when the signorina minetti needed some assistance chavasse reached for the bottle of vodka and poured some more into his glass and what would you say if i told you i still dont know what youre talking about if you persisted you would leave me no choice i would have to apply to the signorina again which would distress me greatly kapo sighed on the other hand women are so much easier to deal with dont you agree tashko the big man moved to the end of the table a mirthless grin on his face and chavasse nodded thoughtfully somehow i thought youd say that he reversed his grip on the bottle of vodka and struck sideways against tashkos skull the albanian cried out sharply as the bottle smashed into pieces drawing blood and chavasse heaved the table over sending kapo backwards in his chair pinning him to the floor haji was already moving fast across the room a knife in his right hand as it started to come up chavasse warded off the blow with one arm caught the small man by his left wrist and with a sudden pull sent him crashing into the wall tashko was already on his feet blood streaming down the side of his face he threw a tremendous punch and chavasse ducked under his arm and moved toward the door kapo pushed out a foot and tripped him so that he fell heavily to the floor tashko moved in quickly kicking at his ribs and face and chavasse rolled away avoiding most of the blows and scrambling up he vaulted over the upturned table picked up one of the chairs in both hands and hurled it through the window with all his force the dried and rotting wood of the frame smashed easily and the window dissolved in a snowstorm of flying glass he was aware of kapos warning cry of tashko lurching forward he lashed out sideways the edge of his hand catching the big man across the face scrambled onto the sill and jumped into darkness the air rushed past his ears with a roar the fog seemed to curl around him then he hit the water with a solid forceful smack and went down when he surfaced he gazed up at the dark bulk of the house at the light filtering through the fog from the smashed window there was a sudden call kapos voice drifting down and another answered from the stromboli dimly seen in the fog to the right there was only one sensible way out of the situation and chavasse took it he turned and swam away from the landing stage out into the harbor toward the jetty on the other side it was perhaps a quarter of a mile he knew that no great distance and the water was warm he took his time swimming steadily and the voices faded into the fog behind him and he was alone in an enclosed world everything seemed to fade away and he felt curiously calm and at peace with himself time seemed to have no meaning and the riding lights of the fishing boats moored close to the jetty appeared through the fog in what seemed a remarkably short time he swam between them and landed at a flight of steps that led to the jetty for a moment or two he sat there getting his breath and then went up quickly and moved along the jetty to the waterfront his first real need was obviously a change of clothes and he hurried through the fog toward his hotel after that a visit to orsini at the tabu and perhaps a return match with adem kapo and his thugs although it was more than probable that the stromboli was already being prepared for a hasty exit the electric sign over the entrance to the hotel loomed out of the night and he opened the door and moved inside the desk was vacant no one apparently on duty and he went up the stairs two at a time and turned along the corridor the door to his room stood open panels smashed and splintered and a light was still burning a chair lay on its side in the middle of the floor and the blankets were scattered over the end of the bed as if there had been a struggle he stood there for a moment his stomach suddenly hollow then turned and hurried back downstairs he noticed the foot protruding from behind the desk as he moved to the door and there was a slight audible groan of pain when he looked over the top he saw the old proprietor lying on his face blood matting the white hair at the back of the head seven the landing stage was deserted when chavasse orsini and carlo drove up in the old ford pickup the big italian cut the engine jumped to the ground and went to the head of the steps he turned shaking his head were wasting our time paul but well check the house just in case they went down the steps quickly and crossed the landing stage to the door it opened without difficulty and chavasse went up first an old colt automatic orsini had given him held against his right knee the door to the room in which kapo had interviewed him stood ajar light streaming out across the dark landing chavasse kicked it open and waited but there was no reply he went in quickly at ground level the automatic ready vodka from the smashed bottle had soaked into the floor mixed with blood and the table still lay on its side fog billowed in through the broken window and orsini walked across feet crunching on glass and peered outside he turned respect on his face a long way down i didnt have a great deal of choice what do we do now the italian shrugged go back to the tabu maybe old gilbertos remembered something by now i wouldnt count on it chavasse said that was a hard knock he took then well have to think of something else they returned to the pickup and carlo drove back to the tabu through the deserted streets as the truck braked to a halt chavasse checked his watch and saw that it was almost half past two he jumped to the ground and followed the two italians along the alley to the side door there were still a few customers in the bar at the front and as they walked along the passage the barman looked round the corner rome on the phone theyre hanging on thatll be my call to the bureau chavasse said to orsini ill see what theyve got to tell me about kapo ill have another word with old gilberto orsini said he may be thinking a little straighter by now chavasse took his call in the small office at the back of the bar the man he spoke to was the night duty officer based at the embassy no one of any particular importance just a good reliable civil servant who knew what files were for and how to use them efficiently he had nothing on kapo that chavasse didnt already know incredibly everything the man had said about himself was true at one time a high official in the albanian ministry of the interior he had been marked down for elimination in during one of hoxhas earlier purges he had been allowed to enter italy as a political refugee and had since lived in taranto earning a living as an importexport agent presumably on the basis that an albanian of any description was preferable to a foreigner albtourist had appointed him their taranto agent in an official investigation by italian military intelligence in that year had indicated nothing sinister in the appointment chavasse thanked the duty officer no it was nothing of any importance hed simply run across kapo in matano and had thought him worth checking on at the other end of the wire in his small office in rome the duty officer replaced the receiver with a thoughtful frown almost immediately he picked it up again and put a call through to bureau headquarters in london on the special line it could be nothing but chavasse was a topliner everyone in the organization knew that if by any remote chance he was up to anything and the chief didnt know about it heads might start to roll and the duty officer hadnt the slightest intention of allowing his own to be numbered among them the telephone on his desk buzzed sharply five minutes later and he lifted it at once hello sir yes thats right well there may be nothing in it but i thought youd like to know that ive just had a rather interesting call from paul chavasse in matano old gilberto coughed as the brandy caught at the back of his throat and grinned wryly at orsini i must be getting old guilio never heard a dammed thing it couldnt have been more than twenty minutes after carlo had delivered the young woman one moment i was reading a magazine the next the lights were going out he raised a gnarled and scarred fist old i may be but id still like five minutes on my own with that fancy bastard whoever he is orsini grinned and patted him on the shoulder youd murder him gilberto nothing like a bit of science to have these young toughies running around in circles they went out into the passage leaving the old man sitting at the fire a blanket around his shoulders a good heavyweight in his day orsini said one with the sense to get out before they scrambled his brains anything from rome chavasse shook his head everything kapo said about himself was true he is the albtourist agent in taranto an old party man from tirana who said the wrong thing once too often and only got out by the skin of his teeth according to italian intelligence hes harmless and they usually know what theyre talking about thats what mi said about fuchs and look where it got them orsini pointed out nobodys perfect and the good agent is the man who manages to pull the wool over the eyes of the opposition most effectively which doesnt get us anywhere chavasse said theyve gone which is all that counts taking francesca minetti with them they went into the office at the rear of the bar and orsini produced a bottle of whisky and three glasses he filled them a slight thoughtful frown on his face whoever took the girl it couldnt have been kapo and his men the time factor wouldnt have allowed it the men who attacked her on the jetty earlier what can you tell me about them judging by the language the second one used when he tried to stick his knife into me id say he was italian chavasse said straight out of the taranto gutter anything else interesting about him he had a dark beard anything but the trimmed variety and his face was badly scarred a sort of hook shape curving into his right eye orsini let out a great bellow of laughter and clapped him on the shoulder but my dear paul this is wonderful you mean you know him do i know him orsini turned to carlo tell him about our good friend toto he works for a man called vacelli carlo said a real bad one runs a couple of fishing boats out of here engaged in the albanian trade the town brothel and a caf√© in the old quarter he spat vigorously a pig it looks as if kapo must have employed vacelli to get hold of the girl for him orsini said the sort of task for which nature has fitted him admirably unfortunately you arrived on the scene and messed things up which doesnt explain why kapo went to the trouble of having me pulled in for a personal interview he probably thought he could do some kind of a deal you made a break for it and he had to leave in a hurry in case you decided to whistle down the law on him no other choice and in the meantime vacelli and his boys picked up the girl orsini nodded and kapo had to leave before they could get in touch with him so you think vacelli may still have the girl orsini opened the drawer of his desk took out a luger and slipped it into his hip pocket he smiled and the great ugly face was quite transformed lets go and find out vacellis place fronted the harbor on the corner of an alley that led into the heart of the old town the sign simply read caf√© inside someone was playing a guitar they parked the pickup at the entrance and when they went in orsini led the way downstairs there was a bead curtain and the murmur of voices from the bar beyond the guitar player sat just inside the entrance chair balanced against the wall he was young with dark curling hair the sleeves of his check shirt rolled back to expose muscular arms orsini pulled back the curtain and looked down at the legs sprawled across the entrance the guitar player made no effort to move and orsini hooked the chair from under him the sudden clatter stunning the room to silence there was a narrow marbletopped bar the wall behind it lined with bottles and a few small tables chairs ranged about them the floor was of stone the walls whitewashed and there were no more than a dozen customers most of them men the guitar player came up fast a spring knife in one hand but carlo was faster his hand tightened over the wrist twisting cruelly and the youth screamed dropping the knife he staggered back against the wall tears of pain in his eyes and orsini shook his head god knows whats happened to the youth of this country no manners at all he turned looking the other patrons over casually the bearded man with the scarred face the one they called toto sat at the table by the wall one arm in a sling orsini grinned eh toto you dont look too good wheres vacelli there was a scrape of a boot on stone and a surly voice growled what the hell do you want vacelli stood at the top of the flight of stone steps in the corner leading up to the first floor he was built like primo carnera a great ox of a man with a bulletshaped head that was too small for the rest of his body hello there you animal orsini cried gaily weve come for the minetti girl vacellis brutal face reddened in anger and he obviously restrained his temper with difficulty i dont know what youre talking about what a pity orsini picked up the nearest chair and threw it at the shelves behind the bar smashing the mirror and bringing down a dozen bottles does that help vacelli gave a roar of rage and came down the steps on the run orsini picked up a full bottle of chianti from a nearby table jumped to one side and smashed it across vacellis skull as he staggered past vacelli fell to one knee orsini picked up a chair and brought it down across the great shoulders vacelli grunted started to keel over orsini brought the chair down again and again until it splintered into matchwood he tossed it to one side and waited slowly painfully vacelli reached for the edge of the bar and hauled himself up he swayed there for a moment then charged headdown blood washing across his face in a red curtain orsini swerved and slashed him across the kidneys with the edge of his hand as vacelli plunged past him vacelli screamed and fell on his face he tried to push himself up but it was no good he collapsed with a great sigh and lay still anyone else orsini demanded no one moved and he turned to carlo watch things down here we wont be long chavasse followed him up the stairs and the big italian pulled back a curtain and led the way along a narrow passage a young woman in a cheap nylon housecoat leaned in a doorway smoking a cigarette eh guilio have you killed the bastard just about he grinned hell be inactive for quite a while time enough for you to pack your bags and move on there was a girl brought here tonight any idea where she is the end room he was just going in when you arrived i dont think he meant her any good my thanks carissima orsini kissed her lightly on one cheek go home to your mother chavasse was already ahead of him but the door was locked francesca its paul he called there was a quick movement inside and she called back the doors locked on the outside orsini stood back raised one booted foot and stamped twice against the lock there was a sudden splintering sound the door sagged on its hinges rotten wood crumbling he stamped again and it fell back against the wall francesca minetti stood waiting her face very white she was still wearing chavasses old sweater and looked about fifteen years old chavasse was aware of the breath hissing sharply between orsinis teeth and then the italian was moving forward quickly his voice was strangely gentle and comforting like a father reassuring a frightened child its all right now cara there is nothing to worry about anymore she held his hand gazing up into the ugly battered face and tried to smile and then she started to tremble she turned stumbled across the wreckage of the door and ran into chavasses arms eight it was just after eight oclock on the following evening when the buona esperanza moved away from the jetty and turned out to sea it was a warm soft night with a luminosity shining from the water there was no moon for heavy cloud banked over the horizon as though a storm might be in the offing orsini was at the wheel and chavasse stood beside him leaning forward to peer through the curved deckhouse window into the darkness ahead what about the weather he said force four wind with rain imminent nothing to worry about is it the same for the drin gulf a few fog patches but theyll be more of a help than anything else chavasse lit two cigarettes and handed one to the italian funny what a daytoday business life is i never expected to set foot on albanian soil again the things we do for the ladies orsini grinned but this one is something special paul this i assure you as an expert she reminds me very much of my wife god rest her chavasse looked at him curiously i never knew youd been married a long time ago orsinis face was calm untroubled but the sadness was there in his voice she was only nineteen when we married that was in during my naval service we spent one leave together thats all the following year she was killed in an air raid while staying with her mother in milan there was nothing to be said and chavasse stood there in silence after a while orsini increased speed take over paul ill plot our course chavasse slipped behind him and the italian moved to the chart table for some time he busied himself with the charts and finally nodded in satisfaction we should move into the marshes just before dawn he placed a cheroot between his teeth and grinned what happens after that is in the lap of god do you want me to spell you for a while chavasse asked orsini took over the wheel again and shook his head later paul after carlo has done his trick that way ill be fresh for the runin at dawn chavasse left him there and went down to the galley where he discovered francesca making coffee he leaned in the doorway and grinned thats what i like about italian girls so good in the kitchen she turned and smiled mischievously is that all were good for cooking she wore a pair of old denim pants and a heavy sweater and the long hair was plaited into a single pigtail that hung across one shoulder she looked incredibly fresh and alive and chavasse shook his head i could think of one or two things but the timings wrong what about the terrace of the british embassy too public she poured coffee into a mug and handed it to him theres a place i know in the hills outside rome only a village inn but the food is out of this world you eat it by candlelight on a terrace overlooking a hillside covered with vines the fireflies dance in the wind and you can smell the flowers for a week afterwards its an experience one shouldnt miss im all tied up for the next couple of days chavasse said but after that im free most evenings by a strange coincidence so am i im also in the telephone book and id like to point out that you still owe me a date now how could i forget a thing like that he ducked as she threw a crust of dry bread at his head turned and went through the aft cabin into the salon carlo had two aqualungs and their ancillary equipment laid out on the table theres fresh coffee in the galley chavasse told him ill get some later i want to finish checking this lot he never had much to say for himself a strange silent youth but a good man to have at your back in trouble and devoted to orsini he sat on the edge of the table a cigarette smouldering between his lips and worked his way methodically through the various items of equipment chavasse watched him for a while then went through into the other cabin he lay staring at the bulkhead thinking about the task ahead if francescas memory hadnt failed her and the crossbearing she had given them was accurate then the whole thing was simple there couldnt be more than five or six fathoms of water in those lagoons and the recovery of the statue shouldnt take long with any kind of luck they could be back in matano within twentyfour hours he could hear a rumble of voices from the galley francesca quite distinctly and then carlo laughed which was something unusual chavasse was conscious of a slight unreasoning pang of jealousy he lay there thinking about her and the voices merged with the throbbing of the engine and the rattle of water against the hull he was not conscious of having slept only of being awake and checking his watch and realizing with a shock that it was two am orsini was sleeping on the far bunk his face calm one arm behind his head and chavasse pulled on his reefer coat and went on deck mist swirled from the water and the buona esperanza kicked along at a tremendous pace there was no moon but stars were scattered across the sky like diamonds in a black velvet cushion and there was still that strange luminosity in the water carlo was standing at the wheel his head disembodied in the light from the binnacle chavasse moved in and lit a cigarette how are we doing fine carlo said keep her on onefouroh till three am then alter course to onefourfive guilio said hed be up around four we should be near the coast by then the door banged behind him and a small trapped wind lifted the charts raced round the deckhouse looking for a way out and died in a corner chavasse pulled a seat down from the wall and sat back his hands steady on the wheel this was what he liked more than anything else to be alone with the sea and the night and a boat something deep in his subconscious some race image handed on from his breton ancestors responded to the challenge men who had loved the sea more than any woman who sailed to the grand banks of the north american coast to fish for cod long before columbus or the cabots had dreamed of crossing the atlantic the door opened suddenly as rain dashed against the window and he was aware of the heavy aroma of coffee together with another more subtle fragrance whats wrong with bed at this time in the morning he demanded she chuckled softly oh this is much more fun how are we doing dead on course another hour and orsini takes over for the final runin she pulled a seat down beside him balanced her tray on the chart table and poured coffee into two mugs what about a sandwich he was surprised at the keenness of his appetite and they ate in companionable and intimate silence thighs touching afterwards he gave her a cigarette and she poured more coffee what do you think our chances are paul she said the truth now all depends on how accurately your brother plotted the final position of the launch when she sank if we can find her without too much trouble the rest should be plain sailing diving for the madonna will be no great trick in water of that depth depending on weather conditions we could be on our way back by this evening and you dont anticipate any trouble in the drin gulf from the albanian navy he shook his head from an efficiency point of view its almost nonexistent the russians had a lot of stuff based here before the big bustup but they withdrew when hoxha refused to toe the line something he hadnt reckoned on and chinas too far away to give him that kind of assistance what a country she shook her head i can well believe the old story about god having nothing but trouble left to give when it came to albanias turn chavasse nodded not exactly a happy history a succession of conquerors more than any other country in europe greeks romans goths byzantines serbs bulgars sicilians venetians normans and turks theyve all held the country for varying periods and always the people have struggled to be free chavasse shook his head how ironic life can be after centuries of desperately fighting for independence albania receives it only to find herself in the grip of a tyranny worse than any that has gone before is it really as bad as they say he nodded the sigurmi are everywhere even the italian workers holiday association complain that they get one sigurmi agent allocated to each member of their holiday parties even at a rough estimate hoxha and his boys have purged better than one hundred thousand people since he took over and you know yourself how the various religious groups have been treated stalin would have been proud of him an apt pupil he took out his cigarettes and offered her one she smoked silently for a while and then said slowly last year two of your people who were operating temporarily through the bureau in rome went missing one in albania the other in turkey chavasse nodded matt sorley and jules dumont good men both how can you go on living the life you do that sort of thing must happen a lot look how close you came to not getting out of tirana maybe i just never grew up he said lightly how did it all begin quite by chance i was lecturing in languages at a british university a friend wanted to pull a relative out of czechoslovakia and i gave him a hand thats when the chief pulled me in at that time he was interested in people who spoke eastern european languages an unusual accomplishment some people can work out cube roots in their heads in seconds others can never forget anything they ever read i have the same sort of kink for languages i soak them up like a sponge no effort she lapsed into fluent albanian isnt it a little unnerving dont you ever get your wires crossed not that i can recall he replied faultlessly in the same language i cant afford that kind of mistake if its any consolation i still cant read a chinese newspaper on the other hand ive only ever met two europeans who could with that kind of flair plus your academic training you could pick up a chair in modern languages at almost any university in britain or the states she said doesnt the thought appeal to you not in the slightest i got into this sort of work by chance and by chance i possessed all the virtues needed to make me good at it you mean you actually enjoy it something like that if id been born in germany twenty years earlier id probably have ended up in the gestapo if id been born an albanian i might well have been a most efficient member of the sigurmi who knows she seemed shocked i dont believe you why not it takes a certain type of man or woman to do our kind of work a professional i can recognize the quality and appreciate it in my opposite numbers i dont see anything wrong in that there was a strained silence as if in some way he had disappointed her she reached for the tray id better take these below we must be getting close the door closed behind her and chavasse opened the window and breathed in the sharp morning air feeling rather sad so often people like her the fringe crowd who did the paperwork manned the radios decoded the messages could never really know what it was like in the field what it took to survive well he paul chavasse had survived and not by waving any flags either then what in the hell are you doing here he asked himself and a rueful smile crossed his face what was it orsini had said the things we do for the ladies and he was right this one was something special something very special the door swung open and orsini entered immense in his old reefer coat and peaked cap on the side of his head everything all right paul chavasse nodded and handed over the wheel couldnt be better orsini lit another of his inevitable cheroots good shouldnt be long now dawn seeped into the sky a gray halflight with a heavy mist rolling across the water orsini asked chavasse to take over again and consulted the charts he checked the crossbearing francesca had given him and traced a possible course in from the sea through the maze of channels marked on the chart everything okay chavasse asked orsini came back to the wheel and shrugged i know these charts four or five fathoms and a strong tidal current that means that one day theres a sandbank the next ten fathoms of clear water estuary marshes are always the same well go in through the main outlet of the buene and turn into the marshes about half a mile inland not only safer but a dammed sight quicker the mist enfolded them until they were running through an enclosed world orsini reduced speed to ten knots and a few moments later carlo and francesca came up from below chavasse went and stood in the prow hands in pockets and the marshes drifted out of the mist and their stench filled his nostrils wildfowl called overhead on their way in from the sea and carlo moved beside him and crossed himself a bad place this always i am glad to leave it was a landscape from a nightmare long narrow sandbanks lifted from the water and inland mile upon mile of marsh grass and great reeds marched into the mist interlaced by a thousand creeks and lagoons orsini reduced speed to three knots and leaned from the side window watching the reeds drift by on either side chavasse moved along the deck and looked up at him how far are we from the position francesca gave perhaps three miles but the going would be too difficult in a little while we must carry on in the dinghy much safer and who minds the launch carlo its all arranged he isnt pleased but then he seldom is about anything he grinned down at carlo who glared up at him and went below chavasse moved back along the deck and joined francesca in the prow a few moments later the launch entered a small lagoon perhaps a hundred feet in diameter and orsini cut the engines they glided forward and grounded gently against a sandbank as he came out on deck and joined them he slipped an arm around francescas shoulders and smiled down at her not long now cara a few more hours and well be on our way home again i guilio orsini promise you she looked up at him gravely then turned to chavasse a strange shadowed expression in her eyes and for some unaccountable reason he shivered nine francesca cooked a hot meal perhaps the last they would have for some time and afterwards carlo and chavasse broke out the large rubber dinghy inflated it and attached the outboard motor when they went below for the aqualung orsini was sitting on the edge of the table loading a machine pistol the top of one of the salon seats had been removed and inside there was a varied assortment of weapons the submachine gun a couple of automatic rifles and an old bren of the type used by the british infantry during the war help yourself he said a selection to suit all tastes chavasse picked up one of the automatic rifles a garrand and nodded this will do me what about ammo there should be plenty in there somewhere there were three boxes stacked together the first contained grenades the second several pouched bandoliers chavasse picked one up and orsini shook his head thats an explosive we used during the war for underwater sabotage ive had it for years a hell of a thing to have people sitting on chavasse said orsini grinned just the thing for fishing you stick a chemical detonator in a piece as big as your fist heave it over the side and wait they come floating up by the thousands ill take some along just in case we need to do any blasting chavasse found the ammunition in another box loaded his garrand and strapped a bandolier containing a hundred rounds about his waist he helped carlo up top with one of the aqualungs and they stowed it in the prow of the dinghy along with several other items of equipment as they finished orsini and francesca came up on deck she was wearing an old reefer coat of carlos against the cold the sleeves rolled back and a scarf tied around her head peasantfashion she seemed calm but was extremely pale and there were blue shadows under her eyes chavasse squeezed her hand as he helped her into the dinghy and whispered soon be over well be on our way out again before you know it she smiled wanly but made no reply and he clambered into the dinghy beside her and sat on one side the garrand across his knees orsini followed seating himself in the stern he glanced up at carlo and grinned if all goes well we could be back by this evening certainly no later than dawn tomorrow and if it doesnt always you look on the dark side orsini pressed the automatic starter and the powerful motor roared into life wildfowl rose from the reeds in alarm the sound of them filling the air as carlo released the line the dinghy moved forward quickly chavasse had one final glimpse of his dark saturnine face scowling at them over the rail and then the marsh moved in to enfold them the reeds lifted out of the mist like pale ghosts on either hand the only sound the steady rattle of the outboard motor orsini consulted his compass turning from one narrow waterway to the other moving always toward the position on the chart francesca had given them she sat in silence her hands buried in the pockets of the reefer coat and chavasse watched wondering what she was thinking about her brother probably of his death and her own struggle for survival in this waking nightmare the stench of the marshes heavy and penetrating filled his nostrils and he hurriedly lit a cigarette it was perhaps an hour later that they emerged into a broad waterway and orsini cut the motor this is as near as i can make it from the position you gave me he told francesca recognize anything she stood up and gazed around her when she sat down there was a troubled look on her face they all look the same these waterways but im sure this wasnt the place it was much smaller i can remember my brother running the boat into the reeds to hide her and then we suddenly emerged into this small lagoon orsini stood up and looked around but the reeds stretched into the mist an apparently impenetrable barrier he turned to chavasse and shrugged this is definitely the position he charted so this lagoon she speaks of cant be far away well have to go looking for it thats all chavasse started to undress i hope to god those last malaria shots i had are still active he kept on his shirt pants and shoes against the cold went over the side and struck across the channel orsini followed a moment or so later and swam into the mist in the opposite direction it was bitterly cold and chavasse coughed retching as the strong earthy stench caught at the back of his throat he swam into the reeds following a narrow waterway that turned in a circle bringing him back into the main channel he tried another emerging a few moments later into a shallow lagoon no more than four or five feet deep and he swam across into the reeds forcing his way through just then orsini called through the mist from the other side of the barrier and chavasse pushed toward him he came out on the perimeter of a lagoon no more than a hundred feet across as orsini surfaced in the center the italian floated there coughing a little hair plastered across his forehead chavasse looked down at the launch mirrored in five fathoms of clear water then did a steep surface dive he swallowed to ease the pressure in his ears then grabbed for the deck rail and hung there the launch had tilted over on the shelving bottom and he worked his way round to the stern where he found the name teresa bari inscribed in gold paint across the counter he had a quick look at the general condition of the wreck then released his hold and shot to the surface he trod water gasping for air and grinned at orsini good navigating my mother god rest her always told me i was a genius orsini turned and swam across the lagoon plunging into the reeds and chavasse followed they emerged into the main channel within sight of the dinghy and swam toward it any luck francesca asked orsini nodded just as you described so near and yet so far without that crossbearing it would have been hopeless one could have searched these marshes for a year without finding anything they climbed back into the dinghy and he started the motor and steered for the wall of reeds for a moment they seemed an impossible barrier and chavasse and francesca pulled desperately with all their strength quite suddenly the reeds parted and the dinghy passed into the lagoon orsini cut the motor and they drifted toward the center francesca gazed over the side down through the clear water her face very pale she shivered abruptly and looked up will it take long orsini shook his head well fix a line to hold us in position and one of us will go down with luck well be out of here in a couple of hours he turned to chavasse feel like another swim chavasse nodded why not it couldnt be any colder than it is up here the wind sliced through his wet shirt as he lifted the aqualung onto his back and orsini strapped it into place francesca watched eyes very large in the white face and chavasse grinned a piece of cake well be out of here before you know it she forced a smile and he pulled on his diving mask sat on the rail and allowed himself to fall back into the water as he surfaced orsini tossed him a line chavasse went under paused to adjust his air supply and swam down toward the launch in a sweeping curve the teresa was almost bottomup and he hovered over the stern rail to attach the end of his line and then swam toward the deckhouse which was jammed against the sandy bottom of the lagoon at a steep angle there were jagged bullet holes in the hull and superstructure mute evidence of the fight between the teresa and the albanian patrol boat some sort of a direct hit had been scored on the roof of the salon and the companionway was badly damaged the only entrance being a narrow aperture he managed it pulling himself through by force the aqualung scraping protestingly against the jagged edges of the metal the salon table had broken free of its floor fastenings and floated against the bulkhead together with several bottles and the leather cushions from the salon there was no sign of the madonna or anything remotely resembling it and he swam toward the door leading to the forward cabin the roof at this point had been smashed in by what looked like a cannon shell and a twisted mass of metal blocked the door he turned and swam out through the salon squeezed through the entrance and struck up toward the light he surfaced a few feet astern of the dinghy and swam toward it orsini gave him a hand over the side and chavasse crouched in the bottom and pushed up his mask the interiors in one hell of a mess stuff all over the place and the madonna no sign at all i couldnt get into the inner cabin theres a lot of wreckage at that end of the salon and the doors jammed but that is where it is francesca said i remember now marco put it under one of the bunks for greater safety when the shooting started it was wrapped in a blanket and bound in oilskin against the damp the whole bundle was about five feet long orsini pulled a package from under the stern seat a good thing i brought along some of that explosive youll have to blast your way in he unfolded a bandolier and took out a piece of plastic explosive shaped like a sausage that should be enough we dont want to blow the whole boat apart from another bundle he took a small wooden box containing several chemical pencil detonators each one carefully packed in a plastic sheath how long do these things give me chavasse demanded a full minute ive got some which take longer but i left them on the boat well thanks very much friend chavasse said what are you hoping to do collect on my insurance a minute should be plenty all you have to do is insert the fuse break the end and get out of it ill go myself if you like stop trying to show off chavasse told him in any case youll never get that frame of yours in through the salon companionway he was conscious of francescas face white and troubled as he gripped the rubber mouthpiece of his breathing tube between his teeth pulled down his mask and went backwards over the side he went down through the clear water quickly negotiated the companionway with no trouble and moved inside he jammed the plastic explosive into the corner at the bottom of the door inserted the detonator carefully for a moment he floated there looking at it then he snapped the end the fuse started to burn at once fizzing like a firecracker and he turned and swam for the companionway as he squeezed through the narrow opening his aqualung snagged on the jagged metal he paused fighting back the panic and eased himself through a moment later he was shooting toward the surface he broke through at the side of the dinghy and orsini pulled him over there was a muffled roar and the dinghy rocked in the turbulence the surface of the water boiled and wreckage bobbed up sand and mud spreading in a great stain toward the reeds they waited for fifteen minutes and gradually the water cleared again and the hull of the launch became visible orsini nodded and chavasse went over the side there was still a lot of sand and mud hanging in suspension like a great curtain obscuring his vision but not seriously and he went down toward the teresa the explosion had even disturbed the entrance to the companionway the turbulence blowing the wreckage back out onto the deck and he passed through the salon himself with no trouble where the door to the cabin had been there was now only a gaping hole and he swam forward paused for a moment and then moved inside the tiered bunks were still intact but bedding floated against the bulkhead moving languorously in the water like some living thing he pushed his way through their pale fronds and looked for the madonna it became immediately obvious that he was wasting his time there was no fivefoot bundle wrapped in oilskins as francesca had described the madonna was carved out of ebony a heavy wood but one that would float and he drifted up through the waving blankets pulling them to one side searching desperately but he was wasting his time back outside he grabbed for the stern rail and floated there like some strange sea creature his webbed feet hanging down perhaps francesca had been wrong maybe her brother had moved it to some other place in the launch and there was always the chance that it had been blown clear in the explosion he decided to start again working his way from one end of the launch to the other but first he had to let orsini know what had happened he surfaced a few feet away from the dinghy and went under again in the same moment orsini was standing with his back to him hands above his head on the far side of the dinghy was a flatbottomed marsh punt an outboard motor at its stern its occupants were three albanians in drab and dirty uniforms on their peaked caps the red star of the army of the republic two of them menaced orsini and francesca with submachine guns while the third was in the act of stepping across chavasse went under the dinghy in a shallow dive as submachinegun fire churned the water where he had surfaced his aqualung scraped the bottom of the punt and he reached up grabbed the thwart and pulled the frail craft completely over one of the soldiers sprawled against him legs thrashing in a panic and chavasse slipped an arm around his neck and took him into deep water his legs scraped painfully against the stern rail of the teresa and he hung on with one hand tightening his grip the soldiers face twisted to one side hands clawing back wrenching the breathing tube from his assailants mouth chavasse tightened his lips and hung on the mans limbs moved in slow motion weakening perceptibly until suddenly he stopped struggling altogether chavasse released his grip and the body spun away from him the sand at the bottom of the lagoon had churned into a great cloud and he clamped the mouthpiece of his breathing tube between his teeth and struck out for the surface above him there was a tremendous disturbance limbs thrashing together in a violent struggle he came up into the center of it pulling his knife from his sheath and struck out at a dim khakiclad shape the soldier bucked agonizingly shoving chavasse away so that he broke through to the surface a couple of yards away from him a fifteenfoot motor boat bumped against the dinghy he was aware of francesca struggling in the grip of two soldiers of orsini floating against the hull blood on his face a soldier rushed to the rail machine gun leveled and a man in a dark leather coat with a high fur collar ran forward and knocked the barrel to one side the bullets discharging themselves harmlessly in the sky alive i want him alive for one brief moment chavasse looked up into adem kapos excited face then he jackknifed and went down through the water his webbed feet driving him toward the edge of the lagoon he swam into the reeds forcing his way through desperately a few moments later he surfaced behind him he could hear voices calling excitedly and then the engine of the motor boat coughed into life he broke through into the main channel moved straight across it into a narrow tributary and started to swim for his life ten the motor boat turned out of a side channel into the main stream of the buene river the dinghy trailing behind on a line in the stern four soldiers huddled together smoking cigarettes and talking in low tones the bodies of their two comrades killed in the lagoon by chavasse lay under a tarpaulin beside them orsini was handcuffed to the rail and seemed half unconscious his head roughly bandaged where a rifle butt had struck him a glancing blow there was no sign of francesca minetti but adem kapo paced the foredeck impatiently smoking a cigarette the fur collar of his hunting jacket turned up orsini watched him eyes half closed and after a while another man appeared from the companionway he was as big as orsini with a scarred brutal face and wore the uniform of a colonel in the army of the albanian republic with the green insignia of the intelligence corps on his collar kapo turned on him eyes like black holes in his small face well the colonel shrugged she isnt being very helpful the anger blazed out of the little man like a searing flame you said it would work damn you that all we had to do was wait and theyd walk right into the net what in the hell am i supposed to tell them in tirana what do you think hes going to do swim out of here the big man laughed coldly well run him down never fear a night out on his own in a place like this will shrink him down to size lets hope youre right kapo walked across to orsini looked down at him for a moment then kicked him in the side orsini continued to feign unconsciousness kapo turned away and resumed his pacing as the motor boat rounded a point of land jutting from the mist into the river chavasse parted the reeds carefully he stood up to his chest in water no more than fifteen yards away as it passed and his trained eyes took in everything orsini and the soldiers kapo standing in the prow the cigarette holder jutting from a corner of his mouth the most interesting thing was the presence of tashko when chavasse had last encountered him he had been dressed like any seaman off the taranto waterfront now he wore the uniform of a colonel in the albanian intelligence corps which explained a lot beyond him through the deckhouse window chavasse could just see the head and shoulders of haji the knife man standing at the wheel the motor boat passed into the mist and he waded onto a piece of comparatively dry land to take stock of the situation the stench of the marsh filled his nostrils and the bitter cold ate into his bones there was a hell of a lot about the whole affair that didnt make any kind of sense but the basic situation was obvious enough adem kapo was no ordinary agent but someone a lot more important than that probably a highranking sigurmi officer hed have to be to have a colonel of intelligence taking orders from him in any event he was a man who knew what he was doing hed obviously sailed straight for the buene from matano and his twentyfourhour start had given him the time hed needed to reach tama and organize a suitable reception the buona esperanza must have been under observation from the moment it hit the coast and tracking the dinghy would have been no great trick to men who knew the marshes he wondered what had happened to carlo he too was probably on his way to tama by now it was the only sizable town in the area and certain to be kapos base the engine of the motor boat faded into the distance and he slid into the water and started to swim after it within an hour at the outside theyd be out in force looking for him probably concentrating their search toward the coast under the circumstances tama would probably be a whole lot safer at least there would be houses scattered along the riverbank and where there were houses there was dry clothes and food there might even be a chance of doing something about the others although he didnt hold out much hope of that about fifteen minutes later the air in his aqualung ran out he surfaced quickly and waded from the river into the reeds he pulled off his rubber flippers unbuckled the heavy aqualung and let it sink into the ooze he went forward through the reeds and the wildfowl called as they lifted from the water disturbed by his passing after a while he came out on higher ground and moved on through the mist keeping the river on his left it was hard going through mud flats and marsh and constantly he had to wade across narrow creeks often sinking up to his waist in thick glutinous mud the saltwater stung his eyes painfully and the intense cold steadily drove every trace of warmth from his body until his limbs had lost all feeling he moved into the gray curtain and the ground became firmer and he found himself stumbling across firm sand and springy marsh grass he paused on a small hillock head turned slightly to one side he could smell woodsmoke heavy and pungent on the air drifting before the wind a narrow arm of the river encircled a small island and a low house looked from the mist there was no sign of life and no boat was moored at the narrow wooden jetty probably the home of a fisherman or wildfowler out at his traps chavasse moved upstream disturbing a wild duck and walked into the river allowing the current to sweep him in toward the island he landed in the reeds and moved through them carefully drawing his knife the house was no more than twenty yards away a poor enough looking place of roughhewn logs with a shingle roof and stone chimney two or three scrawny hens picked apathetically at the soil and scattered as he moved across the patch of open ground the back door was simply several heavy wooden planks nailed together and it opened with a protesting groan as he unfastened the chain that held it he moved into a small dark room that was obviously some sort of kitchen there was a cupboard a rough table and a pail of fresh water at the side of the door the living room was furnished with a table and several chairs there were two or three cupboards and a skin rug covered the wooden floor in front of the stone hearth on which logs burned fitfully heavily banked by ashes he crouched to the warmth spreading his hands and a cold wind seemed to touch the side of his face a voice said quietly easy now hands behind your neck and dont try anything stupid he came up slowly there was a soft footstep and the hard barrel of a gun was pushed against his back as a hand reached for the hilt of the knife at his waist he pivoted to the left swinging away from the gun barrel there was a cry of dismay as they came together and fell heavily to the floor chavasse raised his right arm to bring down the edge of his hand he paused his opponent was a young girl perhaps nineteen or twenty certainly no more she wore a heavy waterproof hunting jacket corduroy breeches and leather knee boots and her dark hair was closecropped like a young boys the skin sallow over high cheekbones the eyes dark brown she was not beautiful and yet in any crowd she would have stood out now theres a thing he said softly and sat back for a moment she lay there eyes widening in surprise and then in a flash she was on her feet again like a cat the hunting rifle in her hands she stood there feet apart the barrel steady on his chest and he waited the barrel wavered sank slowly she leaned the rifle against the table and examined him curiously her eyes took in his bare feet the shirt and pants that were clinging to his body she nodded youre on the run arent you where from the chain gang at tama he shook his head im on the run all right angel but not from there she scowled and reached for the rifle again youre no gegh thats for sure you speak like a tosk from the big city chavasse was aware of the enmity that still existed between the two main racial groups in albania the geghs of the north with their loyalty to family and tribe and the tosks of the south from whom communism had sprung there were times when a man had to play a hunch and this was one of them his face split into that inimitable charming smile that was one of his greatest assets and he raised a hand as the rifle was turned again neither gegh or tosk im an outlander her face was a study of bewilderment an outlander from where yugoslavia he shook his head italy understanding dawned ah a smuggler something like that we were surprised by the military i managed to get away i think theyve taken my friends to tama she stood watching him a thoughtful frown on her face and he made the final gesture and held out his hand paul chavasse french she said and english a little of both she made her decision and her hand reached for his liri kupi there was a gegh chieftain called abas kupi leader of the legaliteri the royalist party head of our clan he fled to italy after the communists murdered most of his friends at a socalled friendship meeting you dont sound as if you care for hoxha and his friends very much hoxha she spat vigorously and accurately into the fire eleven chavasse stood on a rush mat beside the large bed and rubbed himself down with a towel until his flesh glowed he dressed quickly in the clothes liri had provided corduroy pants a checked wool shirt and kneelength leather boots a size too large so that he took them off again and pulled on an extra pair of socks the clothes had belonged to her brother conscripted into the army at eighteen he had been killed in one of the many patrol clashes that took place almost daily along the yugoslavian border her father had died fighting with the royalist party in the mountains in the last year of the war since the death of her mother she had lived alone in the marshes where she had been born and bred earning her living from wildfowling she was crouched at the fire when he went back into the living room stirring something in a large pot suspended from a hook she turned and smiled pushing back the hair from her forehead all you need now is some food inside you he pulled a chair to the table as she spooned a hot stew onto a tin plate he wasted no time on conversation but picked up his spoon and started to eat when the plate was empty she filled it again he sat back with a sigh they couldnt have done better at the london hilton she opened a bottle and filled a glass with a colorless liquid id like to offer you some coffee but its very hard to come by these days this is a spirit we distill ourselves very potent if youre not used to it but it can be guaranteed to keep out the marsh fever it exploded in chavasses stomach and spread through his body in a warm glow he coughed several times and tears sprang to his eyes now this they wouldnt be able to offer even at the london hilton she opened an old tin carefully and offered him a cigarette they were macedonian coarse brown tobacco loose in the paper but chavasse knew how to handle them he screwed the end round expertly and leaned across the table as she held out a burning splinter from the fire she lit a cigarette herself blew out a cloud of pungent smoke and said calmly youre no smuggler i can see that no seaman either your hands are too nice so i lied you must have had a good reason he frowned down into his glass for a moment then decided to go ahead youve heard of the virgin of scutari the black madonna who hasnt her statue disappeared about three months ago the general opinion is that the central government in tirana had it stolen theyre worried because people have been turning to the church again lately i came to the buene looking for it chavasse said it was supposed to be on board a launch that sank in one of the lagoons in the marsh toward the coast my friends and i were searching for it when the military turned up he told her about francesca minetti or as much as she needed to know and of guilio orsini and carlo and the buona esperanza when he was done she nodded slowly a bad business the sigurmi will squeeze them dry even this smuggler friend of yours they have their ways and they are not pleasant im sorry for the girl god knows what they will do with her i was wondering whether it would be possible to get into tama chavasse said perhaps find out whats happened to them she looked at him sharply her face grave we have a saying only a fool puts his head between the jaws of the tiger theyll be beating the marshes toward the coast he said that stands to reason whos going to look for me in tama a good point she got to her feet and looked down into the fire her hand on the stone mantel above it she turned to face him there is one person who might be able to help a franciscan father shedu in the war he was a famous resistance fighter in the hills a legend in his own time it would hardly be polite to arrest or shoot such a man they content themselves with making life difficult for him always with the utmost politeness of course he hasnt been here long a couple of months or so i think the last man was taken away i could make a good guess about what happened to him chavasse said this father shedu hes in tama now theres a medieval monastery on the outskirts of the town they use it as local military headquarters the catholic church has been turned into a restaurant but theres an old monastery chapel at the waters edge father shedu holds his services there would it be difficult to reach from here she shrugged not more than half an hour i have an outboard motor not too reliable but it gets me there could i borrow it oh no she shook her head theyd pick you up before youd got a mile along the river i know the back ways you dont she took down an oilskin jacket from behind the door and tossed it to him together with an old peaked cap ready when you are she picked up her hunting rifle and led the way out through the front door and down toward the river there was still no boat moored at the little wooden jetty she passed it moving through dense undergrowth and emerged on a small cleared bank that dropped cleanly into the water her boat a flatbottomed marsh punt with an old motor attached to the stern was tied to a tree chavasse cast off while she busied herself with the motor as it coughed into life he pushed the punt through the encircling reeds and stepped in liri kupi certainly knew what she was doing at one point they hit rough water where the river twisted round sandbanks spilling across ragged rocks and she handled the frail craft like an expert swinging the tiller at just the right moment to sweep them away from the worst hazards after a while they left the buene turning into a narrow creek that circled through a great stagnant swamp losing itself among a hundred lagoons and waterways when they finally came into the river again it was in the lee of a large island the mist hung like a gray curtain from bank to bank and as they moved from the shelter of the island to cross over he could smell woodsmoke and somewhere a dog barked the first houses loomed out of the mist scattered along one side of the river and liri took the punt in close she produced the tin of cigarettes from her pocket and threw it to chavasse better have one try to look at home home was never like this he lit a cigarette leaned back against the prow and watched the town unfold itself there were fewer than five hundred inhabitants these days that much he knew since the cold war had warmed up between yugoslavia and albania the river traffic had almost stopped and the buene was now so silted up as to be unnavigable for boats of any size the monastery lifted out of the mist a vast sprawling medieval structure with crumbling walls several hundred yards back from the riverbank the albanian flag hanging limply in the rain lifted in a gust of wind the red star standing out vividly against the black doubleheaded eagle and a bugle sounded faintly a little farther along the bank forty or fifty convicts worked some of them waistdeep in water as they drove in the piles for a new jetty chavasse noticed that the ones on the banks had their ankles chained together politicals liri said briefly they send them here from all over the country they dont last long in the marshes when the hot weather comes she eased the tiller turning the punt in toward the bank and a small ruined chapel whose crumbling walls fell straight into the river at the foot of the wall the entrance to a narrow tunnel gaped darkly and liri took the punt inside there was a good six feet of headroom and chavasse reached out to touch cold damp walls straining his eyes into the darkness which suddenly lightened considerably liri cut the motor and the punt drifted in toward a landing stage constructed of large blocks of worked masonry they scraped beside a flight of stone steps and chavasse tied up to an iron ring and handed her out light filtered down from somewhere above and she smiled through the half darkness i shant be long she mounted a flight of stone steps and chavasse lit another cigarette sat on the edge of the jetty and waited she was gone for at least fifteen minutes when she returned she didnt come all the way down but called to him from the top of the steps he went up quickly and she turned opened a large oak door and led the way along a narrow passage she opened another door at the far end and they stepped into the interior of the small chapel the lights were very dim and down by the altar the candles flickered and the holy mother was bathed in light the smell of incense was overpowering and chavasse felt a little giddy it was a long time since he had been in church too long as his mother was never tired of reminding him and he smiled wryly as they moved down the aisle father shedu knelt in prayer at the altar the brown habit dark and somber in the candlelight his eyes were closed the worn face completely calm and somehow the ugly puckered scar of the old bullet wound that had carried away the left eye seemed completely in character he was a man strong in his faith certain in his knowledge of that which was ultimately important men like enver hoxha and adem kapo would come and go ultimately to break upon the rock that was father shedu he crossed himself got to his feet in one smooth movement and turned to face them chavasse suddenly felt awkward under the keen scrutiny of that single eye for a moment he was a little boy again at his grandfathers village in finistere just after the war when france was free again standing before the old implacable parish priest trying to explain his absence from mass the tongue drying in his mouth father shedu smiled and held out his hand i am happy to meet you my son liri has told me something of why you are here chavasse shook hands relief flowing through him she seemed to think you might be able to help father i know something of what happened to the statue of our lady of scutari the priest said it was my predecessor father kupescu who gave it into the charge of the young man who was later killed in the marshes father kupescu has since paid for his actions with his life i might add the girl who was with me was the young mans sister chavasse said she was the one who guided us to the position of minettis launch father shedu nodded she and an italian named orsini arrived in tama earlier this afternoon they were taken to the monastery are you sure i was visiting sick prisoners at the time one of the little privileges i still insist on im surprised youre allowed to function at all father shedu smiled faintly as you may have noticed my name is the same as that of our beloved president something for which the average party member holds me in superstitious awe they can never be quite sure that im not some kind of third cousin you see there are things they can do of course we had a wonderful old church here now its a restaurant they use the altar as a counter and the nave is crammed with tables at which the happy workers can consume kebab and shashlik to the greater glory of enver hoxha all things in their own good time father chavasse said the priest smiled as it happens i can help you mr chavasse your friends are at the moment imprisoned in the back guardroom which is inside the inner wall of the monastery a colonel of intelligence and a high sigurmi official named kapo who brought them in left again almost at once with every spare soldier they could lay their hands on to look for me obviously i shouldnt think there will be more than one man on duty at the guardroom perhaps two but how could we get in father liri demanded there are two walls to pass through and guards on each gate we go under my dear its really quite simple the good fathers who built this monastery thought of everything come with me he led the way out of the chapel and back along the passage to the door that led down to the landing stage he took an electric torch from a ledge on which an icon stood and went down to the waters edge when he switched on the torch its beam played against the rough walls of the tunnel which ran on into the darkness narrowing considerably the monasterys underground sewage system comes down through here to empty into the river he said not a pleasant journey im afraid but one that will take you inside the walls without being seen show me the way thats all i ask father chavasse said you can leave the rest to me to require you not to use violence against violent men would be absurd father shedu said but you must understand that i myself could not possibly take part in any such action you accept this willingly the priest turned to liri you will stay here child she shook her head there may be a use for me please father i know what im doing he didnt bother to argue but hitched his trailing robes into the leather belt at his waist and stepped into the water on the lefthand side of the tunnel it was no more than ankledeep and chavasse followed along a broad ledge his head lowered as the roof dropped to meet them there was a strong earthy smell and a slight mist curled from the water fanning out against the damp roof the tunnel stretched into the darkness and gradually the water became deeper until he could feel it swirling about his knees by now the stench was appalling and he stumbled on his stomach heaving finally the priest turned into a side passage that came out into a cavern about fifty feet in diameter it was some three feet deep in stinking water and at least a dozen tunnels emptied into it the franciscan waded across and counted from the left i think the eighth will be the one the tunnel was no more than four feet high and chavasse paused at the entrance and reached out to liri are you all right fine she chuckled the swamps stink worse than this lot in the summer they bent double and went after father shedu who was now several yards ahead a few moments later he stopped light filtered down through some sort of grille and a short tunnel sloped up toward the surface if i am right the priest said we should be in a cell of the old cloisters behind the square containing the guardhouse the tunnel was a good fifty feet in length the stonework smooth and slippery making it difficult to climb the priest went first liri next and chavasse brought up the rear he jammed himself between the narrow walls working his way up foot by foot once liri slipped falling back against him but he managed to hold her and they continued above them father shedu was already at the entrance a large slab that had been carved by some master craftsman into a stone grille he put his shoulder to it and it slid back easily he climbed out and turned to give liri a hand chavasse clambered up after them and found himself in a small crumbling cell with a gaping doorway that opened into halfruined cloisters broken pillars lifting into the sky grass growing between great cracked stone slabs through the cloisters and you will come to the square father shedu said the guardroom is a small flatroofed building of brick and concrete a slight smile touched his mouth from here you are on your own there is nothing more i can do for you as i said earlier i must not play any active part in this affair i will wait here he turned to liri you will stay with me she shook her head stubbornly there may be something i can do something to help father shedus right chavasse said you stay if you want my gun then you take me she patted the stock of the old hunting rifle thats my final word chavasse looked at the priest who sighed heavily a will of iron im afraid and she hates the reds chavasse said to liri you can come as far as the edge of the square you watch from there while i go in if anything goes wrong youll have plenty of time to join father shedu and get clear all right he moved out across the ruined courtyard and through the cloisters to the crumbling wall on the far side the square stretched before him quiet and still the guardhouse was built against the wall halfway along the other side just as father shedu had described a difficult place to come at from the front in the far wall great double gates leading to the outer square were closed chavasse turned to liri you stay here im going to work my way round the wall so that i come in from the other side where theres no windows if anything happens get out of it fast and back to father shedu she started to protest but he pulled the rifle firmly from her grasp now be a good girl and do as youre told he moved along behind the ruined wall to the point where it joined the other stepped into the open and ran half crouching until he reached the side of the guardhouse he paused conscious of the sweat soaking his shirt and started forward at that moment the guardhouse door opened and someone stepped out chavasse heard voices two men talking one of them laughed and a match was struck he was trapped with no place to run if one of them took a step to the corner of the building he was certain to be discovered a fresh young voice called heh you there yes you you great ox come here liri kupi strolled calmly across the square her hands in her pockets her intention was obviously to attract the attention of the guards and she succeeded perfectly as chavasse went along the side of the guardhouse two soldiers moved out to meet liri they werent even armed and one of them was stripped to the waist as if he had been having a wash chavasse ran forward raised the rifle and rammed it down hard against an exposed neck as the soldier crumpled with a groan the other swung round chavasse swung the barrel into the mans stomach he keeled over and the butt of the rifle smashed his skull chavasse was already moving toward the door when liri arrived on the run her face flushed there cant be anyone else theyd have come out when i called lets hope youre right the outer office was quiet papers scattering across the desk in the wind that blew in through the doorway keys hung on a board on the far wall chavasse moved across quickly and opened the inner door there were only six cells the first four were empty guilio orsini was in the fifth sprawled on a narrow bunk head on hands now then you old bastard chavasse said amiably the italian sat up an expression of astonishment on his face he jumped on his feet and crossed to the grille paul by all thats holy you go in for miracles now ask and ye shall receive chavasse said youll never know just how apt that quotation is wheres francesca next door weve been here ever since we arrived kapo took off again in something of a hurry presumably to chase you hes out of luck liri was beside him with the keys as she released orsini chavasse was already at the next grille francesca minetti stood there eyes like dark holes in the white face i knew youd come paul he took the keys from liri and unlocked the cell francesca came straight into his arms he held her close for a moment then pushed her away weve got to get moving orsini was already ahead of them following liri and chavasse picked up the rifle and pushed francesca along the passage the italian paused in the doorway and looked out into the square seems quiet enough the noise of the siren rising through the still air was like a physical blow numbing the senses chavasse swung round and saw francesca on the other side of the room she had opened a small metal box on the wall and her thumb was pressed firmly against a scarlet button he pulled her away so violently that she staggered back against the desk what the hell are you playing at she spat in his face and slapped him heavily across the left cheek and in an instinctive reflex action he returned the blow with his clenched fist knocking her to the floor she lay there moaning softly and orsini grabbed chavasse by the sleeve pulling him round for gods sake whats going on a single shot echoed across the square splintering the doorpost and orsini ducked pulling liri to the floor chavasse looked out through the window and saw a movement on the wall above the great gates another rifle shot was followed by the rapid stutter of a submachine gun and a line of bullets kicked a cloud of dust into the air in a brown curtain he smashed the window with the butt end of the hunting rifle aimed quickly and fired there was a faint cry and a soldier pitched over the parapet and fell still clutching his rifle one of the two guards lying in the square pushed himself onto his knees an expression of bewilderment on his face chavasse shot him through the head and ducked out of sight as the mans comrades started to concentrate on the window he moved to the doorway and crouched beside orsini and the girl there must be half a dozen of them up there now and more on the way im going to draw their fire it might give you and liri a chance she knows the way just do as she says orsini opened his mouth to protest but chavasse was already running into the square he flung himself down beside the body of the guard he had shot took aim and started to fire at the men on the wall behind him orsini and the girl emerged from the guardhouse and started to run it was at precisely that moment that the great double doors on the far side of the square swung open an engine burst into life and a jeep roared through in a cloud of dust a light machine gun was mounted on a swivel in the rear and colonel tashko swung it in a half arc a line of bullets churning the dust into fountains beside orsini and the girl bringing them to a halt hands held high chavasse the heart freezing inside him saw a detail of soldiers come through the gate rifles at the port in the moment that the jeep braked slewing broadside on francesca staggered past him and lurched toward it chavasse jumped to his feet and fired the hunting rifle from the hip as he ran his first shot kicked up dirt a foot to one side of her and then something punched him in the left arm spinning him round the rifle flying from his grasp he crouched like an animal holding his arm tightly blood oozing between the fingers and heard boots crunch through the dirt in the sudden silence when he raised his eyes adem kapo looked down at him a slight smile fixed to the small mouth twelve rain drifted in through the bars of the window and chavasse pulled himself up and looked out across the monastery walls toward the river he was immediately aware of the pain in his left arm and dropped with a curse the bullet had passed through cleanly a flesh wound and the only treatment he had so far received was to have it bandaged they were in some sort of storeroom on the second floor of the main building liri kupi slept in the corner a blanket hitched over her shoulders orsini crouched beside her to straighten the blanket when he rose to his feet there was a strange expression on his face quite a girl a pity she had to get mixed up in a thing like this as ive already explained she wasnt supposed to chavasse walked to the door peered through the grille at the guard outside god what a fool ive been and i never saw it francesca orsini shook his head i still cant believe it she said the madonna was in the forward cabin and it wasnt and remember we had to blast our way in how do you get round that he kicked a packing case savagely the little bitch that night outside the tabu when she was attacked they must have been waiting for me to show the whole thing was laid on for my benefit but why orsini demanded it doesnt make sense and what happened to the madonna thats one thing id like to know myself that part of the story was genuine enough because father shedu confirmed it at least they dont seem to have laid hands on him which is a good thing a key rattled in the lock and the door was flung open liri came awake and scrambled to her feet as two soldiers moved into the room followed by tashko he examined the girl and smiled ill come to you later she spat in his face and he reached out quick as a snake and grabbed her shoulder as orsini and chavasse started forward the soldiers raised their machine pistols threateningly tashkos face was quite expressionless as his thumb expertly pressed a nerve against bone liris mouth opened in a cry and she crumpled to the floor he turned to chavasse adjusting his leather gloves karate my friend perhaps youve heard of it you were lucky with the vodka bottle next time all the luck will be mine this i promise you he nodded and one of the soldiers grabbed chavasse by the shoulder and dragged him outside he had a quick glimpse of orsini dropping to one knee beside the girl and then the door closed they took him along the wide stoneflagged passage and up a narrow circular staircase at the far end tashko opened a door at the top and led the way into a comfortably furnished office adem kapo sat behind a desk reading through some papers he glanced up and a smile flashed across his face youll never know just how much of a pleasure this is weve been most anxious to lay hands on you since that little affair in tirana the other week sigurmi kapo nodded my italian front is only one of the numerous facets of my personality as im sure youll appreciate oh i do chavasse said but what about a few answers only sporting and all that but of course kapo smiled jovially the english side of your nature coming out i presume the business in matano it was all a fix no ramiz no marco minetti ramiz was just a little blood on the floor and a substantial bribe to a young woman who lived just across the hall from his room minetti was a figment of the imagination which explains why francesca was so insistent that i didnt disclose what was going on to rome kapo nodded the story was genuine enough it was played out by a rather highminded young italian named carveggio who tried the same trick and got his head blown off for his pains and the statue we recovered it from the wreck almost immediately he nodded to tashko who went to a cupboard opened it and took out a shapeless bundle he unwrapped a gray blanket and set the statue on the desk she was perhaps four feet high and carved from a single piece of ebony her robes inlaid with gold the features carried an expression of wonderful serenity and peace a supreme achievement by some great artist all right chavasse said in all essential details the story handed me by francesca minetti was true and it did what it was supposed to do got me back into albania which means you went to a hell of a lot of trouble why kapo selected a cigarette from a wooden box on the desk and leaned back in his chair as you may know relations between my own poor country and the ussr and its satellites have somewhat deteriorated over the past few years in our trouble only one friend came to our aid china how touching we are a sentimental people i assure you we like to pay our debts the report from our counterintelligence section which contained the information that you intended to enter our country as a member of an italian workers holiday group was passed on to chinese intelligence headquarters in tirana as a matter of courtesy they expressed great interest apparently you did them some disservice in tibet last year something to do with a doctor hoffner i understand we promised to let them have you and then i slipped through your fingers but not for long you must agree and thanks to only one person an extremely able member of the counterintelligence section of the sigurmi perhaps youd like to meet her when tashko opened the door she came in at once she was still in the clothes she had worn on the boat but looked different harder more assured why francesca why he said i am as much albanian as i am italian she said calmly one cant have a foot in both worlds i chose mine long ago you mean youve been working for the other side ever since the bureau took you on how else did you think our people in tirana knew you were coming i only transmitted that radio warning from scutari because the night duty officer was present when it came in and then it really hit him for the first time at the very heart of things with a top security rating someone from the other side had been sitting for two years passing on the information men had sweated and died for perhaps even sending them to their deaths something of this must have shown on his face and she smiled slightly oh yes paul i have accomplished great things remember matt sorley and the frenchman dumont neither of them lasted long i saw to that and there were others you lousy bitch you killed my husband paul she said calmly and a cold hatred blazed from her eyes your husband he frowned slightly and shook his head i dont know what youre talking about in any case ive seen your personal file there was no mention of any marriage not a difficult thing to keep quiet about if one goes the right way about it his name was enrico noci you drowned him like a rat in a fishing net no marks no violence just an accident which i must say was really damned ingenious of you kapo put in there was obviously nothing more to say and chavasse turned from her to the little man what happens now a quick flight to peking no rush kapo grinned weve all the time in the world and theres so much you could tell me how on earth you managed to get inside the monastery for example of course that was the idea that you should show up we were quite certain that a man of your resource and energy wouldnt leave his friends in the lurch but to be perfectly honest your sudden materialization out of thin air was even more than id reckoned on a trick i picked up from an old fakir in india years ago fascinating you can tell me all about it when i return if you cant im sure tashko can persuade the young lady you picked up on your travels to be more cooperative chavasse ignored the veiled threat and calmly helped himself to a cigarette from the box on the desk youre going somewhere didnt i explain kapo took another cigarette lit it and tossed the matches across to chavasse they might have been good friends enjoying a pleasant conversation its really rather ingenious though i do say it myself at the moment your young friend arezzi is sitting on the buona esperanza awaiting your return which didnt make sense at all chavasse was unable to suppress a slight frown and kapo smiled later tonight i shall take francesca in the motor boat to within a reasonable distance of the launch in the gray light of dawn she will float out of the mist in your dinghy in a distressed condition i might add and with an even more distressing story to tell but of course theyll be most upset back in rome when they hear theyve lost the gallant chavasse and his friend orsini and you think theyll accept francesca back into the fold without a question chavasse shook his head my boss has a mind like a sewer hell check every step shes taken since she was six months old i wouldnt be too sure kapo smiled you see shell have the black madonna with her such a lovely stroke of propaganda against albania everyone will be so pleased and he was right it was good kapo started to laugh and nodded to tashko take him back to his friends ill deal with him when i return in the morning chavasse turned to face francesca she held his gaze for a moment then looked away and tashko gave him a push toward the door they went down the stairs and back along the corridor just before they reached the storeroom again tashko paused to light a long russian cigarette the two soldiers waited respectfully a few paces away obviously frightened to death of him and he glared at chavasse coldly that one up there is a big man with words but i have a different approach soon you will find this out why dont you take a running jump chavasse said calmly rage flared in the cold eyes tashko took a step forward and restrained himself with obvious difficulty there was a door to another room to one side of chavasse and quite suddenly the albanians right fist shot forward in a straight line in that terrible basic karate blow known as the reverse punch the inchthick center plank of the door splintered and sagged inwards there was a little japanese professor whose class chavasse attended three times a week whenever he was in london who could do the same thing to three planks at once and he was half tashkos size his words echoed faintly like an old tune science chavasse san science not force god did not intend the brute to lord it over the earth try to imagine what that would have done to your face tashko said its certainly a thought chavasse moved on along the passage one of the soldiers unlocked the door and they pushed him inside as it closed he looked through the grille into tashkos cold eyes the albanian nodded ill be back his footsteps died along the corridor and chavasse turned to the others orsini was sitting by the window an arm around liri and the blanket was draped over their shoulders it was bitterly cold what happened orsini demanded chavasse told him when he had finished liri shook her head she must be a devil that one no cara no devil orsini said she is like all her kind convinced that she alone knows the ultimate truth of things to achieve it she believes anything to be permissible which doesnt help any of us one little bit chavasse said he went and sat on a packing case turning up the collar of his jacket and folded his arms to conserve what heat was left in his body thinking about francesca minetti so enrico noci had been her husband strange that a woman so obviously intelligent should fall for that sort of man orsini and liri were talking together in low voices an intimacy between them what was it someone had once said a day told you as much about a person as ten years pity theyd had to meet under such circumstances how ironic that guilio orsini the man who had penetrated the main harbor at alexandria on one of the first underwater chariots who had sunk two british destroyers survivor of one desperate exploit after another through the years should end like this because he had been touched by the apparent sorrow of a young girl life could be strangely puzzling after a while his head dropped forward on his breast and he slept thirteen chavasse was not certain of what had caused him to awaken and he lay for a moment staring through the darkness conscious of the ache in his cramped muscles of the bitter cold his watch was still functioning and the luminous dial told him that it was two am he sat there for a moment aware of the wind howling across the square outside and got to his feet there was movement in the corridor and when he looked out through the grille he could see the sentry standing in front of his chair a look of abject terror on his face colonel tashko confronted him hands on hips so you were sleeping you worm his hand lashed forward catching the unfortunate sentry across the side of the face sending him back across his chair with a crash as the man scrambled to his feet tashko booted him along the corridor go on get out of it report to the guardhouse ill deal with you later orsini and liri awakened by the disturbance came to the door what is it orsini demanded tashko chavasse told him briefly i think hes drunk the albanian moved to the door and looked through the grille at chavasse his tunic hung open and underneath he was naked to the waist great muscles standing out like cords he unbuckled the black leather holster at his hip and took out a mauser then unlocked the door and opened it slowly liri took a step forward toward orsini whose arm encircled her at once how touching tashko said its been a long day and wed like to get a little sleep chavasse said so kindly state your business and get to hell out of here still full of fight tashko said thats the way i like it lets have you outside and what if i tell you to go to hell i shoot the girl through her left kneecap a pity to waste good material but there it is orsini took a step forward but chavasse pushed him back leave it guilio my affair he moved into the corridor and tashko slammed the door and locked it i dont think kapos going to like this hes saving me for peking to hell with peking tashko said in any case im in charge now kapo and the girl left half an hour ago he sent chavasse staggering down the corridor and followed three feet behind the mauser ready for action they went down a spiral staircase at the far end turned along a broad stone passage and descended a flight of stone steps that seemed to go down forever at the bottom tashko produced his keys and unlocked an oaken door bound with bands of iron chavasse moved in and tashko flicked a switch and locked the door behind them they stood at the top of a flight of broad stone steps and beneath them in the dim light of a couple of electric bulbs was an amazing sight a great roman plunge bath perhaps a hundred feet long stretched into the gloom flanked by broken pillars and the stumps of what must have been at one time wellproportioned colonnades there was a strong sulphurous smell and steam drifted up from the water amazing what they got up to the romans tashko said of course the medieval fathers who built this monastery werent too keen on such pagan survivals they simply built over it they went down the steps and crossed a cracked tessellated floor the pool was about six feet deep the water very still and the face in the brightly colored mosaic that was its floor gazed blindly up at him out of two thousand years of chaos its fed by a natural spring tashko said one hundred twenty degrees fahrenheit quite pleasant they say its good for rheumatism as chavasse turned slowly the albanian slipped off his tunic and let it drop to the floor he held up the keys in one hand the mauser in the other then tossed them into the center of the pool with a quick gesture nothing to help you this time my friend so that was it quite simply a case of personal vanity on the part of a man so proud of his brute strength that he couldnt bear to be beaten by anyone chavasse stumbled back as if panicstricken if tashko thought him an easy mark he might still do something stupid the albanian moved forward arms at his sides and laughed harshly in the same moment he delivered a tremendous reverse punch the basic karate blow that takes the uninitiated unawares because it is delivered with the hand that is on the same side as the rear foot chavasse crossed his hands above his head to counter with the xblock the jujiuke and delivered a forward elbow strike in return that caught tashko full in the mouth the albanian staggered back blood spurting from his crushed lips and chavasse grinned a gyakuzuki and badly delivered is that the best you can do tashkos face was twisted by anger but he immediately dropped into the defensive position adopting the cat stance arms down inviting combat chavasse moved in his right forearm vertical the left protecting his body they circled warily and tashko made the first move he pushed the heel of his palm at his opponents face and as chavasse blocked it delivered a lightning punch to the stomach chavasse turned sideways riding most of the force and at the same moment fell to one side and delivered a roundhouse kick to the groin the albanian keeled over and chavasse throwing caution to the wind raised a knee into the descending face he realized immediately that he had made a bad mistake a blow that would have demolished any ordinary man only succeeded in shaking the albanians massive strength and great hands clawed across his body grabbing for his throat the lights seemed to be very far away and there was sudden roaring in his ears and through it he seemed to hear the professors monotonous singsong voice science science and intelligence will beat brute force he summoned every effort of willpower and spat full in that great stinking face and tashko recoiled in a reflex action that was as natural as breathing chavasse stabbed upwards with stiffened fingers at the exposed throat and tashko screamed and staggered back chavasse rolled over several times and came to his feet as the big man lurched toward him hands extended all science forgotten chavasse ducked in under the hands delivering a forefist punch knuckles extended and it sank into the muscles beneath tashkos rib cage he started to fall and chavasse raised his knee into the descending face throwing him back tashko swayed on the edge of the pool his face a mask of blood and chavasse jumped high in the air delivering a flying front kick the devastating maetobigeri into the albanians face knocking him back into the water chavasse followed him in twisting in midair going under awkwardly the warm water drawing him down his hands took the shock against a bearded mosaic face and he surfaced quickly tashko was about twenty feet away lurching toward the center of the pool where he had thrown the mauser and chavasse went after him he scrambled up onto the great back his hands sliding under the armpits locking together at the nape of the neck he started to press and tashko screamed all pity dying in him chavasse maintained that relentless pressure and the head sank down into the water the body bucked and heaved hands flailing the surface into a cauldron but chavasse strengthened his grip and hung on the end came with startling suddenness tashko simply went limp and when chavasse released his grip planed down through the water turning on his back when he reached bottom chavasse took a quick breath and went after the mauser the keys were perhaps ten feet away and he had to push tashko to one side to pick them up the albanians eyes stared into eternity blood drifting in brown strings from his smashed face and chavasse turned and swam for the side he sat on the edge for perhaps five minutes his chest heaving drawing air into his tortured lungs when he felt a little better he got to his feet and mounted the steps he had to try four keys before he found the right one as he opened the door he looked down for the last time at tashko who stared up at him just another figure in the mosaic now he switched off the lights closed the door and locked it the corridors were quiet and he met no one on his way back outside the storeroom the chair on which the sentry had been sleeping still lay on its side and he righted it before slipping the mauser into his pocket and fumbling with the keys as he worked through them guilio orsini appeared at the grille he glanced up and down the passage and an expression of bewilderment appeared on his face what happened to tashko he made a mistake chavasse said swinging the door open his last lets get going he turned along the passage remembering the way they had come a stone spiral staircase dropped to the first floor another to the basement all was quiet and he led the way along a narrow whitewashed corridor pausing to reconnoiter the entrance hall at the end there was no sentry but then why should there be the building was encircled by two thirtyfoot walls the main gates in each being strongly guarded they had explained earlier to orsini how they had gained access to the monastery and the big italian followed chavasse unhesitatingly the girl at his side they kept to the shadow of the wall skirting the square on the far side of the guardhouse where a light shone in the window and entered the cloisters through a gap in the ruined wall it was very dark and chavasse moved through the pillars cautiously and turned into the passage containing the cells he had to try three before he found one with the grille and it was orsini who pulled it out fingers fastening into the latticework like steel hooks ill go first chavasse said then liri you follow guilio and replace the grille as you come down he shot down the stone chute on his back forearms raised to protect his face and landed in the tunnel below with a splash liri followed so quickly that she cannoned into him as he was getting to his feet orsini joined them a moment later and they crouched in a little group it was so dark in the tunnel that they couldnt see each others faces and chavasse said quietly this isnt going to be any picnic whatever happens keep close together as long as we can make it to the main channel we cant go wrong because its bound to flow in the direction of the river anythings preferable to what weve just left orsini said lets get moving chavasse started along the tunnel bent double liri holding on to the tail of his oilskin jacket it was a strange claustrophobic sensation like nothing he had ever experienced before and yet he wasnt frightened the darkness was a friend cloaking their flight enfolding them in gentle hands and he was grateful a few moments later they emerged from the tunnel into the central cavern he stood thighdeep in the stinking water staring into the darkness father shedu counted eight openings to the left from where we came out paul liri said he nodded keep behind me both of you ive got an idea he took out the mauser pointed it at the water and fired in the single brilliant flash of light the tunnel openings stood out like dark wounds he fired again counting quickly then started across the pool his questing hand found the opening and he grunted fifty yards farther on the passage emptied itself into the main tunnel and he could hear the splash and gurgling of the water on its way down to the river already the stench seemed to be lessening and as he followed the wall chavasse breathed deeply to clear the heaviness that weighed upon his brain the landing stage loomed out of the darkness light flowing down from the candles burning at the icon in the niche at the head of the stairs liris punt was still tied to the bottom of the steps and chavasse sat on the edge of the landing stage and rubbed the back of one hand wearily across his eyes how much juice you got in that thing enough to get us to the coast i think so most of the way at least we still need a compass to get back to the buona esperanza orsini said at least if were going to go now in the dark we cant afford to wait till dawn chavasse said thats when kapo will send francesca in the dinghy if were going to beat them to it we must go now father shedu will have a compass liri said wait here ill go and get him she mounted the steps and the door closed behind her orsini slumped down beside chavasse what a girl most would have had hysterics by now shell have to come with us chavasse said she cant stay here what about an entry permit i know what its like for the stateless refugees dont worry about that i know the right people at the ministry in rome ill see she gets treated like royalty well even find her a job shes earned it maybe she wont need a job chavasse glanced at him curiously you make up your mind in a hurry dont you orsini shrugged you either know straightaway or its no good of course ive got twenty years on her i wouldnt let that worry you chavasse said she knows a man when she sees one he sat there his left arm aching like hell his strength slowly ebbing and after a while the door clicked open and father shedu came down the steps with liri so miracles can still happen he said as he moved forward my friend guilio orsini father chavasse said im glad you kept out of it back there they still havent got the slightest idea how we got inside the priest poured brandy into a couple of tin mugs and handed a small basket to liri not much im afraid bread and cheese and some dried meat the rich full life is long in coming for the peoples republic well eat it on the way chavasse said he drank some of the brandy and coughed as it burned its way down his throat liri has told me what happened in there the priest said it pains me to know this woman deceived you and shell go on playing the same game unless we can manage to stop her chavasse said liri thought you might have a compass the priest held one forward pressing a small spring so that the lid flew open chavasse examined it noting the inscription wd and the official broad arrow british army issue a souvenir from another life take it with my blessing he turned to liri and placed a hand on her shoulder and what happens to you liri she goes with us father orsini said gruffly ill look after her the priest gazed at him searchingly and then smiled god moves in his own strange ways now go all of you while there is still time they dropped into the boat and liri took the tiller the roaring of the engine seemed to fill the cavern when it broke into life and the boat turned away quickly as they moved through the dark entrance chavasse glanced back and saw the franciscan still standing there watching them a moment later they swung into the main current and turned downstream through the darkness fourteen the river was angry swollen by the rains flowing down from the mountains of the north and it rushed toward the sea with more than usual force the frail punt skipped water constantly and chavasse and orsini took turns at bailing with an old tin basin they ate the food the priest had provided and finished the bottle of brandy chavasse sat in the prow his collar turned up against the spray and longed for a cigarette he wondered what kapo would do probably tie up farther downriver till dawn then he would send francesca in with the dinghy and carlo would swallow every damned thing she said perhaps half an hour later the engine faltered and died abruptly as the punt started to drift broadside on in the strong current liri called there are paddles under the seat keep her head round chavasse fumbled in the darkness and found two crude paddles he leaned over the side and dug one deep into the water using all his strength and gradually the punt turned into the current orsini scrambled to the stern and after a struggle managed to get the engine housing off he started to try to trace the fault by touch alone and after a while his sensitive fingers encountered a broken lead to one of the plugs the wire was old and brittle and crumbled between his fingers but he eventually managed to link it together and tried the starter the engine turned over twice faltered then rumbled into life and chavasse rested on the thwart in relief as the punt surged forward any chance of that happening again he called softly i wouldnt be surprised this must be the one they used on the ark orsini stayed at the tiller nursing the engine along and liri moved into the center and started to bail it was still quite dark and visibility was almost nil only the surge of white water against the bank gave them any kind of bearing the bulk of a large island loomed out of the night and liri called urgently as orsini swung the tiller taking them away toward the center of the river as the current caught them there was a sudden challenge from the left and chavasse glanced over his shoulder and saw the motor boat anchored in the lee of the island a light in her wheelhouse he was aware of people moving along the deck of confused voices and then a powerful spot mounted on top of the wheelhouse was switched on the beam splaying out across the dark water it followed them relentlessly trapping them in its dazzling beam like flies in a web there was an incredulous cry of dismay and francescas voice sounded on the cold air like a bugle kapo kapo come quickly chavasse leaned over the side digging the paddle into the water feverishly as orsini gave the old motor everything it had they dipped into the millrace as the current flowed past the final curved point of the island and coasted into darkness again a few moments later the engine of the motor boat rumbled into life and liri scrambled back into the stern ill take over now she said theres a creek about a quarter of a mile below if we can reach that were safe its too narrow for the motor boat to enter theyll have to stay in the main channel orsini moved down beside chavasse picked up the other paddle and drove it into the water with all his great strength they were passing through a narrower section of the river now and the flood waters rushed with a mighty roar drowning the sound of the motor boats engine chavasse stabbed the crude paddle into the water again and again exerting everything of mind and will in a supreme effort pushing the tiredness the fatigue of the past twentyfour hours away from him they swung in close to the land as the river broadened and quite suddenly as the roaring of the flood waters subsided the engine of the motor boat sounded close behind he glanced over his shoulder saw the lighted wheelhouse the searchlight stabbing out toward them there was the harsh deadly staccato of a submachine gun and then the punt swerved into the lee of a small island and started to turn reeds swam out of the darkness and as the beam of the searchlight fell across them the opening of the creek sprang out of the night the punt surged toward it slowed as it slid across a submerged mud bank and then they were through the machine gun rattled again ineffectually as the reeds closed about them liri reduced speed and they coasted on brushing against the pale fronds gradually the sound of the river faded the engine of the motor boat had stopped for a while but now they heard it start again faintly in the distance and fade downstream orsini laughed shakily a close call chavasse took from his pocket the compass father shedu had given him and passed it to the italian youd better start using this we havent got time to hang about orsini moved in to the stern beside liri southsouthwest must be our general direction can we do it i think so i know this creek and where it goes well come to a large lagoon soon we change direction there but its possible you might have to get out and push in places when will it be light chavasse asked an hour perhaps a little longer it will be misty one can always tell were in your hands cara orsini told her they moved into a large lagoon as she had indicated and turned into a maze of twisting channels the outboard motor stopped several times as trailing weeds clogged the propeller and finally it died altogether orsini examined it for several minutes and shook his head thats all im afraid theres nothing i can do not under these conditions from then on they used the paddles and after a while the reeds became so thick that the two men had to go over the side wading through thick glutinous mud as they forced a way through for the punt always trying to keep to their general compass bearing the swampy water was treacherous and had a way of changing depth without warning once chavasse stepped into a deep hole and went in over his head he struggled back with a curse to a comparatively safe footing and scrambled back into the punt as they emerged into another waterway orsini laughed grimly now this i could do without it was bitterly cold and a damp mist curled from the water occasionally wildfowl fluttered protestingly from the reeds as they passed through calling angrily to each other warning those ahead of the intruders there was an appreciable lightening of the darkness and a faint luminosity drifted around them and then they could see the reeds and there was a honking of geese overhead lifting to meet the dawn orsini was pale and drawn the dark stubble of his beard accentuating his pallor he looked about twenty years older his hands shaking slightly in the extreme cold and chavasse didnt feel any better the girl looked healthier than either of them but on the other hand she hadnt spent the best part of an hour up to her waist in freezing water they coasted into a broad channel and orsini held up his hand we must be close now very close he stood up in the punt cupped his hands to his mouth and called at the top of his voice buona esperanza ahoy ahoy buona esperanza there was no reply and chavasse joined him carlo carlo arezzi their voices died away and in the gray light they looked helplessly at each other liri held up her hand i heard something at first chavasse thought it was the cry of a bird but then it sounded again unmistakably a human voice they paddled into the mist calling again and again and gradually the voice grew louder for the last time chavasse and orsini went over the side forcing the punt through a wall of reeds and then quite suddenly they were through and drifting into a familiar lagoon at the other end the buona esperanza seemed to swim out of the mist to meet them carlo arezzi poised on top of the wheelhouse fifteen it was warm in the cabin chavasse vigorously rubbed himself down and dressed quickly in a spare pair of denim working pants and a heavy sweater of carlos there was a knock on the door and liri kupi called are you dressed she came in carrying a mug of coffee and he took it gratefully it was scalding hot and the fragrance seemed to put new life into him best i ever tasted wheres guilio he went up to the wheelhouse said something about charting the course she opened the little box gave him one of her macedonian cigarettes and struck a match for him holding it in her cupped hands like a man chavasse blew out a cloud of smoke and looked at her shrewdly you like him dont you guilio who wouldnt hes got twenty years on you you know that she shrugged and said calmly you know what they say about good wine chavasse slipped an arm about her shoulders youre quite a girl liri id say he was a lucky man he swallowed the rest of his coffee handed her the jug and went up the companionway it started to rain as he went out on deck and the mist draped itself across everything in a gray shroud orsini and carlo were leaning over the charts when he went into the wheelhouse whats the score he said orsini shrugged i think we should try the main channel out its quicker and we could stand a good chance of getting away with it its yugoslavian territory on the other side and albanian boats dont like going in too close if we can get into the open nothing theyve got stands a chance of catching us i should have thought kapo would count on us doing just that he very probably has i say we go and find out chavasse shrugged thats all right by me but i think it might be an idea to break out a little hardware just in case you and carlo can handle that end ill get things moving up here chavasse and the young italian went below opened the box seat and unpacked the weapons there was still a submachine gun left a dozen grenades and the old bren they went back on deck and laid the weapons out on the floor of the wheelhouse under the chart table ready for action it was just after five am when the engines shuddered into life and orsini took the buona esperanza into the mist chavasse stood in the prow beside liri and rain kicked into his face and the wind blowing in from the sea lifted the mist into strange shapes the girl stared into the grayness eagerly lips parted a touch of color in each cheek are you glad to be going he said she shrugged briefly im leaving nothing behind as the light grew stronger the dark silver lances of the rain became visible stabbing down through the mist and somewhere a curlew called eerily once twice and he waited with bated breath trapped by a childhood memory once for joy two for sorrow three for a death there was no third call which left them with a little sorrow but that he could bear he turned and went back to the wheelhouse for half an hour they moved slowly along the broad channel crossing from one lagoon into the other changing direction only once visibility was down to twenty yards but the reeds were falling away now and the channel was widening the water began to kick against the hull in long swelling ripples and orsini grinned tightly the buene were about half a mile from the sea the launch crept forward the engines a low rumble that was almost drowned in the splashing of the heavy rain chavasse examined the chart the estuary was a mass of sandbanks and the main channel the one that they had used on the way in was no more than thirty yards if kapo was anywhere it would be there a few moments later orsini cut the engines and they drifted with the current he opened the side window and leaned out were almost there if theyre patroling well hear the engines chavasse went on deck and stood in the prow listening carlo and liri joined him at first there was nothing only the wind and the sizzle of rain then carlo held up a hand i think i hear something chavasse turned signaling orsini down and the italian swung the wheel taking the boat in to where a low hogs back of sand lifted from the sea they grounded with a slight shudder and chavasse ran back to the wheelhouse carlo thinks he heard something no sense in running into anything we can avoid well take a look on foot he stood on the rail and jumped landing in a couple of inches of water carlo tossed the submachine gun to him then followed and they moved into the mist along the sandbank it stretched for several hundred yards in some places water slopping across it so that they had to wade the noise of an engine was by now quite unmistakable at times it faded then a minute or two later grew louder again they must be patrolling the mouth of the channel chavasse said carlo pulled him down into the sand the motor boat floated out of the mist no more than twenty yards away they had a quick glimpse of a soldier crouching on the roof of the wheelhouse a machine pistol in his hands and then the mist swallowed it again they ran back along the sandbank and the sound of the motor boat faded behind them the mist seemed to be a little thicker and the water was rising flooding in across the dark spine of sand tugging at their boots and the buona esperanza loomed out of the gloom chavasse waded into the water and orsini reached down to give him a hand over the rail are they there chavasse nodded and explained briefly what they had seen what happens now they went back into the wheelhouse and orsini leaned over the chart we could return to the marshes there is a way through certainly but it would take many hours with a boat of this size and there is no guarantee by that time kapo could have called in the albanian navy such as it is they could give us trouble if we ran into them with no way round have we any choice orsini traced a finger across the chart theres a channel here it runs a mile to the southwest emerging at cat island see where i mean whats the snag it looks good to me as i said earlier the river isnt used much these days because of the border dispute and the channels such as they are have been allowed to silt up theres no knowing just how much water there is anymore probably shoaled up are you willing to try if the rest of you are there was really no question chavasse knew that as he glanced at liri and orsini pressed the starter and reversed off the sandbank the launch turned in a long sweeping curve and started back up the river orsini leaned out of the side window eyes narrowed into the mist and after a while he gave a quick grunt and swung the wheel taking them between low humped sandbanks he reduced speed to dead slow and the boat moved forward as cautiously as an old lady finding her way across a busy street waves slapped hollowly against the bottom a sure sign of shallow water and once or twice there was a slight protesting jar and a scraping as they grazed a shoulder of sand it was perhaps five minutes later that they ploughed to a halt orsini reversed quickly at first the launch refused to budge and then it parted the sand with an ugly sucking noise carlo vaulted over the side without a word to anyone the water rose to his chest and as he waded forward it dropped to waist level he changed direction to the left and a moment later it lifted to his armpits again he waved quickly and orsini swung the wheel taking the boat after him the young italian swam forward into the shoals sounding the bottom every few yards and behind him the buona esperanza carefully followed his circuitous trail and then a wave lifted out of the mist swamping him and he went under he surfaced and swam back to the launch and when chavasse pulled him in there was a wide grin on his face deep water i couldnt touch bottom were through orsini waved from the wheelhouse and gave the engines more power swinging the wheel to take them out of the estuary to sea fifty yards beyond the entrance the dark bulk of cat island lifted out of the mist and he turned to port as they rounded the point the current pushing against them engines roared into life and a gray naval patrol boat surged out of the rock inlet where she had been waiting as she swept across their bows a heavy machine gun started to fire bullets sweeping across the deck shattering glass in the wheelhouse chavasse had a quick glimpse of kapo at the rail still wearing his hunting jacket with the fur collar mouth open as he cried his men on carlo appeared in the doorway of the wheelhouse the submachine gun at his hip firing as he crossed the deck to the rail on the patrol boat someone screamed and kapo ducked out of sight already orsini was taking his engines to full power and from the forward deck of the patrol boat another machine gun started to fire tracer and cannon hammering into the hull of the buona esperanza great shudders rushing through her entire frame as she reeled at the impact and then they were through prow lifting over the waves as the patrol boat faded into the mist behind them chavasse picked himself up from the deck and gave a hand to liri there was blood on her face and she wiped it away quickly are you all right he said she nodded a flying splinter thats all carlo turned the submachine gun hugged to his breast for the first time since chavasse had known him there was a smile on his face i gave the bastards something to remember me by chavasse moved to the door of the wheelhouse the windows were shattered glass scattered across the floor but orsini seemed to be all in one piece i got down quick he called above the roar of the engine did you see kapo for a moment there i thought hed put one over on us we should have reckoned on the possibility of him having both exits watched i hope the swines head rolls for this as orsini grinned savagely the engines missed a couple of times faltered tried to pick up then stopped completely the buona esperanza ploughed forward her prow biting into a wave slowed and started to drift with the current sixteen when orsini got the hatch off the tiny engine room they could smell escaping fuel at once the italian slid down the short steel ladder and chavasse and orsini followed him carlo made a quick examination and turned it could be worse a section of the fuel intake pipe is damaged we were lucky the whole damned lot didnt blow skyhigh a jagged hole in the steel hull punched by a cannon shell was mute evidence of how the damage had been caused how are we off for spares orsini demanded no problem there but ill have to cut a section to the right size and braze it how long twenty minutes if you all get to hell out of here and leave me alone chavasse went up the ladder and joined liri on deck how bad is it she asked bad enough to make us sitting ducks for the next half hour orsini scrambled out of the engine room and nodded grimly if the swine doesnt get us now he doesnt deserve to wed better make ready paul he broke open a box of cartridges and carefully loaded the submachine guns onehundredround circular clip and chavasse checked the machine gun and the half dozen magazines that went with it liri scrambled on top of the wheelhouse and kept watch straining her eyes into the mist when he had finished loading the submachine gun orsini went below and came back with an old american service issue automatic he tossed it to the girl who caught it deftly best i can do but watch it it has the kick of an angry mule ive been using guns all my life she said pulling out the magazine and examining it expertly orsini grinned up at her i wonder what youd look like in a skirt and some decent stockings and shoes the thought has great appeal when we reach matano i must do something about it she laughed her face flushing and then the smile was wiped from her face listen i think i hear them the boat lifted on the swell waves slapping hollowly against her bows chavasse stood at the rail straining his ears and in the distance heard the sound of an engine come down from there he told the girl go into the wheelhouse and lie flat she did as she was told chavasse stood over her the barrel of the bren gun poking through one of the windows and orsini crouched beside the engine room hatch perhaps theyre going away liri whispered chavasse shook his head not on your life they must have heard our engines stop and they cut their own and listened to see what was happening kapo must know that there are only two possibilities either were being picked up by another boat or our engines have packed in the patrol boat came nearer and nearer obviously beating backwards and forwards through the mist it passed very close to them indeed its bowwave rippling across the water rocking the buona esperanza violently for a moment chavasse thought they had been missed and then the engine of the patrol boat lifted and it roared out of the mist it swept across their stern and the air was broken by the sound of violence the main trouble came from the heavy machine gun mounted in the stern of the patrol boat its crew couched behind a curved shield of armor plating in the prow several soldiers stood at the rail firing rifles and machine pistols and kapo lurked behind them a revolver in his hand chavasse started to fire swinging the barrel of the bren in an arc and a couple of soldiers stumbled backwards to the deck he saw francesca running head down and swung the bren desperately his bullets chipping the rail beside her head as his magazine ran out she disappeared into the wheelhouse he ducked reaching for another magazine and glass shattered above his head and the walls splintered rocking to the impact of tracer and cannon shell as the patrol boat swung away orsini jumped to his feet and fired a long burst at the crew of the machine gun in the stern there was a sharp cry as the boat disappeared into the mist one of them lurched to the rail and toppled into the sea the sound of the patrol boat faded and orsini shouted to liri keep down next time hes really going to mean business the patrol boat circled several times invisible in the heavy mist and chavasse waited impatiently when kapo at last made his move it was from a different quarter as the boat roared out of the mist behind him chavasse frantically swung the bren round firing from the hip the heavy machine gun in the stern of the patrol boat raked them with a murderous fire the buona esperanza reeling at the impact and chavasse ducked as he finished his last magazine and portions of the roof disintegrated above his head orsini was still firing the barrel of the submachine gun braced against the side of the wheelhouse as the patrol boat veered in a wide arc cutting across their bows again chavasse snatched a grenade from the box beside liri pulled the pin and ran out on deck for a brief moment the patrol boat was so close he could see the expressions on the soldiers faces and as it swept by he lobbed the grenade over the railing to her stern it started to roll one of the soldiers kicked out at it frantically and then it exploded when it cleared only the tangled wreckage of the machine gun was left the soldiers had vanished the patrol boat ran on into the mist and there was quiet liri got to her feet blood on her face and wiped it away with the back of her hand will they try again certain to theyll be a little more careful next time thats all orsini was leaning over the engine room hatch and he stood up and came toward them not so good at least another fifteen minutes they looked at each other without saying anything knowing what that meant and quite suddenly kapos voice boomed out of the mist why dont you give in chavasse you cant hope to get away liri gave a startled exclamation and orsini reassured her dont be alarmed hes using a loud hailer thats all i wonder what the swines playing at not interested chavasse called the engines of the patrol boat roared into life and it erupted from the mist the men at her rail raking the buona esperanza with small arms fire chavasse shoved liri down against the deck and orsini crouched beside them the submachine gun chattering angrily he stopped firing abruptly just as the patrol boat disappeared into the mist he checked the magazine then tossed the weapon into the wheelhouse what about the bren nothing left for that either orsini went and pulled the small box of grenades from under the chart table at least weve got these if they come close enough chavasse said kapos voice drifted out of the mist again its obvious that youre incapable of moving chavasse but ill be generous give yourself up without any further nonsense and ill let your friends go free i give you my word ill give you ten minutes to think it over after that well come and finish you off in the silence that followed orsini gave an audible grunt and disappeared down the salon companionway when he returned he carried the spare aqualung help me get into this thing quickly he said to liri and turned to chavasse youll find some more of that plastic explosive in the salon paul and some chemical detonators get them quickly what in hell do you think youre playing at chavasse began but orsini gave him an angry shove dont argue just do it the italian was buckled into the aqualung and pulling on his rubber flippers when chavasse came back on deck with the bandolier of explosive im going to have a go at fixing kapo once and for all orsini said as he fastened the bandolier around his waist chavasse shook his head you havent got enough time left orsini grinned thats what they told me in fortyone when i took a team into alex but we got in and out and left two british destroyers squatting on their backsides in the mud i know what im doing he pulled his mask down turned from liris white face and vaulted over the rail he had only a rough idea of the direction of the patrol boat but he knew it couldnt be far away he swam very fast kicking strongly with his webbed feet and within a couple of minutes had penetrated the mist he surfaced gently and looked about him there was no sign of the patrol boat but kapos voice boomed over him and he saw a dark outline in the mist five minutes chavasse thats all orsini went under swam forward and the keep of the patrol boat loomed out of the water he worked his way along to the stern opened the pouches of his bandolier and squeezed handfuls of the plastic explosive between the propeller and the hull he was fast running out of time and he pushed home the detonator snapped the end and turned away he drove forward drawing upon his final reserves of strength feet churning the water into a cauldron and then the hull of the buona esperanza seemed to be moving toward him and he surfaced chavasse leaned over the rail carlo beside him and they hauled him up onto the deck somewhere through the roaring in his ears the engine of the patrol boat rumbled into life when the explosion came it echoed through the rain and the screams of the dying mingled with it for a long time debris continued to fall into the water and then there was silence holy mother carlo said in awe she must have gone down like a stone orsini slowly unbuckled the straps of his aqualung how are things below all finished carlo said we can move out whenever youre ready liri was kneeling beside orsini her cigarette tin open chavasse dropped beside them took one and bent his head to the match as it flared in her hands orsini looked at him curiously youre sorry about the girl anything she got she asked for chavasse turned and stood at the rail aware of the tightness in his throat that couldnt be logically explained remembering a gay and lovely girl he had met a thousand years ago at an embassy party in rome his head was aching and he was tired damned tired and she was calling his name over and over again he closed his eyes briefly when he opened them again she came swimming out of the mist she had never looked lovelier dark hair spreading around her in the water eyes large in the white face as she drifted in she looked up at him appealingly help me paul help me he looked down at her remembering matt sorley dumont and all the others good friends who had gone to a hard death because of her orsini said for gods sake paul are we animals chavasse turned and looked at him and the italian shrugged if you wont help her i will he started forward and chavasse shook his head my affair guilio he reached down and pulled francesca aboard and she sprawled on the deck coughing and gasping for breath thank you paul youll never regret it i promise you as she got to her feet her hand swung up and he was aware of the blade shining in the harsh morning light he tried to turn but he was too late and it caught him in the left side slicing through flesh bouncing from the rib cage he staggered back recoiling as much from the cold hatred in her eyes as from the force of the blow and orsini cried out in dismay chavasse was aware of the knife raised high gleaming in a ray of earlymorning sunlight which at that moment pierced the mist and then liris voice was lifted in a savage cry she moved forward the heavy automatic orsini had given her in both hands and one heavy slug after another hammered francesca back over the rail into the water chavasse was aware of orsini kneeling beside him of liri throwing the gun far out to sea he took a deep breath fighting against the pain im all right guilio im fine just lets get to hell out of here orsini called to carlo in the wheelhouse and a moment later the engines started and the buona esperanza moved forward slowly they passed through a great widening circle of wreckage from the patrol boat and liri standing at the rail called out sharply and pointed to the water chavasse shook his head holding his bunched shirt tightly against his side to stem the flow of blood and tried to hear what was being said there was a roaring in his ears and gray cobwebs seemed to be drifting slowly across his field of vision he was aware that the engines had stopped that carlo had joined liri and then orsini went over the rail chavasse leaned over suddenly faint fighting hard against the pain when he straightened carlo was lifting the statue of our lady of scutari over the side orsini brought it across and laid it reverently on the deck in front of chavasse look paul floating in the wreckage without a mark on her a miracle carlo went back into the wheelhouse and started the engines and chavasse sat there looking at the statue he was crying which was a strange thing and couldnt be explained and yet somehow the dark serene face smiling up at him seemed to ease his pain above his head a gull cried sharply skimmed low over the sea and sped away through the misty rain like a departing spirit manhattan seventeen in the sitting room at the trump tower apartment chavasse finished reading the file closed it and sat back vinelli said another drink sir paul why not chavasse said champagne will be fine vinelli went to the bar opened a fresh bottle chavasse took the glass he offered and savored it lets have him in aldo as you say it was quiet only that damned rain drumming on the windows and then the door opened and vinelli came in ahead of volpe chavasse said a hell of a story i mean it was really heavy stuff for you to get hold of it like i said those clerks at the public records office arent the best paid people in the world so all you had to do was check up on paul chavasse and the bureau and it was all there well you were a star performer what can i say id sound modest what you did it was better than james bond oh i dont know just another job for the bureau thats what it was all about the name of the game you may think that but im truly impressed chavasse said what now we go to see don tino at the saddle room at the plaza hotel actually things have changed the don would like to see you on the family yacht its moored off pier ten at the waterfront in brooklyn full crew great chef don rossi is concerned with confidentiality here chavasse picked up his rain hat slanted it across his head and reached for his burberry so lets get on with it aldo got to the burberry and held it for him chavasse said why thank you aldo vinelli appeared to hesitate and chavasse smiled im really looking forward to this i love boats aldo aldo drove chavasse and volpe sat together in the back of the mercedes the rain washed the streets clean of people as they moved toward brooklyn chavasse took out the silver case selected a cigarette and lit it he blew out the smoke yes fascinating that file of course bureau files are on a fiftyyear hold so it would be impossible for anyone to take a look an offense under the official secrets act amazing what money can do people are so corrupt oh i agree totally but in this case theres one thing wrong and what would that be bureau case study field agent doctor paul chavasse you said i probably wrote it myself actually i did and theres only one problem which is its been expanded for instance the mention of the death of enrico noci you remember that sure drowned in a fishing net by you and your friends no to be correct executed murdered there was a sudden violence in volpes voice a point of view he was what youd call a bad guy his actions responsible for the deaths of friends of mine having said that the manner of his death wasnt the kind of thing to put in an official report so under the chiefs instructions i left it out he took out his case and selected another cigarette so how did you find out from my aunt volpe was shaking a little and that would be signora volpe if i recall your background don tinos niece greatniece by marriage you italians take family so seriously so what was enrico noci to you my father the father you murdered something i learned at my aunts knee i see chavasses voice was gentler no you still dont would you like to know who my mother was chavasse waited for the axe to fall i believe i know francesca minetti who as i point out in my report gutted me with a rather large knife never mind that your friend liri kupi shot her to pieces you admit that so all my life i dreamt of revenge but these things take time one step after another your friend orsini married liri kupi do you remember what happened to them three years ago chavasse went cold they were killed in a car accident outside rome exactly faulty brakes was the conclusion of the police chavasse managed to stay very calm so now its my turn precisely and what will the don say thats not important his time is long past he took a walther ppk from his pocket rammed it into chavasses side and searched him quickly no weapon thats interesting i thought i was amongst friends so did the don the biggest mistake of your life volpe said as the mercedes moved along the waterfront the pier was deserted in the rain the large motor yacht moored at the far end a few deck lights on dont worry volpe said no crew on board tonight usually theres a watchman but i gave him the night off too just you me and aldo vinelli pulled in by the gangway slid from behind the wheel and opened the rear door chavasse got out does this suit you too aldo vinelli said heh conversation i dont need just get moving volpe led the way chavasse behind him and vinelli followed gun in hand they passed along the deck and came out in the stern which was illuminated by dim lights there was a half canopy rain thudding against it the railing of the upper deck above volpe turned at the stern rail put the walther in his pocket took out a pack of marlboros and lit one over here aldo vinelli moved toward him holding a browning against his right thigh chavasse said so this is it he removed his rain hat and ran his left hand over his face his right clutching the butt of the colt in its clip you know what they say in sicily is true tonight paul chavasse will sleep with the fishes just like my mother and father you bastard a soft voice said why mario whats all this don tino rossi moved out of the shadows of the port deck and confronted him his face shadowed by a broadbrimmed hat malacca cane in one hand a raincoat draped over his shoulders volpe registered cold shock started to stammer uncle i never expected to see you here isnt that how it goes rossi shook his head foolish boy ive known all about your plans every conversation with aldo here in my home youre even wired for sound in the bathroom on camera everything i treated you like a father and how do you repay me by killing sir paul who is important to all my plans he murdered my parents volpe said desperately ive known about that for years so it was all right for them to kill others but not to be killed themselves a point of view but there is the matter of your intention to kill me we cant have that can we aldo volpe cried vinellis hand swept up clutching the browning and chavasse fired through the rain hat and shot him between the eyes vinelli dropped the weapon bounced against the rail and fell on his face damn you to hell volpe cried pulling the walther from his pocket there was the muted crack of a silenced ak assault rifle from the rail above the first shot spinning him round the second shattering his spine there was a step on the companionway and two men came down in reefer coats and knitted caps both holding aks chavasse said you left it a little late oh i had every confidence in you my friend and as i now know you like a brother even your trick with the colt in the rain hat was familiar to me rossi shrugged if you hadnt got aldo my man would have so what happens now my boys will dump them out there victims of another mafia feud he smiled bleakly does it give you a problem or can we still deal on london and eastern europe i dont see why not good then be on your way if you look over the rail you will notice a lincoln has pulled in behind the mercedes your bags have been packed and you are booked out of the plaza to where my chauffeur will take you to westhampton airport on long island where i keep a private gulfstream that will have you on your way to london before you know it goodbye my friend this never happened oh yes it did chavasse said turned and walked away as the gulfstream climbed out over the atlantic chavasse sat in solitary splendor and asked the steward for a large irish whisky which he drank quickly he thought of enrico noci francesca guilio orsini and mario volpe asleep with the fishes a long time ago most of it a hell of a long time ago but was anything ever finished truly finished he closed his eyes and leaned back jack higgins jack higgins was a soldier and then a teacher before becoming a fulltime writer the eagle has landed turned him into an international bestselling author and his novels have since sold over million copies and been translated into fiftyfive languages many of them have also been made into successful films
