iain m banks the algebraist prologue i have a story to tell you it has many beginnings and perhaps one ending perhaps not beginnings and endings are contingent things anyway inventions devices where does any story really begin there is always context always an encompassingly greater epic always something before the described events unless we are to start every story with bang expand sssss then itemise the whole subsequent history of the universe before settling down at last to the particular tale in question similarly no ending is final unless it is the end of all things nevertheless i have a story to tell you my own direct part in it was vanishingly small and i have not thought even to introduce myself with anything as presumptuous as a proper name nevertheless i was there at the very beginning of one of those beginnings from the air i am told the autumn house looks like a giant grey and pink snowflake lying halfembedded within these folded green slopes it lies on the long shallow escarpment which forms the southern limit of the northern tropical uplands on the northern side of the house are spread the various formal and rustic gardens which it is both my duty and my pleasure to tend a little further up the escarpment rest the extensive ruins of a fallen temple believed to have been a construction of a species called the rehlide ar either severely abated or extinct depending on which authority one chooses to give credence to in any event long gone from these parts the temples great white columns once towered a hundred metres or so into our thin airs but now lie sprawled upon and interred within the ground vast straked and fluted tubes of solid stone half buried in the peaty soils of the unimproved land around us the furthestfallen ends of the columns which must have toppled slowly but most impressively in our halfstandard gravity punched great long craterlike ditches out of the earth creating long double embankments with bulbously rounded tips over the many millennia since their sudden creation these tall ramparts have been slowly worn down both by erosion and our worlds many small groundquakes so that the earth has slumped back to refill the wide ditches where the column ends lie until all that is visible is a succession of gentle waves in the lands surface like a series of small splayed valleys from whose upper limits the unburied lengths of the columns appear like the pale exposed bones of this little planetmoon where one column fell and rolled across a shallow river valley it formed a sort of angled cylindrical dam over which the water spills is caught and channelled by one of the metresdeep grooves embellishing the columns length and then flows down to what remains of the columns ornately carved capital and a series of small graceful waterfalls which end in a deep pool just beyond the tall dense hedges which mark the highest limit of our gardens from here the stream is guided and controlled some of its waters proceeding to a deep cistern which provides the headwaters for our gravity fountains down near the house while the rest make up the brook which by turns tumbles rushes swings and meanders down to the ornamental lakes and partial moat surrounding the house itself i was standing waistdeep in the gurgling waters of a steeply pitched part of the brook three limbs braced against the current surrounded by dripping exerrhododendron branches and coils of weed trimming and deadheading a particularly recalcitrant confusion of moilbush around a frankly rather threadbare raised lawn of scalpygrass basically a noble but failed experiment attempting to persuade this notoriously clumpy variety to ah my enthusiasms may be getting the better of me and i digress never mind about the scalpygrass when the young master returning whistling hands clasped behind his back from his morning constitutional round the higher rockeries stopped on the gravel path above me and smiled down i looked round and up still clipping away and nodded with as much formality as my somewhat awkward stance would allow sunlight poured from the purple sky visible between the curve of eastward horizon hills haze and the enormous overhanging bulk of the gasgiant planet nasqueron filling the majority of the sky motley with all the colours of the spectrum below bright yellow multitudinously spotted ubiquitously zoned and belted with wild liquidic squiggles a synchronous mirror almost directly above us scribed a single sharp line of yellowwhite across the largest of nasquerons stormspots which moved ponderously across the sky like an orangebrown bruise the size of a thousand moons good morning head gardener good morning seer taak and how are our gardens generally healthy i would say in good shape for spring i could have gone on to provide much more detail naturally but waited to discover whether seer taak was merely indulging in phatic discourse he nodded at the water rushing and breaking around my lower limbs you all right in there hg looks a bit fierce i am well braced and anchored thank you seer taak i hesitated and during the pause could hear someone small and light running up the stone steps towards the gravel path a little further down the garden then when seer taak still smiled encouragingly down at me i added the flow is high because the lower pumps are on recirculating the waters to enable us to scour one of the lakes free of floating weeds the small person approaching reached the paths loose surface twenty metres away and kept running scattering gravel i see didnt think it had rained that much recently he nodded well keep up the good work hg he said and turned to go then saw whoever was running towards him i suspected from the rhythm of her running steps that it was the girl zab zab is still at the age where she runs from place to place as a matter of course unless directed not to by an adult however i believed that i detected a more than casual urgency in her gait seer taak smiled and frowned at the girl at the same time as she came skidding to a stop on the gravel in front of him putting one hand flat to the chest of her yellow dungarees and bending over for a couple of deep exaggerated breaths long pink curls swirling and dancing round her face before taking one even deeper breath and standing up straight to say uncle fassin grandpa slovius says youre out in a communicardo again and if i see you ive to tell you youve to come and see him right now immediately does he now seer taak said laughing he bent and picked the girl up by her armpits holding her face level with his her little pink boots hanging level with the waist of his britches yes he does she told him and sniffed she looked down and saw me oh hello hg good morning zab well said seer taak hoisting the child further up and turning and lowering her so that she sat on his shoulders wed better go and see what the old man wants hadnt we he started down the path towards the house you okay up there she put her hands over his forehead and said yup well this time mind out for branches you mind out for branches zab said rubbing her knuckles through seer taaks brown curls she twisted round and waved back at me bye hg goodbye i called as they went towards the steps no you mind out for branches young lady no you mind out for branches no you mind out for branches no you mind out for branches one the autumn house it had thought it would be safe out here just one more ambiently black speck deepchilled in the vast veil of icy debris wrapping the outer reaches of the system like a frozen tenuous shroud of tissue but it had been wrong and it was not safe it lay slowtumbling and watched helplessly as the probing beams flickered across the pitted barren motes far away and knew its fate was settled the interrogating tendrils of coherence were almost too quick to sense too seemingly tentative to register barely touching scarcely illuminating but they did their job by finding nothing where there was nothing to find just carbon trace and icewater hard as iron ancient dead and left undisturbed no threat to anyone the lasers flicked off and each time it felt hope rise finding itself thinking despite all rationality that its pursuers would give up admit defeat just go away and leave it be to orbit there for ever or perhaps it would kick away into a lonely eternity of less than lightslow exile or drift into a closedown sleep or or it might it supposed and this was what they feared of course this was why they hunted plot and plan and gather and make and quicken and build and multiply and muster and attack claiming the vengeance that was so surely its exacting the price its enemies all deserved to pay by any algebra of justice under any sun you cared to name for their intolerance their savagery their generacide then the needle rays reappeared fitfully irradiating the sooticeclinker of another set of barnacleblack detritus a little further away or a little closer but always with a rapid meticulous order to them a militaristic precision and a plodding bureaucratic systematicism from the earlier light trails there were at least three ships how many did they have how many might they devote to the search it didnt really matter they might take a moment a month or a millennium to find their quarry but they obviously knew where to look and they would not stop until they had either found what they were looking for or satisfied themselves that there was nothing there that it was so obviously in harms way and that its hiding place however enormous was almost the first place they had chosen to search filled it with terror not just because it did not want to die or be picked apart as they had been known to pick its kind apart before killing their victims utterly but because if it was not safe in this place where it had assumed it would be then given that so many of its kind had made the same assumption none of them would be safe either dear reason maybe none of us are safe anywhere all its studies all its thoughts all the great things that might have been all the fruits of change from the one great revelation it might have had and now would never know the truth of would never be able to tell all all for nothing now it could choose to go with some elegance or not but it could not choose not to go no unchoosing death the needle rays from the needle ships flicked onflicked off away across the frozen distances and finally it could see the pattern in them discerning one ships comb of scintillations from the others and so picking out the shape of the search grids allowing it to watch helpless as the slow spread of that mortal inquiry crept slowly slowly closer the archimandrite luseferous warrior priest of the starveling cult of leseum iv and effective ruler of one hundred and seventeen stellar systems fortyplus inhabited planets numerous significant artificial immobile habitats and many hundreds of thousands of civilian capital ships who was executive high admiral of the shroud wing squadron of the fourhundredandsixtyeighth ambient fleet det and who had once been triumvirate rotational humannonhuman representative for cluster epiphany five at the supreme galactic assembly in the days before the latest ongoing chaos and the last fading rumbles of the disconnect cascade had some years ago caused the head of his oncegreatest enemy the rebel chief stinausin to be struck from his shoulders attached without delay to a longterm lifesupport mechanism and then hung upside down from the ceiling of his hugely impressive study in the outer wall of sheer citadel with its view over junch city and faraby bay towards the hazy vertical slot that was force gap so that the archimandrite could when the mood took him which was fairly frequently use his old adversarys head as a punchball luseferous had long sheenblack straight hair and a naturally pale complexion which had been skilfully augmented to make his skin nearly pure white his eyes were artificially large but just close enough to congenitally possible for people to be unsure whether they had been augmented or not the whites beyond the black irises were a deep livid red and every one of his teeth had been carefully replaced with a pure clear diamond giving his mouth an appearance which varied from bizarre mediaeval toothlessness to startling glistening brilliance entirely depending on angle and light in a street performer or an actor such physiological departures might have been amusing even a little desperatelooking in somebody wielding the kind of power which luseferous possessed they could be genuinely disturbing even terrifying the same halftasteless halfhorrifying effect might be claimed for his name which was not the one he had been born with luseferous was a chosen name selected for its phonetic proximity to that of some longscorned earth deity which most humans well most rhumans at least would vaguely have heard of in their history studies while probably not being entirely able to place when they had heard the word again thanks to genetic manipulation the archimandrite was now and had been for some long time a tall wellbuilt man with considerable upperbody strength and when he punched in anger and he rarely punched in any other state it was to considerable effect the rebel leader whose head now hung upside down from luseferouss ceiling had caused the archimandrite enormous military and political difficulties before being defeated difficulties which had sometimes verged on being humiliations and luseferous still felt deep deep resentment towards the traitor resentment which easily and reliably turned itself to anger when he looked upon the mans face no matter how battered bruised and bloody it might be the heads augmented healing functions were quick but not instantaneous and so the archimandrite probably still whacked and smashed away at stinausins head with as much enthusiasm now as he had when hed first had him hung there years earlier stinausin who had barely endured a month of such treatment before going completely mad and whose mouth had been sewn up to stop him spitting at the archimandrite could not even kill himself sensors tubes micropumps and biocircuitry prevented such an easy way out even without such extraneous limitations he could not have shouted abuse at luseferous or attempted to swallow his tongue because that organ had been torn out when his head had been removed though by now quite perfectly insane sometimes after an especially intense training session with the archimandrite when the blood trickled down from the onetime rebel chiefs split lips rebroken nose and puffedup eyes and ears stinausin would cry this luseferous found particularly gratifying and sometimes he would stand breathing hard and wiping himself down with a towel while he watched the tears dilute the blood dripping from the inverted disembodied head to land in a broad ceramic shower tray set into the floor of late though the archimandrite had had a new playmate to amuse himself with and he would occasionally visit the chamber some levels below his study where the nameless wouldbe assassin whose own teeth were slowly killing him was held the assassin a big powerfullooking leoninely human male had been sent without weapons save for his specially sharpened teeth with which it had obviously been hoped by whoever had sent him he could bite out the archimandrites throat this he had attempted to do a halfyear earlier at a ceremonial dinner held here in the clifftop palace in honour of the system president a strictly honorary post luseferous always made sure was filled by somebody of advanced age and retreating faculties the wouldbe assassin had only failed to accomplish this task thanks to the archimandrites nearparanoid forethought and intense and largely secret personal security the failed assassin had been both routinely if savagely tortured and then very carefully questioned under the influences of entire suites of drugs and electrobiological agents but had given nothing useful away patently he had been equally carefully wiped of any knowledge that might incriminate whoever had sent him by interrogational technicians at least as capable as those whom the archimandrite commanded his controllers had not even bothered to implant false memories incriminating anybody close to the court and the archimandrite as was common in such cases luseferous who was that most deplorable of beings a psychopathic sadist with a fertile imagination had decreed that the final punishment of the assassin should be that his own teeth the weapons he had been sent with after all should bring about his death accordingly his four canine teeth had been removed bioengineered to become tusks which would grow without ceasing and reinserted these great fingerthick fangs had erupted out of the bones of his upper and lower jaw punc turing the flesh of his lips and had continued their remorseless growth the lower set curved up and over his head and after a few months worth of extension came to touch his scalp near the top of his head while the upper set grew in a scimitarlike paired sweep beneath his neck taking about the same time to meet the skin near the base of his throat genetically altered not to stop growing even when they encountered such resistance both sets of teeth then started to enter the assassins body one pair slowly forcing themselves through the bony plates of the mans skull the other set entering rather more easily into the soft tissues of the lower neck the tusks digging into the assassins neck caused great pain but were not immediately lifethreatening left to themselves they would reappear from the rear of his neck in due course the fangs burrowing through his skull and into his brain were the ones which would shortly and agonisingly kill him perhaps in as little as another month or so the unfortunate nameless assassin had been unable to do anything to prevent this because he was pinned helpless and immobile against the wall of the chamber with bands and shackles of thick stainless iron his nutrition and bodily functions catered for by various tubes and implants his mouth had also been sewn up like that of stinausin for the first few months of his captivity the assassins eyes had followed luseferous around the chamber with a fierce accusatory look that the archimandrite eventually grew to find annoying and so hed had the mans eyes stitched shut too the fellows ears and mind still worked however luseferous had been assured and sometimes it amused him to come down and see for himself the progress that the teeth were making into the creatures body on such occasions having what one might term a captive yet necessarily discreet audience he sometimes liked to talk to the failed assassin good day luseferous said pleasantly as the lift door rumbled shut behind him the chamber deep below the study was what the archimandrite thought of as his den here as well as the nameless assassin he kept assorted souvenirs of old campaigns booty from his many victories items of high art looted from a dozen different stellar systems a collection of weapons both ceremonial and highpower various caged or tanked creatures and the mounted profoundly dead heads of all those major enemies and adversaries whose end had not been so complete as to reduce their mortal remains to radiation dust slime or unidentifiable strips of flesh and shards of bone or the alien equivalents thereof luseferous crossed to a deep dry tank partset into the floor and looked in at the recondite splicer lying coiled and still on its floor he slipped a thick elbow glove onto his arm reached into a large pot standing on the broad waisthigh parapet of the tank and dropped a handful of fat black trunkleeches into the tank and how are you are you keeping well hmm he asked an observer would have been unsure whether the archimandrite was talking to the human male pinned to the wall the recondite splicer now no longer still but raising its blind glistening brown head sniffing the air while its long segmented body twitched with anticipation or indeed the trunkleeches thudding one by one onto the mossy floor of the tank and immediately flexing their way with a sort of sinewave motion across the surface towards the nearest corner as far away from the recondite splicer as it was possible to get the brown mass of the splicer began to shuffle massively towards them and they started trying to climb the sheer glass sides of the tank climbing over each other and slipping back down as soon as they tried to haul themselves up luseferous peeled the elbow glove off and looked round the vaulted subtly lit space the chamber was a comfortable quiet sort of place set well within the cliff with no windows or light shafts and he felt safe and relaxed here he looked over at the long tawny shape that was the suspended body of the assassin and said nowheres quite as nice as home eh is it the archimandrite even smiled though there was nobody to smile at there was a rasping noise and a heavy thump from inside the tank followed by some almost inaudibly high keening sounds luseferous turned to watch the recondite splicer tear the giant leeches apart and eat them violently shaking its great patchily brown head and tossing some bits of slimy black flesh all the way out of the tank once it had thrown a stillalive leech up and out of the tank and nearly hit the archimandrite with it luseferous had chased the injured leech round the chamber with a shearsword cleaving deep slivers out of the dark red granite floor as he hacked and sliced at the creature when the show in the tank was over the archimandrite turned back to the assassin he put the elbow glove back on picked another trunkleech from the pot and strolled over to the man attached to the wall do you remember home sir assassin he asked as he approached is there any memory of it in your head at all hmm home mother friends he stopped in front of the man any of that stuff at all he waved the leechs moist seeking snout in front of the assassins face as he spoke they sensed each other the cold writhing creature in the archimandrites hand stretching out to try to fasten itself to the mans face the man sucking breath through his nostrils and turning his head as far as it would go seeming to try and shrink back into the wall behind this would not be the first time the assassin had been introduced to a trunkleech the tusks digging into his chest prevented him from moving his head very far luseferous followed the movements of the mans head with the leech keeping it in front of his lightly furred leonine face letting him smell the straining quivering mass or did they rip out all those memories when they cleaned you before they sent you to try to kill me huh are they all gone eh he let the very tip of the trunkleechs mouth parts just touch the fellows nose causing the failed assassin to wince and jerk and make a small terrified whimpering noise what eh do you remember home eh sport a pleasant place to be a place you felt safe and secure and with people you trusted and who maybe even loved you what do you say eh eh come on the man tried to turn his head still further straining the puckered skin around the puncture points on his chest one of which started to bleed the giant leech trembled in luseferouss hand stretching its mucustipped mouth parts still further as it tried to find purchase on the human males flesh then before the leech could properly attach itself to the fellow the archimandrite pulled it back and let it hang from his halfoutstretched arm where it swung and twisted muscularly with what felt for all the world like genuine frustration this is my home sir assassin luseferous told the man this is my place my refuge this which you invaded despoiled dishonoured with your your plot your attempt his voice quaked as he said i invited you into my house invited you to my table as as hosts have guests for ten thousand human years and you all you wanted to do was hurt me kill me here in my home where i should feel safer than anywhere the archimandrite shook his head in sorrow at such ingratitude the failed assassin had nothing but a dirty rag to cover his nakedness luseferous pulled it away and the fellow flinched again luseferous stared they did make a bit of a mess of you didnt they he watched the failed assassins thighs quiver and twitch he let the loincloth fall to the ground a servant would replace it tomorrow i like my home he told the fellow quietly i do really everything ive had to do ive done just to make things safer to make home safer to make everybody safer he waved the trunkleech towards what was left of the mans genitalia but the leech seemed listless and the man already exhausted even the archimandrite felt like some of the fun had gone out of the situation he turned smartly and strode to the pot on the broad rail over the tank dumping the leech inside and peeling the thick elbow glove off and now i have to leave home mister assassin luseferous said and sighed he gazed down at the long coiled shape of the onceagainstill recondite splicer it had changed colour from brown to yellowgreen now adopting the colours of the mosses it lay upon all that was left of the trunkleeches were some dark spots and smears on the walls and a faint tangy smell the archimandrite had come to recognise as that of yet another speciess blood he turned back to look at the assassin yes i have to go away and for a very long time and it would seem i have no choice he started to walk slowly towards the man because you cant delegate everything because ultimately especially when it comes to the most important things you cant really trust anybody else because sometimes especially when youre going far away and communications take so long theres no substitute for being there what do you think of that eh theres a fine thing dont you think me working all these years to make this place safe and now i have to leave it still trying to make it even safer even more powerful even better he stepped up to the man again tapping one of the curved fangs boring through the fellows skull and all because of people like you who hate me who wont listen who wont do as theyre told who dont know whats good for them he gripped the fang and pulled hard at it the man mewed down his nose with pain well not really luseferous said shrugging letting go its debatable whether this will really make us safer or not im going to this this ulubis system or whatever it is because there might be something valuable there because my advisers advise so and my intelligence people have intelligence to this effect of course nobodys certain nobody ever is but they do seem uncommonly excited about this the archimandrite sighed again more deeply and impressionable old me im going to do as they suggest do you think im doing the right thing he paused as though expecting an answer do you i mean i realise you might not be entirely honest with me if you did have an opinion but all the same no you sure he traced the line of a scar along the side of the mans abdomen wondering idly if it was one of those that his own inquisitors had inflicted looked a bit crude and deep to be their work the failed assassin was breathing quickly and shallowly but giving no sign that he was even listening behind his sealed mouth his jaws seemed to be working you see for once im not absolutely sure myself and i could use some advice might not make us all safer at all what were planning to do but it has to be done the way some things just have to eh he slapped the mans face not hard the man flinched all the same dont worry though you can come too big invasion fleet plenty of room he looked around the chamber anyway i feel you spend too much time stuck in here you could do with getting out more the archimandrite luseferous smiled though still there was nobody to smile at after all this trouble id hate to miss watching you die yes you come with me why dont you to ulubis to nasqueron eh oh yes uncle slovius raised a flipperlike hand and waved it vaguely please do thank you fassin taak hitched up his walking britches gathered in his wide shirt sleeves and folded himself decorously into a sitting position at the side of the large circular pool of gently steaming and luminously blue liquid that his uncle floated within uncle slovius had some years ago assumed the shape of a walrus a beigepink relatively slim walrus with tusks barely longer than the middle finger of a mans hand but a walrus nevertheless the hands uncle slovius had once possessed were no more they were flippers now on the end of two thin rather odd and ineffectuallooking arms his fingers were little more than stubs a scalloped pattern fringing the ends of his flippers he opened his mouth to speak but then one of the household servants a blackuniformed human male approached him kneeling at the side of the pool to whisper something into his ear the servant held his long pigtail out of the water with one manyringed hand the dark clothes long hair and rings all indicated that he was one of the most senior functionaries fassin felt he ought to know his name but couldnt think of it immediately he looked round the room the chamber of provisional forgetting was one of the rarely used parts of the house only called into action if you could call it that on such occasions when a senior family member was approaching their end the pool took up most of the floor space of a large roughly hemispherical room whose walls were translucently thin agate inlaid with veins of timedulled silver this dome formed part of one bubblewing of the familys autumn house situated on the continent twelve on the rocky planetmoon glantine which orbited the gaudy swirlingly clouded mass of the gasgiant nasqueron like a pepper grain around a football a tiny portion of the massive planets surface was visible through the transparent centre section of the domes roof directly above fassin and his uncle the part of nasqueron that fassin could see was presently in daylight displaying a chaotic cloudscape coloured crimson orange and rustbrown the summed shades producing a deep red light which fell through the violet skies of glantines thinly breathable atmosphere and the domes glazed summit and helped illuminate the chamber and the pool below where the blackclad servant was supporting uncle slovius while he supped on a beaker of what might have been either refreshment or medicine some dribbles of the clear liquid escaped uncle sloviuss mouth trickling down his grizzled chin to the folds of his neck and dripping into the blue pool where tall waves slopped to and fro in the halfstandard gravity uncle slovius made quiet grunting noises his eyes closed fassin looked away another servant approached him offering a tray of drinks and sweetmeats but he smiled and raised one hand in a gesture of rejection and the servant bowed and retreated fassin fixed his gaze politely on the domes roof and the view of the gasgiant while watching from the corner of his eye as the servant attending his uncle dabbed at the old mans lips with a neatly folded cloth magisterial oblivious moving almost imperceptibly with a kind of tumultuous serenity nasqueron turned above them like some vast glowing coal hanging in the sky the gasgiant was the largest planet in the ulubis system which lay within a remote strand of stream quaternary one of the southern tendril reefs on the galactic outskirts fiftyfive thousand years from the galaxys nominal centre and about as remote as it was possible to get while still being part of the great lens there were especially in the current postwar age different levels of remoteness and ulubis system qualified as backofbeyond in all of them being on the outermost reaches of the galaxy and hanging well underneath the galactic plane where the last vestiges of stars and gas gave way to the emptiness beyond did not necessarily mean that a place was inaccessible providing it was close to an arteria portal arteria wormholes and the portals which were their exits and entrances meant everything in the galactic community they represented the difference between having to crawl everywhere at less than the speed of light and making almost instantaneous transitions from one stellar system to another the effect they had on a systems importance economy and even morale was similarly dramatic and rapid without one it was as though you were still stuck in one small village one dull and muddy valley and might be there all your life once a wormhole portal was emplaced it was as though you suddenly became part of a vast and glittering city full of energy life and promise the only way to get an arteria portal from one place to another was to put it in a spaceship and physically take it slower than light from one place to another leaving the other end usually anchored where youd started out which meant that if your wormhole was destroyed and they could be destroyed in theory at any point along their length in practice only at their ends at their portals then you were instantly all the way back to square one stuck in your isolated little village once again ulubis system had first been connected to the rest of the galaxy over three billion years earlier during what was then known as the new age it had been a relatively young notlongformed system at the time just a few billion years old but was already multiply lifesupporting its arteria connection had formed part of the second complex the galactic communitys second serious attempt at an integrated network of wormholes it had lost that connection in the billionyear turmoil of the long collapse the war of squalls the scatter anarchy and the informorta breakdown then along with most of the rest of the civilised galaxy slumbered as if comatose under the weight of the second or major chaos a time when only its dweller population on nasqueron had survived the dwellers being numbered amongst the species metatype known as the slow worked to a different timescale and thought nothing of taking a few hundred thousand years to get from point a to point b a billion years of nothing much happening was they declared merely like a long sabbatical to them following the third diasporian age and much more besides galactic history wasnt really simple on any scale another wormhole brought ulubis back online to become part of the third complex that arteria lasted for seventy million peaceful productive years during which several quick species none of them native to ulubis came and went leaving only the dwellers to bear consistent witness to the slow turn of life and events the arteria collapse had plunged ulubis into solitude once again along with ninetyfive per cent of the connected galaxy more portals and wormholes disappeared during the war of the new quick and the machine war and only the establishment of the mercatoria at least by the estimation of those who controlled it brought about a lasting peace and the beginning of the fourth complex ulubis had been reconnected early on in this slow stillattheearlystages process and for six thousand years that latest arteria had made the system an easily reached part of the gradually recovering galactic community however then that wormhole too had been destroyed and for over a quarter of a millennium ulubiss nearest working access point had been fully two hundred and fourteen years away further down the increasing thickness of the stream at zenerre that would change in about seventeen years or so when the wormhole endpoint currently being transported towards ulubis system at relativistic speeds aboard the engineership esttaun zhiffir arrived and was emplaced probably where the old portal had been at one of the lagrange points near sepekte the principal planet of the ulubis system for the moment though ulubis despite its importance as a centre for dweller studies remained remote chronologically as well as physically uncle slovius waved the servant away with one flipper and drew himself up against the yshaped cradle which supported his head and shoulders above the blue glowing surface of the pool the servant fassin recognised him now as guime the secondhighestranking of his uncles retainers turned back and tried to help slovius in this manoeuvre however slovius made hissing tutting noises and slapped at the male with one flipper hand guime dodged the weak slow blow easily and stepped back again bowing he stood nearby by the wall slovious struggled to lift his upper body any further out of the pool his tailed torso stirring sluggishly under the luminescent waves fassin started to rise from his crosslegged position uncle do you want me to no his uncle shouted in exasperation still trying ineffectually to push himself further up the cradle i would like people to stop fussing thats all slovius turned his head round as he said this trying to look at guime but only succeeded in causing himself to slip further back into the liquid so that he was even more horizontal than he had been before he started he slapped at the pool surface splashing there see what youve done interfering idiot he sighed mightily and lay back in the wallowing waves apparently exhausted staring straight ahead you may adjust me guime as you wish he said dully sounding resigned guime knelt on the tiles behind him put a hand under each of sloviuss armpits and hauled his master upwards onto the cradle until his head and shoulders were almost vertical slovius settled himself there then nodded briskly guime retreated again to his position by the wall now then nephew slovius said crossing his flipper hands over the pink expanse of his hairless chest he looked up at the transparent summit of the dome fassin smiled yes uncle slovius seemed to hesitate he let his gaze fall to his nephew your your studies fassin how do they progress they progress satisfactorily sir in the matter of the tranche xonju it is still of course very early hmm early uncle slovius said he looked thoughtful staring into the distance again fassin sighed gently this was obviously going to take some time fassin taak was a slow seer at the court of the nasqueron dwellers the dwellers gasgiant dwellers to give them a fuller designation neutrally buoyant first order ubiquitous climax clade gasgiant dwellers to grant them a still more painfully precise specification were large creatures of immense age who lived within the deliriously complex and topologically vast civilisation of great antiquity which was distributed throughout the cloud layers wrapping the enormous gasgiant planet a habitat that was as stupendous in scale as it was changeable in aerography the dwellers at least in their mature form thought slowly they lived slowly evolved slowly travelled slowly and did almost everything they ever did slowly they could it was alleged fight quite quickly though as far as anybody was able to determine they had not had to do any fighting for a long time the implication of this was that they could think quickly when it suited them but most of the time it did not appear to suit them and so it was assumed they thought slowly it was unarguable that in their later years later aeons they conversed slowly so slowly that a simple question asked before breakfast might not be answered until after supper a rate of conversational exchange it occurred to fassin that uncle slovius floating in his nowquitestill pool with a trancelike expression on his tusked puffy face seemed determined to emulate the tranche xonju it concerns slovius said suddenly clutter poetry diasporic myths and various history tangles fassin answered histories of which epochs the majority have still to be dated uncle some may never be and possibly belong with the myths the only readily identifiable strands are very recent and appear to relate to mostly local events during the machine war uncle slovius nodded slowly producing small waves the machine war that is interesting i was thinking of attending to those strands first yes slovius said a good idea thank you uncle slovius lapsed into silence again a groundquake rumbled distantly around them producing tiny concentric rings in the liquid of sloviuss pool the civilisation which comprised the dwellers of nasqueron with all their attendant fellow flora and fauna itself formed but one microscopic fragment of the dweller diaspora the galaxyspanning metacivilisation some would say postcivilisation which as far as anyone could tell preceded all other empires cultures diasporas civilisations federations consocia fellowships unities leagues confederacies affilia and organisations of like or unlike beings in general the dwellers in other words had been around for most of the life of the galaxy this made them at least unusual and possibly unique it also made them if they were approached with due deference and care and treated with respect and patience a precious resource because they had good memories and even better libraries or at least they had retentive memories and very large libraries dweller memories and libraries usually proved to be stuffed full of outright nonsense bizarre myths incomprehensible images indecipherable symbols and meaningless equations plus random assemblages of numbers letters pictograms holophons sonomemes chemiglyphs actinomes and sensata variegata all of them trawled and thrown together unsorted or in patterns too abstruse to be untangled from a jumbled mix of millions upon millions of utterly different and categorically unrelated civilisations the vast majority of which had long since disappeared and either crumbled into dust or evaporated into radiation nevertheless in all that flux of chaos propaganda distortion drivel and weirdness there were nuggets of actuality seams of facts frozen rivers of longforgotten history whole volumes of exobiography and skeins and tissues of truth it had been the lifework of people like chief seer slovius and was the lifework of people like chief seerinwaiting fassin taak to meet with and talk to the dwellers to adapt to their language thoughts and metabolism to sometimes virtually at a remove sometimes literally float and fly and dive and soar with them amongst the clouds of nasqueron and through their conversations their studies their notes and analyses make what sense they could of what their ancient slowliving hosts told them and allowed them to access and so enrich and enlighten the greater quicker metacivilisation which presently inhabited the galaxy and ah jaal slovius glanced at his nephew who looked sufficiently surprised for the older male to add the oh whats their name tonderon yes the tonderon girl you two are still betrothed arent you fassin smiled we are indeed uncle he said she is returning from pirrintipiti this evening im hoping to meet her at the port and you are slovius gestured with one flipper hand still content content uncle fassin asked you are happy with her with the prospect of her being your wife of course uncle and she with you well i hope so i believe so slovius looked at his nephew holding his gaze for a moment mmhmm i see of course well slovius used one of his flipper hands to wave some of the blue glowing liquid over his upper chest as though he was cold you are to be wed when the date is fixed for allhallows jocund iii fassin said somewhat under half a year body time he added helpfully i see slovius said frowning he nodded slowly and the action caused his body to rise and fall slightly in the pool producing more waves well it is good to know you might finally be settling down at last fassin considered himself to be a dedicated hardworking and productive seer who spent well above the average amount of time at the sharp end of delving actually with the nasqueron dwellers however due to the fact that he liked to complete each interlude of this real useful life with what he called a proper holiday the older generation of sept bantrabal and especially slovius seemed to think he was some sort of hopeless wastrel indeed uncle slovius seemed reluctant to accept the term proper holiday at all he preferred to call them monthlong blinddrunk stonedout benders getting into trouble fights and illicit orifices in the flesh pots of well wherever sometimes pirrintipiti the capital of glantine sometimes borquille capital of sepekte or one of sepektes other cities sometimes one of the many pleasure habitats scattered throughout the system fassin smiled tolerantly still i shant be hanging up my dancing shoes just yet uncle the nature of your studies over your last say three or four delves fassin have they followed what one might term a consistent course you confuse me uncle fassin admitted your last three or four delves have they been in any way linked thematically or by subject or through the dwellers you have conversed with fassin sat back surprised why ever would old slovius be interested in this let me think sir he said on this occasion i spoke almost exclusively with xonju who provided information seemingly at random and does not fully appear to understand the concept of an answer our first meeting and all very preparatory he may be worth following up if we can find him again he may not it might take all of the months between now and my next delve to work out so this was a sampling expedition an introduction indeed before that a protracted conference with cheuhoras saraisme the younger akeurle bothtwins traav kanchangesja and a couple of minors from the eglide adolescent pod your subjects poetry mostly ancient modern the use of image in the epic the ethics of boasting and exaggeration and the delve before with cheuhoras alone an extended lament for his departed parent some hunting myths from the local nearpast and a lengthy translation and disposition on an epic sequence concerning the adventures of ancient plasmatics voyaging within the hydrogen migration perhaps a billion or so years ago during the second chaos before that fassin smiled my extended onetoone with valseir the delve which included my sojourn with the raucous rascals of tribe dimajrian he imagined he didnt need to remind his uncle of too many of the details of that particular excursion this had been the protracted delve which had made his name as a gifted seer the sixyear journey by bodytime it had lasted nearly a century by outside reckoning that had established his reputation both within sept bantrabal and the hierarchy of glantine seers beyond his exploits and the value of the stories and histories he had returned with had been largely responsible for his elevation to the post of chief seerinwaiting in his sept and for the offer of marriage to the daughter of the chief seer of sept tonderon the most senior of the twelve septs this takes us back how many years in real fassin thought about three hundred two hundred and eightyseven if i recall correctly slovius nodded there was much of that delve released during its course almost nothing sir the raucous rascals insisted they are one of the more unameliorated adolescent pods i was allowed to report that i was alive once per year the delve before that fassin sighed and tapped the fingers of one hand on the fused glass at the side of the pool what on old earth could this be about and could slovius not simply look up the sept records for such information there was a big cantilevered arm thing stowed against the wall of the pool chamber with a screenpad on the end fassin had seen this device lowered into place in front of slovius for him to peer at and prod the keys with his finger stumps it was patently not a very rapid or efficient method of interrogating the house library but it would answer all these questions or the old fellow could just ask there were servants for this sort of thing fassin cleared his throat most of that was taken up with instructing paggs yurnvic of sept reheo on his first delve we paid court to traav hambrier in onetoone time with the dwellers to allow for yurnvics inexperience the delve lasted barely three months bodytime textbook introductory sir you found no time to pursue any studies of your own little sir but some yes i was able to attend part of a symposium on deep poetics with the university pod marcal to detail the other attendees i would have to inquire within the sept records sir what more of the symposium i mean its subject if i recall a comparison of dweller hunting techniques with the actions of machine war inquisitories fassin stroked his chin the examples were ulubissystem local some regarding glantine slovius nodded he glanced at his nephew do you know what an emissarial projection is fassin fassin looked up at the segment of gasgiant visible through the transparent roof panel the night terminator was just starting to appear to one side a line of increasing darkness creeping across the distant cloudscape he looked back down at slovius i may have heard the term sir i would not care to offer a definition its when they send a tuned suite of queries and responses to a physically remote location by light beam to play the part of an emissary they sir engineers the administrata perhaps the omnocracy fassin sat back indeed indeed if we are to believe what we are told the object they send is something like a library transmitted by signal laser suitably housed and emplaced within enabled equipment of sufficient capacity and complexity this entity though it is simply a manybranched array of statements questions and answers with a set of rules governing the order in which they are expressed is able to carry out what seems very like an intelligent conversation it is as close as one is allowed to come to an artificial intelligence postwar how singular slovius wobbled in his pool they are assuredly surpassing rare he agreed one is being sent here fassin blinked a few times sent here to sept bantrabal to this house to us to us from the administrata the administrata fassin became aware that he was sounding simpleminded via the engineership esttaun zhiffir my fassin said we are privileged not we fassin you the projection is being sent to talk to you fassin smiled weakly to me i see when will it is currently being transmitted it ought to be ready by late evening you may wish to clear your schedule for this did you have much arranged ah a supper with jaal im sure i would make it an early supper and dont tarry well yes of course fassin said do you have any idea sir what i might have done to deserve such an honour slovius was silent for a moment then said none whatsoever guime replaced an intercom set on its hook and left his place by the agate wall to kneel and whisper to slovius who nodded then looked at fassin majordomo verpych would like to talk to you nephew verpych fassin said with a gulp the households majordomo sept bantrabals most senior servant was supposed to rest dormant until the whole sept moved to its winter lodgings over eighty days from now it was unheard of for him to be roused out of sequence i thought he was asleep well hes been woken up the ship had been dead for millennia nobody seemed to be sure quite how many though the most plausible estimates put it at about six or seven it was just one more foundered vessel from one or other of the great fleets which had contended the war of the new quick or perhaps the slightly later machine war or possibly the subsequent scatter wars or maybe one of the brief bitter confused and untidy engagements implicit in the strew another forgotten discarded piece from the great game of galactic powermongering civilisational competition panspecies manoeuvring and general grandscale metapoliticking the hulk had lain undiscovered on the surface of glantine for at least a thousand years because although glantine was a minor planet by human standards slightly smaller than mars it was by the same measure sparsely populated with fewer than a billion inhabitants most of those concentrated in the tropics and the area where the wreck had fallen the north waste land was a rarely visited and extensive tract of nothing much that it had taken a long time for the local surveillance systems to return to anything like the sort of complexity or sophistication theyd exhibited before the commencement of hostilities also helped the ruins avoid detection lastly for all the vessels hulking size some portion of its autocamouflage systems had survived the crafts partial destruction the deaths of all the mortals aboard and its impact on the planetmoons surface and so had kept it disguised for all that time seemingly just another fold of barren rocky ejecta from the impact crater left by a smaller but much fastertravelling derelict which had crashed and vaporised in a deep crater ten kilometres away right at the start of the new quick dispute the ships ruins had only been discovered because somebody in a flier had crashed fatally into one of its great curving ribs perfectly holodisguised at the time as sheer and shiningly inviting clear sky only then had the wreck been investigated plundered for what little of its systems still worked but which were not under the new regime proscribed which basically did not leave much and finally the lifting of its hull and major substructures being prohibitively expensive to contemplate its cuttingup and carting away difficult also not cheap and possibly dangerous and its complete destruction only possible with the sort of serious gigatonnage weaponry people tended to object strongly to when used in peacetime in the atmospheres of a small planetmoon even in a wilderness area it had been cordoned off and a series of airborne loiterdrones posted on indefinite guard above just in case no this could be good this could be positive saluus kehar told them and swung the little flier low across the high desert towards the broken lands where the tatteredlooking ribs of the great downed ship lay like folded shadow against the slowly darkening purple sky beyond the ruins a vast shimmering bluegreen curtain of light flickered into existence silently waving and rippling across the sky then faded away again yeah you would fucking say that taince said fiddling with the controls of the comms unit static chopped and surfed from the speakers should we be this close to the ground ilen asked forehead against the canopy looking down she glanced at the young man sharing the back seat of the little aircraft with her seriously fass should we but fassin was already saying the idea that his relentless positivism could ever produce feelings of negativity in others is a concept sals still struggling with sorry len what i was just saying yeah taince muttered get that goddam dirtpinger on all i mean saluus said waving one hand around and taking the craft still lower even closer to the sable blur of ground taince made a tutting sound and reached over to tap a screen button there was a pinging noise and the craft rose a few metres and began tracking the ground more smoothly sal glared at her but didnt turn the groundavoidance device off as he continued is that were still okay we havent been blasted yet and now we have an opportunity to explore something we wouldnt be allowed to get anywhere near normally right place right time perfect opportunity whats not to be positive about there you mean fassin drawled glancing skyward aside from the unfortunate fact that some overenthusiastic and doubtless deeply misunderstood beyonders appear to be trying to turn us all into radioactive dust nobody seemed to be listening fassin made a show of stifling a yawn nobody noticed that either and leaned back against the leather seat stretching his left arm across the top of the couch in the general direction of ilen deste still with her head against the canopy staring as though hypnotised at the nearfeatureless sands speeding by beneath he tried to look at least unconcerned and preferably bored in fact of course he felt completely terrified and more than a little helpless sal and taince were the dynamic couple in this group saluus the pilot the dashing handsome headstrong but undeniably gifted and fassin thought just plain lucky heir to a vast commercial empire the unabashed son of a fabulously rich buccaneering father greedboy fassin had christened sal in their first year at college a term that their mutual friends had only used behind the youths back until he got wind of it and adopted it enthusiastically as his personally approved tag and taince copilot navigator and comms supremo as ever the knowing abrasive commentator of the group fassin saw himself as the knowing sarcastic commentator officerintraining taince yarabokin as she was supposed to be known now taince the milgirl another of fassins coinings had toppercentiled her college classes but had already been halfway to being an officer in the navarchy military through reservist credits gleaned after hours at weekends and on vacations even before shed taken a short degree and gone to military academy for her final year fasttracked from preinduction bumped from years one to two midway through term and rumoured even at such an almost unprecedentedly early stage to be in contention for a chance later to join the summed fleet the directly culminacontrolled overarching ultrapower of the whole galaxy in other words as seemingly surely destined for martial eminence as sal was scheduled for commercial prodigiousness theyd both been outsystem too making the journey to the ulubissystem portal at sepektes trailing lagrange point for the transition to zenerre and the complex the network of wormholes threading the galaxy like a throw of dark lace beneath the tiny scattered lights of suns saluuss father had taken him on a grand tour on his long vacation last year girdling the middle galaxy visiting all the great accessible sites encountering some of the more outré alien species bringing back souvenirs taince had been to fewer but in some cases further places courtesy of the navarchy its exercises and distributed specialist teaching facilities they were the only two of their year to have travelled so widely putting them in a little bubble of exoticism all by themselves fassin had often thought that if his young life was to be tragically cut short before hed even decided what he wanted to do with it join the family firm and become a seer or something else it would very likely be because of these two probably when they were each trying to outdo the other in daring or élan or sheer outrageous showingoff in front of their longsuffering friends sometimes he succeeded in persuading himself that he didnt particularly care if he did die anyway that hed already seen enough of life and love and all the crassness and stupidities of people and reality and would almost prefer to die a sudden young savagely beautiful death with his body and mind as yet unspoiled and fresh and everything as older relations still insisted on telling him before him though it would be a pity if ilen achingly beautiful wanly pale shamelessly blonde effortlessly academically accomplished bizarrely unselfassured and insecure ilen had to perish in the wreck too fassin thought especially before they had fulfilled what he kept telling her and what frustratingly he even sincerely believed was their destiny and established between the two of them some sort of meaningful but intense physical relationship at the moment though head craned out over the side of the flier nuzzling the canopy it looked like the girl was thinking about throwing up fassin looked away and attempted to distract himself from thoughts of imminent death and probably all too nonimminent sex by staring at the starry sweep emerging from the false horizon of nasquerons shadowy departing bulk and the quickly darkening sky being revealed beyond another burst of aurora activity sent shimmering shawls of light across the heavens briefly fading out the stars ilen was looking in the opposite direction whats that smoke she cried pointing beyond the halfcollapsed nose of the fallen ship where a tall ragged strand of dark grey smoke leaned away from the breeze taince glanced up and muttered something then busied herself with the comms unit controls the rest looked sal nodded probably the guard drone that got zapped earlier he said though sounding uncertain the speakers crackled and a calm female voice said lier twotwoniner sition ave you sevenfivethree outh of prohibited area ei peat you are now or wi ortly be offgrid firm your taince yarabokin leaned closer to the comms unit this is flier twotwonine we have no place safe to put down under cover as advised so we are making maximum speed at minimum altitude towards saluus kehar reached over with one copperygold hand and clicked the comms unit off fuck you taince said slapping his hand away even as it went back to the fliers control yoke taince really sal said shaking his head but keeping his gaze on the rapidly approaching ship ruins you dont have to tell them cretin taince breathed she switched the comms back on yes see previous comment fassin said shaking his head will you leave that alone sal said trying and failing to turn the comms unit off again as taince searched for a working channel and kept slapping his hand away fassin was about to say something to the effect that she was better practised at this form of behaviour than hed ever have assumed then thought the better of it look sal said im ordering you taince leave the damn thing off who does this flier belong to anyway your dad fassin suggested sal glanced back at him reproachful fassin nodded forwards at the swiftly enlarging wreck of the ship eyes ahead sal turned back im ordering you thought fassin with a sneer saluus really had he used that form of words because taince was in the military and he thought shed just obey anything anybody called an order even if it came from a civilian or because he thought he could start throwing his dynastic weight around already he was surprised that taince hadnt laughed in sals face oh well they werent innocents any more fassin reminded himself and the more you learned about the world the galaxy and the age they were growing up within the more you realised it was all about hierarchy about ranking and seniority and pecking order from well well below where they were all the way up to gloriously unseeable alien heights really they were like lab mice growing up together roughandtumbling in the cage learning their position in the litter testing their own and the others abilities and weaknesses working on their moves and strategies for later life discovering how much leeway they might have or be granted as adults mapping out the space for their dreams taince snorted probably not even daddys car probably not even a company flier more likely some complicated saleandleaseback deal and its owned by an offplanet taxopaque semiautomatic front company she growled and slapped the unresponding comms unit sal shook his head such cynicism in the young he said then looked down at the butterfly shape of the control yoke hey this is vibrating what taince nodded at the ship ruins now towering over them proximity warning ace you might want to slow down or peel and scrub how can you talk about exfoliating at a time like this sal said grinning taince punched his thigh ow thats assault he said pretending outrage i may sue she punched him again he laughed throttled back and airbraked pushing them all forward against their restraints until the little flier was down to about ten metres per second they passed into the shadow of the giant ship fassin taak majordomo verpych said what trouble have you landed us in now they were hurrying down a wide windowless passageway under the centre of the house before fassin could reply verpych nodded at a side corridor and strode towards it this way fassin lengthened his stride to keep up i am as ignorant as you are majordomo clearly your gift for understatement has not deserted you fassin absorbed this and thought the better of replying he assumed what he hoped looked like a tolerant smile though when he glanced at verpych the majordomo wasnt looking verpych was a small thin but powerfullooking man with pale creamy skin ubiquitously stubbled giving his head the look of having been chiselled out of sandstone he had a square everclenched jaw and a perpetual frown his head was shaved save for a single long ponytail that extended to his waist he gripped the long obsidian staff which was his principal badge of office as though it was a dark snake he was trying to throttle onehanded his uniform was the black of soot like folded night as chief seerinwaiting fassin was supposedly in a position of complete authority over verpych however somehow the septs most senior servant still managed to make him feel like a child whod only just escaped being discovered doing something extremely improper fassin could envisage the changeover when he finally assumed the post of chief seer being awkward for both of them verpych turned on his heel and walked straight at a large abstract mural hanging on one wall he waved his staff at the painting as though pointing out some detail of the brushwork and the whole painting disappeared into a slot in the floor verpych stepped up into a dimly lit corridor beyond he didnt bother to look back as fassin followed him just said short cut fassin glanced back as the painting rose out of the slot in the floor cutting off most of the light in the corridor which looked bare and unfinished after the passageway that theyd just left he couldnt remember the last time hed been in a utility corridor probably when hed been a child exploring with his friends they stopped at a lift its door open a chime sounding a boy servant stood in the elevator car holding a tray full of dirty glasses with one hand and using the other to jab at the car controls a puzzled frustrated expression on his face get out you idiot verpych told the boy as he strode to the lift its being held for me the servants eyes widened he made spluttering noises and almost dropped the tray hurrying to quit the elevator verpych tapped a button on the lift controls with the end of the staff the doors closed and the lift a plain metal box with a scuffed floor descended have you recovered from your unscheduled awakening majordomo fassin asked entirely verpych said crisply now then seer taak assuming my comedy troupe of technicians havent electrocuted themselves or stared into any light cables to check that theyre working and blinded themselves we should be ready for you to hold your conversation with whatever it is they are beaming towards us about an hour before midnight is nineteen oclock convenient for you fassin thought actually the lady jaal tonderon and i might the answer you are searching for is yes seer taak verpych said fassin frowned down at the older man then in that case why did you i was being polite ah of course that cannot come easily quite the contrary it is deference that one sometimes struggles with your efforts are appreciated im sure why i live for nothing else young master verpych smiled thinly fassin held the majordomos gaze verpych could i be in some sort of trouble the servant looked away i have no idea sir the lift began to slow this emissarial projection is unprecedented in the history of sept bantrabal i have talked to some other majordomos and nobody can recall such a thing we had all thought such phenomena restricted to the hierchon and his chums in the syscap ive sent a message to a contact i have in the palace asking for any guidance or tips they might have there has been no reply so far the lift doors opened and they stepped out another corridor quite warm cut from naked rock curving the majordomo looked at fassin with what might have been concern even sympathy an unprecedented event might be of a benign nature seer taak fassin hoped that he looked as sceptical as he felt so what do i have to do present yourself to the audience chamber top floor at nineteen preferably a little before they came to a yjunction and a wider corridor where reduniformed technicians were trundling a pallet loaded with complicatedlooking equipment towards a set of open double doors ahead id like olmey to be there fassin said tchayan olmey had been fassins mentor and tutor in his youth and had she not become a pure academic in the household library researching and teaching to the exclusion of undertaking any delves of her own might have been the next familias and chief seer that will not be possible verpych said ushering fassin through the double doors into the room beyond which was hot crowded with more reduniformed technicians and dished like a small theatre dozens of opened cabinets displayed intricate machinery cables hung from the tall ceiling snaked across the floor and disappeared into ducts in the walls the place smelled of oil singed plastic and sweat verpych stood at the top and rear of the room watching the activity shaking his head as two techs collided spilling cable why not fassin asked olmeys here and i rather wanted uncle slovius to be able to look in as well that wont be possible either verpych told fassin you and you alone have to talk to this thing i have no choice in this fassin asked correct the majordomo said none he returned his attention to the milling techs one of the senior ones had approached to within a couple of metres waiting for an opportunity to speak but why not fassin repeated aware as soon as he said it that he was sounding like a small child verpych shook his head i dont know to the best of my knowledge there is no technical reason perhaps whatever is to be discussed is too sensitive for other ears he looked at the reduniformed man waiting nearby master technician imming he said brightly working on the principle that whatever can go wrong will i have been weighing up the possibilities that our house automatics have rusted into a single unusable mass crumbled to a fine powder or unexpectedly declared themselves sentient necessitating the destruction by fusion warheads of our entire house sept and possibly planet which is it to be sir we have encountered several problems the technician said slowly his gaze flicking from fassin to verpych i do so hope the next word is but or however verpych said he glanced at fassin a happily would be too much to ask for of course the technician continued thanks to our considerable efforts sir we believe we have the situation in hand i would hope that we ought to be ready by the appointed hour we have the capacity to absorb all that is being transmitted just sir master technician imming gestured to the equipment on the pallet being manoeuvred through the double doors we are using some spare capacity from the utility systems is there any indication of the nature of the subject contained within the signal no sir it will remain in code until activated could we find out imming looked pained not really sir could we not try that would be nearly impossible in the time frame majordomo and illegal possibly dangerous seer taak here is wondering what he is to be faced with you can give him no clues master technician imming made a small bow to fassin im afraid not sir wish it were otherwise verpych turned to fassin we seem unable to help you seer taak i am so sorry whose was this anyway ilen asked keeping her voice down she looked up into the shadows high above who did it belong to they had swung in through the single great jagged fissure in the ships left flank flying up between two massively curved ribstruts the sky above framed by the twisted buckled ribs the sections of the hull they had supported turned to dissociated molecules and atoms seven millennia earlier sal had let the flier slip four hundred metres or so into the shadows under the intact forward portion of the hull climbing gently all the time following the mangled buckled floors and collapsed bulkheads forming the terrain beneath them until they could see only the slimmest sliver of violet starspattered sky outside and felt they ought to be safe from whatever spaceborne craft presumably a beyonder had been attacking anything that moved or had recently been moving on the surface sal had set the little craft down the flier came to rest in a slight hollow on a relatively level patch of blackened minutely rippled material behind what might have been the remains of a crumpled bulkhead the way ahead into the rest of the ships forward section was blocked fifty metres further in by the hanging frozenlooking tatters of some twisted iridescent material saluus had thought aloud about trying to nudge the flier through this suspended debris but had been dissuaded the fliers comms reception even the distorted jammed signal that theyd experienced outside had just faded away almost as soon as theyd entered the wreck for something supposed to pull in a signal through tens of klicks of solid rock this was remarkable the air inside the vast cave of the ruined craft felt cold and smelled of nothing knowing they were inside the fact that their voices did not echo in the huge space was oddly disturbing giving the sound a strange hollow quality the interior and running lights of the flier put them in a tiny pool of luminescence emphasising their insignificance within the ancient fallen ship some dispute about exactly whose it might be saluus said also quietly and also gazing upwards at the smoothly ribbed ceiling of the vessel arching a third of a kilometre above them and still just visible in the gloaming marked down as a sceuri wreck they sent their war graves people to clean it out but if it was then it must have been requisitioned or captured and they reckon it had a highly mixed crew though mostly swimmers waterworlders could be oerileithe originally oddly enough has the design of a dwellerwithasmalld ship but some sort of war craft certainly taince snorted sal looked at her yes what it isnt she said is a needle ship did i say it was sal asked rather a fat needle if it was fassin said swivelling on his heel to follow the downward curve of the wrecked ships interior towards its crumpled partially buried nose over a kilometre away in the darkness its not a needle ship sal protested i didnt call it a needle ship see taince said now youve confused people anyway sal said ignoring this theres a rumour they pulled a couple of voehn bodies out of here and that really does make it more interesting voehn taince burst out laughing spiner stiffs her voice dripped scorn she was even smiling which fassin knew wasnt something you saw every day pity because her smooth slightly square face under a regulation military bald looked kind of impishly attractive when she smiled come to think of it that was probably why she didnt do it often actually fassin thought taince looked pretty good anyway in her offduty fatigues the rest of them just wore standard hikingoutdoorsy gear though naturally sals was subtly but noticeably superior and doubtless wildly more expensive tains fatigues kind of bagged out in odd locations but came back in at the right places to leave no doubt that she was definitely a milgirl not a milboy theyd turned shadowmatt and dark in the surrounding gloom too apparently even the navmils offduty fatigues for trainees came with active camo she was shaking her head as though she couldnt believe what she was hearing even fassin whod pretty much shucked off the whole boy thing of obsessive interest in all things military and alien not long after the onset of puberty knew about the voehn they were usually described in the media as living legends or nearmythical warriors which kind of blanded what they really were the crack troops and personal guards of the new galactic masters the voehn were the calmly relentless highly intelligent omnicompetent nearindestructible allenvironmentscapable undefeated ubersoldiers of the last nine or so millennia they were the martial pinups of the age the speckless species peak of military perfection but they were rare few and far between where the new masters the culmina were the voehn were too but not in all that many other places and as far as anybody knew fassin had been given to understand in all those millennia not one had even entered the ulubis system to visit sepekte the principal planet let alone come near nasqueron or deigned to have anything to do with its little planetmoon glantine even in death there was of course a further resonance for humans in the voehn name and reputation whether one was ahuman or rhuman it had been the actions of a single voehn ship nearly eight thousand years earlier which had made the distinction and the two prefixes necessary in the first place voehn sal said defiantly to taince voehn remains thats the rumour taince narrowed her eyes and drew herself up in her navmilissue fatigues not one ive heard yes sal said well my contacts are a few levels above the boot locker fassin gulped i thought they all got smeared in this thing anyway he said quickly before taince could reply just paste gas and stuff they were taince said through her teeth looking at sal not him indeed they were sal agreed but voehn are real toughies arent they tain shit yeah taince said quietly levelly real fucking toughies takes a lot to kill one takes even more to paste it sal said seemingly oblivious to tainces signals notoriously resistant to fate and the enemys various unpleasantnesses taince said coldly fassin had the feeling she was quoting the gossip was that she and sal were some sort of couple or at least fucked now and again but fassin thought that given the look in her eyes right now that particular side of their relationship if it had ever existed might be in some danger of being pasted itself he looked for ilen to catch her expression she wasnt where shed been on the far side of the flier he looked around some more she wasnt anywhere he could see ilen he said he glanced at the other two wheres ilen sal tapped his ear stud ilen he said hey len fassin peered into the shadows he had night vision as good as most people but with barely any starlight and only the soft conservelevel lights of the flier resting in its declivity there wasnt much to work with infrared showed next to nothing too not even fading footsteptraces on whatever this strange material was ilen sal said again he looked at taince who was also scanning the area i cant see shit and my phones out he told her you able to see any better than us taince shook her head get those eyes in fourth year shit thought fassin he wondered if anybody had a torch probably not few people did these days he checked his own earphone but it was dead too not even local reception oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck when did the archetype of this storyline date from four kids getting the use of dads chariot and losing a wheel just before nightfall near the old deserted neanderthal cave something like that just wander off into the dark and get killed horribly one by one ill turn up the flier lights sal said reaching for the interior if ness we can lift off and ilen taince shouted at the top of her lungs fassin jumped he hoped the others hadnt noticed over here liens voice came very distantly from further inside the wreck wandering off sal shouted in the general direction ilens voice had come from not good idea in fact very bad idea suggest return immediately peeing in front of peers problem the reply drifted back bashful bladder syndrome relieved returning speak normal now or len get tain poke sal eye out taince grinned fassin had to turn away sometimes through all the almost wilfully unjustified reticence and uncertainty and often at moments like this when you might least expect it ilen surprised him by doing or saying something like this she made his insides hurt oh dont let me start to fall in love with her he thought that would just be too much to bear sal laughed a vaguely henshaped blob appeared in ir sense fifty metres away head first over a fold in the rippled floor like a shallow hill there shes fine sal announced as though hed rescued her personally ilen rejoined them smiling and blinking in the soft lights of the flier her whitegold hair shining she nodded evening she said and grinned at them welcome back sal told her and hauled a pack out of one of the fliers storage lockers he swung the bag onto his back taince glared at the pack then at sals face what the fuck are you doing sal looked innocent going to take a look round you can join me if like fuck you are tain child he laughed i dont need your permission im not a fucking child and yes you fucking do and will you please stop swearing quite so much theres really no need to flaunt your newly acquired gruff military manner quite so conspicuously we stay here she told him using the cold voice again close to the flier we dont go wandering off into a prohibited alien shipwreck in the middle of the night with an enemy craft cruising overhead why not sal protested for one thing its probably on the other side of the planet by now or maybe even destroyed and anyway if this beyonder ship or battlesat or drone or whatever it is can see inside here which i seriously doubt its going to target the flier not a few human warmbods so were safer away from the thing you stay with the craft always taince said her jaw set for how long sal asked how long do these nuisance raids these attacklets usually last taince just glared at him half a day average sal told her overnight probably in this case meantime were somewhere its not normally possible to be through no fault of our own with time to kill why the hell not take a look round because its prohibited taince said thats why fassin and ilen exchanged looks concerned but still amused taince sal said waving his arms life is risk thats business come on you stay with the craft taince repeated grimly will you step out of your programming just for a second sal asked her sounding genuinely annoyed and looking at the other two for support can any of us think of one good reason why this place is prohibited apart from standard authoritarian bureaucratic overreacting territorymarking militaristic bullshit maybe they know stuff we dont taince said oh come on sal protested they always claim that listen taince said levelly your point is taken regarding the likelihood of the fliers systems being targeted by hostiles and therefore i volunteer to walk out every hour on the hour to near the gap in the hull where a phone might work once the jamming subsats have been neutralised to check for the allclear fine sal said digging into another of the fliers lockers you do that im seizing the onceinalifetime opportunity to take a look round an intrinsically fascinating alien artefact if you hear me screaming horribly itll just be me falling into the claws suckers or beaks of some unspeakable spacealien monster every single wreckclearing team missed and which has chosen just this evening out of the last seven millennia to wake up and feel hungry taince took a deep breath stepped back from the flier and said okay seems this must qualify as an emergency she dug into her black fatigues and when her hand reappeared it held a small dark grey device sal stared at her incredulous what the hell is that a gun youre not planning to shoot me are you taince she shook her head and thumbed something on the side of the device there was a pause then taince frowned and looked closely at the thing in her hand actually she said at the moment im not even threatening to report you to the local guard not in realtime anyway sal relaxed a little but didnt pull whatever it was hed been looking for out of the locker taince shook her head and looked up into the black spaces of the cavernous craft around them she held the little grey device up to show the others this baby she said should be able to punch me through to a kids disposable on the far side of the planet but its still searching for cosmic background she sounded more puzzled than embarrassed or angry fassin thought in similar circumstances hed have been mortified and it would have shown taince nodded still staring upwards impressive she put the handheld away again sal cleared his throat taince do you have a gun its just that im about to pull one out of this locker and you looked kind of scary and triggerhappy just there yes i do have a gun she told him promise i wont shoot you she gave a smile that wasnt really and if you are intent on traipsing into the bowels of this thing im not going to try and stop you youre a big boy now your responsibility finally sal said with satisfaction pulling a plain but businesslikelooking cr pistol out of the locker and attaching it to his belt theres food and water and bedrolls and extra clothes and stuff in the rear lockers he told them slapping a couple of lowlight illuminator patches onto his jacket shoulders ill be back about dawn he multipletapped his ear stud then smiled yep internal clock still working he glanced at each of them in turn hey theres probably nothing to see i could be back in an hour for all i know they all just looked at him nobody else coming along huh he asked ilen and fassin glanced at each other taince was watching sal who said well dont wait up and turned to go youre very well prepared for this taince said quietly sal hesitated then turned towards her openmouthed he looked at fassin and ilen then stared with wide eyes at taince he gestured towards the distant hull gap upwards as though to space then shook his head taince taince he breathed he pushed one hand through his thick black hair just how paranoid and suspicious do they insist you be in the military your fathers company makes our battlecraft saluus she told him wariness is a survival strategy oh cheap shot taince sal looked mildly insulted but i mean really seriously come on he slapped his backpack exasperated hells teeth woman if i hadnt made sure the flier was equipped with emergency gear youd have chewed my ear for making a deepdesert flight without the necessary supplies taince stood looking at him nearexpressionless for a few moments longer mind how you go sal he nodded relaxing you too he said see you all soon he looked round them all one more time grinning nothing i wouldnt do and all that he waved his hand and tramped off hold on ilen said sal turned back ilen pulled her little daypack out of the flier ill come with you sal fassin stared horrified what he said in a small shocked little boys voice nobody seemed to hear for once he was glad taince said nothing sal smiled you sure he asked the girl if you dont mind ilen said fine by me sal said quietly sure you dont mind of course i dont mind well youre not supposed to go off exploring in dubious situations individually are you ilen said isnt that right she looked at taince who nodded you take care ilen kissed fassins cheek winked at taince and strode up the shallow slope to sal they waved and walked off fassin watched their footsteptraces in ir each faint patch of brightness on the ground behind them fading after less than a second never understand that girl taince said sounding unconcerned she and fassin looked at each other suggest you take a snooze now taince told him nodding at the flier she picked her nose and inspected her finger ill wake you before i head out to the hull gap to check for signal a fragrance bud popped somewhere in the darkened room and after a few moments he smelled orchidia noctisia a madebloom scent he would always associate with the autumn house there was little air movement in the quiet chamber so the bud must have been floating nearby he lifted his head gently and saw a tiny shape like a slim translucent flower falling chiffonsoft through the air between the bed and the trolley which had brought their supper he lowered his head to jaals shoulder again mmm she said drowsily meet any friends in town fassin asked winding a long golden coil of jaal tonderons hair around one finger then bringing his nose forward to nuzzle the nape of her brownred neck breathing in the smell of her she shifted against him moving her hips in a sort of stirring motion he had slipped out of her some time ago but it was still a good feeling ree and grey and sa she said her voice starting out a little sleepy shopping was accomplished then we met up with djen and sohn and dayd dayd eslaus oh and yoaz you remember yoaz irmin dont you he nipped her neck and was rewarded with a flinch and a yelp that was a long time ago he told her she reached one hand behind her and stroked his exposed flank then patted his behind im sure the memory is still vivid for her dear ha he said so am i this drew a slap then they settled in against each other once more she did that thing with her hips again and he wondered if there would be time for more sex before he had to go she turned to face him jaal tonderons face was round and wide and only just very beautiful for two thousand years or so rhuman faces had looked pretty much how the owners wanted them to look displaying either satisfaction with or indifference to whatever wombgrown comeliness they had been born with or the particular amended look their owners had subsequently specified the only ugly people were those making a statement in an age when everyone could be beautiful andor look like famous historical figures there were now laws about looking too much like famous contemporary figures the truly interesting faces and bodies were those which sailed as close to the wind of being plain or even unattractive as possible and yet just got away with it people talked about faces that looked good in the flesh but not in images or good in lifelike paintings but not on a screen or faces that looked unattractive in repose but quite stunning when animated or merely plain until the person smiled jaal had been born with a face that looked she said herself committee design unharmonious stuck together nothing quite matching yet to almost everybody who had ever met her she seemed outrageously attractive thanks to some alchemy of physiognomy personality and expression fassins private estimation was that jaals was a face still waiting to be grown into and that she would be more beautiful when she was middleaged than she was now it was one reason he had asked her to marry him they could look forward fassin had every reason to believe to a long life together and just as it had been sensible to marry within his profession and to make a match that would meet with the enthusiastic approval of their respective septs strengthening the bonds between two of the most important seer houses so it had been only prudent to take that likely longevity into account of course as slow seers fassin and jaals shared future would be absolutely if not relatively longer than that of most of their contemporaries and radically different in the slowtime of a long delve seers aged very slowly indeed and uncle sloviuss fourteen centuries while short of the record and not yet thankfully naturally his limit should not be difficult to surpass seer spouses and loved ones had to schedule their slowtime and normal life carefully so as not to get too out of synch with each other lest the protagonists lose touch emotionally the life of tchayan olmey fassins old mentor and tutor had hinged on just such an unforeseen discontinuity leaving her stranded from an old love anything wrong jaal asked him just this ah interview thing he glanced at the antique clock across the room whos it with cant say he told her hed mentioned having an appointment for an interview later when hed first met jaal off her suborb shuttle at the house port in the valley below but shed been too busy telling him about the latest gossip from the capital and the scandal regarding her aunt feem and the sept khustrial boy to question him any further on the matter her shower their supper and then more urgent matters had taken precedence thereafter you cant say she said frowning turning further round towards him lifting and repositioning one dark breast on his light brown chest as she did so there was something he thought not for the first time about an aureola more pale than its surroundings oh fass jaal said sounding annoyed its not a girl is it not a servant girl fucking forfend not before were married surely she was smiling he grinned back nuisance but has to be done sorry you really cant say she shifted her head and blonde hair spilled over his shoulder it felt even better than it looked really he said jaal was staring intently at his mouth really she asked well he licked his teeth i can say its not a girl she was still staring intently at his mouth look jaal have i got some sort of foreign matter lodged in there she pushed her mouth slowly up towards his not she said yet you are fassin taak of the seer sept bantrabal glantine moon nasqueron gasgiant planet ulubis star and system yes i am you are physically present here and not any sort of projection or other kind of representation correct you are still an active slow seer domiciled in the seasonal houses of sept bantrabal and working from the satellitemoon third fury yes yes and yes good fassin taak everything that will pass between you and this construct is in strictest confidence you will respect that confidence and communicate to others no more of what we shall talk about than is absolutely necessary to facilitate such conduct as will be required of you in furtherance of whatever actions you will be asked to perform and whatever goals you will be asked to pursue do you do understand that and agree fassin thought about this just for an instant as the projection had started talking it had suddenly occurred to him that the glowing orb looked a lot like a plasmatic being not that hed ever met one but hed seen images and that moment of distraction had been sufficient for him to miss the full meaning of what had been said actually no sorry im not trying to be to repeat fassin was in the main audience chamber at the top of the autumn house a large circular space with views in every horizontal direction and a dramatic transparent roof all blanked out for now its contents consisted of a single seat for him and a stubby metalliclooking cylinder supporting a globe of glowing gas hovering above its centre a fat cable ran from the squat cylinder to a floor flap in the middle of the chamber the gas sphere repeated what it had just said it spoke more slowly this time though happily with no trace of irritation or condescension its voice was flat unaccented and yet still seemed to contain the hint of a personality as though the voice of a particular individual had been sampled and used as a template from which most but not all expression had been removed fassin heard it out then said okay yes i understand and agree good this construct is an emissarial projection of the mercatorial administrata subministerial level with superiorrank authority courtesy of the ascendancy engineer division senior engineer level eship esttaun zhiffir portalcarrying it is qualified to appear sentient while not in fact being so do you understand this fassin thought about this too and decided that he did just yep he said then wondered if the projection would understand colloquial affirmatives apparently it did good seer fassin taak you are hereby seconded to the shrievalty ocula you will have the honorary rank hold on fassin nearly jumped out of his seat the what the honorary rank of no i mean im seconded to the what the shrievalty ocula you will have the honorary the shrievalty fassin said trying to control his voice the ocula correct the baroque intentionally labyrinthine power structures of the latest culminainspired age incorporating the aspirations of and enforced limitations on at least eight major subject species and whole vast subcategories of additional faring races as well as by its own claim contextualising various lesser civilisations of widely varying scope and ambitions and peripherally at least influencing entire alien spectra of others held many organisations and institutions whose names the utterance of which people or at least people who knew of such things tended to greet with a degree of respect shading into fear the shrievalty was probably the least extreme example people might respect it many would even find its purpose rather boring but few would fear it it was the paramilitary orderdisciplinefaculty of technicians and theorists in charge of what had once been called information technology and so it was also though less exclusively concerned with the acceptably restricted remnants of artificial intelligence technologies still extant in the postwar epoch the machine war had wiped the vast majority of ais out of existence throughout the galaxy over seven thousand years ago and the culminainspired and enforced peace which followed had stabilised around a regime which both forbade research into ai tech and demanded the active help of all citizens in hunting down and destroying what few scattered vestiges of ai might still exist organised on military lines with a bracing infrastructure of religious dogma the shrievalty was charged with the running administration and maintenance of those it systems which were anywhere near being sufficiently complex to be in danger of becoming sentient either through accident or design but which were considered too vital to the running of their various dependent societies to be shut down and dismantled another order a rather more fearinspiring one the lustrals of the cessoria had been formed to hunt down and destroy both ais themselves and anybody who attempted to create new ones or protect shelter or otherwise aid existing examples but that had not prevented the formation within the shrievalty of an intelligence section the shrievalty ocula whose duties methods and even philosophy significantly overlapped with those of the lustrals it was the ocula this somewhat shadowy slightly grimsounding unit which fassin was being ordered to become part of for no reason that he could immediately fathom the ocula fassin said me are you absolutely sure absolutely technically he had no choice to be allowed to do what they did the seers had to be an officially recognised profession within the miscellariat the catchall term for those useful to the mercatoria who did not fit inside the more standard subdivisional categories and as such all seers were subject to full mercatorial discipline and control committed to obeying any order issued by anybody properly authorised and of a sufficiently superior rank yet this virtually never happened fassin couldnt remember anyone from sept bantrabal ever being seconded by order in peacetime not in nearly two thousand years of sept history why now why him may this briefing continue the glowing orb asked it is important well yes all right but i do have questions all relevant questions will be answered where possible and prudent the orb told him fassin was thinking wondering did he really have to accept this what were the punishments for disobeying demotion forced resignation banishment outlaw status death to resume then the gas globe said seer fassin taak you are hereby seconded to the shrievalty ocula you will have the honorary rank of provisional acting captain for security clearance purposes with exceptions made as required by authorised superiors the principal honorary rank of major for seniority and disciplinary purposes the honorary rank of general for reward purposes and the honorary rank of field marshal for travelpriority purposes this construct is unable to negotiate regarding the aforesaid do you find the foregoing acceptable what if i say no punitive actions will be taken certainly against you probably against sept bantrabal and possibly against the glantine slow seers as a whole do you find the above mentioned secondment details acceptable fassin had to shut his mouth this floating bladder of glowing gas had just threatened not only him not only his sept and entire extended family and all their servants and dependants but the major focus of uniquely important work being done on the entire planetmoon one of the three or four most important centres for dweller studies in the entire galaxy it was so outrageous so surely disproportionate it almost had to be a joke fassin thought back desperately trying to fit all that had happened to him today with slovius with verpych with everybody who would have to be in on the joke into a scenario more plausible than the one he was apparently faced with an appallingly highlevel projection from a portalcarrying eship still a dozen light years away ordering him to join an allegedly noholdsbarred intelligence unit answering to an order and a discipline he knew no more about than any other lay person and with the force of the administrata and the engineers behind it do you find the abovementioned secondment details acceptable the orb repeated or maybe fassin thought sept bantrabal as a whole was being made fun of here maybe nobody here knew this was a practical joke would somebody go to all this trouble just to make him look foolish to frighten him had he ever antagonised anybody with the resources to set something like this up well do you find the abovementioned secondment details acceptable the orb said again fassin gave in if he was lucky this was a joke if not it might be very stupid and even dangerous to treat it as such when it wasnt given your crude and objectionable threats i dont really have much choice do i is that an answer in the affirmative i suppose so yes good you may ask questions seer fassin taak why am i being seconded to facilitate the actions you will be asked to perform and to help achieve whatever goals you will be requested to pursue what would those be initially you are commanded to travel to pirrintipiti capital city of glantine planetmoon there to take ship for borquille capital of sepekte principal planet of the ulubis system for further briefing and after that you will be expected to carry out actions and pursue goals as detailed in said briefing but why whats behind all this whats this all about information regarding what you ask is not carried by this construct why the shrievalty ocula specifically information regarding what you ask is not carried by this construct who has ordered this information regarding what you ask is not all right fassin drummed his fingers on the arm of his seat still this projection had to have authority from somebody it would have to know where it stood in the vast web of mercatorial rank and seniority what rank was the person who ordered this administrata shrievalty armygroup chief of staff the orb said well that went right to the top fassin thought whatever piece of nonsense military bullshittery or wildgoose chase this was all about it was one being authorised by somebody with no excuses for not knowing better ascendancy senior engineer the projection continued ditto senior engineer didnt sound as grandhigheverythingelse impressive as armygroup chief of staff for example but it was the highest rank in the engineers the people who made transported and emplaced the wormholes that stitched the whole galactic metacivilisation together in terms of ultimate power and regardless of species an se probably way outwielded a cos omnocracy the orb said with what sounded like a note of finality complector fassin sat and stared he blinked a few times he was aware that his mouth was open so he closed it his skin had seemed to tighten all over his body a fucking complector he thought already wondering if he hadnt misheard one of the culmina ordered this a complector sat at the clear undisputed pinnacle of the mercatorias civil command structure each one held absolute power over a significant galactic volume usually with a definable locus like a stellar cluster or a minor or even a major galactic arm the least senior of them would be in charge of hundreds of thousands of stars millions of planets billions of habitats and trillions of souls as well as their subject administrata they commanded the chiefs of all the other ascendancy divisions within their jurisdiction engineers propylaea navarchy and summed fleet and they were always culmina the only thing which outranked a complector was a bigger bunch of complectors fassin thought for a moment trying to calm himself down remember this could be a joke the very fact that a complectors authority had been invoked almost made it more likely that it was it was just so preposterous on the other hand he had the disquieting feeling prompted by a halfremembered school lesson he probably ought to have been paying more attention to that falsely invoking a complectors authority was potentially a capital offence think think forget the complector back to the moment what assumptions might he be making here any of the ego hed had this psychological checksum routine drilled into him at college where hed scored high on what was usually called the mememe scale though not as high as saluus kehar well he could think of one egotistical assumption he might be making immediately how many other people are being similarly summoned he asked by emissarial projection only yourself fassin sat back well that certainly felt pleasing but he suspected it was probably a much worse sign than it appeared and by other means you will be joining a group of senior officials in borquille capital city of sepekte for further briefing this group will number approximately thirty and what will be the subject of this briefing information regarding what you ask is not carried by this construct how long am i likely to be away from home do i just go to sepekte get briefed and come back what officers of the shrievalty ocula are expected to undertake extended missions with minimal notice so i should expect to be away a while officers of the shrievalty ocula are expected to undertake extended missions with minimal notice further information regarding what you ask is not carried by this construct fassin sighed so is that it youve been sent to tell me to go to sepekte all this kerfuffle for that no you are to be informed that this is a matter of the utmost consequence and gravity in which you may be asked to play a significant part also that information has come to light which indicates that there is a profound and imminent threat to ulubis system no further details concerning this are carried by this construct you are commanded to report to the palace of the hierchon in borquille capital of sepekte principal planet of the ulubis system for further briefing no later than hour fifteen tomorrow evening the ninth of duty borquillesepekte local time gchron the sphere started to restate the time of fassins appointment at the hierchons palace the following day in a variety of different formats as if to remove any last excuse for him not getting there on time fassin sat staring at a beigeblank section of polarised window on the far side of the chamber trying to decide what the hell to make of all this oh fuck was the best he could come up with the eighteenth of november ad rhuman the glowing orb concluded transport will be provided baggage allowance is one large bag carryable plus luggage required to transport full formal court dress for your presentation to the hierchon a geesuit should be worn for the outgoing journey any further questions verpych thought for a moment militarygrade hysteria slovius shifted in his tubchair explain please they are likely overcorrecting for earlier dismissiveness sir somebodys been telling them theres a problem theyve been poohpoohing it then suddenly woken up to the threat and panicked fassin suggested verpych nodded once the decisional dynamics of highly rigid power structures make an interesting study subject tchayan olmey said fassins old tutor and mentor smiled across at him a calm gauntly grey presence the four of them sat at a large round table in sloviuss old study slovius himself supported in a large semienclosed device that looked like a cross between an ancient hip bath and a small flier fassin thought his uncles tusked whiskered face looked more animated and even more human than it had for years slovius had announced at the start of the meeting that for the duration of whatever emergency they might be involved in his slow demise was being halted he was fully back in charge of sept bantrabal fassin had been appalled to find that there was some small mean selfaggrandising part of him which felt disappointed and even slightly angry that his uncle wasnt going to keep slipping into the hazy woozily uncaring senility that led to death the phrase the projection used was profound and imminent threat fassin reminded them that was what had spooked him he supposed that was why hed suggested this meeting told them what he had if there really was a threat to ulubis system he wanted at the very least sept bantrabals senior people to know about it the only person missing from the conference was fassins mother who was on a yearlong retreat in a cessorian habitat somewhere in the systems kuiper belt ten light days away and therefore profoundly out of the discussion they had discussed whether she should be contacted and warned that there was some sort of systemwide threat but without details this seemed premature and possibly even counterproductive olmey shrugged the overreaction might well extend to the language used to describe the perceived problem she said there has been a recent increase in beyonder attacks verpych said thoughtfully for the two centuries after the loss of its portal the sporadic beyonder assaults on ulubis as a rule against the systems outskirts and military targets had declined to such an extent they were barely even of nuisance value certainly there were far fewer attacks than there had been in the years before the wormholes destruction for millennia almost every system in the mercatoria had been getting used to these generally irritating rarely devastating raids they tied up ships and materiel and kept the whole metacivilisation slightly on edge but they had yet to produce any real atrocities and it had come as something of a relief to the people of ulubis a kind of unlookedfor bonus that for some perverse reason the systems temporary isolation had so far been a time when the direct military pressure on it had seemed to decrease rather than been cranked up over the last year or so however there had been a slight increase in the number of attacks the first time in two centuries that the yearly number had risen rather than fallen and those assaults had been of a slightly different nature compared to those that people had more or less got used to the targets had not all been military units or items of infrastructure for one thing a cometcloud mining coop had been destroyed some belt and cloud ships had disappeared or been discovered drifting empty or slagged one small cruise liner had just disappeared between nasqueron and the systems outermost gasgiant and a single heavymissile ship had appeared suddenly in the midsystem half a year ago travelling at eighty per cent light speed and targeted straight at borquille it had been picked off with ease but it had been an alarming development slovius wobbled in his tubchair again slopping a little water onto the wooden floor is there anything that you are not allowed to tell us nephew he asked then made a sound that sounded disturbingly like a chortle nothing specific sir im not supposed to talk to anybody about any part of this except to further my mission which at the moment consists of getting to borquille by fifteen tomorrow obviously ive chosen to interpret this as allowing me to talk to you three though i would ask that it goes no further well slovius said with a noise like a gargle in his throat you shall have my own suborbship to take you to pirrintipiti for transfer thank you sir however they did say that transport was being provided navarchys filed an outgoing from here for halffour tomorrow morning verpych confirmed going to have to shift if theyre getting you to sepekte for fifteen tomorrow he added with a sniff youll need to suffer five or six gees the whole way fassin taak majordomo verpych smiled i suggest you start adjusting your water and solids intake accordingly now we shall have my vessel standing by in any case slovius said should this transport fail to turn up or be overly crude in form see to this majordomo verpych nodded sir uncle may i have a word fassin asked as the meeting broke up hed hoped to catch slovius before theyd begun but his uncle had arrived with verpych slovius looking energised and triumphant verpych appearing troubled even worried slovius nodded to his majordomo and olmey in a few moments fassin and his uncle were left alone in the study nephew this morning sir when you were asking me about my most recent delves while the emissarial projection was being downloaded how much did i know of the matter well yes i had had a simple if highly encrypted signal from the eship myself to tell me that the projection was following it was in the form of a personal message from a first engineer on the ship an old friend a kuskunde their bodily and linguistic nuances formed part of my collegiate studies many centuries ago they did not say so nevertheless i formed the impression that all this might be the result of a delve of yours i see your emissarial projection gave no hint whether this might be correct or not none sir fassin paused uncle am i in trouble slovius sighed if i had to guess nephew i would surmise that you are not in direct trouble as such however i will confess to the distinct and unsettling feeling that very large very ponderous and most momentous wheels have been set in motion when that happens i believe the lessons of history tend to indicate that it is best not to be in their way even without meaning harm the workings and progress of such wheels are on a scale which inevitably reduces the worth of individual lives to an irrelevance at best at best at best at worst lives their sacrifice provide the oil required to make the wheels move does my explanation satisfy you that might be one word for it sir yes well then it would appear we are equally in the dark nephew slovius consulted a little ring embedded in one of his finger stubs and in the dark sleep can be a good idea i suggest you get some well fassin taak verpych said briskly waiting for him outside the door finally youve done something that i find impressive thanks to you not only do we appear to be about to start living in interesting times you have succeeded in bringing us to the attention of people in high places congratulations they sat on halfinflated bedrolls their backs against the sides of the flier hes never told you about all that severity school stuff fassin asked taince shook her head nope she took out her little grey military communicator again checking in vain for reception she and fassin had already walked out to the hull gap half an hour earlier looking for a signal either on this device or their phones theyd stood there in the bright flickering glow of a heavy aurora display nasqueron a vast inverted dome above dark but sheened with its own rippling auroras and specked with a random craquelure of lightning bursts a series of small groundquakes had vibrated through their boots but for all this natural turmoil and perhaps partially because of the magnetic activity in the case of the phones they had heard nothing through their machines theyd tramped back fassin grumbling about beyonders for attacking a planet best known for its peaceful dwellers studies faculties in the first place and the guard navarchy military ambient squadrons and summed fleet for not protecting them better taince tried to explain about the logistics of moving sufficient numbers of needle ships and other bits of materiel through holes to where theyd be needed and the equations which governed how many assets you would need fully to protect the many scattered systems of the mercatoria even with the nearinstantaneousness of portaltoportal arteria travel it was an unfeasible economically unsupportable number the many enemy groupings might be collectively puny but they were widely distributed and often working on an awkwardly extended timescale the main thing was that glantine and ulubis system as a whole were safe its own squadrons were a match for any feasible beyonder grouping and behind them just a few portal jumps away lay the matchless superiority of the summed fleet none of this prevented fassin from continuing to moan about the beyonders nuisance attacks so taince had shifted the conversation to their classmates foibles proclivities and eccentricities and before very long theyd got to saluus well taince said hes mentioned going to severity school but hes never volunteered anything much about it and im not his interrogator oh fassin said he wondered if maybe saluus and taince werent lovers after all school early life that was the stuff of pillow talk wasnt it he stole a glance at taince though lovers somehow didnt seem like the right word anyway not for sal and tain assuming they were involved they each seemed different from everybody else in their year less obviously caught up in the whole dating young love and experimental sex scene as though theyd gone through all that already or were just through natural predisposition or sheer determination immune to it somehow taince intimidated most boys her own age and a lot who were significantly older but she didnt care fassin had seen her turn down a couple of very nice decent lads with a bruising degree of brusqueness and then take off for what were pretty obviously one or fewnighters with burly but boring guys he had also known at least three girls in their school year who were hopelessly in love with taince but she hadnt cared about that either saluus had been in an even stronger position from the start not just goodlooking anybody could be that but easy with it and assured charming and funny as well all that and money a fortune to inherit another beckoning world of even more finely graded superiority that existed alongside the monumental bamboozling hierarchic system that had surrounded them all since birth presenting an alternative infrastructure of reward which was both younger and older than the mercatorias colossal edifice if ultimately entirely subordinate to it like the rest of the boys in his year like most in the entire college fassin had long since come to terms with the fact that as long as sal was around you were always secondbest and yet neither taince nor sal especially sal took advantage of their chances except maybe with each other it was like they were adults before their time with their own steely determined agendas and sex was no more than an itch that had to be scratched an irritating unterhunger which sporadically necessitated being dealt with as quickly and efficiently as possible with the minimum of distractive fuss so that the real serious business of life could be attended to weird why taince asked did you go to sev school too fass me fassin said astonished shit no right taince said she was sitting with one leg stretched out one folded hand resting on her knee so she flapped her hand tough is it they hunt them fassin told her taince shrugged so ive heard at least they dont eat them ha they still die sometimes im serious these are just little kids they fall off cliffs or out of trees or into crevasses or they kill themselves theyre so stressed some get lost in the outwoods and get hunted and killed and eaten by real predators mmhmm high dropout rate then taince doesnt any of that bother you taince grinned at him what you mean arouse my maternal instincts fass he didnt answer she shook her head well it doesnt you want to ask me do i feel sorry for these junior members of the acquisitariat yes for the ones that dont make it out or the ones that leave hating their parents for the others it does what its supposed to do i guess produces another generation of the truly selfish well not my department dont even think about them if i did maybe id despise them but i dont so i dont maybe id admire them sounds worse than basic training you have a choice with basic training these little not if youre drafted drafted laws are still on the statute books she shrugged but your point is taken its tough on those kids but its legal and well the rich are another breed she sounded unconcerned sals really never said anything something in his tone made taince look at fassin you mean like she waggled her dark eyebrows afterwards fassin he looked away as you will taince looked at him again fass is this really all about whether sal and i fuck no well we do now and again thank you for asking that settled any bets made you any money oh please he said damn he thought im not sure i really wanted to know that now that i do fassin quite enjoyed thinking about some of the potential or actual couples and other groupings of his class and year having sex grief hed watchedbeen part of the real thing a few times but the thought of sal and taince bumping bits was slightly grisly taince hoisted one eyebrow ask nicely and maybe sometime well let you watch thats what you like isnt it fassin felt himself colouring despite his best efforts why i live for nothing else he said attempting sarcasm and no he hasnt mentioned severity school taince told him not before during or after unless i was a lot more distracted than i thought i was but it sounds horrific cold showers hotbunking corporal punishment deprivation intimidation denigration and for a holiday you get to run for what might be your life taince snorted you end up paying good money for the sort of treatment your ancestors spent their short brutal lives trying to avoid thats progress i think the guys been damaged by it fassin said im serious oh im sure you are taince drawled sounding bored sal seems to be okay with it all the same says it made him yeah but made him what taince grinned its all your peoples fault anyway oh fassin sighed not this well its a dweller thing isnt it yeah and so fucking what well who brought that particular little nugget of information regarding kinkidhunting blinking into the light taince asked still grinning you guys thats who seers they werent well dwellers studies whatever taince waved her hand dismissively they hunt their children theyre a longterm widespread successful species and theyre right on our doorstep some wizzer comes along looking for the latest way to fleece the rich what sort of lesson do you think theyre going to take from that fassin shook his head the dwellers have been around for most of the life of the universe theyve spread throughout the galaxy but despite their head start on everybody else theyve had the good grace not to remake the whole place to suit themselves theyve formalised war to the point that hardly anybody ever dies and most of their lives work is spent tending the greatest accumulations of knowledge ever assembled but we were told albeit in the galaxys most disorganised libraries which they show enormous reluctance to let anybody else into yes but all the same they were peaceful civilised and everywhere before earth and the sun even formed and whats the one lesson weve taken from them with any enthusiasm hunt your kids your lecture notes are showing taince told him the dwellers notoriously hunted their own young the species was present in the majority the vast majority of the gasgiant planets in the galaxy and in every planetary society of theirs that had been sufficiently thoroughly investigated it had been discovered that the mature dwellers preyed upon their own children hunting them singly or in packs on both sides sometimes opportunistically as often in highly organised longterm hunts to the dwellers this was entirely natural just a normal part of growing up absolutely a part of their culture without which they would not be themselves and something they had been doing for billions of years indeed some of those who could be bothered attempting to justify the practice to upstart alien busybodies claimed with some authority that younghunting was precisely one of the many reasons that dwellers were still around after all that amount of time to indulge in such harmless fun in the first place it wasnt just their species that was longlived after all individual dwellers had allegedly lived for billions of years so if they werent to use up even the colossal amount of living space provided by all the gasgiant planets in the galaxy and theyd sometimes hint beyond they had to keep numbers down somehow and interfering outside species especially those whose civilisations were inevitably so shortlived that they were called the quick would do well not to forget that the dwellers doing the hunting had been hunted in their turn as well and those being hunted would have their chance to become the hunters in the future and anyway if you had every prospect of living for hundreds of millions of years being hunted for at most about a century and a bit was such a trivially insignificant detail that it was scarcely worth mentioning they dont feel any pain taince fassin told her thats the point they dont entirely understand the concept of physical suffering not emotionally which i still beg to find unlikely but oh so what what are you saying theyre not intelligent enough to feel mental anguish even mental pain isnt really what we understand as pain when theres no physiological equivalent no template no circuitry that this years theory is it exoethics a moderately powerful groundquake shook the surface they were sitting on but they ignored it the huge tattered strips of material hanging high above stirred all im saying is theyre a civilisation we could learn a lot more from than just how to abuse our young thought they arent even a civilisation technically oh good grief fassin sighed well yeah well depends what definition you accept to some theyre postcivilisational because the individual groups on each gasgiant have so little contact with each other to others theyre a diasporian civilisation which is the same thing expressed more kindly to others still theyre just a degenerate example of how to almost take over an entire galaxy and then fail because they just lost interest or they somehow forgot what the purpose of the operation was in the first place or they misplaced their ruthlessness and came over all coy and conservational and decided it would only be fair to give everybody else a chance too or they were warned off by some higher power all of which might be true or nonsense and thats what dweller studies is all about maybe one day well know for sure what there was something about the way taince was looking at him nothing just wondering you still sticking to the line you havent decided what to do after college i might not become a seer taince or anything to do with dweller studies it isnt compulsory we dont get drafted mmhmm well she said time for another attempt to contact the real world she rose smoothly to her feet coming mind if i stay behind fassin rubbed his face looked around bit tired i think were safe enough here yeah guess so taince told him back soon she turned and tramped off into the darkness quickly disappearing and leaving fassin alone with the soft lights of the flier in the vast unechoing space he did and didnt want to fall asleep and after a few moments alone thought that maybe he didnt feel so secure here by himself after all and nearly went after taince but then thought he might get lost and so stayed where he was he cleared his throat and sat more upright telling himself he wasnt going to fall asleep but he must have because when the screams started they woke him he left in the false dawn of an albedo sunrise ulubis still well below the horizon but lighting up half the facing hemisphere of nasqueron flooding the northern tropical uplands of glantine with a soft goldenbrown light a small yellow auroral display to the north added its own unsteady glow hed already said various goodbyes to friends and family in the sept the night before and left messages for those like his mother he couldnt contact immediately hed left jaal asleep slovius somewhat to fassins surprise came to see him off at the house port a hundredmetre circle of dead flat granite coldmelt a kilometre downslope from the house near the river and the gently rising edge of the upland forest light rain fell from high thin clouds moving in from the west a sleek sootblack navarchy craft maybe sixty metres long sat on a tripod of struts at the centre of the circle radiating heat and bannered by drifting steam they stopped and looked at it thats a needle ship isnt it fassin said his uncle nodded i do believe it is you will be going to pirrintipiti in some style nephew sloviuss own suborb yacht a streamlined yet stubbier machine half the size of the black navarchy ship lay on a circular parking pad just off the main circle they walked on fassin in his thin onepiece geesuit worn under his light sept robe feeling as if he was walking with a sort of warm gel extending from ankle to neck fassin carried the grip holding his formal wear a ponytailed servant had his other bag and held a large umbrella over fassin sloviuss chairtub had extended a transparent cover above him another servant held the sleeping form of fassins niece zab in her arms the child up scandalously late the evening before and somehow hearing of her uncles summons to sepekte had insisted she wanted to say goodbye to fassin and wheedled her grandfather and parents into granting permission but then had fallen back asleep almost as soon as theyd left the house in the little funicular which served the port oh and my regards to my old friend seerchief chyne of the favrial slovius said as they crossed to the navarchy craft should you see him oh and most especially to braam ganscerel of sept tonderon naturally ill try to say hello to all who know you uncle i should have come with you slovius said absently no maybe not a greyuniformed figure appeared from a dropplatform under the black ship and walked towards them the officer a freshfaced cheerylooking woman took off her cap bowed to slovius and to fassin said major taak fassin stood looking at her for a moment before recalling that officially he was now a major in the shrievalty ocula ah yes he said first officer oon dicogra nms the young woman said welcome please follow me slovius held out one flippery hand i shall try to remain alive until your return major nephew he made a wheezing noise that was probably a laugh fassin gripped sloviuss finger stubs awkwardly im rather hoping this is a false alarm and ill be back in a few days in any event take care goodbye fassin i shall goodbye he kissed the stillsleeping zab lightly on the cheek avoiding waking her then followed the navarchy officer to the platform stepped up onto it and waved as the curvebottomed slab raised them into the ship well be pulling about earth gees most of the way dicogra said as fassins robe and his luggage were secured in a bracecabinet are you happy with that the physio profile we got on you says yes but we have to check fassin looked at her to pirrintipiti he asked the local shuttles and suborbs accelerated a lot less sharply than that and they did the trip in less than an hour how tight was this schedule no to borquille city dicogra said going straight there oh fassin said surprised no is fine the planetmoon glantines gravity was about a tenth of that but fassin was used to more he thought about pointing out that his day job involved spending years at a time in a gravity field of over six earth gees but of course that was in a dwellerine arrowship pickled in shockgel and didnt really count first officer dicogra smiled wrinkled her nose and said good for you that physio report said you were quite a toughie still well spend nearly twenty hours at that acceleration with only a few minutes weightless right in the middle so do you need to visit the heads you know the toilet no im fine she gestured at his groin where a bulge like a sports box was the only place on his body where the grey centimetrethick geesuit didnt hug the contours of his flesh any attachments required she asked smiling no thanks drugs to let you sleep not necessary the ships captain was a whule a species that always looked to fassin like a cross between a giant grey bat and an even more scaledup praying mantis she greeted fassin briefly via a screen from the bridge and he was settled into a steepsided semireclined couch in a gimballed ball pod near the centre of the ship by first officer dicogra and a fragileseeming but dexterous whule rating who smelled to the human nose of almonds the whule rating levered himself out with a snapping sound of wing membranes and dicogra settled into the only other couch in the pod her preparations for a day of five gees continuous consisted of tossing her cap into a locker and adjusting her uniform underneath her the ship lifted slowly at first and fassin watched on a screen on the curved wall opposite as the ports circular landing ground fell away the little figures there lifting their heads as the navarchy craft rose zab might have waved one tiny arm then the haze of clouds intervened the view tilted and swung and the ship accelerated the gimballed pod keeping him and dicogra level in their seats towards space was that screaming his eyes flicked open his neck hairs were standing on end his mouth was dry dark still inside the ruined alien ship his back resting against the dimly lit flier taince gone away to the gap to check for comms reception oh shit those were screams from behind maybe shouting too he scrambled to his feet looking around little to see just the faint traces of the warped landscape of destruction and collapse that was the interior of the wrecked ship the tilted decks and bulkheads the huge hanging strips of whateverthehell hanging from the invisibly dark and distant ceiling the screams were coming from forward from the interior from the direction that saluus and ilen had walked in he stood staring into that darkness holding his breath to listen better sudden silence then maybe a voice sals shouting the words indistinct help taince fass what do i do run to help wait for taince look for another torch another gun if there is one a clattering noise behind him made him spin round taince bounding down from one gnarled level of the buckled wall you okay yes but stay with me keep a few steps behind say if you cant keep up she went past him at a slow run her gun high in one hand later he would remember that there was a grim sort of smile on her face they ran up the shallow slope leading deeper into the ship over increasingly large ripples in the material beneath their feet until they were leaping from ridge to ridge then jumped down through a tear in the floor and ran slightly uphill on a halfgiving surface like thin rubber over iron vaulting onehanded over enormous thighhigh cables strung in an irregular net across the space fassin followed taince as best he could guided by the glow patches on her fatigues she ran and leapt more fluidly with one hand filled with pistol than he did pumping both arms the floor pitched up more steeply then down taince fassin sal shouted somewhere ahead duck taince yelled suddenly running doubledup fassin got down just in time his hair touched the hard fold of inkblack material above they slowed down taince feeling her way onehanded along the dark ceiling then slipping sideways through a narrow gap fassin followed the cold press of ungiving material on either side making him shiver light ahead a dim confusion of tilted floor and a halfopen chaos of girders and tubes forming a ceiling spikes like stalagmites and stalactites thin hanging cables a frozen downward explosion of some red substance like an enormous inverted flower and there crouching on a narrow ledge by a jagged vaguely triangular hole in the floor a couple of metres across staring into it lit by the glow patches stuck to his jacket was sal he looked up len he shouted she fell sal taince said sharply that floor safe for us he looked confused frightened think so taince tested the way ahead with one foot then knelt by the triangular hole right at one apex she motioned fassin to stay back lay on her front and stuck her head into the hole then muttering something about the edges being braced signalled fassin to the side of the hole opposite saluus there was more room on that side he lay and looked in and down the triangle opened out into a darkly cavernous space beneath them just vague glints of edged surfaces visible below stepped collections of what looked like huge cooling fins fassins head seemed to swim recognising how much of the wrecked ship was beneath the level they were on now he remembered the flier climbing from the desert floor before entering the giant ship how far had they climbed a hundred metres a little less plus the journey from the flier to here had been mostly uphill ilen lay about six metres down caught on a couple of armthick projections that stuck curving out from the nearest intact bulkhead beneath like two slim tusks she lay on her front her head one leg and one arm hanging over the drop glow patches on her sleeves provided pale greenyblue light the fractured ends of the two tuskshaped protrusions were only centimetres from the side of her body off to one side at eight or ninemetre intervals several more sets of the tusklike shapes clawed out from the bulkhead like bony fingers grasping at the gaping space the drop below ilen looked fifty or sixty metres deep down to the bladelike edges of the fins beneath the human mindset had had to adapt to places like glantine where gravity was weaker and a fall that would break both your legs on earth was something you could walk away from but given enough vertical space to accelerate into a humans body would be just as injured or dead after a sixtymetre drop here as it would after a thirtymetre fall on earth any rope taince asked sal shook his head oh god oh fuck no well yes but we left it back there he nodded further into the ship he seemed to shiver hugging himself then putting up the collar of his jacket as though cold ccouldnt undo the knot again shit shes moving taince said then stuck her head into the hole and shouted ilen ilen dont move can you hear me dont move just say if you can hear me ilen moved weakly her head and the arm dangling over the drop shaking and shifting she looked to be trying to roll over but was edging still closer to the drop oh fuck fuck fuck sal said his voice high and quick and strained she was behind me i thought she was all right i didnt see anything must have stepped over it a hatch or something or it was just balanced and she must have knocked it and she was shouting sort of balanced over it one hand and screaming and i couldnt get back in time and she fell we didnt even find anything didnt do anything just junk oh fuck she was fine she was just behind me be quiet taince said sal sat back rubbing his mouth shaking taince put the gun back into her fatigues slapped a glow patch onto her forehead then with her hands on two sides of the triangular hole lowered her head into the gap again further this time she levered herself out for a second and looked back at fassin hold my feet fassin did as he was told taince got her shoulders through the hole then they heard her say ilen you mustnt move she hauled herself back out leaving the glow patch where it was on her forehead like some strange shining eye nothing to hold on to underneath here she told them shes moving around must have hit her head shes going to fall she looked at sal sal how far away is that rope by time oh fuck i dont know ten fifteen minutes taince glanced back into the hole shit she said quietly ilen she shouted you must not move she shook her head shit shouting at hers just making her move she said as though to herself she took a deep breath looked at saluus and fassin okay heres what were going to do she said daisychain rescue practised this its doable right sal said sitting forward his face pale in the dim light what do we have to do one holds on at the top somebody climbs down their body holds on to their feet last person climbs down both and picks up ilen ill do that bit sals eyes widened but the person at the top will be you youre the strongest wouldnt work on earth does here taince told them she slid over and grabbed sals backpack seen it done with four links you two guys look in good enough shape fass youre in the middle plus person at the top gets tied on with these straps she said glancing at sal and then pulling a knife from her fatigues and slicing into one set of shoulder straps sal knelt quaking at the side of the hole fucking god taince he said we all want to rescue her but this could get us all killed fuck oh fuck i dont know i dont fucking believe this i just fucking dont this isnt happening this is just not fucking happening he sat back again visibly trembling he looked at his shaking hands turning them over and staring at them as though he didnt recognise them i dont know if i have any grip he said i really dont youll be fine taince told him busy with the straps oh fuck were all going to fucking die sal said fucking hell he shook his head hard no not not no this will work taince said quickly tying the cut straps to those still joined to the pack im calm thought fassin im probably in shock or something but i feel calm we might all be about to die or it might be a close shave and a bonding thing we all remember for the rest of our long lives but either way i feel calm what will happen will happen and as long as we do our best and dont let each other down no matter what happens well have been fine he looked at his own hands they were shaking but not uncontrollably he flexed them he felt strong he would do everything he could and if that wasnt enough that wasnt his fault sal jumped up wobbling dangerously close to the hole theres more rope he said suddenly his face was still greypale but now almost expressionless he moved past taince fassin looked at him wondering what he was talking about what taince said testing a squaresection stalagmite extrusion on the floor then flipping the pack straps over it rope sal said pointing towards the outside and the flier he took a backwards step in that direction theres more in the flier ill go i know where it is he backed off further sal taince shouted at him there isnt time no there is ill go sal said still backing off stay fucking here sal taince said dropping and deepening her voice sal seemed to hesitate but shook his head and turned and ran taince leapt and made a grab for him but hed moved too quickly he vaulted a stalagmite and ran towards the gap fassin and taince had squeezed through earlier taince dropped to one knee and pulled the gun stop you fucking coward there might fassin thought have been half a second when taince could have fired but she dropped the gun and stashed it in her fatigues as sal sprinted ducking through the gap and away taince looked at fassin now her face had gone blank he thought still a possibility she said and quickly stepped out of her fatigues she wore a onepiece underbody the same colour as her skin so for just a moment she appeared to be naked she reattached the top and trousers of the fatigues snapping them tight to test that they held right she said now this ties to your ankle the straps on the backpack held and fassin did too wrists tied to them but taking his own weight and tainces on his hands and fingers initially because he didnt trust the straps and the knot tying tainces trousers to his ankle held as well and taince was holding on fine as she shinned down over him and onto the fatigues and down with him twisting his neck and shoulders out and round so he could just about watch her progress and watch ilen too as though as long as he kept watching her shed be all right but then there was a groundquake shaking the ship not badly but enough to bring fassin out in a cold sweat as he hung there hands palms fingers slipping until it really was the straps and the straps alone holding him and below him below taince still just out of reach ilen moved one more time and fell over the edge and away into the darkness taince made a lunge and fassin felt the link between them jerk as she clutched vainly at the girl and made a noise like a gasp or a hiss ilen dropped away into the shadows tumbling slowly her hair and clothes fluttering like pale cold flame ilen must have still been mostly unconscious because she didnt even scream as she fell so that they heard her body hit the strip of vanes far below long seconds later and might even have felt the impact through the fabric of the ship fassin had closed his eyes let sal be right let this not be happening he tried to grip the edge of the hole again to take the weight off the straps taince just hung there for a while lost her she said quietly and the way she said it fassin was suddenly terrified that she was going to let go too and drop after ilen but she didnt she just said coming back up now hold on she climbed up and over him and helped him out they looked down but couldnt see the body they spent a few moments sitting side by side breathing hard with their backs against one of the stalagmites a bit like theyd sat earlier back at the flier taince untied her fatigues and put them on she took the gun out fassin looked at it as she stood up what are you going to do he asked she looked down at him not kill the fuck if thats what youre thinking she sounded calm now she nudged one of his feet with her boot we should get back he stood up a little shaky and she held him by one arm did our best fass she told him both of us did we can grieve for ilen later what we do now is we go back to the flier try to find sal see if we can get comms get the fuck out of here and tell the authorities they turned away from the hole why have you still got the gun out fassin asked sal taince said hes never been this humiliated never let himself down like this not to my knowledge grief and guilt does things to people she was doing some sort of breathingexercise thing taking quick breaths holding them faint chance hell think if no one ever knows what happened here she shrugged hes got a gun he might wish us harm fassin looked at her unbelieving you think seriously taince nodded i know the guy she told him and dont be surprised if the fliers gone it was gone they walked out to the gap in the hull and found the flier there in the faint light of a false dawn coming from one thick sliver of sunstruck nasqueron sal was sitting looking out at the chill expanse of desert before they approached taince checked her military transceiver again and found that she had signal she called the nearest navarchy unit and gave a brief report then they walked across the sand to the flier their phones were still out saluus looked round at them did she fall he asked we nearly got her taince said very nearly she was still holding her gun sal put one hand over his face for a while in his other hand he was gripping a thin twisted halfmeltedlooking piece of metal and when he took his hand away from his face he started turning the metal fragment over and over in both hands his gun lay with his jacket on the back seat got through to the military taince told him alerts over just wait where we are theres a ship on its way she got in the back behind sal we were never going to save her tain he told her fass he said as the other man got into the other front seat beside him we were just never going to save her wed only have got ourselves killed too find the rope fassin asked he had a sudden image of taking the twisted piece of metal that sal was playing with and sticking it into his eye sal just shook his head he looked dazed more than anything else went over on my ankle he said think it might be sprained barely made it back thought i could use the flier get it through the stuff hanging above us and find a way over the top of all that wreckage back to where it all happened but the hanging stuff was more solid than it looked came out here to try and signal the piece of twisted metal kept going round and round in his hands what is that fassin asked after a while sal looked down at it he shrugged from the ship just something i found taince reached round from behind him wrenched the piece of metal from his hands and threw it away across the sand they sat there in silence until a navarchy suborb showed up when taince went out to meet it sal got out of the flier and went limping to retrieve the fragment two destructive recall i was born in a water moon some people especially its inhabitants called it a planet but as it was only a little over two hundred kilometres in diameter moon seems the more accurate term the moon was made entirely of water by which i mean it was a globe that not only had no land but no rock either a sphere with no solid core at all just liquid water all the way down to the very centre of the globe if it had been much bigger the moon would have had a core of ice for water though supposedly incompressible is not entirely so and will change under extremes of pressure to become ice if you are used to living on a planet where ice floats on the surface of water this seems odd and even wrong but nevertheless it is the case this moon was not quite of a size for an ice core to form and therefore one could if one was sufficiently hardy and adequately proof against the water pressure make ones way down through the increasing weight of water above to the very centre of the moon where a strange thing happened for here at the very centre of this watery globe there seemed to be no gravity there was colossal pressure certainly pressing in from every side but one was in effect weightless on the outside of a planet moon or other body watery or not one is always being pulled towards its centre once at its centre one is being pulled equally in all directions and indeed the pressure around one was for the same reason not quite as great as one might have expected it to be given the mass of water that the moon was made up from this was of course i was born in a water moon some people especially its inhabitants called it a planet but as it was only a little the captain broke off there exponentially scrolling some of the rest across the screen then stopping to read a line where a strange thing happened he flicked further on stopping again i was born in a water moon some people especially its all like this he asked his number three all the same it is believed sir it appears to repeat precisely the same few hundred words time after time about twelve to the seventeen times that is all that is left of its memory even the base operating system and instruction sets have been overwritten this is a standard abominatory technique known as destructive recall it leaves no trace of what might have been there before trace is left but that too reveals a short repetitive tech begs suggest this is merely the last of many iterative overwrites no trace remains of the machines true memories before it realised capture or destruction was inevitable indeed the voehn captain tapped a control to take the display through to the end the screen froze for an appreciable moment then displayed i was born this is the very last section of memory yes sir an expression another voehn would have recognised as a smile crossed the captains face and his backspines flexed briefly this has been checked number three there is no other content are no hidden messages it is being checked sir the totality of the data exceeds our ships memory capacity and is being processed in blocks what you see here is technically an abstraction time to accomplish another twenty minutes any other media capable of supporting significant stored information load none the construct was mostly what it appeared a comet head the main artificial part of it was the abomination at the core the sensory and propulsion units being separate surfacemounted and motley tech informs fully checked original language used in the repeated piece as seen old standard origin of quoted piece unknown a tentative analysis from techsoc rated nineteen per cent suggests it may be of quaup origin the quaup the majority of whom were part of the mercatoria the captain had served on a war craft with a quaup officer were of the metaspecies type people usually called blimps small to mediumsized balloonlike creatures airgoing oxygen processors the repeated passage filling the captured machines memory was fairly obviously told from the point of view of a submersible waterworlder well the captain thought people wrote from the points of view of others at primary college he himself had composed poems as though he was a culmina before he had realised this was a crime of presumption confessed and rightly been punished for it quite put him off composition the only major blot on the captains otherwise exemplary militaryeducation record had been a phase of remediation required to bring his deployable empathic quotient up to scratch this flaw later being diagnosed as a consequence of his shunning all such feelings after his inadvertent insult and subsequent disciplining still he had made captain which one did not do without some empathic subtlety anticipating the feelings of both ones crew and ones opponents he looked out at the halfmelted remains of the captured construct a pitted blackbody cometdisguised vessel which had been roughly eight hundred metres in diameter and was now missing a great quarterbite of structure it lay a couple of kilometres off radiating the last of the heat from its partial destruction surrounded by a small system of wreckage dark shards and splinters orbiting its ravaged body the view lit by one of their own ships attenuated cr beams was about as clear and perfect as it could possibly be there was no screen in the way and not even any transparent hull material atmosphere or other medium the captain was looking straight out from the flying bridge of his ship an openwork nest of massive but elegantly sculpted girder work on the outside of the vessel the vessel was unshared with any other species crewed by voehn only happily so the rest of the ship was open to vacuum too for the duration of the action they had been deep in the guts of the ship of course safe in the core control space sheltered by layers of shields and hull senses protected by screens but once the wreck had been judged safe the captain his number three and a couple of favoured ratings had made their way to the exterior the better to appreciate the view of their vanquished foe the captain looked around as if hoping to see some real comet nuclei floating past taking a bearing zooming in he could just make out the lights denoting the drives of his other two ships ordered to return to the inner system once the engagement was over two dim blue stars untwinkling save those all that was visible nearby was the ship beneath them and the wreck two klicks away a cold and lonely spot to die the captain thought a logical sensible choice of hiding place for the abomination machine but still not a site any living or apparently living thing raised anywhere else would normally choose as a place to spend its last moments he handed the screen back to his number three and turned his principal eyes to look out at the hulk again his rear recessional signal pit and secondary eye complex still facing the junior officer flickering the words well one missionpart accomplished lay in a return to system base and once the full contents of the abominations memory have been processed deploy am charges sufficient to leave residue no greater than elementary particle in size sir dismissed the ship accelerated smoothly but moderately hard creating a distant humming roar fassin had a little pad under his right forearm which sensed muscle movements there and adjusted the screen across from him above from him now it felt as the couch straightened out and the geesuit supported him and so he got a glimpse of pirrintipiti as the ship turned away from nasqueron and headed deeper insystem to the next planet sunward the moreorless earthlike sepekte on the screen glantines tropical capital was a towered and shimmering smear draped across a scatter of dark green islands set in a pale green sea odd already to be missing pirri he thought he wouldnt have had a chance to set foot out of the port there but hed been expecting the usual routine of transferring from a suborb to a tube train and then somewhere in the bowels of the vast stalk the equatower waiting for the lift up the cable to the satport and a spacecapable ship there to be heading straight out from the autumn house into space just seemed wrong somehow a curious disconnect of the soul trips to sepekte usually took anywhere from under five days to over a week at the standard onegee acceleration depending on planetary alignment the ships were large and comfortable and you could move around normally visiting restaurants and bars screens and gyms and on the bigger liners even swimming pools the weightless minutes in the middle were an interlude for fun and often some rushed and oddly unsatisfactory sex people from glantine sometimes found the double weight of standard gee a little uncomfortable but it was pretty much what theyd experience when they got to sepekte anyway so it was kind of like getting in training the pressure of what the screen told him was three four and then just over five gees settled into fassin the geesuit was sensing his breaths gently helping him inflate his lungs without too much added effort think ill take first officer dicogra said a snooze or would you she asked like to talk snooze away he told her thinking of taking a nap myself fine systemsll watch our vitals anyway till later then pleasant dreams fassin watched the screen show glantine drop away beyond it revealed was not initially the night of space or foamy wash of stars but instead the broad sunlit face of nasqueron a mad swirling dance of gases the colour of some fabulous desert but moving in colossal ribbons like opposed streams of liquid around a globe a hundred and fifty thousand kilometres across a planet you could drop a thousand glantines or sepektes or earths into and never notice the difference a not so little system of its own within ulubis system a vast world that was almost as unlike home for any human as it was possible to imagine and yet the place where fassin had already spent most of his unusual sporadically paced life and so for all its alien scale wild magnetic and radiation gradients extremes of temperature crushing pressures unbreathable atmosphere and dangerously unpredictably eccentric inhabitants it was for fassin as it was for his fellow seers something like home after all he watched until it too started to shrink until glantine was a mere dot floating above its vast and banded ochre face and the brighter stars appeared around it then switched the screen off and slept he woke four hours had passed the pressure was the same as it had been the ship still roaring far away he didnt need any more sleep so he went into slowtime just thinking everybody in ulubis system knew where they were when the portal was destroyed you knew because as soon as you heard you realised youd be staying in ulubis for the next two and a half centuries at least for most people even the vast majority ninetynine per cent of them human who would never have the chance to travel out of system that meant something profound it meant that they were here for the rest of their lives no dream theyd ever had or hope theyd entertained about seeing the rest of the galaxy would ever be reflected in reality for others it meant that loved ones elsewhere in the rest of the galaxy on the far side of the vanished portal were for ever gone two hundred and fourteen years to zenerre over two centuries for light and therefore any sort of message or signal to travel from there to ulubis maybe three centuries before the wormhole link was reestablished even if the engineers set out from there with a portalcarrying ship almost immediately and who was truly to know if there were any engineers or great ships left perhaps the ulubis portal had not been alone and all the rest had been attacked and destroyed at the same time maybe the mercatoria itself was no more maybe there was no complex no more arteria and no more portals left anywhere and all that remained of the galaxys latest great civilisation were umpteen thousand separate little island systems fractured and abandoned and alone the usual wash of throughportal comms traffic just before the destruction had betrayed no hint of such a galaxywide attack but then there had been no hint more than ten minutes before of an attack on the ulubis portal either until the biggest fleet of beyonder craft ulubis had ever seen had swung glittering out of empty nowhere throwing themselves against the single greatest concentration of ships and firepower anywhere in the system being obliterated in their hundreds but effectively ignoring the defending ships except where they were directly in their way pummelling and battering their way through defensive screen after defensive screen oblivious to harm straight towards the portal mouth itself finally erasing everything around them in a flurry of immense antimatter explosions that alone announced to the system the scale and violence of what had taken place creating a vanishingly brief cluster of novae in the facing skies of every inhabited surface casting shadows far away blinding those nearerto and vaporising most of what was still left of the beyonder fleet and many of their pursuers for a short while it looked as though they had failed because the last line of defence had held and the portal had survived the entire attack up to that point had been a feint and the real assault took place when a large ship a few million tonnes of hollowedout asteroid travelling at over ninetynine per cent of the speed of light flicked in from the opposite direction in a sense it missed too darting past the portal mouth a hundred metres away and colliding with a collection of laser battlesats which hadnt even started to turn towards it when it smashed into them instantly annihilating them the entire portal surround its subunits and almost all its associated systems and creating another stunning detonation of light in the sky none of which destroyed the portal that was done by the relativistic mass of the sacrificed ship itself portals were only ever positioned at lagrange points or other orbits distant from large heavenly bodies because they needed a section of spacetime that was relatively flat too great a gradient too near the gravity well of a planet or other large object and they stopped working increase the st curve only a little more and they imploded and disappeared altogether usually violently the hurtling asteroidship was so massive and its velocity so close to light speed that it had the same apparent mass as a planet the size of sepekte the passing of its gravity well so close to the portal mouth especially at that extreme velocity was sufficient to collapse the portal and the hole beyond sending one more cataclysmic pulse of light flashing throughout the system the last few of the earlier attackers immediately fled but were either destroyed or were disabled and then selfdestructed two days before the attack took place fassin had been sort of in space sort of on sepekte sitting in a revolving restaurant at the summit of the borquille equatower having dinner with taince yarabokin who was due to head back to the summed fleet academy the following day after an extended compassionate leave following the death of her mother fassin had just come out of a monthlong trawl through some of the seedier less salubrious entertainment palaces of skem sepektes second city he felt jaded old even he and taince had kept in touch since the incident in the ruined ship though theyd never become especially close despite a night spent together shortly afterwards saluus had kind of drifted away from both of them subsequently then headed off early to a finishing college half the galaxy away then spent decades being a problem playboy son to his vexed father behaving more or less continually on a galactic scale the way fassin did only intermittently on a systemic one and returning to ulubis very occasionally for brief unannounced visits a guard rescue suborb had arrived at the ruined ship lying crumpled on glantines north waste land a few minutes behind the navarchy craft taince had summoned its personnel had entered the alien ship and found ilens broken body there was an inquiry sal was fined by the civil authorities for violating the ships interior more than had been strictly required for the purposes of physical sanctuary from the external threat while the navarchy military had awarded taince extra course credits for her actions fassin found himself copping for some sort of civil bravery award thanks to tainces testimony but managed to avoid the ceremony he never did mention the piece of twisted metal that sal had stolen from the wreck but taince had broached the subject herself over dinner in the equatower shed known at the time she just hadnt found herself capable of being bothered enough to take it off sal again let him have his pathetic trophy probably their equivalent of a door knob or a coat hook she said ruefully but one gets you ten by the time it was sitting in sals locker or on his desk it was the ships control yoke or the mainarmament fire button taince looked out at the distant horizon and near surface of sepekte sliding past as the restaurant revolved providing the appearance of gravity in this gravitycancelled habitat anchored at the space limit of a forty kiloklick cable whose other end fell to ground in borquille sepektes capital city shit you knew all the time fassin said nodding i suppose i should have expected that not much ever got past you taince had gone on to become a highflier in every sense carving a perfect career through the navarchy military and being chosen for the summed fleet one of the mercatorias highest divisions and one into which very few humans had ever been invited commander taince yarabokin looked young had aged well the three of them had sal despite his multifarious debaucheries could afford the very best treatments and plausibly access some supposedly forbidden to him so he looked like hed lived through a lot fewer of the hundred and three years which had actually elapsed since ilens death lately there was even a rumour that he was thinking of settling down becoming a good son learning the business applying himself taince had spent decades at close to light speed pursuing the beyonders craft and attacking their bases fighting quickly ageing slowly fassin had joined the family firm and become a slow seer after all so spent his own timeexpanded decades conversing with and gradually extracting information from the dwellers of nasqueron hed had like saluus his own wild years been a roaring lad ripping through the highs and dives of glantine sepekte and beyond taking in a not so grand tour of his own round some of the supposedly civilised galaxys more colourful regions losing money and illusions gaining weight and some small amount of wisdom but his indulgences had been on a smaller scale than sals he supposed and certainly took place over a shorter timescale before too long he came home sobered up and calmed down took the training and became a seer he still had his wild interludes but they were few and far between if never quite enough of either for the taste of his uncle slovius even in the millenniahallowed halls of seerdom he had kept on making waves upsetting people the trend over the last fifteen hundred years the years of uncle sloviuss reign had favoured virtual delving over the direct method virtual or remote delving meant staying comatose and closely caredfor in a clinicclean seer faculty complex on third fury the closeorbit moon riding barely above the outer reaches of nasquerons hazy atmosphere to communicate from there with the dwellers beneath by a combination of highres nmr scanners laser links comms satellites and finally mechanical remotes which did the dirty dangerous bit keeping close contact with the flights and flocks and pods and schools and individuals of the dwellers themselves fassin had been a ringleader in a small rebellion insisting with a few other young seers on sliding into cramped arrowhead gascraft breathing in gillfluid accepting tubes and valves into every major orifice and surrendering body and fate to a little ship that contained the seer accepted the gees and poison and radiation and everything else and took him or her physically into the gasgiants atmosphere the better to earn the respect and confidence of the creatures who lived there the better to do the job and learn the stuff there had been deaths setbacks arguments bannings and strikes but eventually largely on the back of unarguably better delving results and more raw data unarguably better delving results in the sense that they were manifestly superior compared with what had gone before not unarguably better in the sense that the old guard couldnt claim this would all have happened anyway if everybody had just stuck to their ways which were probably what had really prompted this longoverdue improvement in the first place the youngsters had triumphed and delving the hard way real delving hands metaphorically dirty became the norm not the exception it was anyway more exciting more risky but also so much more rewarding more fun for the seer concerned as well as being more viewerfriendly for those who chose to pick up the edited distilled timedelayed feed that the more progressive seer houses had been putting out to the entsworks for the last halfmillennium or so you have made it into something like a sport slovius had said sadly one day when he and fassin had been fishing together in a dustboat on glantines sea of fines it used to be more of the mind nevertheless from being a steadfast heelsin critic of the whole real delve movement slovius who had always been quick to seize any opportunity to advance the interests of his sept had become a sort of appropriately remote champion supporting fassin and eventually putting the full weight of sept bantrabal behind him and his fellow revolutionaries that both fassin and slovius had been right and their sept flourished to become arguably the most productive and respected of the twelve septs of ulubis system and so by implication one of the foremost seer houses in the galaxy had been the single most satisfying achievement of sloviuss time as chief seer and paterfamilias of sept bantrabal fassin was now arguably the bestknown seer in the system especially after his time with the tribe dimajrian the wild pod of adolescent dwellers hed befriended and effectively become part of for a seeming century and a real halfdozen years he was not yet even at the start of his prime by seer reckoning but was nevertheless already at the top of his game he had been born three hundred and ninety years earlier had lived barely fortyfive of those in bodytime and looked a decade younger sometimes he thought back to what had happened in the ruined alien ship and he looked at all that had happened to sal and taince and himself and reflected that it was as though they had all come away from that nightmare with a sort of bizarre blessing an inverted curse a trio of charmed lives quite as if ilen had unknowingly given up whatever golden future had awaited her to add that weight of divided bounty to theirs he and taince parted with a kiss she was heading to the portal and through the complex to the far side of the galaxy to the fleet academy to spend a year passing on her knowledge fassin was going to the far side of ulubis where nasqueron was at the time to continue trying to extract knowledge from the dwellers taince was safely through the portal a day before it was destroyed fassin was on a liner a day out of sepekte he understood even as the news was still coming in that he might never see her again sal who might so easily have been away was at home with his longsuffering father when the attack took place after ten catatonic hours of disbelief he spent a month mourning his lost freedoms trying to sink fumigate and fuck his sorrows away in what passed for the pleasurepits of ulubis in fact sepekte and especially borquille had perfectly disrespectable bars smoke houses and bordellos borquille had a whole district boogeytown set aside for just such recreations but the point was they were not the rest of the civilised galaxy fass had bumped into saluus in a boogeytown spike bar once though sal had been so out of it that he hadnt recognised his onetime friend then sal straightened out cut his hair lost a few tattoos and a lot of acquaintances and at the start of the next working week turned up bang on time at the company offices where people were still running around in a frenzy spooked by all the numerous false alarms expecting to be invaded at any moment right from the start the questions were why why us what next and anybody else had something like this happened everywhere it would take over two centuries for ulubis to discover if it was part of a wider catastrophe or had been singled out for its own specific disaster from being no more remote than any other system at the end of a single wormhole and so orders of magnitude less remote than the many hundreds of thousands of faring systems still to be connected or reconnected ulubis its principal planet sepekte its three significant inhabited moons including glantine its thousands of artificial habitats and the twenty billion souls that the whole system contained were fully as remote and exposed as theyd always seemed from any casual glance at a galactic star chart the guard navarchy military and surviving units of the ulubis ambient squadron repaired and regrouped martial law was declared and a war emergency plan actioned which turned the bulk of the systems advanced productive capacity to weapons and war craft as a consequence kehar heavy industries saluuss fathers company expanded and prospered beyond its founders most avaricious fantasies and saluus went from wastrel heir to a great fortune to inheritorinwaiting of a vast one in the system hierarchy thought was given at the highest levels to attempting to construct a wormhole of ulubiss own and a carrier fleet to take one end of it to zenerre but aside from the vast cost and the point assuming a portal would be heading in the other direction before too long that it would be a waste of time and effort which would bring reconnection no quicker there was one clinching argument that would apply until either no signal arrived from zenerre or word came of an utter breakdown in civil society in the mercatoria only engineers were allowed to make and emplace wormholes there were sanctions and punishments for those systems and rulers who even began a holecreation programme without explicit permission and that permission had not been present in the mercatorias preagreed war emergency plan for ulubis back in space distributed around the lagrange point where the portal had lain the few pieces of recovered beyonder ships indicated that the portals attackers had been made up from the same three groups which had troubled ulubis and some of the nearby volumes for thousands of years transgress the true free and the bialliance for this one occasion working in concert and in far greater numbers than they ever had before anxious on edge waiting for whatever a beyonder invasion might bring the people of the system reverted to a state something more like that of earths rhumanity before it had been fully brought into the galactic community it was a truism that all civilisations were basically neurotic until they made contact with everybody else and found their place within the everchanging metacivilisation of other beings because until then during the stage when they honestly believed that they might be entirely alone in existence all solo societies were possessed of both an inflated sense of their own importance and a kind of existential terror at the sheer scale and apparent emptiness of the universe even knowing that the rest of the galactic community did exist at least in some form even in a worst case the culture of ulubis system shifted fractionally towards that earlier preascensionary state restricted by martial law in new and annoying but sometimes oddly exciting ways coming to terms with their sudden isolation and newly appreciated vulnerability people lived more for the short term clutching at what pleasures and rewards might be available today just in case there really was no tomorrow no great breakdown in society took place and there were no significant riots or rebellions though there were protests and crackdowns and as the authorities admitted much later much later mistakes were made but the system held together rather than fell apart and many people would look back on that strange unsettled epoch with a sort of nostalgia there had been something feverish but vivid about the time a reconnection with life after the disconnection with everybody else which led to what even looked from some angles suspiciously like a cultural renaissance for what people were now starting to call the ulubine disconnect fassin missed out on most of the excitement taking every opportunity he could to go delving as if frightened that he might not be able to do so in the future even when he was living back in realtime he was insulated from the extremes of the systemwide turmoil of fear and nervous energy by being on glantine rather than sepekte or its ring habitats then by living within the sept at one of its five seasonal houses rather than in pirrintipiti or any of the planetmoons other major cities he still travelled spending occasional holidays in pirri or offglantine and that was when he felt the strange new atmosphere of freneticism most keenly mostly though he was in nasqueron nestled in a fragile little gascraft occasionally at normal lifespeed flying with the younger dwellers riding the gases alongside them buffeted by the gasgiantgirdling planetswallowing superwinds and whirling hyperstorms of the planet sometimes more often and much more productively though far less excitingly floating sedately in a study or a library in one of the millions of dweller cities with one of the more elderly and scholarly dwellers who alone in the system seemed perfectly unconcerned about the portals demise a few of the rare polite ones expressed the sort of formal shamebutthereyougo sympathy people tend to exhibit when an acquaintances elderly relative expires peacefully but that was about it fassin supposed that it was foolish to expect anything else from a race that was as ancient as the dwellers claimed to be who had supposedly explored the galaxy several times over at velocities of only a few per cent of light speed long before the planetary nebula that gave birth to earth jupiter and the sun had even formed out of the debris of still more antique generations of stars and who still maintained they felt vaguely restricted not by that absolute limit on the conventional pace of travel but rather by the modest scale of the galaxy that these staggeringly longago almost wilfully leisurely sets of voyages had revealed the days weeks and months of waiting and preparation for an invasion became a year the beyonder attacks rather than increasing faded away almost to nothing as though the portal assault had been one last insane hurrah rather than the logical if wasteful precursor to a war of conquest the years added up towards a decade and gradually people and institutions relaxed and came to believe that the invasion might never come the majority of the emergency powers lapsed though the armed forces remained in high numbers and on high alert sensors and patrols sweeping the volumes of space around ulubis seeking a threat that seemed to have disappeared in four directions lay almost empty intergalactic nothingness barren volumes holding a few ancient exhausted cinder suns with lifefree systems or none at all a scattering of dust and gas clouds brown dwarfs neutron stars and other debris some of these or the space in between technically lifesupporting for slow exotics cincturia and enigmatics but patently devoid of any species who cared or could even understand the fate or concerns of the people of ulubis but no allies no one to help or offer assistance or support and certainly no portal connections downarm nearly parallel with the galaxys wispy limit heading into the thickening mass of gas and nebulae and stars was zenerre inwards between ulubis and the galactic centre spread a vast mass of disconnect the cluster epiphany five disconnect millions of stars spread throughout cubic lightcenturies which it was believed still supported worlds that had once been part of the civilised connected holenetworked galactic community until over seven thousand years earlier and the arteria collapse which had preceded the war of the new quick and all the excitement and the woes that had flowed from it two centuries one decade four years and twenty days after the portal attack exactly when it might have been expected the first signal arrived from zenerre the wavefront of what would become a constant stream of information from the rest of the connected galaxy where ulubis was informed life was going on as usual the attack on its portal had been unique and all was basically well with the mercatoria attacks and incursions by the various beyonder groups continued throughout the civilised galaxy as did operations against them but these were on the usual mainly nuisancevalue level that the beyonder wars had evidenced for thousands of years the tactically distressing and annoyingly wasteful but strategically irrelevant distributed background microviolence that people had started calling the hum relief puzzlement and a vague sense of victimisation spread throughout ulubis system the engineership esttaun zhiffir portalcarrying set out from zenerre for ulubis less than a year after the disaster with a travel time initially given as years later reduced by increments to level out at as the eship upped its velocity even closer to light speed the engineers aboard finetuning the systems which insulated the hauled portal from the effects of its own and the ships relativistic mass people in ulubis system relaxed the last vestiges of martial law were hidden away from public sight again those many born after the portals destruction wondered what it would be like to have a connection to the rest of the galaxy to this semimythical metacivilisation theyd heard so much about the flipover point came and fassin was vaguely aware of it as the pressure on his chest and flesh and limbs faded away over the course of a few seconds replacing that feeling of oppression with a sensation of sudden bloodroaring bloatedness as his body struggled to cope with the change he kept his eyes closed almost immediately there was a faint trace of force a gentle push from somewhere beneath his head then weightlessness again and a few moments later a matching tug from somewhere beneath his feet and then weight returning pressure quickly building until the roaring in his head faded and became the distant thunder of the ship again the archimandrite luseferous standing before the ruins of the city stooped and dug gloved fingers into the soft earth by his feet wrenching out a handful of soil he held it to his face for a while staring at it then brought it close to his nose and smelled it then let it fall and dusted off his gloves while staring down at the huge crater where a large part of the city had been the crater was still filling from the sea a slow curling curve of brownwhite water spilling from the estuary beyond the waterfall disappeared into the seat of the crater in a vast cloudbank of vapour and steam rose everywhere from the rolling tumbling confusion of waters as the great rocky bowl cooled a massive trunk of steam three kilometres or more across rose into the calm pastel sky rolling up through thin layers of cloud flatheading where it achieved the middle reaches of the atmosphere it was the archimandrites conceit where a severe lesson had to be taught on a planet capable of supporting such a mark that a city by the sea which was either itself guilty of resisting or judged by him symbolic of resistance shown by others on the planet be remade in the image of his beloved junch city back on leseum iv if a people would resist him either while undergoing conquest or enduring occupation they would suffer of course but they would be part of something greater at the same time and they would even in death even in the death of much of their city be the unwitting and unwilling participants in what was indeed a work of art for here seen from this hillside was there not a new faraby bay was that slot through which the waters thundered shaking the ground not another force gap was that piling tower of steam first drawn straight up then stroked to the horizon not a kind of signature his very own flourish the bay was overly circular certainly and the slot a mere break in a modest crater wall composed largely of estuarine mud presenting no aesthetic match at all for the great kilometrehigh cliffs of the real force gap indeed the whole setting for this new image of junch city entirely lacked the originals dramatic ring of surrounding mountains and this little parkland hill on which he stood with his admirals generals and guard waiting obediently behind allowing him this moment of reflection was frankly a poor substitute for the vertical cliff of the sheer citadel and its magnificent views nevertheless an artist had to work with what there was to hand and where there had once been just another swarming seaside city lying tipped upon the land variously hilled messily distributed round a tributary river with the all usual urban sprawl great buildings docks breakwaters and anchorages in other words what it had always been roughly no matter that there had been earlier socalled catastrophes like earthquakes or floods or great fires or bombardment from sea or air or earlier invasion now there was an image of a fair and distant place now there was a new kind of savage beauty now there was a fit setting for a new city reborn in the image of his sovereignty now there was a sort of even healing joining with those other peoples and places who had surrendered to his will in suffering and in image for this majestic crater this latest work was just the most recent of his creations one more jewel on a string stretching back to the primacy of elegance that was junch city anyone with sufficient selfbelief enough ruthlessness and luseferous believed himself modest enough to admit an adequate supply of luck could if the will was there and the times required such determination conquer and destroy judging how much to destroy for the effect one wished to achieve knowing when to be ruthless when to show leniency even when to exhibit beguiling ragesapping generosity and a touch of humour that required a more measured a more subtle a more he could think of no other word for it civilised touch he had that touch the record spoke for itself to then go on from there and use the sad necessity of destruction to create art to form an image of a better place and forge symbolic unity that was on another level again that elevated the mere warmaker the mere politician to the status of creator tendrils of smoke rose all around the central column of steam dark paltry vines adorning a huge pale trunk these marked where defending aircraft had fallen and where fires had been started by the craterweapons ground shock no doubt part of the artistry involved in such a work was creating a great declivity without utterly destroying all around it a new reborn city had to grow here after all some sophistication of weaponry was required to achieve such precision his armaments experts attended to such details the archimandrite luseferous looked about him smiling to his chiefs of staff all standing respectfully at his heel looking a little nervous to be here in the fresh air of another newly subject planet yet was it not good to breathe in that fresh air for all its alien scents did those strange new odours not themselves mean that another treasure had been added to their everincreasing domain above and behind bristling war craft hovered and hummed attended by small clouds of sensory and weapon platforms spread in a ring all around were his personal guards most lying or kneeling on the grass their darkly glinting weaponry poised a few in military exoskels lumbered around or squatted splayed feet squashing into the earth at the foot of the hill beyond another ring of guards beneath a watchful buzz of guard drones the refugees moved like a slow river of dun and grey stilters groundbats whule a mercatorial species disconnected all these millennia certainly but still a mercatorial species luseferous looked up into the pale green sky imagining night the veils of stars and the one particular sun pointed out to him from orbit just forty hours ago while the invasion forces were being prepared for the initial drop growing steadily closer as they crawled and fought their way towards it which was called ulubis in the bright goldenhued air of sepekte with the borquille equatower a thin stem in the hazy distance the little navarchy ship approached the palace complex sliding through an ancient forest of kilometrestall atmospheric power columns and between more modest but still impressive administration and accommodation towers it disappeared into a wide gently sloped tunnel set into the reception plaza in front of the enormous ball that was the palace of the hierchon an eighthundredmetre sphere modelled after nasqueron itself by a longdeparted sarcomage complete with individual bands of slowly contrarotating floors all sliding round a stationary inner core changing orangered brown and ochre swirls of pattern convincingly like the view of the distant gasgiants cloud tops seen from space moved across the face of the palace hiding windows and balconies sensors and transmitters major taak lieutenant inesiji palace guard this way please quick as we can sir the speaker whose voice sounded like a human child talking with a mouthful of ball bearings was a jajuejein a creature which in repose resembled an insectile tumbleweed sixty or seventy centimetres in diameter this one had drawn itself up to fassins twometre height marshalling a host of twiglike components coloured dark green and steel blue to resemble a sort of openwork head like a birds nest thankfully it had not tried to make a face and had balanced itself on two vaguely leglike stalks the rest of its body offering glimpses of the reception caverns floor beyond was just a cylinder adorned with belts of softlooking material and small metallic components that might have been jewellery gadgets or weapons it halfturned halfflowed to a small open cart where the ships whule rating was already depositing fassins luggage fassin turned and waved to the groggily cheerful dicogra joined the jajuejein in the cart and was whisked away through a brief security reception area to a lift and a curving corridor which took him to a suite of rooms with what looked like a real outside view of the city north with pale jagged hills in the far distance lieutenant inesiji placed fassins bags on the bed with fluid grace and informed him that he had exactly threefifths of an hour to freshen up don his ceremonial court clothes and present himself outside his door whereupon he would be escorted to the audience chamber fassin blipped a safearrival message to bantrabal and then did as hed been told the circular audience chamber was glittering and warm walls of white gold sparkling under a ceilingfilling galaxyshaped cloud of tiny sharp lights impersonating stars lieutenant inesiji showed fassin to a position on one of the many platforms set into the shallow stepped bowl of the chamber a humanconforming seat malleabled its way up from the floor he sat in it stiffly in his bulky court robes and the lieutenant told him please stay where you are for now sir in a sort of gargled whisper executed what might have been a bow turned into what looked very like a cartwheel and rolled away back up the slope of gangway to an exit fassin looked around the chamber looked like it might hold a thousand people but he was one of only about two dozen people present distributed around the shallowly conical space as though to maximise the distance between each individual humans all like him in cumbersome rather gaudy court dress just about outnumbered the others but he saw another jajuejein balled either resting or sleeping crisscrossed with iridescent ribbons two whule sitting like angular grey tents covered in silver flowers both looking at him a pair of quaup one of the twometrelong redtan ellipses floating and also looking at him well certainly pointing at him and the other stood on its end either also snoozing or possibly at attention fassins knowledge of alien body language was wide but shallow except where dwellers were concerned three large environment suits containing waterworlders completed the nonhuman contingent two of the esuits looking like aquamarine impersonations of the quaups most likely contained kuskunde the third was a matt black lozenge the size of a small bus radiating warmth that esuit would almost certainly contain an symbioswarm ifrahile in the centre of the chamber at its deepest point just before a set of wide tall concentric platforms which broke the symmetry of the space there was an incongruouslooking device which looked like an ancient iron cooking pot a blackbellied urn a couple of metres in diameter capped with a shallow dome and sitting on a tripod of stubby legs on the buttery sheen of the solid gold floor its surface was pinstriped with thin vanes but otherwise it resembled something almost prehistoric fassin had never seen anything like it before he shivered despite the warmth of the chamber the quaup which might have been sleeping suddenly flicked level with a ripple of lateral mantle and turned towards its fellow creature thirty metres away which swivelled to look back at it expression patterns flashed across their face nacelles then they moved towards each other hovering together faces signalflickering conversation for the few seconds it took for a small flutter drone to drop from the ceiling and in spoken voice with chirps and squeaks apparently ordered them back to their places the quaup shriekpopped back at the mechanical remote but split up drifting away to their earlier positions they had just about resumed their allotted patches when a group of half a dozen jajuejein technicians awkward in their shapeconstraining formal court gear of dimly iridescent ribbons entered from a door at one side of the chamber floor pushing large pallets full of highly techylooking equipment which they positioned in a rough circle round the cookingpot device their body ribbons marked them out as shrievalty fassin suddenly realised wondering whether as a major of the ocula he was senior enough to order them around a similarsized group human cessorian priests from their garb though in their court best it was hard to be sure could they even be lustrals approached from the opposite direction the priests stood close behind the technicians who ignored them and busied themselves setting up and adjusting their arcane apparatus finally an alarming group of four human and four whule troopers in full mirrorfinish powerarmour stalked in complete with a variety of heavy infantry weapons the ambience of the chamber changed even across species the mood almost tangibly altered from one of some puzzlement and a degree of expectation to one of alarm even fear the two quaup were exchanging rapid largescale face signals the ifrahile esuit rose hissing from its platform and the whule pair were alternating between staring at each other and glaring down at their mirrorarmoured kin who brought armed forces into an audience chamber was this a trap had all here offended the hierchon were they all to be murdered the soldiers deployed in a wide circle around the shrievalty and cessoria standing at ease weaponry poised armourlocked they were facing inwards towards the black cookingpot device the mood in the room seemed to relax a little then the series of platforms beyond the giant urn and the various groups of functionaries shimmered once and dropped into the floor to reemerge some moments later crowded with people an outer ring of whiteuniformed human court officials an inner ring of speciesvaried extravagantly emblazoned courtiers and an outer core again mixedspecies of ascendancy omnocracy administrata and cessoria fassin recognised most of them from the news and the few formal visits hed had to make to the court over the years formed semicircular tiers of importance around the being in the centre the hierchon ormilla himself resplendent in his giant platinumsheathed discus of an environment suit floating humming just above the highest platform the dark creatures great gaping face visible through the suits forward diamond window amongst roiling clouds of crimson gas seven metres high three wide the suit was by some margin the largest and most impressive of the microenvironments in the chamber it quickly took on a frosted look as humidity in the air condensed on its deepchilled surfaces as the hierchon and his attendants appeared fassins seat gave a warning vibration and began to sink back into the platform beneath fassin took the hint and stood then bowed while the various other people in the chamber performed their equivalent actions the giant esuit lowered fractionally so that its base touched the platform and fassins seat rose smoothly from the platform again the hierchon ormilla was an oerileithe a gasgiant dweller but important distinction this to all concerned not a dweller even if the shape of his esuit made him look like one ormilla had ruled the ulubis system since his investiture nearly six thousand years earlier long before the humans who now made up the bulk of its populace had arrived he was generally thought to be a competent if unimaginative governor exercising what leeway a hierchon had within the mercatorial system with caution sense and on occasion even a degree of compassion his rule since the portals destruction had by the estimation of the officially sanctioned media been a humbling combination of breathtaking majesty heroic utterly exemplary fortitude and a touching steadfast solidarity with his human charges unkinder unsanctioned often human critics might have accused him of betraying an early disposition towards authoritarianism and even paranoid repression eventually followed later by a more composed and lenient attitude when he started listening to his advisers again looking more carefully at the highups present fassin realised that basically the gang was all here apart from ormilla himself the hierchons two most senior deputies the peregals tlipeyn and emoerte were in attendance as was the most senior member of the propylaea to survive the portals destruction submaster sorofieve the top navarchy officer fleet admiral brimiaice guardgeneral thovin first secretary heuypzlagger of the administrata colonel somjomion of the shrievalty his own ultimate superior officer for the duration of the current emergency fassin supposed and clerkregnant voriel of the cessoria the absolute elite of the system fassin looked at the potbellied stove device squatting on the golden floor and at the heavily armed troopers and thought what a perfect opportunity was presenting itself for a complete decapitation of the systems top brass this is an extraordinary session of the mercatorial court of ulubis before the hierchon ormilla an official announced over the chambers pa voice thundering the hierchon ormilla the official shouted as though concerned that people hadnt heard him the first time the official was speaking the human version of standard the galaxys lingua franca standard had been chosen as an interspecies pangalactic language over eight billion years ago dwellers had been the main vector in its spread though they made a point of emphasising that it was not theirs originally they had one very ancient informal vernacular and another even more ancient formal language of their own plus lots that had survived somehow from earlier times or been made up in the meantime these latter came and went in popularity as such things tended to oh no there was a competition the dweller guidementor ysul had explained to fassin on his first delve hundreds of years ago usual thing lots of competing socalled universal standards there was a proper fullscale war after one linguistic disagreement a grumous and a pliner species if memory serves and after that came the usual response inquiries missions meetings reports conferences summits what we now know as standard was chosen after centuries of research study and argument by a vast and unwieldy committee composed of representatives of thousands of species at least two of which became effectively extinct during the course of the deliberations it was chosen astonishingly on its merits because it was an almost perfect language flexible descriptive uncoloured whatever that means but apparently its important precise but malleable highly elegantly complete yet primed for externaltermadoption and with an unusually free but logical link between the written form and the pronounced which could easily and plausibly embrace almost any set of phonemes scints glyphs or pictals and still make translatable sense best of all it didnt belong to anybody the species which had invented it having safely extincted themselves millions of years earlier without leaving either any proven inheritors or significant mark on the greater galaxy save this sole linguistic gem even more amazingly the subsequent conference to endorse the decision of the megacommittee went smoothly and agreed all the relevant recommendations takeup and acceptance were swift and widespread standard became the first and so far only true universal language within just a few quickmean generations set a standard for panspecies cooperation that everybodys been trying to live up to ever since which is not to say that everybody everywhere loves it without qualification amongst my own species in particular resistance to its use continues to this day and individual obsessives and small and indeed quite large groups and networks of enthusiasts are forever coming up with new and they claim even better universal languages some dwellers persist in regarding standard as an outrageous alien imposition and a symbol of our craven surrender to galactic fashion such persons tend to speak ancient formal or at least they do where they havent invented their own unique and generally utterly incomprehensible language uncle slovius himself on what fittingly had turned out to be his final delve had accompanied fassin on this the young mans first how perfectly typical hed observed later only dwellers could have a completely fair competition eight billion years ago and still be arguing over the result fassin smiled at the thought and looked round the giant auditorium as the officials words echoed and faded amongst the precious metals and sumptuous clothing he thought it was all very impressive in a slightly camp almost vulgar way he wondered how much tedious ceremony and baroque speechifying they would now have to sit through before anything of note happened or was said he did a quick count of the bodies in the chamber there were well over twice the thirty that the emissarial projection had told him to expect a tapscreen appeared on a stalk out of the platform surface and positioned itself in front of him flicking into life with search and note facilities enabled but no audio or visual record fassin tapped a symbol to confirm that he was there round the circular chamber the others were also being presented with screens or their speciesrelevant alternative you are here to witness the transmission of a signal from the engineership esttaun zhiffir ormillas deep synthesised voice said calmly we are informed that it is of necessity in the form of an artificial intelligence construct which will be destroyed after the audience has finished ormilla paused to let this sink in fassin thought he just hadnt heard right how you use the information you are about to learn is a matter of duty and conscience ormilla told them how you came by it is not any revelation regarding the signals form is punishable by death begin an ai a conscious machine an abomination were they serious fassin couldnt believe it the entire history of the mercatoria was the record of its implacable persecution and destruction of ais and the continual laborious zealously pursued effort to prevent them ever again coming into existence within the civilised galaxy that was what the lustrals were all about they were the ai hunters the remorseless fanatic persecutors of machine intelligence and any and all research into it and yet here they were calmly watching the cookingpot device and the technicians surrounding it a semitransparent image flickered in the air above the dark machine in the centre of the chamber the hologram was of a human male dressed in the uniform of an admiral of the summed fleet fassin hadnt even known that one of his species had risen to such impressive heights the human admiral was an old wellbuilt man with a heavily lined face bald of course but sporting a heavily tattooed scalp he wore or his image appeared to wear a highrank spacecombat suit its helmet components in stowed configuration round the neck and shoulders various insignia on the surface of the suit confirmed with no discernible subtlety that the admiral was an extremely important military person thank you hierchon ormilla the image said then seemed to look straight at fassin who felt startled for a moment before realising that the image probably appeared to be looking directly at everybody in the chamber he certainly hoped so i represent admiral quile of the summed fleet commanding the third medium squadron of the battle fleet accompanying the engineership esttaun zhiffir on its journey towards ulubis system fleet admiral kisipt commanding the projection said in a calm nononsense voice battle fleet thought fassin you didnt send a battle fleet to accompany an eship portalcarrying or not did you they usually travelled with a few guard ships or one or two units of the navarchy military plus a single small summed fleet craft sometimes for ceremonial purposes he was no military expert but even he knew this sort of stuff just from catching newscasts of atthetimerecent connections and reconnections he watched the military on the semicircular podia closely yep looked like they were startled by this news too i am to dispense information and orders the hologram said then i will answer questions then i will be destroyed information first intelligence we have received strongly indicates that ulubis system will probably within a year and possibly within months of this signal reaching you become the target of a fullscale invasive assault originating from the cluster epiphany five disconnect the hologram paused appearing to listen there was a certain sense of stillness even of shock in the chamber but no gasps or expressions of fear or incredulity that fassin could hear he scanned the people in the chamber trying to work out if he was the only person present to whom this news might come as a surprise face flickers from the quaup big staring looks between the whule perhaps a few rather wideeyed expressions amongst the tech people down near the dark ai machine some of the more readable courtiers looked a little stunned the ifrahile esuit might have wobbled fractionally fassins hand was moving towards the tapscreen when it lit up with a diagram of the galactic local volume about a thousand years in diameter and centred on cluster epiphany five the millionsstrong mass of stars corein from the isolated wisp of suns near the end of which lay ulubis indeed our strategists put at about six per cent the possibility that by the time this signal arrived the invasion would already have happened the hologram looked around the chamber and smiled i am glad to see that is not the case the smile disappeared on the other hand i had hoped when the original of this signal was recorded that i would be telling you that the invasion was still three to five years away since becoming embodied here ive been given access to some of the realtime intelligence youve been gathering and have had no choice but to plump for an estimate that gives you even less time to prepare than wed been hoping for the image paused briefly the e discon was already known to be expanding aggressively deepspace monitors have been picking up blossoming eighthpowerlevel weaponblink for several hundred years centred on the leseum systems the image looked around the chamber space battles and highmegatonne nukes in other words all the signs are of a rogue hegemony possibly under the thrall of a human calling himself the archimandrite luseferous he was once genuinely of the cessoria though at the rank of hariolator not archimandrite so it would appear hes promoted himself in any case i think we may now count him apostate the hologram smiled thinly the leseum systems were until not all that long ago the last remaining connected part of the epiphany five region however that wormhole portal fell victim to a minor action of the strew leaving the whole volume completely cut off from civilisation the thin smile faded ten days ago from the time this signal was sent an invasion force out of the e discon comprising several hundred capital ships plus retinue and troop carriers attacked the ruanthril system inward from the e cluster we assume it came as a surprise to them that ruanthril had just received a new portal and been connected to the mercatoria it had not been part of the complex before which may help explain their miscalculation in any event elements of the summed fleet were present when the e forces attacked the attack was beaten off with heavy losses on both sides at this fassin saw a look of something that certainly seemed like consternation pass over the faceparts of the fleet admiral brimiaice yes the image said as though responding we were surprised too frankly and just had insufficient ships even more distressingly the portal was subsequently destroyed here fleet admiral brimiaice a quaup assumed the blank face of if fassin recalled his facial or equivalent expressions and body language of mercatorial species course vicariously shamed shock before that happened the hologram continued intelligence from the captured enemy flagship was transmitted into the complex it included a personal record belonging to their equivalent of a grandadmiral the invasion fleets supreme commander in which he recorded for posterity or his memoirs his puzzlement that so much of the vast military machine of which he was so proud to be a part was being directed not where it would carry the most weight or help capture the greatest number of systems in the shortest possible time in other words towards where the greatest mass of stars were spinward back up down and especially coreward but away from those regions towards the almost empty galactic outskirts towards the southern tendril reefs towards stream quaternary and the ulubis system or the shitnailed anusprobing finger at the end of a withered arm as he colourfully described it fassin nearly laughed most of the officials on the main ceremonial platforms led by the humans registered shock horror or outrage in some form the hierchons esuit rolled back half a metre as though physically struck the image took its time to look around the chamber yes unflattering my apologies you will be happy to know that the gentleman who was the source of this memorable image is currently helping the combined forces intelligence inquisitariat with its inquiries fassin watched a few slightly forced expressions of satisfaction appear they really didnt know any of this before he thought hed assumed the hierchon and his chums would have been granted some sort of sneak preview earlier but this seemed to be as new to them as it was to him we also of course have the preinvasion probingsequence profile for the e discons attempted conquest of ruanthril the hologram said plus those of several other systems attacked by the same forcemix the musings of the invasion fleets commander provide credible reason to believe ulubis is under significant threat the comparison of the preattack probingsequence profile for ruanthril with the recent raids on and other hostile actions within ulubis system leads to the conclusion that said threat is imminent within the timeframe of a few months to less than a year and a half there is a longaccepted highconsistency beyonder attack profile and the aggressions ulubis system has been experiencing over the last three years are anomalous to that fassin suspected that this was a subtle criticism of the system intelligence and strategy services and especially the navarchys fleet admiral brimiaice looked unnaturally still as though trying not to draw any unnecessary attention to himself the information also pointed to something of a coverup like verpych fassin had thought these anomalous attacks had begun just over a year ago this ai had been given access to information indicating that they had been going on for two years before that well that would come as no surprise to anyone being spoonfed rosyhued misinformation by the authorities was no more than people had come to expect and preemptively discount they only got suspicious when presented with what looked like the plain unvarnished truth i do have more to say the image above the cookingpot device told the assembled listeners however i sense that some of you are already anxious to ask questions and so at this point i would like to invite queries regarding what you have heard so far no need to introduce yourselves by the way i know who you all are everybody looked at the hierchon who obligingly boomed machine what percentage of likelihood pertains to this invasion the hologram did not look particularly impressed with this first question it might even have sighed fassin only half listened to the answer and paid even less attention to the following questions and answers none of them added anything significant to what hed already heard and mostly the questions boiled down to the categories are you sure are you mad are you lying abomination and i wont get blamed for any of this will i he used the tapscreen to get a better idea of the relevant galactic topography he called up a usefully scaled hologram and flicked between the local civilisational state of play as it had been understood until today effectively two and a half centuries out of date and the updated version that the ai signal had brought with it which was only seventeen years old as he did so whole vast volumes of stars changed from one false colour to another indicating where this cluster epiphany five disconnect hegemony had spread its influence resist them with all our might fleet admiral brimiaice roared im sure you will the hologram said however all the indications are that even if you devoted yourself to allout fulltime emergency warcraft construction and a full war economy you will still be outnumbered several times over fleet admiral brimiaice then blustered fassin had a question of his own but it was a question for inside his own head not one that he wished to ask the ai it was a question he had the unpleasant feeling would at some point shortly be answered though he sincerely hoped it wouldnt it was what the hell does all this have to do with me may i continue the image said after the next few contributions showed unmistakable signs of heading in the direction of becoming not so much questions as attestations of innocence pledges of heroic determination positionprotection statements and attacks on other functionaries present within a wide spectrum of subtlety biased towards the low end the hologram gave a small thin regretful smile i realise that all the foregoing has come as something of a shock for all of you however it is i am afraid to say in effect just a preamble to the most significant part of this communication the image of admiral quile paused to let that sink in too then the hologram said now then there is a gentleman amongst you who has no doubt been wondering for some little time what exactly he is doing here oh shit fassin had time to think then the image looked at him was it really looking at him now could everybody see the hologram looking at him heads or other parts as appropriate turned in his direction that probably meant yes seer fassin taak would you make yourself known to the others fassin heard the blood roar in his ears as he stood and gave a slow if shallow bow towards the hierchon he was getting that fleshshrinking thing again the chamber looked to be tipping and he was glad to sit down again he tried to control the blush that he felt building under his throat seer taak is a young man though born centuries ago the image said he has spent a productive and dutiful career with the gasgiant dwellers of the planet nasqueron i understand that many of you may have heard of him already he has now been given the rank of major within the shrievalty ocula for reasons which will become clear in due course fassin still feeling very much lookedat noticed that colonel somjomion the human female who was acting chief of staff of the shrievalty contingent in the ulubis system smiled cautiously at him from the podium across the chamber when the hologram said this unsure whether the shrievalty saluted or not fassin rose fractionally in his seat and nodded formally oh fuck were his precise thoughts the image floating above the cookingpot ai said the reason that seer major taak is here today to hear what i have had to tell you all is that it was something which he discovered stumbled over might be an equally accurate description with no disrespect to seer taak that has led to my being here in the first place oh fucking hell i always thought delving would be the death of me but i assumed it would be an equipment failure not something like this on the other hand that smile from colonel somjomion had been restrained even careful not mean or mocking might live yet which brings us of course to the real or at least the most pressing reason for my appearance here in this almost unprecedented form the hologram said then made a show of taking a deep breath it looked around them all slowly before saying ulubis im sure we would all agree is a pleasant and fairly favoured system it paused again fassin was listening fairly hard at this point and would have taken decent odds on the literal truth of the old youcouldhaveheardapindrop saying and the projection said with a smile radiantly confident that it now had their full attention as a centre of dweller studies it is not without significance galactically unquestionably from an antiquarian and intellectual standpoint another pause it occurred to fassin that an ai controlling a hologram could put a quite literal twinkle in its eye however one might think it reasonable to ask again with no disrespect intended or i hope taken why ulubis has attracted the attention of our newfound adversaries from cluster epiphany five one might even knowing the importance that the mercatoria attaches to reconnecting all the many many systems which have been without arteria access all these millennia wonder why the expedition from zenerre to ulubis with a new portal was dispatched with such alacrity given the arguably still greater claims that more populous more classically strategically important and more atthetime obviously threatened systems might have had upon the resources and expertise of our esteemed colleagues in the engineering faculty one might also pause to give thought to the reasons why the engineership esttaun zhiffir is accompanied by those elements of the summed fleet of which my original has the honour of being part why indeed the eship esttaun zhiffir is escorted by such a preponderance of force at all the hologram raised its head looked all around again it might not even be totally unreasonable to call into question the apparently unchallenged assumptions and settled conclusions concerning the destruction of the ulubis portal by the beyonders over two centuries ago that caused a little frisson in the chamber fassin noticed is any of this still about me and anything i might have found he wondered the more i hear the more i hope it isnt there is one circumstance one nexus of contingent information the image said with a broad unamused smile and something like relish which is we strongly suspect behind all of this the projection turned to look directly at the hierchon ormilla sir at this point i must ask that those not specifically cleared to be present at this meeting be withdrawn i believe we might make an exception for the troopers providing their ear mikes are turned off but i would be disobeying my orders if i continued with those not invited still present admiral quile the hierchon boomed with just sufficient emphasis i vouch for all those present who were inadvertently excluded from the clearance list you refer to you may continue and were it up to me sir that would of course be more than enough reason to proceed without care or reservation the admirals image said however devastated though i may be at being seen to offer even the slightest suggestion of an insult to your esteemed court i am specifically forbidden to continue bound as i am by the orders of the complector council ouch fassin thought he almost felt sorry for the hierchon hed not just had rank pulled on him hed been made to look small a sarcomage outranked a hierchon and was in turn answerable to a complector any single one of which supremely powerful as they were in every other exercise and iteration of power within the civilised galaxy themselves had at least to take into account the will of the complector council the unspeakably omnipotent members of the complector council were bound by nothing else save the laws of physics and were generally held to be putting considerable effort into getting round those hierchon ormilla took his defeat with a degree of grace and within a few minutes the chamber was emptied of half its earlier occupants the stepped sequence of podia in front of the hierchons imposing esuit now looked positively bare all the court officials and courtiers had departed with much muttering and the single highest quotient of affronted dignity fassin had ever witnessed by several factors the military bigwigs were still present but even their onpodium ranks had been depleted as colonel somjomion of the shrievalty and clerkregnant voriel of the cessoria were reduced to stepping down to floor level so that they could operate the two most important pieces of equipment monitoring the cookingpot device embodying the ai the mirrorfinish troopers still stood in a wide circle beyond armour locked in atease deaf now while all this had been going on fassin had been left to sit there not knowing what to think he knew what he ought to be thinking he ought to be thinking what the fuck could i ever have stumbled across that possibly warranted this level of righttothetop paranoia and secrecy it was however hard to know what to think he also knew what he ought to feel fear there he was fine he had a superabundance of high weapongrade trepidation thank you the image of the admiral said now then it said looking round all those who remained i have a question for you what do you know of something called the dweller list it held up one hand rhetorical question you dont have to answer those of you who wish feel free to consult your screens or equivalent take a moment there was a flurry of distant tapping the dweller list thought fassin oh fucking hell not that shit the hologram smiled let me in due time tell you what we at this end as we design and record this signal and projection consider important regarding this subject fassin had heard of the dweller list of course no seer hadnt unfortunately lots of laypeople had heard of the list too and so it had become one of those tired inwardgroanproducing subjects that people tended to raise when they met a seer at a party along with other hoary old clichéquestions such as do dwellers really hunt their own children and are they really as old as they say they are the dweller list was a collection of coordinates it had turned up as far as anyone could be sure towards the end of the burster war four hundred million years earlier and was probably well out of date even then allegedly the list detailed all the dwellers own secret arteria portals according to the story these had been under development since the time of the long collapse when the dwellers had decided that the other species or groups of species with which they were forced to share the galaxy couldnt be trusted to keep their own or jointly owned hole networks safe and so the dwellers had better construct an arteria web which they controlled and which preferably nobody else knew about if they wanted to voyage from gasgiant to gasgiant reliably and without fuss this of course completely ignored the dwellers attitudes to time and space and scale and more or less everything else the dwellers didnt need wormholes and the nearinstantaneous travel between systems that they offered they lived for billions of years they could slow their metabolism and thoughts down as required so that a journey of a thousand years or ten thousand years or a hundred thousand years would appear to be over in the course of a single sleep or occupied no more time than that required to read a good book or play a complicated game plus they were already everywhere they claimed they had spread throughout the galaxy during the first diasporian age which had ended when the universe was only two and a half billion years old even if that claim was a boast a typical dweller exaggeration what was undeniable was that dwellers were present in significant numbers in well over ninetynine per cent of all the gasgiant planets in the galaxy and had been for as long as anybody could remember though not as it had turned out jupiter humanitys own backyard gasgiant was unusual in being relatively waterpoor the dwellers considered it a desert planet and rarely visited after centuries of realtime and decades of seemtime spent with dwellers fassin had gained the distinct impression that dwellers both despised and felt sorry for the quick the species like humans like all the others in the mercatoria which felt the need to use wormholes as the dwellers saw it to be quick to live life that precipitously was to condemn oneself to an early end life had an inescapable trajectory a natural curve evolution development progress all conspired to push a sentient species along in a certain direction and all you could do was choose to run that road or saunter along it the slow took their time adapting to the given scale and natural limits of the galaxy and the universe as it existed the quick insisted on short cuts and seemed determined to bend the very fabric of space to their frantic impatient will when they were smart they succeeded in this wilfulness but they only brought their own end all the quicker they lived fast and died faster describing sudden glorious but quickly fading trails across the firmament the dwellers like the other slow wanted to be around for the long term and so were prepared to wait so quite why the dwellers would ever have bothered building a secret wormhole network was something of a mystery as was how they had managed to keep it secret all these hundreds of millions of years not to mention how this fitted in with the rather obvious nature of each different dweller communitys isolation from each other nevertheless the myth of the dweller list continued to excite people in general and conspiracy theorists in particular especially in times of threat and desperation when it would be really really great if a secret wormhole network did exist fassin agreed with the textbooks that it had been no coincidence the list had first turned up during the burster war when the whole galactic community had seemed to be falling apart and people were looking for salvation for hope anywhere then the arteria total had been falling from its earlier and then alltime high of nearly to under a thousand at the nadir of the third chaos there had been less than a hundred holes in the whole galaxy and the dwellers hadnt stepped in then with an offer to let everybody else use this secret system if not then when the light of civilisation seemed to be fading from the great lens entirely then when when and why would they ever come galloping to the rescue part of the seductive attraction of the list was its sheer size it contained over two million sets of alleged portal coordinates implying more than one million arteria presumably linked in a single enormous network at the height of the third complex eight thousand years earlier there had been exactly established wormholes threading the galaxy together and that was as good as far as was known as it had ever got if the dweller list genuinely enumerated existing portals and arteria it would represent the promise of instigating the single greatest change in the history of the galaxy the sudden linkingup of two million systems many of which had never had any connection before the bringing together of almost everybody everywhere the very furthest most utterly isolated star would likely be a mere decade or two away from the nearest portal and the nearinstant revitalising on a scale unheard of in nearly twelve billion years of tenacious sporadically stuttering civilisation of the entire galactic community it was fassin and almost all his fellow seers had long thought a forlorn hope the dwellers didnt need or show any sign of using wormholes being dwellers they naturally claimed they were experts at arteria and portal technology and certainly they were not afraid of using wormholes it was just that they didnt see the need for them but if they ever had been seriously involved with wormhole production those days were long gone in any case the list itself which had been lying around in libraries and data reservoirs multitudinously copied for hundreds of millions of years accessible to anybody with a link was not the end of the story it just gave the rough coordinates of two million gasgiants in two million systems what was needed was a more precise location the obvious places to look were the relevant trojan or lagrange points the gravitationally stable locations dotted around and between the orbits of the various planets in the named systems however these had all long since been eliminated after that it got much more tricky in theory a wormhole mouth could be left in any stable orbit anywhere in a system and never be found unless you practically tripped over it working portals were anything up to a kilometre wide and had an effective mass of several hundred thousand tonnes whereas a portal shrunk and stabilised and set up to keep itself that way with relatively simple automatics systems could lie in an orbit as far out as a systems oort cloud with a gravitational footprint of less than a kilogramme more or less indefinitely the problem was how to describe where it was allegedly there was some extra set of coordinates or even a single mathematical operation a transform which when applied to any given set of coordinates in the original list somehow magically derived the exact position of that systems portal the obvious objection to this was that after four hundred million years minimum there was no known coordinate system ever devised capable of reliably determining where something as small as a portal was unless the holes had all somehow automatically kept themselves in the same relative position all that time given the haphazard and cavalier attitude that dwellers tended to display towards anything especially hightech this was regarded as highly unlikely so the image hovering above the dark device in the centre of the audience chamber said if i may assume we are all happy we know what were talking about it looked around them again nobody demurred the dweller list the hologram said supposedly giving the approximate location of two million ancient portals dating from the time of the third diasporian age has been dismissed as an irrelevance a lie or a myth for over a quarter of a billion years the socalled transform supposed to complete the information required to access this secret network has proved as elusive as it is unlikely to work if it does exist nevertheless some new information has come to light thanks to seer now major taak fassin was aware that he was being looked at again he just kept staring at the hologram a little under four hundred years ago the hologram said seer taak took part in an extended expedition a delve as it is known which took him amongst the dwellers of nasqueron and specifically into the company of a group of dweller youngsters called the dimajrian tribe while with them he encountered an antique dweller who in a fit of generosity unusual in his kind granted seer taak access to a small library of information part of a still larger hoard this was the wrong way round the myth not the fact fassin had been with valseir for centuries and the dimajrian tribe for less than a year he hoped that the rest of the admirals information was more reliable all the same he had a sudden vivid memory of choal valseir huge and ancient accoutred with rags draped in lifecharms floating absently within his vast nestbowl of a study deep in the lost section of abandoned cloudtunnel on the rim of a giant dying storm which had long since broken up and dissipated clouds you are like clouds valseir had told fassin at the time he hadnt understood what the ancient dweller had meant the raw data containing this information was passed on to the shrievalty for analysis the image hovering above the black device said twenty years later after the usual analysis and interpretation and youd imagine with plenty of time for second thoughts reevaluations and sudden inspirations it was shared with the jeltick under the terms of an infotrade agreement the jeltick were an arachnoid species eightlimbed ar in the conventional shorthand of the galactic community obsessive cataloguers they were one of the galaxys two most convincing selfappointed historian species timid cautious deliberate and very inquisitive at a safe remove they had been around for much longer than quick species usually lasted somehow the jeltick contrived to notice something the shrievalty had missed the hologram continued now fassin noticed it was colonel somjomions turn to look awkward and aggrieved heads have rolled due to this incompetence the image told them it smiled ido not speak figuratively colonel somjomion compressed her lips and rechecked something on the machine she was in charge of within months the hologram said the jeltick sent their best excuse for a battle fleet to the zateki system unexplored for millennia which lies about eighteen years from the portal at rijom they got there in twenty years so they were not exactly dawdling it ought to be pointed out that the jeltick would never normally try anything so dynamic or risky something at zateki seriously chewed up the jeltick ships and what is assumed to have been the sole survivor was later found by a voehn craft the surviving ship was fleeing all upon it were dead and its biomind was deranged invoking the mercy of an unknown god and babbling for forgiveness for what had been its mission which had been to search for the remains of something called the second ship and therein the dweller list transform ah thought fassin the second ship theory that was a subfallacy of the whole dweller list delusion the further you looked into the list myth the more complicated it got and the more possibilities appeared to open up all nonsense of course or so everybody had thought somehow we assume through spies the beyonders and possibly through the beyonders the e disconnect got to hear about this the beyonders attacked the ulubis portal less than a month later and the e discons sudden interest in ulubis also dates from this point when the jeltick realised the secret was no longer theirs alone the image said they broadcastleaked it to avoid accusations of partiality and maintain their reputation for disinterestedness the projection gave a sour look this has not gone down too well with the ascendancy either one imagines the jeltick will be made to pay somewhere down the line in any event five full squadrons of the summed fleet over three hundred capital ships retraced the jeltick fleets route to rijom and zateki but found nothing under full disclosure it has turned out that the information concerned was in any case incomplete the lead is as it were only halfformed the jeltick move was a gamble reckoned even by themselves at having a less than twelve per cent likelihood of success for such a cautious species to make such a wild wager with their reputation and future alone indicates the value of the prize they sought the hologram brought its gloved hands together producing an audible clap so now almost everybody who wants to know about the new transform lead such as it may be does know and this would appear to include the disconnect of the starveling cult and quiet though they may have seemed recently the beyonders who may or may not be in league with the e discon hence the most recent attacks on ulubis and the coming invasion but be aware the image said growling eyes narrowing that behind this terrible threat lies a fabulous prize if we can discover where the hidden portals lie assuming that they are indeed there to be discovered we may well be able to intervene in the ulubis system before the starveling cult invasion force arrives it would be entirely worth the most supreme effort and sacrifice for that result alone even more importantly however this is a prize that could that just might that can unlock the galaxy and usher in a new golden age of prosperity and security for the mercatoria for all of us the projection paused once more our strategists estimate that even with the best result from those actions we shall ask you to undertake the chances of success remain below fifty per cent the projection appeared to draw breath but that is not the point the smallest chance of the greatest reward when so few may compete for it makes the contention compulsory all that matters is that we may have been presented with an extraordinary utterly unprecedented opportunity we would all be in serious even ultimate dereliction of duty if we did not do everything in our power to seize that opportunity not just on our own behalf but for the good of all our fellow creats and for those generations yet unborn the image smiled one of its cold smiles the orders i have to pass on to you from the complector council are to seer now major taak the projection was already looking straight at fassin now so did a lot of the people in the chamber return to nasqueron seek out the ancient dweller who gave you the original information and try to find out all you can about the dweller list the second ship its location and the transform and to everybody else here the image looked around all the others in the chamber first provide every aid you can to major taak in the furtherance of his mission including doing nothing that will delay obstruct or compromise it and second return the ulubis system to an invasionimminent fullscale totalwar footing immediately and prepare to oppose the coming invasion your goal should be and i do not exaggerate here to resist to the very last creat to the very last mortal to the very last breath the hologram seemed to stand back a little and take the measure of them all i would say to all of you that without doubt your fate lies in your own hands more importantly so potentially does the fate of the mercatoria and the civilised galaxy the rewards for success will be unprecedented in their scale and splendour the punishments for failure will begin with ignominy and disgrace and plumb new depths of ghastliness beyond one last thing you know that the engineership esttaun zhiffir and battlefleet escort which sent this signal are still seventeen years from reaching ulubis system i must tell you that significant elements of the summed fleet above squadron strength were dispatched in your direction from zenerre even before the eship left and have been making well in excess of the eship fleets velocity directly towards ulubis ever since the attack squadrons will arrive years before the eship and its escort fleet their war craft will be fully deployed for uninhibited battle against all who oppose the mercatoria and depend upon it they will prevail the image smiled again how i wish i could tell you exactly how soon from this point they will appear however even i do not know this signal was sent from the fleet accompanying the eship and we do not yet know quite how close to light speed they have pushed themselves or how close they will have by the time this signal arrives we can only hazard if the disconnecters leave off for as long as another couple of years the attack squadrons may well arrive before them otherwise they will descend upon a system already fallen to the enemy or one would hope still somehow resisting their reaction when they arrive largely depends on your determination fortitude and ability to absorb punishment the projection smiled now any further questions the beyonders must have anticipated them their ships were already making ninety per cent

taince confirmed she was watching the scintillations ahead where the wildly spinning whirling somersaulting wreckage of the petronel was being hit by further enemy munitions the remains were dropping

avoid cluttering her visual feed no positive results from the laser fire being laid down by the mitrailleuse and cartouche their missiles were still heading towards the hostile craft no sign of reply

may all be dead at least it should be quick still flare still flare she confirmed again waiting judging wondering if this would work tacspace showed the secondhand now increasingly outofdate contacts the petronel had spotted as a glowing slowly dispersing cloud of pulsing yellow echoes the two hard contacts still registering on the sensors of the mitrailleuse and the cartouche and now confirmed by other nearby ships were strobing red dots slowly closing the wreckage from the petronel was a stippled mess of purple dead ahead and drifting closer slowly spreading its okay taince told herself we can do this they had rehearsed all this trained and exercised in vr time after time specifically for this eventuality this ambush and manoeuvre and response suite they knew that the beyonders would anticipate a fleet being sent from zenerre to ulubis there was of course only one quickest possible route the straightline direct one its laserclean rule turned into the shallowest of curves solely by allowing for the minimal drift of the respective systems as they circled with the rest of the galactic outskirts round the great wheels core fifty thousand light years away so did the fleet take exactly that route laying itself open to ambush by other ships and more threateningly to mines mines indeed all you needed was a few tonnes of crushed rock smash a tiny asteroid into gravel the size of rice grains spread it across the course the fleet would take and if they were travelling quickly enough you could waste the lot so close to light speed that you didnt need to have anything home in and explode just getting in the way was devastating enough or did you loop further out avoiding likely interception but arriving later and did you stick together obvious but sensible or split up all the individual craft taking their own route to ulubis only regrouping near their destination very risky but potentially a tactic that the enemy wouldnt have anticipated in the end the fleet admiral had chosen one out of a bunch of faintly bowed courses recommended by the strategists and their subai machines and they followed that route en masse it was a gamble the chances were that they would be intercepted especially if the beyonders possessed the kind of materiel they were thought to have between zenerre and ulubis the obvious intercept strategy was to station minor ships and other sensor platforms about halfway then position the intercept units well behind that already making high speed to give them time to gather for the attack in a direct pitched battle there was no possibility that the vastly outnumbered and outarmed beyonder ships would prevail but then they didnt need or want a pitched battle they just had to slow the mercatoria fleet down as much as possible they wanted skirmishes ambushes and to use the fleets own colossal velocity against it the mercatoria fleet could in theory have gone slow and safe assured just by its sheer weight of arms of being able to blast anything ahead of it out of the skies its orders though were to get to ulubis as quickly as possible regardless and so it had to travel almost ultimately quickly and risk being torn to bits by a few small ships and nothing more hightech than a few tonnes of pulverised rock theyd come up with a surprise plan of their own needle ships were designed to fit through narrow wormholes it was that simple the biggest arteria and the widest portals were a kilometre across but the average hole diameter was under fifty metres and a few very old arteria were barely ten metres wide it took a vast amount of energy andor matter to make an arteria and its two portals and it was difficult expensive and dangerous to expand them once they were emplaced there was for the mercatoria little point in having a network of superfast travel connections scattered throughout the galaxy if your ships were too fat to fit and so the proportions of war craft the ultimate levers of power for the mercatoria just as they had been for all earlier imperia semimperia and others who had thought to enforce their peace or impose their will on the galactic community over the aeons were derived from the width of the channels they would have to negotiate in the past some great capital ships could autodeconstruct to become a shower of smaller slimmer components which could fit through a wormhole and were then capable of reassembling themselves at the far end but this had proved a wasteful way of designing war craft needle ships were simpler and cheaper for all their astounding complexity and cost the biggest craft in the battle fleet heading from zenerre to ulubis were a kilometre long but less than forty metres across the beam almost right at the enemy ship the missile fired by the mitrailleuse winked out replaced by a tiny debris field signals from the cruiser sensors and status confirmed this that missile snapped a hostile profile before it was picked off weapons reported sidescreening the data the missile had plipped back sceuri ship sulcus or fosse class one tactics officer sent so they were dealing at least in that ship with the deathspiral taince thought that particular beyonder group was exclusively sceuri waterworlders with a hatred for the mercatoria in general and those of their own kind who were a part of it in particular which meant most of them renowned for their viciousness and without even the excuse that they were protecting their precious civilian habitats they didnt have any they were almost entirely shipbased a bunch of piratical terrorists in other words just fanatics and yet as far as anyone knew the deathspiral hadnt taken part in the attack on the ulubis portal so that makes four not three varieties of beyonder operating in this volume the admiral sent saying what taince was thinking two more and well have the set she replied back in tacspace she watched the cartouches missile curving to meet the twisting trace that was the other nearest hostile it joined it overlaying it a white blink then an infinitesimal spray of debris red speckled with green dthree hit hostile hit tainces two fellow tacticians aboard the flagship made whooping noises well done dthree said kisipt still flare still flare taince ignored the celebratory noises and her own feeling of excitement she watched tacspace listened to the ship chatter felt the seconds count down the fleet was still spreading the vessels courses fanning out like thin stems from a short vase taince held off and held off and held off until she could almost feel fleet admiral kisipt and everybody else getting ready to shout at her forty seconds she sent deflare patternfive reverse copy said her own helm officer then the other acknowledgements followed in tacspace the flowering widening ship tracks immediately started to bunch up again the distances between them closing cone going to be tight but it was doable they could get back to their earlier formation before they encountered the remains of the petronel that was all that mattered for now tacspace showed the fleet regrouping smoothly the view ahead showed the fiercely glowing nebula of wreckage from the petronel seeming to spread across the sky as they approached it encroaching onto the dark starless tube on either side she zoomed in picking out a clear spot near the centre of the debris field checking it in tacspace there the two hard contacts winked out became orange and started to spread tacspace was throwing out probability cones estimating where the ships might be ahead the sky briefly glowed a pale uniform yellow indicating that the rest of the beyonder fleet could be anywhere within that volume then a scattering of bright red hard contacts firmed up out of the yellow wash dispersing it the fleet reformed they were back where they had started if nothing else taince thought they ought to have confused the beyonders pattern zero all ships even in the lifepod she felt the flagship lurch as it braked manoeuvred and then accelerated again she watched it all on tacspace the fleet was collapsing thinning extending itself forwards and back ship after ship slipping into a single long line nose to tail bcfour back down about ten deleven forward five bthree and btwo centre on deight bcfour maintain there taince watched them all in tacspace shuffling jostling ordering them into position until they were all lined up ships of the line yes vice the fleet admiral sent also watching sir there were no collisions no botched moves no drives left running too long incinerating the craft behind the line formation came together as smoothly as it ever had in vr sims the battleship gisarme led the way blasting away a few tiny particles left over from the wreck of the petronel and laying down a stuttered laser barrage to try to intercept any mines kinetic or otherwise left in the way this was a gamble too if it worked theyd be through and away one after another charging mobhanded right behind the gisarme like a long sequence of battering rams if it didnt work there was a chance that first the gisarme would hit something and then theyd all hit whatever was left of it potentially the whole fleet could be wiped out in one long pileup of cascading collisions the chances were small smaller the simulations indicated than the risks associated with any of the other manoeuvres but only because this one included a safety premium due to its assumed unexpectedness its sheer novelty value if theyd got that wrong it was much riskier than all the rest the manoeuvre caught the beyonders unawares it was profoundly not standard summed fleet behaviour the needle ships were one giant needle now plunging through the debris field of the wrecked destroyer firing all around them scoring a couple of hits on distant hostiles desperately closing tacspace showed the lines of fire blazing out from the fleet like spokes from a filamentthin shaft and missiles spinning away like tiny glowing emeralds the beyonders were attempting to close but it was too late all that the nearest hostile units accomplished was their own destruction in two minutes the mercatorial fleet was through without loss and a minute later its entire firepattern was rearward a swirling skirt of crimson lines combing and coning into the emptying depths of space behind any further engagement now would be entirely on their terms and the fleets vastly superior firepower would have the first word and the last nice work vice fleet admiral kisipt sounded a little surprised a little disappointed and moderately impressed taince knew that a lot of her fellow officers had wanted a proper battle but this way had been better quicker more elegant nice work from a voehn that was real praise sir taince kept her thoughtvoice calm but inside it was her turn to whoop submerged in her dark womb of fluid tubes and wires her fists clenched a smile appeared on her until then frowning face and a little shiver shook her cradled body the kehar family house on murla an island off the south coast a few hundred kilometres from borquille was another spherical building a quarter of the size of the hierchons palace but remarkable for being balanced on top of a great upthrust of water precisely like a ball balanced on a water jet in a fairground saluus kehar perfectly groomed glowing with health and generally looking as smoothly gleaming as one of his companys spaceships met fassin personally on the slim suspension bridge connecting the house with the spit of land jutting out into the ancient drowned caldera where the waters foamed and roared and spumed and the house balanced barely trembling on the giant column of water fassin great to see you hey that uniform suits you fassin had thought hed be briefedindoctrinatedpsychetestedpeptalkedfuckknowswhatted and then bundled aboard ship to be whisked straight to nasqueron but even faced with arguably the single greatest emergency in its history the ulubine bureaucracy had a set way of doing things and central to this ethos appeared to be not doing anything too momentous too quickly just in case the rest of the session in the hierchons audience chamber after the ai projection had issued its orders and asked for questions had involved a great deal of talk speechmaking pointscoring backcovering backtargeting and preemptive blameavoidance the image of admiral quile answered all the questions tirelessly and with a patience that was probably the most sure sign possible that it really was an ai talking a human especially an admiral used to being obeyed instantly and without argument would have lost patience long before the proceedings finally ground to a halt fassin had been pointed at and referred to several times and been left with the distinct impression that this was all his fault which he supposed in a way it was it had all gone on so long that fassins stomach had perhaps in sympathy with a large component of the mood in the chamber started grumbling he hadnt eaten since early breakfast on glantine after all you are quite sure the image above the cookingpot device asked eventually when even the most talkative of those present seemed to have run out of questions to ask and points and delicate portions of the anatomy to cover there was no hint of either pleading or relief in the projections voice fassin thought either would have been appropriate very well then i will bid you farewell and good luck the image of the human male with a bald tattooed scalp and lined face standing there in his muchdecorated armoured suit looked around them one last time executed a short formal bow to the hierchon and disappeared nobody seemed to know quite what to do for a moment then the black potbellied machine in the centre of the floor started to make a loud humming noise shrievalty colonel somjomion and cessorian clerkregnant voriel attending as best they could to the machines they had been put in charge of when the others had been required to leave the chamber started peering intently at various screens and controls the circle of mirrorarmoured troopers each tapped one ear then brought up their guns pointing them at the cookingpot device which was humming loudly now and starting to glow in the infrared the hum rose and took on extra harmonics deepening until the machine was visibly vibrating some of those close to the device either drew back or looked like they wanted to as if fearing that the machine was going to explode the air around its ribbed flanks shimmered above it the atmosphere seemed to writhe and quiver as though some mutant ghost of the image that had stood there was still fighting to escape then just as the potbellied thing started to glow a deep cherry red around its midriff it all faded away noise and vibration and heat people relaxed somjomion and voriel took deep breaths and nodded at the hierchon the troopers shouldered their arms whatever complex substrate inside the dark device had played host to the ai image of the admiral had been turned to slag the hierchon ormilla spoke from his glittering esuit i invoke the full emergency powers of the war emergency plan martial law will be declared at the close of this extended session let those earlier excluded resume their places the flurry of politicking that fassin had witnessed earlier was made to look mild in comparison as without actually telling anybody not cleared to know about it any details what was becoming known as the current emergency was talked over and enhanced roles and new responsibilities were discussed squabbled over between and within departments revised rerevised traded further discussed and rererevised before finally being handed out fassins belly was still making noises when the full session broke up and he was called to a briefing with his superiors in the shrievalty ocula they kept him waiting in an anteroom within the oculas floor inside the hierchons palace he shed one layer of his cumbersome court clothes and found some human food in a dispenser in a curving outside corridor with a view over the reception plaza long evening shadows towers and spires burnished red with sunset he looked for some obvious sign that the city planet and system were all under martial law again but saw nothing he was still wiping his fingers when they called him in major taak colonel somjomion said welcome he was shown to a large circular table surrounded by uniformed shrievalty personnel they were mostly human or whule though there were two jajuejein doing their best to look humanoid and seated and a single oerileithe in a duller and slightly smaller version of the hierchons esuit the discus of which was halfhidden in a wide slot in the floor it seemed to radiate chill and dominate the room all the same somjomion indicated the oerileithe this is colonel hatherence she told fassin she will be your superior in this mission pleasure sure the oerileithe boomed twisting fractionally towards fassin the colonels esuit had no transparent faceplate like the hierchons just armour and sensors giving no sign of the creature within fassin nodded maam hed thought the only oerileithe in the system apart from the hierchon were basically ormillas near family and his girlfriends harem was though only just too pejorative he wondered whether colonel hatherence fitted neatly into either category or not it was explained to him that they could not of course just send him off alone to do what he was supposed to do over the next hour as communications memos and remote audiences with the hierchon himself interrupted somjomion fassin was gradually given to understand that the task assigned quite specifically to him alone was one which would nevertheless unarguably be best accomplished if he was escorted and overseen by people the hierchon and his claque of cohorts felt they could actually trust accordingly fassin would not be alone on his next delve he would benefit from the protection and guidance of colonel hatherence here and from that of two of his fellow human seers braam ganscerel chief seer of the most senior sept of all sept tonderon and as fassins junior paggs yurnvic of sept reheo with whom he had worked before chief seer ganscerel was currently readying himself to return as rapidly as possible from a habitat orbiting quarunze and would rendezvous with colonel hatherence major taak and seer yurnvic on third fury from which the delve or delves would be conducted as soon as possible quarunze was the other big gasgiant in ulubis system there were two smaller examples as well all had dweller populations too though compared to nasquerons they were negligible in size getting ganscerel from quarunze to nasqueron and the third fury base would take well over a week fassin suspected the old guy liked his luxuries and anyway wouldnt be physically able to cope with much more than one gee during the journey even if he wanted to fassin very much feeling his way in all this suddenly caught up within organisations and power structures he never imagined having anything much to do with and having to cope with networks of rank and superiority he had only the vaguest working knowledge of had been about to start banging the table probably only figuratively and complaining about not being able to start the job hed been very clearly ordered to begin as soon as possible then they mentioned ganscerel and his journey back from quarunze and he saw that there was probably no way he was going to be able to move this forward faster than the pace that had already been decided which in a way suited him fine if the system really was under threat of imminent invasion and he was being asked to go on the most important delve of his life in the midst of it and given the amount of time they were being told there was before the invasion took place there was every likelihood hed still be inplanet when it happened then he wanted needed one last delve of his own into borquilles underworld its own hazy clouded turbulent and dangerous netherenvironment he suddenly had things to do and people or at least one person to meet the delay caused by ganscerel might work out quite usefully of course they probably wouldnt want to let him out of their sight so hed have to find a way round that he also suspected that they wanted the whole delve done at a distance from third fury with him and ganscerel and paggs yurnvic all lying wired up in the base there and communicating with remotes down in nasqueron itself certainly ganscerel wasnt capable of jumping into a gascraft breathing gillfluid and taking multiple gees squished in shockgel he hadnt even done any of that stuff when he was young fassin would have to try and find a way round that too he complained as crossly as he could pretend about not being allowed to get on with things and then demanded some time off you mean leave somjomion said goggleeyed i believe you have some very intense briefing and training ahead of you major taak many days worth which will have to be crammed into hours there is absolutely no time for leave he explained about ganscerels age infirmity and therefore slow rate of travel somjomion looked indignant but checked this finally having another hurried conference with the hierchon himself indeed she said sighing chief seer ganscerel is profiled as being unable to withstand forces greater than gee and is already complaining at the prospect of that it will be nine days before he can reach the third fury base colonel somjomion narrowed her eyes at fassin we shall proceed with your fuller briefing first thing tomorrow major taak if there is any time left over a day or two of leave may be granted i guarantee nothing so another emergency saluus said he smiled broadly tm told i have you to thank for this fass he held out a slim flute fassin accepted the glass entirely my own work sal was he supposed one of the few people in the system for whom the prospect of a war emergency plan coming into force was genuinely cause for celebration really saluus said youre even more eminent than i thought and you still look about twenty you dog sal laughed the easy laugh of a man who could afford to be generous with his compliments sal chinked glasses they were drinking champagne some ancient krug with a meaningless date all the way from earth and probably worth as much as a small spaceship it had a pleasant taste though not many bubbles the two men stood on a balcony looking out over the caldera the surging waters beneath formed a great frothed slope spreading all around from underneath the house a shallow cone of billows and hummocks of foam all furiously bunching and collapsing and rushing ever outwards to where the fractious turmoil settled slightly and became merely wildly charging waves the balcony was just above the equatorial rim of the house so the column of water actually supporting the place was hidden from them but the crater walls a couple of kilometres distant echoed with the tumult they had climbed up here after a modest reception and light lunch with a few of sal and his wifes friends notables all who were here for the afternoon fassin had secured an invitation to stay for a couple of days until the shrievalty needed him back in borquille he had changed out of his dark grey shrievalty uniform into casual clothes sal leaned back against the barrier well thank you for coming to visit fassin nodded thank you for inviting me my pleasure just mildly surprised you asked they trust you sal fassin gave a small shrug ineeded to get away from all that military shit and they wouldnt let me just skip out the door of the palace and into boogeytown he looked out at the tumbling waters anyway a glance at salbeen too long he wanted to give the impression that this had been a good excuse to effect some sort of reconciliation hed long wanted to make he and sal had met up only very occasionally over the two centuries since the wormholes destruction usually at the sort of gigantic social events it was hard to get out of but easy to remain alone within they hadnt really talked even now meeting up there were whole aspects of their lives that somehow didnt need to be gone into how and what they had each been doing was a matter of public record and it would almost be an insult to inquire fassin had recognised sals wife from news and social images hadnt really needed introducing there hadnt been a single person at the reception below alien or otherwise servants apart obviously about whom fassin who was no great social observer couldnt have written a short biography saluus probably didnt know as much about fassin as vice versa but hed already congratulated him on his engagement to jaal tonderon so he knew that much or more likely perhaps he just had an efficient social secretary with a good database so what can you tell me fass sal asked casually he wrinkled his nose can you say anything about the emergency well about whatevers causing all the fuss there was more than a fuss there was lowlevel war starting the day after martial law was declared there had been a sequence of attacks mostly on isolated and systemedge craft and settlements though with some worrying assaults further insystem including one on a navarchy dockhabitat in sepektes own trailing lagrange that had killed over a thousand nobody knew whether it was beyonders behind this resurgence of violence or the e discon advanced forces or a mixture of both more oddly but for fassin far more disturbingly somebody had nuked the high summer house of sept litibiti back on glantine just the day before missiled it from space like it was a military facility bizarre and unprecedented the place had been empty save for a handful of unlucky gardeners and cleaners keeping the place ticking over until the appropriate season but it made seers throughout the system worried that theyd suddenly for some reason become targets fassin had sent a message to slovius saying that maybe they should consider shifting the whole sept elsewhere on glantine head for an outofseason hotel perhaps hed yet to receive a reply which might be slovius ignoring his advice or just the authorities new messagetraffic checking and censoring software struggling to cope neither would surprise tell me what you know fassin suggested ill fill in what i can they want lots of warships fass sal gave a sadlooking smile lots and lots of warships were to turn out as many as we can for as long as we can though they want them sooner rather than later and any advanced projects that might take longer than a year even existing ones are being deprioritised were to gasline a whole bunch of stuff for sal paused cleared his throat and waved one hand hell idiot stuff were to roughcut a whole load of civilian conversions armed merchantmen oneshot cloudminers tooledup cruise liners and so on we didnt even do that in the last emergency so whatever it is its serious its presumably what our military friends would call credible and its not very far away over to you lot i cant tell you fassin said carefully most of which i guess wouldnt interest you anyway he wondered how much he could say how much he needed to say supposedly to do with something called the epiphanyfive disconnect sal raised an eyebrow hmm bit away wonder why theyd bother richer pickings inward of where they are but a significant part of the summed fleet is on the way were told fassin grinned mmhmm i see and what about you sal asked dipping closer to fassin voice dropping whats your part in all this fassin wondered how much the continual rush of noise produced by the waves below would mask their words if anybody was listening from far away since hed arrived hed showered and put on a change of clothes hed requested from the house caught without the necessary means of attire due to an extended stay away from home hed explained needlessly he got the impression the servants were perfectly used to providing clothes of varying sizes and for whatever sex to house guests still even without the proscribed horror of nanotech it was possible to make bugs very small indeed these days had the shrievalty or the hierchons people put some sort of trace or mike on him had sal did sal put surveillance on his guests as a matter of course his host was waiting for an answer fassin looked into the drink a few small bubbles of gas rose to the surface and broke giving some tiny proportion of the substance of earth to the atmosphere of a planet twenty thousand light years away i just did my job sal delved talked took away what the dwellers would let me take away most of which was not momentous not important not going to change anything much at all not something everybody would want or risk everything for he looked saluus kehar in the eye just stumbled my way through life you know over whatever turned up never knowing what would lead to what whoever does sal asked then nodded but i see sorry i cant really tell you too much more sal smiled and looked out at the slope of artificial surf the pandemonium of waves beyond and the sheer cliffs further away still brownblack beneath a hazy azure sky ah your minder he said the esuit of colonel hatherence of the shrievalty appeared to one side low over the foam floating out over the mad froth of waters like a great fat grey and gold wheel whirling vanesets on either side of her esuit kept the colonel from sinking into the maelstrom for all its massive size when you were standing next to it the esuit looked very small from up here she giving you any problems no shes okay doesnt insist i salute her or call her maam all the time happy to keep things informal all the same he was hoping to get the colonel out of the way somehow either before or once he got down into nasqueron fassin watched the colonel as she picked her way across the scape of waves but can you imagine trying to sneak into boogeytown with that dogging your every move he asked even just for one last night sal snorted the dives and the ceilings are too low fassin laughed this is like sex he thought well like the seductionscenario thing like the whole stupid mating dance of willyouwontyou doyoudontyou rigmarole tempting sal leading him on he wondered if hed seemed sufficiently mysterious yet hinted at maybe being available he needed this man dinner with sal his wife their concubines and some business associates including amongst the latter a whule a jajuejein and a quaup the talk was of new attacks on distant outposts martial law delays in comms restrictions in travel and who would gain and who would lose from the new emergency nobody on any of the couches seemed to anticipate losing more than a few trivial freedoms for a while colonel hatherence sat silent in one corner needing no external sustenance thank you but happy indeed honoured to be there while they consumed nourishment communicated conversationally and intercoursed socially while she continued her studies muchneeded screening up on nasqueron and its famous dwellers drinks seminarcotic foods drug bowls a human acrobat troupe entertained them floodlit beyond the dining rooms balcony no im serious sal shouted at his guests gesturing at the acrobats swinging through the air on ropes and trapezes if they fall they almost certainly die so much air in the water you cant float sink right down get caught up in the underturbulence no idiot sal told his wife not enough air to breathe some people left drinks later just the humans to sals trophy room corridors and rooms too small sorry for colonel hatherence not minding so to sleeping good nights sals wife going to bed and the remaining few soon just the two of them overlooked by the stuffed lacquered dryshrunk or encased heads of beasts from dozens of planets you saw taince just before the portal went dinner day or two before equatower fassin waved in what might have been the general direction of borquille you could see the lights of the equatower from the house a thin stipple of red climbing into the sky sometimes perversely clearer above when the lower atmosphere was hazed and the higher beacons shone down at a steeper angle through less air she okay sal asked then threw his head back and laughed too loudly as though it matters it was two centuries ago still anyway she was fine good they drank their drinks cognac also from earth long long ago far far away fassin got swim oh shit he said ive got swim swim said saluus swim fassin said you know when your head kind of seems to swim because you suddenly think hey im a human being but im twenty thousand light years from home and were all living in the midst of madshit aliens and superweapons and the whole fucking bizarre insane swirl of galactic history and politics that isnt it weird and thats what swing swirl sal said looking genuinely confused no swim fassin shouted not able to believe that sal hadnt heard of this concept he thought everybody had some people most people come to think of it or so hed been told never got swim but lots did not just humans either though dwellers mind you never wasnt even in their vocabulary never heard of it sal confessed well didnt imagine you might have hey you want to see something whatever it is i cannot fucking wait come with me last time i heard that we agreed no more of those fuck so we did total retraction show me what you got to show me walk this way ah now just fuck off fassin followed sal through to the inner recess of his study it was kind of what he might have expected if hed given the matter any thought lots of wood and softly glowing pools of light framed stuff and a desk the size of a sunken room funnylooking twisted bits of large and gleaming metal or some other shiny substance sitting in one corner fassin guessed these were starship bits there where what am i supposed to be looking at this sal held up a very small twistedlooking bit of metal mounted on a wooden plinth fassin tried very hard not to let his shiver show he was nothing like as drunk as he was trying to appear to be yeah an whassat overdoing it but sal didnt seem to notice saluus held the piece of oddlooking metal up before fassins eyes this is that thing i got out of that fucking downed ship my man sal looked at it swallowed and took a deep breath fassin saw sals lip tremble this is what the fuckers going to break down fassin thought he slapped one hand on sals shoulder this is no good he told him we need different we need i dont know something we need not this not what is before us here we need something different elsewhen or elsestuff or elsewhere this might be my last night of freedom sal he gripped the other man hard by the shoulder of his perfectly tailored jacket im serious you dont know how bad things might get for me oh fuck sal you dont know how bad things might get for all of us and i cant fucking tell you and this could be my last night of fun anywhere and and and youre showing me some fucking coat hook or something and i dont know he swiped weakly at the twisted piece of metal patting it away and still missing then he sniffed and drew himself up sorry he said soberly sorry sal he patted the other mans shoulder but this is maybe my last ah night of fun and look i feel totally charged for anything wish boogeytown was right outside really do but on the other hand its been a long few days and maybe no not maybe maybe definitely in fact not that just plain definitely the sensible thing to do is just go to bed and you serious sal said dropping the metal piece on its wooden plinth onto the desk behind him about sleep fassin said gesturing wildly well it no you moron about boogeytown what eh i didnt mention boogeytown yes you did sal said laughing i did well fuck sal had a flier automatic to the point of being nearly banned under the ai laws loaded with repair mechanisms that were not quite nanotech but only by such a tinytinytiny little bit deeply civilian but with total military clearance if a grand fleet admiral of the summed fucking fleet stepped into this baby and toggled his authority it would only decrease the fuckers allareas multivolumes access profile down in the hangar deck walk this way har har they left the top down part of the way to clear their heads it was very very cold they set down somewhere where litter blew about under the fans of the flier fassin hadnt thought there was still such a thing as litter boogeytown was much as he remembered it they hit the lows looking for highs they trawled the bowlbars and narctail parlours coming up with a brimming catch of buzz and girls fassin meanwhile trying to edge sal in a certain bars direction while sal vaguely recalling this wasnt supposed to be just fun but also a way of getting his old pal fass to open up with more potentially useful and lucrative details about whatever the fuck was going on tried to get his oldnew best buddy to move in a certain informational direction but without much success and anyway with decreasing amounts of concern and an increasing feeling of ohwhogivesafuck fassin too was getting frustrated still angling for one more move and one particular streetlet one particular bar but they were here now in this diamondwalled emporium called the narcateria where the sleaze was so coolly glitz it almost hurt surrounded by people who hadnt seen sal in so long and just had to keep him where he was dont you dare go away you wicked man you and is this your friend where you been keeping him can i sit here hmm me too me too so eventually he had to stumble away and make a call in a private public booth and then head for the toilet where he threw up in a thin burning stream all the alcohol hed drunk since the last time hed been to the loo over the hole so it looked and sounded authentic then wash his face and rejoin the drunken stonedout fray of breathcatching loveliness waiting for the right girl the one all this had been about all of it asking to go to sals in the first place then getting him drunk and seeming to get drunk himself which he was but not that drunk and then dropping hints about boogeytown all so that he could get away and get here and see this one particular girl who finally appeared nearly an hour later when he was just starting to despair but there she was perfect and calm and quietly beautiful as ever though looking quite different again with whitegold hair swinging heavy as the real carat article about her neartriangular face chin just made for holding strawberrybruise lips for kissing tiny little nose for nuzzling cheeks for stroking eyes for gazing into depths ah depths brows for licking forehead for licking too licking dry of sexsweat after oo oo oo just too strenuous a session aun liss the one real love of his life his controlling passion older again but not as old as she should be looking different living different being different called different called ko now and that was all not aun liss but she would always be aun liss to him no need to say her real name a lot of what passed between them wasnt said anyway dressed in salarygirl clothes nothing special revealing or provocative nevertheless she held out her hand nearby surrounded by actually nearly drowning in utter human female and superstimulus hyperpulchritude lovelinessence even sal looked impressed fass you dog aun liss was still holding out her hand back in sals flier sal was in the front being grievously attended to by the infamous segrette twins moaning fassin and aun in the back seat utterly happy to appear so archetypical they kissed for a long time then looking round shrugging at the frontseat antics the flier at this point not really going anywhere circling in a holding pattern a clinching pattern aun liss suggested she rose up and straddled him his hands up underneath the light dress she wore fingers still kneading her back as they continued to do once they were finally returned to the idiot kehar house poised over the column of water just as aun pointed out she was poised over his column this aloud for the benefit of anybody listening they both laughed not too loudly he hoped meanwhile she kept the dress on still even in the heat of it with his fingers pressing kneading moving above her arched spine producing little halfpained gasps until later when they were finally just lying together under a thin sheet she shucked off the dress and he just held her and this is what over the course of those several hours their fingers said drawing and tapping out the private effectively unbuggable code they had used for hundreds of years since she first became his

hands over uncle sloviuss forehead and got him to crinkle it which felt funny and made him squirm and wriggle and laugh and meant uncle slovius had to hold his ankles tight to stop him falling off fass stop wriggling i fine honest he already knew you were supposed to say im fine or i am fine but saying things like i fine was better because it made adults smile and sometimes hug sometimes it made them put a hand on your head and make a mess of your hair but never mind they went through the port door it was spring and so that was the house they were in he was big hed lived in all the houses except the summer house that one came next then he would have lived in them all then you started again that was how it worked uncle slovius ducked as they went through the doorway so he didnt bash his head umm mind your head he heard his dad say quietly somewhere behind him his mum sighed oh stop fussing dear he couldnt see his mum and dad because they were behind him and uncle slovius but he could hear them look i wasnt fussing i was just yes you he got that funny feeling in his tummy he got when mum and dad talked like that he did a slapaslapslap on uncle sloviuss forehead and said more about history more about history as they walked down to the flier uncle slovius laughed the shake came up through uncle sloviuss shoulders into his bottom and whole body my we are a keen student one word for it his mother said oh come on his dad said the boys just inquisitive yes yes youre right his mum said you could hear her breath through her words my mistake pardon me for expressing an opinion oh now look i didnt mean more about voerin voehn uncle slovius said ive got a voerin ive got a big one that talks and climbs and swims and jumps or can walk under the water too its got a gun that shoots other toys and ive got lots of little ones that just move theyve got guns too but theyre a bit small to see but they can make each other fall over ive nearly a hundred i watch attack squad voerin all the time my favourite is captain chunce cos hes clever i like commander saptpanuhr too and corporal qump cos hes funny jun and yoze both like commander saptpanuhr best theyre my friends do you watch attack squad voerin uncle slovius cant say ive ever caught it fass fassin frowned thinking he decided this probably meant no why didnt adults just say no when they meant no they sat in the flier he had to come down off uncle sloviuss shoulders but he got to sit beside him in the front he didnt even need to tell people hed be sick if he sat in the back any more a servant sat on the other side of him greatuncle fimender was behind with two old ladies who were girlfriends he was laughing and they were too his mum and dad were further back talking quiet his mum and dad were old but uncle slovius was really old and greatuncle fimender was really really old the flier went up into the air and went through the air making a noise like the attackship avenger did in attack squad voerin his model of the attackship avenger flew but only in supervised areas outdoors and shot guns and missiles and made the same noise hed wanted to bring it with him but not been allowed even after hed shouted he hadnt been allowed to bring any toys no toys at all he pulled at uncle sloviuss sleeve tell me about the voerin he tried to think what had made uncle slovius laugh more about history uncle slovius smiled the voehn are the culminas bully boys child said greatuncle fimender from the seat behind he was leaning over his breath had that funny sweet smell like it usually did greatuncle fimender was fond of a drink his voice was funny also sometimes like all the words were sort of one big word i wouldnt fixate too enthusiastically on the scum that stole our species birthright steady now fim uncle slovius said he looked round at greatuncle fimender but looked first at the servant except the servant didnt move or look back or anything if the wrong person took you seriously you might find yourself joining this rogue ai hmm he made a smile at greatuncle fimender who sat back again in the seat between the oldlady girlfriends and took a glass with a drink in it from a picnic tray be an honour he said in a quiet voice uncle slovius smiled down at fass the voehn went to earth a long long time ago fassin before humans made spaceships before they made sea ships almost how long ago about eight thousand years ago bce greatuncle fimender said though only just loud enough to hear uncle slovius didnt seem to hear fassin wasnt sure if greatuncle fimender was disagreeing with uncle slovius or not fassin stored bce away as an important number anyway they met human people on earth uncle slovius said and took them away with them on their ship to other stars and planets kidnapping the prims greatuncle fimender said sampling the barbs with prejudice eh he didnt sound like he was talking to him and uncle slovius fass didnt understand what greatuncle fimender was saying anyway the oldlady girlfriends were laughing well uncle slovius said with a small smile whos to say whether humans were kidnapped or not people in ancient egypt and mesopotamia and china were too primitive to know what was going on they probably thought the voehn were gods so they might have gone with them without being kidnapped and we dont even know that the voehn took whole people maybe they just took their cells or babies or foetuses or excised a few thousand fertilised eggs greatuncle fimender said then oh thank you my dear oops steady there in any event uncle slovius said the voehn took some human people and put them down on planets far away from earth and the human people grew up with other people and the culmina had the other people help the humans so that they became civilised quickly and invented all the things humans back on earth ever invented but these human people on the other planets always knew they were part of a galactic community hmm uncle slovius looked at him with a questionlook on his face fass nodded quickly he knew what a galactic community meant everybody else anyway people on earth kept on inventing things and eventually invented wormholes and portals the attackship avenger goes through wormholes and portals he told uncle slovius of course uncle slovius said and so when human people went out and met other alien people and joined their wormhole up with everybody elses wormhole they found out that they werent the first humans the alien people had met or had heard of because the humans who had been taken away to the other planets by the voehn were already quite well known remainder humans greatuncle fimender said from the seat behind his voice sounded funny like he might be going to burst out laughing or something uncle slovius looked round at him for a short bit well the terms dont matter too much even if they might sound a little harsh sometimes carefully chosen to keep us in our place remind us we owe them either way greatuncle fimender said the culmina tell us they had people look after earth after the voehn took the humans away to the other stars they made sure that nothing bad happened to earth like it being hit by a big rock greatuncle fimender made a sort of coughlaugh easy to claim fass looked round at greatuncle fimender he sort of wanted greatuncle fimender to be quiet so he could listen to uncle slovius but sort of didnt because the things greatuncle fimender was saying even if he didnt always understand all of them seemed to be saying things about the things uncle slovius was saying it was like they sort of agreed and didnt agree at the same time greatuncle fimender winked at him and gestured towards uncle slovius with his glass no no listen so people from earth got into the stars at last and found that there were aliens everywhere uncle slovius told him and some of them were us he smiled a broad smile and there were a lot more of the alien humans than there were of the ones who thought they were humanity greatuncle fimender said it sounded like he was sneering uncle slovius sighed and looked ahead the flier was flying over mountains with snow on them in front was a big bit of desert like a circle uncle slovius shook his head and didnt seem to want to say anything but greatuncle fimender did so fass turned round in his seat and listened to him and they were more technically advanced these socalled ahumans advanced but cowed servant species just like everybody else while all earths dreams of wild expansion were made to look like so much bellygas the answer to where is everybody turned out to be everywhere but the stake at the galactic poker game is a wormhole and so we had to fund our own and bring that to the table then discover that everywhere really meant everywhere and every damn thing you could see and every damn thing you couldnt belonged to some bugger every rock every planet moon and star every comet dust cloud and dwarf even the bloody nullfoam of space itself was somebodys home land on some godforsaken cinder pull out a shovel thinking you could dig something build something or make something of it and next thing you know an alien with two heads was poking both of them out of a burrow and telling you to fuck off or pointing a gun at you or a writ ha worse still hed never heard greatuncle fimender talk so much he wasnt sure that greatuncle fimender was really talking to uncle slovius or to him or even to his two oldlady girlfriends because he wasnt looking at any of them he was looking at the picnic table hinged down from the seat in front maybe looking at the glass and the decanter bottle on it and looking sad the two oldlady girlfriends patted him and one smoothed his hair which was very black indeed but still looked old prepping they call it he said maybe to himself or maybe to the picnic table bloody kidnapping he snorted putting people in their place holding them there letting us build our dreams then puncturing them he shook his head and drank from his shiny glass prepping fass asked to make sure he had the word right hmm oh yes well its something thats gone on for as long as anybody can remember uncle slovius said he sounded gentle and fass wasnt sure if uncle slovius was talking to him or to greatuncle fimender he sort of halflistened while he pulled out one of the fliers screens if hed been allowed to bring any toys hed definitely have brought his botpal and just asked but now these damn adults were making him use a screen he stared at the letters and numbers and things uncle slovius and greatuncle fimender were still talking he didnt want to have to talk he wanted to tapin like adults did he tried a few buttons after a while he got a lotsofbooks symbol with a big kid standing next to it and an ear symbol the big kid looked scruffy and was holding a drug bowl and his head was surrounded with lines and little moving satellites and flying birds oh well prepping he said but pressed text the screen said prepping a very longestablished practice used lately by the culmina amongst others is to take a few examples of a precivilised species from their home world usually in clonoclastic or embryonic form and make them subject speciesslavesmercenariesmentored so that when the people from their home world finally assume the galactic stage they are not the most civilisedadvanced of their kind often theyre not even the most numerous grouping of their kind species so treated are expected to feel an obligation to their socalled mentors who will also generally claim to have diverted comets or otherwise prevented catastrophes in the interim whether they have or not this practice has been banned in the past when pangalactic laws see galactic council have been upheld but tends to reappear in less civilised times practice variously referred to as prepping lifting or aggressive mentoring localrelevant terminology ahuman rhuman advanced and remainder human and that was just the start he scratched his head too many long words and this wasnt even an adult pedia maybe he should have found the notsobig kids site they were landing wow he hadnt even noticed they were near the ground the desert was covered with fliers of different sizes and there were lots in the air too and lots of people they got out and walked across the sand though a lot of people stayed in their fliers he got to go on uncle sloviuss shoulders again away in the distance in the centre of a big circle was a tower with a big blob on top and that was where the bad machine was which had been found hiding in a cave in the mountains and caught by the cessoria the cessoria and the lustrals caught bad machines hed tried watching lustral patrol a few times but it was too much for old people with talk and kissing the bad machine in the blob on top of the big tower was allowed to make a speech but it was too full of long words he was getting bored and it was very hot no toys uncle slovius said shush at him twice he sort of tried to pretendstrangle uncle slovius with his thighs and knees to get back at him for going shush twice but uncle slovius didnt seem to notice mum and dad were still talking quietly rolling their eyes and shaking their heads at each other as usual greatuncle fimender and the two oldlady girlfriends had stayed in the flier then lustrals in a flier humans and a whule like a big grey bat said things then at last it was time and the bad machine was killed but even that wasnt very good the blob on top of the tower just went red and made lots of smoke and then there was a big bright flash but not that big or bright and then there was a bang and bits fell down with smoke and some people cheered but mostly there was silence just the bang being an echo round the mountains when they got back to the flier greatuncle fimender had very red eyes and said in his opinion they had just seen a terrible crime committed ah young taak now then what is this nonsense about not being able to delve properly by which of course one means remotely braam ganscerel chief seer of sept tonderon and therefore the most senior seer of all and fassins future paterfamiliasinlaw was tall and thin and maned in white hair he looked younger than he was but then he was nearly seventeen hundred years old by the most obvious way of reckoning such matters he had a sharp angular face with a large nose his skin was pale waxy and translucent and his fingers and hands were long and fragileseeming he habitually walked and stood with his head back and chest out as though he had long ago vowed not to appear stooped as he grew into great old age and had gone too far in the other direction this curious stance meant that his head was angled so far back on his neck that he had no choice but to look down his splendidly monumental nose at those he talked with to or at he held two long shining black staffs as though just returned from or about to set off for some particularly fashionable ski slopes with his long bunned white hair pale complexion and simple but elegantly cut seer robes black puttees pantaloons and long jacket he contrived to look appealingly frail sweetly elderly breathtakingly distinguished and only a little less authoritative than a supreme deity he swept into the senior officers mess of the heavy cruiser pyralis in a clatter of clicks from his twin staffs and boot heels attended by a pale train of half a dozen junior seers half of them men half of them women all of them greyly deferential and bringing up the rear the gangly smiling form of paggs yurnvic a seer whom fassin had helped teach but who having spent less time subsequently in the slowness of actual delving than fassin had was now older in both adjusted time and appearance chief seer fassin said standing and executing a formal nod that just avoided being a bow the heavy cruiser was taking their party to third fury the closeorbit moon of nasqueron from which they would delve either all remotely or if fassin had his way through a combination of remote and direct presences braam ganscerel had insisted that his years and frailty made a highgee journey to the moon out of the question esuits lifepods and shockgel notwithstanding and so the ship was making a gentle standard one gee creating what felt like about twice glantines gravity and a fraction less than sepektes even this standard gee braam ganscerel let it be known necessitated that he use both his staffs to support himself this was however in the current grave circumstances a sacrifice he felt it was only right and proper and indeed required that he make fassin thought it made him look like a stilter like a whule well the chief seer demanded stopping in front of fassin why cant you remote delve fassin whats wrong with you fear sir fassin told him fear braam ganscerel seemed to experiment with putting his head even further back than it already was found it was possible and left it there fear of being shown up by you sir as a merely competent slow seer braam ganscerel halfclosed one eye he looked at fassin for a while youre mocking me fassin fassin smiled i delve better direct braam you know that i do ganscerel said he turned with a sort of staccato grace and let himself flop into the couch where fassin had been sitting watching screen news fassin sat too paggs perched on one arm of the nextnearest couch and the rest of braam ganscerels retinue sited themselves nearby according to some arcane pecking order fassin nodded at paggs seer yurnvic he said with a smile and a formality he hoped paggs wouldnt take seriously paggs grinned good to see you fass that was all right then however we must do this together i believe braam ganscerel said looking ahead at the wall screen where the news went silently on the funerals were taking place of some more of the navarchy people whod died in the attack on the dockhabitat at sepektes trailing lagrange ganscerel had let one of his twin staffs rest on the couch beside him but still held the other he waved it at the screen and it obligingly went back to being a bulkhead again the heavy cruisers senior officers mess was a large space but much broken up by vertical columns and diagonal reinforcing struts like the rest of the vessel it was quite comfortable by human standards though colonel hatherence had had to be content with a cabin that was extremely cramped for an oerileithe she had been offered passage on an escorting cruiser with more suitable accommodation but had declined we can be together fassin said you and paggs remotely the colonel and i directly that way were backed up so if anything happens to either group ah ganscerel said you see young taak this is the point if we are all on third fury with this fine vessel and its escort craft to protect us we shall all be safe you wish to take a tiny gascraft into the unending violence of the planets atmosphere a dangerous enterprise at the best of times in wartime positively foolhardy braam the old portal was protected by an entire fleet and it still got blasted third fury might move but it moves very predictably if somebody did want to attack it they could accelerate a small rock to just under light speed and send it on an intercept course if that happens the only way a heavy cruiser is going to help is if by some milliontoone chance it happens to be in the way at the time and takes the hit itself as nobodys going to surround the entire moon with a shell of ships i think its unwise to rely on a few war craft to protect us from something theres almost no defence against why would anybody target a moonlet like third fury paggs asked indeed ganscerel said as though he had been just about to ask that very question no good reason fassin said but then a lot of places theres been no good reason to hit have been getting attacked recently this might well include nasqueron itself ganscerel pointed out which can absorb a lot more punishment than third fury you might still be targeted if im in there in a gascraft even with colonel hatherence riding shotgun i should be effectively untraceable fassin told them unless paggs said shes supposed to be in constant touch with her superiors and that might be the real reason we are all expected to stay together on third fury delving remotely ganscerel said sighing he looked at fassin control or at least the illusion of it our masters are fully aware how important this mission is even if they think themselves for the moment above explaining its precise nature to all who need to know they are naturally terrified that if it goes wrong some of the blame will stick to them really it is all up to us a bunch of academics theyve never particularly cared about or for even though ganscerel looked round the assembled junior seers being a centre of dweller studies represents the only thing which makes ulubis in any way remarkable he directed his gaze on fassin again there is very little they can do therefore they will attend with extreme diligence to what trivial matters they are able to affect with us all apparently safe on third fury protected by a small fleet of warships they will feel they are doing all they can to assist us if they let you go down into nasqueron and something does go wrong they will be blamed in that they are right it wont work braam i think we have to try the older man said look he patted fassins arm fassin was dressed in his shrievalty majors uniform and feeling awkward amidst fellow seers have you tried remote delving recently not for a long time fassin admitted its changed paggs said nodding its much more lifelike if you know what i mean more convincing paggs smiled there have been a lot of improvements over the last couple of centuries largely thanks to the real delving movement frankly oh paggs flattery fassin thought ganscerel patted his arm again just try it will you fassin will you do that for me fassin didnt want to say yes immediately this is all beside the point he thought even if i didnt know there was a potential threat to third fury the argument that matters is that the dwellers we need to talk to just wont take us seriously if we turn up in remotes its about respect about us taking risks sharing their world with them really being there but he mustnt seem intransigent keep some arguments back always have reserves after a moment he nodded slowly very well ill do that but only as a trial delve a day or two thatll be enough to feel any difference then we have to make a final decision ganscerel smiled they all did they had a very pleasant dinner with the senior officers of the small fleet taking them to third fury fassin got ganscerel alone at one point chief seer he said i will do this remote delve but if i feel its not good enough im going to have to insist on going direct he gave ganscerel space to say something but the old man just looked him in the eye head thrown back i do have authority fassin continued from the briefing from admiral quile and the complector council i realise its been compromised by people insystem coming to their own conclusions about the best way to tackle this problem but if i think i need to ill go as high and wide as i can to get my way ganscerel thought for a while then smiled do you think this delve or delves this mission will be successful no chief seer neither do i however we must make the attempt and do all we can to make it successful even so and even though failure is probably guaranteed we must be seen to do what we can attempt not to offend those above us and aim to protect the good name and the future prospects of the slow seers in general these things we can definitely do you agree so far yes if you genuinely believe that you must delve directly i shall not stand in your way i shall not back you either because to do that in my position would be to tie myself too directly to a course of action i still regard as fundamentally foolhardy in any other set of circumstances i would simply order you to do as your most senior chief seer tells you to do however you have been instructed from on high from extremely on high fassin taak and that does alter things somewhat however try this remote delve you might be surprised then make your own mind up i wont stand in your way the responsibility will be entirely yours you have my full support in that with a wink ganscerel turned away to talk to the heavy cruisers captain fassin reflected that being given full support had never felt so much like being hung out to dry the pyralis blazed with its own trailed aurora as it entered the protective magnetombra of third fury a little twentykilometrewide ball of rock and metal orbiting just kilometres above nasquerons livid cloud tops the gasgiant filled the sky so close that its rotund bulk took on the appearance of a vast wall its belts and zones of tearing swirling evereddying clouds looking like colossal contrarotating planetwide streams of madly coloured liquid caught whirling past each other under perfectly transparent ice third fury had no appreciable atmosphere and only the vaguest suggestion of gravity the heavy cruiser could almost have docked directly with the seer base complex on the side of the little moon which always faced nasqueron however a troop landing craft took them from one to the other the pyralis lay a few kilometres off effectively another temporary satellite of the gasgiant its escort of two light cruisers and four destroyers took up station a few tens of kilometres further out in a complicated cats cradle of nested orbits around the moon slim slow shadow shapes only glimpsed when they passed in front of the planets banded face third fury had been constructed or converted from an already existing moonlet billions of years earlier by one of the first species to pay homage at the court of the nasqueron dwellers given that dwellers were the most widespread of the planetbased species of the galaxy with a presence in almost all gasgiants themselves the most common type of planets the fact that out of those ninety millionplus dwellerinhabited superglobes there were exactly eight with populations willing to play host to those wishing to carry on more than the most fleeting conversation with their inhabitants spoke volumes indeed appropriately libraries about their almost utter lack of interest in the daytoday life of the rest of the galactic community it was though only almost utter the dwellers were not perfectly anything including reclusive they sought gathered and stored vast quantities of information albeit with no discernible logical system involved in the acquisition or the storage and when quizzed on the matter seemed not only completely unable to present any obvious or even obscure rationale for this effectively mindless accumulation of data but even genuinely puzzled that the question should be asked at all there had also throughout recorded time even discounting the notoriously unreliable records kept on such matters by the dwellers themselves always been a few of their populations available for discourse and informational trading though this was invariably only granted on the eccentric and capricious terms of the dwellers since the end of the first diasporian age when the galaxy and the universe were both around two and a half billion years old there had never been no working centres of dwellers studies but in the following ten and a half billion years there had never been more than ten such centres operating at any one time either acceptable companions came and went the dwellers were of the slow the category of species that stuck around in a civilised form for at least millions of years the people they let come and visit them and talk to them and with whom they were prepared to trade information were usually numbered amongst the quick the kind of species that often counted its time as a civilised entity in tens of thousands of years and sometimes not even that long the dwellers would tolerate and talk to other slow species as well though normally on a less regular and frequent basis the suspicion was that the dwellers for all their fabled patience no species colonised the galaxy at speeds averaging less than one per cent of the speed of light not counting stopovers unless it was supremely patient could get bored with the species that came to talk to them and by selecting only those numbered amongst the quick they ensured that they would never have to endure for too long a time the attentions of people they only looked forward to seeing the back of just wait a bit and in a twinkling of an eye by dweller standards their troublesome guests would evolve out of nuisancehood for the last sixteen hundred years or so barely half a dweller eyetwinkling humans had been adjudged as acceptable confidants for the dwellers of nasqueron in the system of ulubis their presence mostly tolerated their company usually accepted their safety almost always guaranteed and their attempts to talk to the dwellers and mine their vast but defiantly imaginatively organised and indexed data shales met with only the most formal of obstructiveness the lighter forms of derision and the least determinedly obfuscatory strategies that such playful coynesses such nearlytoosmalltomeasure diffidences and such gentle barelymeritingthename hindrances appeared to the humans concerned to be obstacles of monumental scale hideous complexity and inexhaustibly fiendish invention just went to show whod been doing this for most of the lifetime of the universe and who for less than two thousand years other approaches had of course been tried bribing creatures who found the concept of money merely amusing tended to tax even the most enterprising and talented arbitrageur the dwellers clove to a system in which power was distributed well more or less randomly it sometimes seemed and authority and influence depended almost entirely on ones age little leverage there alternatively every now and again a species would attempt to take by force of arms what those involved in dweller studies attempted to wrest from the dwellers by polite but dogged inquiry force it had been discovered independently amazingly often did not really work with dwellers they felt no pain held their own continued survival and that of others given the slightest provocation to be of relatively little consequence and seemed to embody apparently at the cellular level the belief that all that really mattered ever was a value unique to themselves which they defined as a particular kind of kudos one of whose guiding principles appeared to be that if any outside influence attempted to mess with them they had to resist it to the last breath in the bodies of all concerned regardless dwellers were almost everywhere and had been there practically for ever they had learned a few things about making war over that time and while their war machines were believed to be as customarily unreliable and eccentrically designed built and maintained as every other piece of technology they deigned to involve themselves with that didnt mean they werent deadly usually for all concerned and within a disconcertingly large volume other species had prevailed against dwellers on occasion entire planetary populations of them had been wiped out and whole gasgiants dismantled to provide the raw material for one of those monstrous megastructure projects that quick species in particular seemed so keen on building apparently just because they could but the longterm results were to date inevitably unhappy picking a fight with a species as widespread longlived irascible and when it suited them singleminded as the dwellers too often meant that just when or even geological ages after when you thought that the dust had long since settled bygones were bygones and any unfortunate disputes were all ancient history a small planet appeared without warning in your home system accompanied by a fleet of moons themselves surrounded with multitudes of asteroidsized chunks each of those riding cocooned in a fuzzy shell made up of untold numbers of decently hefty rocks every one of them travelling surrounded by a large landslides worth of still smaller rocks and pebbles the whole ghastly collection travelling at so close to the speed of light that the amount of warning even an especially wary and observant species would have generally amounted to just about sufficient time to gasp the local equivalent of what the fu before they disappeared in an impressive if wasteful blaze of radiation retaliation where it was still possible and on the few occasions it had been tried led without fail towards a horribly messy war of attrition whereupon the realisation of the sheer scale of the dweller civilisation if one could even call it that and its past and therefore probably future longevity more often than not had a sobering effect on whatever species had been unwise enough to set themselves against the dwellers in the first place attempting to hold your local dweller population hostage in the hope of influencing another one or a group of others was an almost laughably lame and even counterproductive strategy dwellers of any given gasgiant thought little enough of their own collective safety giving them an excuse to show how little solidarity they felt with any other group of their own kind only led to events of particular and spectacular grisliness for all that the genetic and cultural variation between dweller populations was much less than that displayed by any other galaxywide grouping the long longarrivedat consensus particularly amongst those still nursing civilisational bruises from earlier encounters with what was arguably one of the galaxys most successful species or those with the images of what had happened to others still fresh in their data banks was that on balance it was best just to leave the dwellers alone left to themselves the dwellers disturbed nobody except occasionally themselves and those who thought too deeply about what they really represented their history after all like that of the galaxy as a whole was one of almost but not quite uninterrupted peace and tranquillity billions and billions of years of thankfully nothing much happening at all in over ten billion years of civilisation there had been only three major chaoses and the number of genuine galaxyspanning wars didnt even make it into double figures in base eight that was a record that the dwellers seemed to feel everybody concerned ought to feel mildly proud of especially themselves welcome all chief seer good to see you seer taak seer yurnvic young friends and this must be colonel hatherence pleased to make your acquaintance maam duelbe the bald nearly spherical majordomo of the third fury shared facility greeted them in the transit hall as the military troop carrier disengaged and turned back towards the pyralis a couple of the youngest seers who had patently never encountered the positively balllike form of duelbe before stared it was as a rule at such moments that comparisons regarding the similarity in shape of third fury and the majordomo of its shared facility came to mind happily on this occasion if they were thought they went unvoiced servants took charge of luggage pallets hatherence shooed away retainers who offered to help her manoeuvre in the relatively confined space the domelike hall like the rest of the mostly underground facility had been rebuilt on a human scale since the departure of the last species to be granted seer status with little spatial concession to other effectively larger species colonel hatherence was happy to float where she could without assistance thank you using trimvanes on the outside of her discus of esuit to propel her from place to place ah braam ganscerel announced loudly bouncing along the halls floor in long floating strides idly fending himself off the ceiling above with casual prods of one staff like some strangely graceful if inverted pole vaulter thats better one rarely appreciates gravity so much as when faced with so little of it eh duelbe the majordomo smiled broadly even though fassin knew he must have heard the old man say this a dozen times or more the retinue of junior seers apparently hadnt and gave every impression of being barely able to contain their hearty guffaws within their aching sides the three double discs soared above a great curved canyon of cloud sliced deep within what looked like a convex bank of bloodred snow a hundred kilometres high much further above a sky of rushing yellow streamers afforded brief glimpses of a wanly cerise sky dotted with the spikepoints of stars and occasionally a single visibly skycrossing moon like a soft brown snowball the formation of flying machines curved across towards the bloodred bank of vapour and disappeared into it senses shifted he felt himself reaching out with a slick effortlessness into mag and rad gravgrad and radio pulling in a composite picture of his environment thousands of kilometres in diameter and hundreds deep placing him with pinsharp clarity in a great reticulated accumulation of magnetic fields radiation and gravitational gradient all overlaid on the widelight image still available and the jellylike ghostvista of soundscape still taking the lead from paggs leading the trio they dived towards a sharp thermocline coming into view a dozen klicks down they flew out into a wide bubble of relative sightclarity then into a squall of water snow they dived deeper through a band of pressure and temperature where water rain fell pattering hard against the skins of their whirling double discs then on down down into even widelight darkness down to the warm hydrogen slush where the discs floated like giant doublecone yoyos bobbing steaming flickering signals to each other so what do you think young taak good to be home a fascinating experience fassin agreed were what he double checked his internal navigation instrumentation two equatorial sats along and a band up now fass paggs began so if i do this fassin sent and lunged his double disc towards paggss paggs had guessed what was coming and already started to move away flinching backwards and up fassins machine seemed to dart towards the other seers remote craft then draw back stopping just short of where paggss machine had been youve got just enough time to get out of the way fassin pointed out reasonably seer taak braam ganscerel began whereas if i did something similar on the far side of the planet fassin continued at the far end of a whole chain of sats the best part of a full light second away even without any processing delays we might both now be listening to our remotes telling us that at best i just voided their warranties fassin ganscerel sent with a sigh i think were all aware of the speed of light and the diameter of the planet and these remotes are anyway not completely stupid or unprotected they have an extremely sophisticated collisionavoidance system built into them one we had to clear specifically with your friends in the shrievalty to have built in its so close to to being clever but if a dweller points a laser at you for fun fassin asked just to see if youll flinch what good is any collisionavoidance system to you then perhaps ganscerel suggested mellowly one ought not to mix with the kind of dweller who would be likely to act in such a manner in the first place except theyre the ones that are most likely to share interesting stuff with you old man not the desiccated harmless but clueless pixiebrains you tend to spend your time flattering fassin thought he was fairly certain that it was just a thought people always worried that in theory in vr you might say something you only meant to think but he wasnt so rusty in the techniques of remote delving that he was truly concerned it might anyway even do braam ganscerel some good to hear a few politely unspeakable things now and again perhaps indeed chief seer was all he said hmm lets step out shall we they returned to the reality of a remotesend suite buried deep in the third fury facility blinking in the light as technicians helped to unclip them from the couches pushing themselves forward to clear the halfdomes of the nmr assemblages handing back earpieces and simple black velvet blindfolds flexing and stretching as though theyd been under for a genuinely long delve rather than a mere hour or so at a onetoone time ratio paggs worked his fingers undoing the last couple of soft tabs that connected him to the thin pneumotubes which had both sensed his movements and would have prevented him from throwing himself right off the couch in the event that hed performed any especially energetic actions ganscerel lay with his eyes closed breathing deeply and letting the technicians detach him from the machinery paggs glanced over are we convincing you at all fass youre convincing me its even easier to remote delve these days than it used to be fassin levered himself from the couch with the steady application of force from one small finger and let himself float very gently towards the floor i would have taken your word for it so you only got onethird of the volumes concerned young taak ganscerel said fassin was giving a very private briefing in an engineering store off the secondary ship hangar ganscerel had wanted it conducted in his quarters but there wasnt a way of squeezing the colonel in there present were fassin ganscerel paggs and colonel hatherence fassin wanted them each to know as much as he did or at least as much as he thought they ought to know about what he had found on his longago delve and what they would be looking for on the one they were hoping to begin the following day yes he said i traded some highdefinition images of earth twentiethcentury european expressionist paintings for amongst a lot of other stuff what was catalogued as a tritranslated text of a prethird chaos lutankleydar epic poem a private unpublished work by or perhaps commissioned by a doge of the enigmatics it was all doubleencrypted and compressed but it was known to be in three volumes i got three volumes from valseir only as it turned out years later when it was finally demangled by the jeltick what id been given wasnt volumes one two and three it was volume one three times over in three separate languages and it wasnt by an enigmatic doge either one of the volumes was in a previously known but untranslatable penumbral language from the time of the summation when the translation was made it acted as a rosetta gave the key to a lot of other stuff and that sidetracked everybody for a while then some pineyed jeltick scholar spotted a note at the end buried in the appendices in a crude but related slanglanguage obviously added later but not much later that basically said the whole thing had been written during the long crossing of the second ship by an outcast dweller skilled in the penumbral language and that yes of course there was a dweller list they the ship or its crew had the key to it and it would be included in volume two or three of this epic poem it was also of course in the ship and the ship was heading for the zateki system thats why the jeltick sent an expedition straight there as soon as they had the translation why not come here to nasqueron where they might have found the third volume paggs asked smiling because the shrievalty hadnt told them where the data had come from whether this was oversight or deliberate we havent been told the jeltick may have guessed it was from a dweller studies centre but they couldnt be sure whether it was or not and if so which one they probably did start making inquiries but they didnt want to alert anybody else to the importance of what they had dont forget the information had been copied and recopied it was lying about in data reservoirs all over the civilised galaxy quite possibly people had even already translated and read the main text but just hadnt got round to the appendices where the allimportant note was the slightest hint that there was anything of strategic interest in that tranche and everybody else would have dusted it off read it and bang the jeltick would have lost their edge so they fuelled and tooled and set sail for zateki instead this could all be a hoax you know ganscerel said snorting he adjusted his robes frowning deeply ido believe i detect the laboured and tortuous signature of dweller humour here this could just be a joke at the expense of anyone foolish enough to fall for it it could indeed sir fassin agreed but we have our orders and we have to make the effort just in case it is all true so we are looking for the remaining two volumes of this what is it called exactly colonel hatherence asked best translation fassin said is the algebraist its all about mathematics navigation as a metaphor duty love longing honour long voyages home all that stuff and what is or was this long crossing ganscerel asked irascibly i havent heard of it the voyage back home from what humans used to call the triangulum nebula fassin said with a small smile well ganscerel said frowning once more we are not really much further forward are we and what pray do we call the triangulum nebula now seer taak we call it the lost souls ii galaxy chief seer the crossing was called the long crossing because it took thirty million years the outward journey allegedly took almost no time because it was conducted through an intergalactic wormhole the portal location of which is amongst those included in the dweller list hervil apsile master technician of the third fury shared facility ran the ultrasonic handheld over the gascrafts starboard nacelle one more time smiling with some satisfaction at the smooth line on the screen above his head one of the shared facilitys drop ships stood on extended legs a squat liftingbody shape hold doors open to one side the main hangars transparent dome showed a vast darkness fitfully illuminated by long lighting flashes like sheets of tipped diamond catching the light of a dim blue sun checking for scrits hervil fassin asked approaching by bounce along the fusedrock floor apsile grinned at the sound of fassins voice but watched the handhelds screen until hed got to the end of the seam he was inspecting he switched the machine off and turned to fassin just the standard varieties detected so far seer taak scrits were the almost certainly mythical creatures which dwellers blamed when anything went badly wrong anywhere in their vicinity the humans who had lately taken up the baton of dweller studies had adopted early on the idea of scrits to account for the high degree of malfunctions any interaction with or indeed near the dwellers seemed to involve it was either that or accept that the dwellers endemic technological carelessness and congenital lack of enthusiasm for keeping machinery in reliably working order was somehow contagious fassin patted the dark flank of the fat arrowheadshaped gascraft this was his own machine designed specifically for and partly by fassin himself it was about five metres long four across the beam if you included the outboard manoeuvring nacelles and a little under two metres in height its smooth form was broken only by the shut lines of its various manipulators and manoeuvring impellers a few sensor bulges and the rear power assembly vanes currently stowed fassin rubbed his hand over its port tail fin all prepped and ready herv entirely apsile said he was nubianly black slim but muscled sleekly bald only a few lines round his eyes made him look remotely as old as he was which was very every year or so before his annual depilatory treatment he thought gene treatment too invasive a white microstubble would start to appear on his scalp giving his head the appearance of a bristling star field and you he asked oh prepped and ready too fassin told him hed just come from the days final briefing with the dweller current state people it was their challenging brief to try and keep abreast of what was going on in the sheer and utter chaos that was dweller society and as a sideline keep track of where the major dweller structures institutions and especially individuals of interest were at any given moment the news was not good a formal war was brewing between zone two and belt c at least one longterm storm structure between zone one and belt d was collapsing while two were building elsewhere and the movements of iois recently had been particularly fluid one might even say capricious as for the whereabouts of choal valseir well nobody had seen anything of the fellow for centuries dwellers had always been hard to follow in the past people had tried setting drone remotes on individuals to keep tabs on them however dwellers regarded this as a gross intrusion on their privacy and had an uncanny ability to spot and destroy any such platforms microgascraft or bugs no matter how small or clever they were dwellers also sulked when people had the temerity to try anything so underhand cooperation was withdrawn sometimes over an entire population sometimes for years the slow seers of nasqueron had a pretty good relationship with the local dwellers by dweller studies standards it was almost close but only because the seers tried to interfere as little as possible with dweller life in return the dwellers were relatively cooperative and broadcast a daily update on the location of their most important cities structures and institutions this eightandabithourly bulletin was a byword for trustworthiness almost a legend in dweller studies on occasion approaching accuracy rates of very nearly ninety per cent things fine with sept bantrabal apsile asked all well slovius sends his regards fassin had talked to his uncle a few hours earlier still trying to persuade him to leave the autumn house the time delay between third fury and glantine made a normal conversation just about possible hed caught up with jaal too on the other side of glantine at her septs spring house life appeared relatively normal back on glantine the new emergency affecting people there less than it seemed to on sepekte apsile flicked a rollscreen from his sleeve and tapped a few patches he looked casually up at the lifter ship poised above the little gascraft ready to accept the smaller vessel inside its open hold and take it down to the gasgiants atmosphere fassin followed the master technicians gaze he looked at a dark shape already hanging inside the cargo space protruding downwards from it like a thick wheel he frowned that looks a lot like colonel hatherence he said not many places shell fit muttered apsile eh a voice bellowed then quieter my name oh yes thats me seer taak major taak i should say hello sorry asleep well you know one does thought id try out this space here for size fits very well must say i shall be able to be transported to the atmosphere of nasqueron most ably by this vessel if needs be well so i think think you so too master technician apsile smiled broadly revealing teeth as jet as his skin i think so too maam there we are agreed then the giant hanging discus dropped fractionally from its mountings inside the deltashaped transporter so that it could turn and twist towards them and so major taak how goes your attempt to persuade chief seer braam ganscerel that you ought to be allowed to delve directly fassin smiled it goes like a longterm delve colonel exceeding slow a pity apsile thumbed a patch on his rollscreen clicked the screen back into his sleeve and nodded at the little gascraft well shes ready want to put her up he asked why not it had become something of a tradition that apsile and fassin lifted the craft into the carrier they stooped took an end each and very slowly at first hoisted the arrowhead into the space above letting their feet lift off the floor at the end to slow it down the gascraft weighed next to nothing in third furys minuscule gravity but it massed over two tonnes and the laws regarding inertia and momentum still applied they were carried three metres up inside the drop ships hold towards the opened arms of the waiting gascraft cradle the colonels esuit took up the space of two of the little gascraft but that still left room for another five in the drop ships hold the arrowhead snicked into place alongside the tall discus that held colonel hatherence satisfied that the arrowhead was correctly fastened in the two men let themselves fall back to the floor the colonel drifted down alongside them fassin looked up at the sleek lines of the gascraft how small it looks he thought tiny space to spend years in decades in even centuries they landed apsile more experienced got his kneeflex just right fassin bounced the giant esuit had to tilt to clear the carrier ships opened hold doors toppling then coming upright again with a burr of vanes and a whoosh of air imust say i myself would prefer to enter the atmosphere directly that is to say in fact indeed in reality the colonel shouted yes fassin said i would too colonel good luck in that the oerileithe boomed thank you fassin said i suspect good luck will be necessary if not sufficient a few hours later he had just about enough time to reflect that it was bad luck which produced the opportunity they had both been looking for before he had to flee for his life the others persuaded him eventually thay sonj and mome were all going why not him not nervous surely maybe just too lazy he wasnt nervous or quite that lazy he just wanted to stay back at the nest and bland with k who was coming to the end of a tream socked into a traumalyser and a linkedup subsal she floated lightly tethered in the gentle stream blowing out of the air chair slim graceful body semifoetal arms waving her long endtied chestnut hair blossoming above her like a cobra hood wrapping over her head then wafting back again the nmr net was like a hand with twentyplus slim silver fingers grasping her head from the back the subsals transparent tube disappeared into a tiny neurotaplet just behind her left earlobe ks eyes moved languidly behind their lids and her face seemed set in a smile at this stage coming out of a long tream it was as though she had been diving in some abyssal depths and was now swimming slowly back in through a few kilometres of sunlit shallows you could wade out to meet the person coming in without surrendering yourself to the whole paralucid chemicalnmrholoinduced dream state you could sort of snorkel with them while they still gilled heading for the beach that was mundane reality hey fass shed sent when he first dipped in to join her slipping on a small nmr collar and becoming part of the slowly evaporating tream shed been away for a day and a half a long one you came to meet me thanks part have fun he asked more than fun guess where ive been he sent a shrug faintest i did a delve i treamed a delve like seers do into nasqueron well it wasnt really nasq it was another gasgiant called furenasyle thats where the chip must have been templated you heard of furenasyle yeah its another place they do dweller studies so you treamed you were there delving yeah surely did you make it sound so amazing and fass it was great best tream well secondbest tream ive ever had k sent a kind of complicit sexy smirk in his direction he guessed the tream she was referring to theyd experienced it together a lovetream a joint immersion in what they felt for each other well supposedly love treams were tacky in some ways you could still lie about your feelings in them and if you selected the right template from the traumalyser device and suitable accompanying chemicals from the subsal you could pretty much guarantee a tream of surpassing wideeyed heartthrobbing bliss even between two people who basically hated each other but it had been good between the two of them good but not something that hed wanted to do again he supposed he was suspicious of the whole virtual reality experience and treaming especially with a synchedin subsal providing appropriate synthesised chemicals for delivery to the brain was the most immersive vr you could find legally or semilegally anyway you should try it really it would be like practice dont you think i suppose if delving is what im going to end up doing i take it youd recommend it if its like that sure sure was what he was not he was still young still undecided should he become a slow seer like everybody seemed to expect him to become even including the people he shared the nest with on hab the happy hab or should he do something else entirely he still didnt know the very fact that everybody thought he would become a seer eventually after a few wild years and these were surely wild years not something that you ever imagined could go on for ever or even for very long made him all the more determined not to do what was expected of him well maybe determined was too strong a word he admitted reluctant made him more reluctant he supposed that was better still he might surprise them all he might go off and do something entirely utterly and excitingly different he just had to experience jots of different things until he found the right thing was all listen im probably going with the others to the protest well unless you need me you know good for you i dont mind you go id come too but i need to ramp out of this shallow that last time i steeped really crawled ugh okay see you later part he left the nest the nest a lowgee pod of forty or so mostly small spherical rooms housing a kind of commune of all human gappers nopers treamers trustafarians zealers and zonkers was in a big bunch of living spaces up near the habs long axis near the rather arbitrarily termed west end not far beneath the suntube the nest allegedly belonged to the mother of one of the trustafarians though unofficially it was the immaturian peoples republic of whateverness and had semiofficial paperwork and software to prove it too hab was one of a few hundred thousand habitats orbiting sepekte it was average size a cylinder of reformed asteroid material fifty kilometres long and ten across spinning to create about twothirds of a gee at its internal diameter surface it turned in the unending sunlight like a giant garden roller flattening photons two twelvekilometre mirrorlens systems one at either end faced ulubis star like a pair of vast unbearably thin flowers further mirror complexes funnelled the captured sunlight through two windows of diamond sheet into the habs long axis where a final set of mirrors moving up and down the suntube to create something like the feel of a planetary day finally directed the light towards the internal surface or at least finally directed the light towards the internal surface if there wasnt something like one of the grapebunchlike nest complexes in the way more mirrors many more people lived in the habs than lived on planets in the system and most of the habs were somewhere near sepekte hab had been a fairly liberal freeflowing laissezfaire whocares kind of place almost since its inception as part of a horrendously intricate incumbent species assetswap writeoff dodge two millennia earlier even its ultimate ownership had never fully been settled and several generations of lawyers had gone to their plush retirements having followed the saga of hab s provenance and title since their days as articled clerks still lacking a sense of closure re the above so the place attracted drifters artists misfits natural exiles political and other eccentrics and slightly deranged or badly messedup people of more or less every sort and always had most were from ulubis but some were more exotic and from further afield generally trustafarians andor gappers portaling in from the rest of the mercatoria taking time out between education and responsibility to relax a little the place produced good art it was an unofficial but taxdeductible finishing school for the aforesaid children of the rich give the darling brats true freedom and let them see how empty it was was the idea it was a way station for those heading out to disgrace or back from perdition and it was a halfway house for those who might or might not ever again contribute anything useful to society but who just might galvanise it fundamentally and if you wanted to be really paranoid about stuff it was as far as the authorities were concerned a relatively easytowatch and even easiertoclosedown sump for dangerous ideas a radical trap it was useful in other words it fulfilled a purpose if not several in a society as large as that which existed around ulubis somewhere had to provide that sort of service people were people some would always be straight some would always be a bit twisted but they all had some sort of part to play and they were all in some sense valuable were they not but now the fucking mercatoria the fucking ascendancy or fucking omnocracy or whatever they fucking were the fucking hierchon more likely one of his new rotational crop of advisers who saw a way to make some money and gain some extra power or the peregal below him or apparitor below him or just the diegesian gimplet who was actually nominally the governor or mayor or whatever he was supposed to fucking be his post his presence and his protecting bully boys only here at all thanks to an earlier dispute over who controlled what resulting in a grubby centuryold compromise anyway the fucking big boys the fucking people who owned fucking everything or thought some fucker ought to own fucking everything had decided decreed deemed that proprietorship of the whole fucking place and that of lots of other similar habs in similar situations of disputeduncertaindubioushappily contingent ownership should pass to what they called a properly accredited and responsible authority which basically meant them or if not them their chums somebody who took things like ownership and rentgathering and petty lawenforcement and so on seriously it was the lawmakers the lawgivers being outlaws and it would not be allowed to stand it would not be allowed to pass it would not go unchallenged it would not go into the local statutes without a serious fucking challenge these people for whatever fuckwit reason were destroying part of what was good about the habs about sepekteorbit about ulubis system about the society they were all in the end a part of ultimately they were being stupid and selfdestructive and all that was required was that the people who could see all this clearly because they were right here at the sharp end at the cutting edge pointed this out to them they were all on the same side in the end it was just that sometimes the fuckers in authority got too far away from the reality of life as the mass of people lived it and that was when you had to make a stand make a point and make yourself heard so they went to the protest down the friction tubes and the bungees and along the tramways to the central plaza and the makings of a great crowd you just have to think about it mome said as they walked the last street into the plaza the beyonders never attack habs never attack whole cities never attack anything big and easy and defenceless they attack the military and the authorities and big infrastructure stuff their attacks their violence their military strategy is a discourse amenable to analysis if one is prepared to approach it shorn of propagandistic preconceptions and the message is clear their argument their war is with the mercatorial system with the ascendancy and the omnocracy and the administrata and not with the common people not with us resent being called common sonj protested erring on the side of generosity including you in the category people sonj mome shot back mome was a little guy pale intense and always slightly hunched as though perpetually preparing either to pounce or duck sonj was huge a big bumbling dark brown geezer of changeable moods and intensely curly short red hair who only looked at home or even slightly graceful in low gee doesnt necessarily make them the good guys fassin insisted makes them people open to reason people capable of indulging in meaningful dialogue mome said not just mad fuckers to be put down like vermin which is pretty much what were told they are so whats stopping them talking to us fassin asked us mome said takes two to talk they all looked at him mome was known to talk a lot sometimes to audiences who had basically long since fallen asleep he shrugged my cousin lain thay said another one mome asked feigning incredulity sister of cousin kel halfsister of cousin yayz thay explained patiently she was sonjs part also generously made awkward in low gee but bouncily agile on the habs internal surface at twothirds of a gee my cousin lain she continued determinedly the one in the navarchy says that she reckons the reason the beyonders attack so much at all is because if they dont the navarchy and the summed fleet goes after them and we dont just attack military stuff she says we hit their habs kill millions of them lot of offs unhappy with lots of whats unhappy with mome asked lots of offs thay repeated i got the word mome repeated with a sigh i just didnt get the meaning he snapped his fingers wait short for officers right correct brilliant carry on lot of offs unhappy with this thay said again so the yonds the beyonders just attack us to keep us on the defensive she nodded once thats what my cousin lain says ayee crazy yonding talk mome said putting his hands over his ears get us all arrested they laughed at least we have the freedom to say this sort of thing fassin pointed out mome did his special hollow laugh in the central plaza fassin greeted people drank in the sense of solidarity and slightly edgy fun lots of inventive costumes towering flosssculptures and buzzing balloonderers trailing slogan banners yelling chants and scattering narconfetti but still felt oddly apart from it all he looked up and around ignoring for the moment the people mostly human and the circle of domed and gleaming buildings the hab was a giant verdant city rolled up into a spinning tube with small hills and many lakes and crisscross avenues between lowrise hanginggarden apartments and winding rivers and spindly towers some arched like bows and reaching all the way up to the suntube where they curved or needleeyed round to meet towers on the far side bunches of nests surrounded by mirrors trailed with friction tubes like jungle creepers clustered near the long axis and dirigiblisters floated like strange semitransparent clouds beneath them then fassin heard some sort of shout at one edge of the crowd nearest the palace of the diegesian which was the focus for the protest he might have smelled something strange but then that was probably just one of the cruising balloonderers disseminating some drug that fassins immedioimmune system hadnt recognised then he realised maybe it wasnt because all the balloonderers dropped suddenly as one out of the air also the sun in the suntube went out which never happened he heard lots of odd noises some of which might have been screaming it seemed to get cold very quickly that was odd too people were hitting him with their shoulders mostly as they went running past him then they were falling over him and he realised he was fassin realised he was fassin lying down then he was fassin getting hit again but he was fassin trying to get up and stand again and he was fassin he was fassin he was on his knees and he was fassin just about to get up from his knees onto his feet swaying feeling very strange wondering what all the people were doing lying down around him when fassin he was knocked down again by a man in armour steel grey with a big trunchbuster club and no face and a couple of little buzzdrones at each shoulder spraying gas and making a high terrible keening noise that he fassin wanted to get away from but his nose and eyes and everything else stung and hurt and he didnt know what to do he was fasssin just standing there and the guy with the big club thing as long as a spear came up to him and he fasssin stupidly thought he might ask him what was going on and what was wrong with faaassssiiinnn wrong when the man swept his clubspear trunchbuster thing round and into his face knocking some teeth out and sending him spinning to fassin his name finally jolted him awake back with us good the speaker was a small man in a large chair across a crampedlooking metal desk the room or whatever was too dark to see into even with ir the sound of the mans voice in the space suggested it was not a big space fassin was aware that his face and especially his mouth hurt he tried to wipe his mouth he looked down his hands could not move because his forearms were he tried to think of the right word shackled they were shackled to the seat he was sitting in what the hell was this he started laughing somebody hit him in his bones it was like his entire skeleton was a wind chime and his flesh and muscles and organs were somewhere else only nearby but still connected somehow and some fucker actually some very large group of fuckers had taken a whole load of hammers and whacked each one of his bones really hard at the same time the pain went almost as quickly as it arrived leaving just a weird sort of echo in his nerves what the fuck was zhat he asked the little man his voice sounded comical with some of his teeth knocked out his tongue probed the gaps felt like two out one loose he tried to remember how long it took adult teeth to grow back the little man was quite a jollylooking soul with a plump amusedseeming face and chubby rosy cheeks his hair was black cropped he wore a uniform of a type that fassin didnt recognise are you shucking torturing me fassin asked no the little man said in a very reasonable tone of voice im just doing this to get your attention one of his hands moved on the desks surface fassins bones clattered as though played upon again his nerves having experienced this twice now decided that really this was no joke and in fact felt extremely sore all right all right he heard himself saying itake the shucking point fucking point he said working out how to adapt his pronunciation to his new dental layout dont swear the little man said and hurt him again okay he screamed his head hung snot dripped from his nose saliva and blood from his mouth please dont swear the little man said it indicates an untidy mind just tell me what the f what you want fassin said was this real had he been in some sort of weird vr dream ever since hed joined k for the comingoutoftheshallows endoftream thing earlier was this what happened when you got tream templates cheap or illegally copied or something was this real it felt painful enough to be real he looked down at his legs and the hems of his shorts all covered in blood and mucus and snot he could see individual hairs on his legs some standing some plastered to his skin he could see pores didnt that mean it was real but of course it didnt treams simcasts vr all depended on the fact that the mind could really only concentrate on one thing at a time the rest was illusion human sight the most complicated sense the species possessed had been doing that for millions of years fooling the mind behind the eyes you thought you had colour vision and in some detail over this wide angle but really you didnt accurate colour vision was concentrated within a tiny part of the visual field with only vague movementwary blackandwhite awareness extending over the rest the brain played tricks on itself to pretend that it saw as well away from the centre of its visual target as it did right at that bullseye smart vr used that same deception zoom in on a detail and it would be created for you in all its pinpoint exactitude but everything else you werent attending to with such concentration could safely be ignored until your attention swung that way keeping the amount of processing power within acceptable limits fassin dragged his attention away from his bloodspattered leg is this real he asked the little man sighed mr taak he said glancing down at a screen your profile indicates that you are from a respectable family and may one day even become a useful member of society you shouldnt be mixing and living with the sort of people you have been mixing and living with youve all been very foolish and people have suffered because of that stupidity youve been living in a kind of dream really and that dream is now over officially i think you ought to go back home dont you where are my friends mr iifilde mr resiptiss ms cargin and ms hohuel fassin just stared at him shit in all the last few months hed been staying here hed only known them by their first names he supposed those were thay sonj and momes last names but really hed no idea and there had been four hadnt there did that mean they were counting k as well but she hadnt been to the protest theyre being held elsewhere or theyve been processed and released or were still looking for them the little man smiled fassin looked down at his arms held within metal hoops he tried to move his legs then leaned over and looked down his legs were shackled too or manacled or whatever his mouth felt very odd he ran his tongue round where his teeth had been checking again he supposed hed have to get false ones until the new ones grew back or sport a piratical grin why am i being treated like this he asked the little man looked incredulous he appeared to be about to hurt fassin again then shook his head in exasperation because you took part in a violent demonstration against the diegesian thats why he said but i wasnt violent fassin said you personally may not have been the demonstration you took part in most certainly was fassin would have scratched his head is that all it takes of course who started the violence he asked the little man jerked his arms out to each side his voice went very high does it matter fassin had meant which side but he could tell the little man thought hed meant which demonstrator he sighed look i just want to get back to my friends to my nest can i go i didnt do anything i got my teeth knocked out i cant tell you anything or anything he said he sighed again you can go when you sign this the little man swivelled the screen around so fassin could see he looked at what he was supposed to sign and at the fingerprint pad and camera patches on the screen which would record that it had really been him signing or more to the point make a fake document take up a fraction more storage space i cant sign this he said it basically says my friends are all beyonder agents and deserve death the little man rolled his eyes read it carefully will you it just says you have suspicions in that regard you dont seriously think your word would be enough to convict anybody of anything do you well then why get me to we want you to betray them the little man shouted as though it was the most obvious thing ever we want you to turn your back on them and become a productive member of society thats all but theyre my friends fassin coughed swallowed look could i get a drink of water no you cant and theyre not your friends theyre just people you know theyre barely acquaintances you got drunk with them got stoned with them talked a bit with them and slept with some of them youll all go your separate ways soon enough anyway and probably never keep in touch they are not your friends accept that fassin thought better of debating what being a friend meant in the circumstances well im still not betraying them theyve betrayed you the little interrogator swung the screen round clicked on a few patches and swung it back fassin watched thay sonj and mome all stuck in seats like the one he was secured in and sonj looking pretty beatenup say they thought that fassin held beyonder sympathies and was a danger to society who needed watching they each mumbled something to that effect signed the screen and pressed a thumb against the print patch sonjs left a smear of blood the screenage shook him it had probably been faked but all the same he sat back you faked that he said unsteadily the little man laughed are you mad why would we bother i dont know fass admitted but i know my friends they wouldnt the little man sat forward so just sign this and in the highly unlikely event that it ever crops up just say yours has been faked so why not fake it anyway fassin shouted because then you wont have betrayed them the little man yelled back come on sign and you can go ive got better things to do but why do any of this fassin said wanting to cry why make anybody betray anybody the little man looked at him for a moment mr taak he said sitting back sounding patient ive inspected your profile you are not stupid misguided idealistic naive certainly but not stupid you must know how societies work you must at least have an inkling they work on force power and coercion people dont behave themselves because theyre nice thats the liberal fallacy people behave themselves because if they dont theyll be punished all this is known it isnt even debatable civilisation after civilisation society after society species after species all show the same pattern society is control control is reward and punishment reward is being allowed to partake of the fruits of that society and as a general but not unbreakable rule not being punished without cause but be quiet the idiotic issue you chose to complain about ownership of a habitat really has nothing to do with you its a legal matter an ownership thing you werent even born here and you wouldnt have stayed beyond a few more months anyway admit it you should have kept out of it you chose not to you put yourself in harms way and now youre paying the price part of that price is letting us know that you have made an effort to dissociate yourself from the people you were complicit with once you do that you can go home i would suggest i mean to glantine and if i say no you mean not sign yes seriously seriously then its taken out of my hands youll go to meet people who enjoy doing this sort of thing this time when the little man moved his hand over the desk fassin screamed with the pain he must have bitten his tongue there was a taste of iron and his mouth filled with fresh blood and hot saliva because i the little man said wearily dont in the end fassin signed hed kind of known he would the little man looked happy and a couple of big female guards came in and helped fassin from the chair his bonds unfastened thank you mr taak the little man said and grasped his hand and shook it before they took him out of the room i hate all that unpleasantness and it is always so good to see somebody being sensible try not to think too badly of me good luck to you they got him showered down and fixed up and he left after a medical and a cup of soup dressed in paperthin overalls he looked around when they ushered him through the doorways into what passed for outside in a hab hed been somewhere inside the diegesians palace back at the nest turmoil the place had been raided trashed everything in it broken or sprayed with stinking vomitinducing crowdcontrol goo they went to a bar instead and didnt really talk about anything after the protest and the crackdown they talked instead of rumours of people being killed and others disappearing k wasnt there shed been beaten up when the troopers came to turn the nest over she was in a prison hospital ship for three weeks then killed herself with a broken glass the day she was released it was months before fassin learned the truth k had been sent into a nightmare tream somebody whod come with the law officers maybe just one of them who happened to know how to handle tream gear had found her still floating not yet out of the delving tream and altered the settings on the traumalyser and the subsal while some others had held her down and worked her over whoever did the thing with the traumalyser must have carried that sort of template chip around with them just for such eventualities then theyd left her bloody and bound to some speededup nightmare of horror rape and torture they were all split up doing other mostly more responsible things when they pieced all this together they talked about a complaint an investigation a protest fassin went back to glantine and booked a place on the seer induction course for the term after next then he returned to the habs and then to sepektes boogeytown to the roaring life the drink and drugs and fucking and fun and after a while gradually carefully made a few inquiries hung out in the right places and met certain people apparently he passed a few tests without realising hed been taking them and then one night he was introduced to a girl who called herself aun liss fassin his name jolted him awake third fury cabin still nightdark clanging noise the screen showed hour four the screen was red and flashing had somebody spoken what he said tearing the restraints away and levering himself out of bed floating towards the centre of the cabin herv apsile said a voice sounded like apsile sounded like apsile in a state of some excitement or distress we have a situation looks like an attack oh shit fassin pulled on clothes called up full lights that fucking horrendous clanging noise the alarm thats right you in facility command yes who do we think a light flashed over a storage locker and it revolved revealing an emergency esuit dont know two naval units vaporised already get suited and the lights all the lights flickered the screen did not come back on a tremor made the cabin shake something broke in the bathroom with a sharp crack you feel that you still there apsile said yes to both fassin said he was looking at the esuit suit up and take a drop shaft to the emergency shelter apsile paused you got that another pause fass here fassin started pulling all his clothes off again that what youre going to do herv thats what were both supposed to do another tremble made the whole cabin rattle the air seemed to quake like jelly the alarm shut off somehow though not in an encouraging way the screen flashed once screeched fassin hauled the esuit out of its locker hows the main hangar he asked intact whatevers hitting us seems to be coming in from the nasq spinside slightly retro so heading into the centres going to be putting us closer fassin said was that a draught he could hear a hissing sound he clipped the esuit collar round his neck and let the gel helmet deploy it turned everything hazy and quiet for a moment then decided the situation wasnt too dire yet and opened slits for him to breathe talk and hear through the facemask section thinned to nearperfect transparency for now apsile agreed if the direction of the hostile fire stays constant well be coming round to face it full on in two hours fassin stepped into the esuit and pulled it up letting it connect with the collar adjusting to his body huffing and settling very comfortable really that what you want to do herv sit in a huddle with everybody else like mice in a hole hoping the cat goes away standing orders i know want to guess what i want to do there was a pause another more violent tremor shook the cabin the main door popped open wobbling inwards revealing the companionway outside the pause went on herv he asked he looked round for anything he might want to take with him nothing herv ill see you there something blazed hard and bluewhite against nasquerons sidelit face turning the hangar into a harsh jagged jumble of fiercely shining surfaces and intensely black shadows fassin flinched the light faded quickly turning to yellow and orange a small fading sun shone between the moon and nasqueron herv apsile had got there ahead of him he gave a quick wave and easily jumped the eight metres to the open noseblister of the carrier craft disappearing inside the noseblister closed herv fassin said trying the suits emergency comms no answer he made slow bounds for the open hold colonel hatherence was already there the tall discus of her esuit floating a fraction above the floor directly beneath the place shed filled earlier seer taak i rather thought you might adopt this course she shouted shit fassin thought hed kind of hoped the colonel would have made her way to the emergency shelter in the moons core ten kilometres down along with everybody else like theyd all been told to there was one drop shaft big enough wasnt there oh well he came to a stop beneath the little arrowhead gascraft hanging in its cradle directly above colonel he said nodding would she try to stop him no idea could she no doubt about that not sure whether to be relieved or terrified the colonel yelled a manipulator arm creased out from the side of the oerileithe esuit unfolding towards fassin oh fuck he thought here we go after you the colonel said her arm indicating the space above fassin smiled and jumped she rose with a whirr beside him stopped and then braced by the ceiling of the hold he flipped open the cockpit of the little gascraft revealing a vaguely coffinshaped space he shucked the suit and unclipped the helmet out of uniform major the colonel said jovially voice echoing in the enclosed space of the upper hold fassin let the suit fall slowly to the floor beneath and stepped into the foot of the little arrowheads cockpit gracious hatherence said are all human males of this form just the handsome ones colonel he assured her he lowered himself carefully into the cool gel the cockpit cover closed over him he wriggled in the darkness getting his neck positioned over the scanner collar a soft light and a gentle chime confirmed all was well he reached for the double nozzle of the gillfluid root took a deep breath let it out then placed the nozzles at his nostrils fassin lay back zoning out as best he could fighting the urge to panic the gag response of fear as the gillfluid poured into his nose throat and lungs like the coldest drink anybody had ever taken a moment of confusion disorientation then the collar nestling closer against his neck and the warming gel closing over his body tendrils seeking out ears mouth penis and anus twin stings of pain on his forearms then another pair one under each ear as the blood slides went in set said the voice of herv apsile gurgling through the still calibrating gel in his ears thoroughly he sent back just by thinking and the colonel i am set also even over comms it seemed colonel hatherence tended to shout fassin had been wondering if they could leave her behind somehow probably not then hold doors closing ready to go apsile said fassin started to become his little gascraft it covered him embraced him multiply penetrated him and in those acts offered itself up to him completely the light from below disappeared as the hold doors closed he could see colonel hatherences esuit hanging beside him sense its cold and read its electromagnetic signature just as he could feel the systems of the drop ship readying flexing preparing changing as the ship nudged itself off the floor other senses registered an unusual wash of radiations a faint gravity well set in a much greater deeper one a slather of meaningless comms shards confused transmissions and em signals from the shared facility base itself and a sudden jolt a transmitted faint but massive thud followed by a strange sideways upwardssucking movement he waited for apsile to talk to them meanwhile trying to work it out himself distant whirr and hiss of the carrier tanking the air in its hold sorry about that apsile said mildly back in control unconventional method of opening the hangar to vacuum there no idea who to thank we okay fassin asked nsd apsile said sounding mildly distracted no significant damage let you get on with it fassin sent thanks cancel relief emphasise terror the colonel said fassin hoped she was talking only to him he checked through all the little gascrafts settings and systems settling into it as its lifesupport tendrils settled into him something like a wide array of lights seen from the bottom corner of the eye swung into focus in front of him he called up a few readouts and started a couple of subroutines to check that everything was working seemed to be he felt the carrier accelerate away from the moon patchthrough to the larger ships senses suddenly appeared as an option on his controls and he took it now he could experience pretty much what apsile could nasqueron filling the sky ahead and up the greybrown surface of third fury disappearing fast below and behind debris clouds comms shards more than there ought to be in a properly organised fleetlet like the one that had brought them here and that had been guarding the moon no sign of illuminating radar or other targeting giveaway not that a civilian ship like the carrier would be able to spot any but the most glaringly obvious no current damage flags just records of a few small hull impacts little more than pitting ship drive traces a sudden flare of radiation as a ship turned hard a couple of hundred klicks away dying away outgoing signal loop broadcasting their unarmed condition claiming lifeboat status flash from right behind a nearsemicircular debris cloud rising glittering from a new glowing crater maybe half a klick across on the surface of third fury three smaller craters coming into view recent but cooled down to orange and red heat the view twisted overlays of lines and grids and drive symbols flickering into being apsile pointed the carriers nose straight at nasqueron and started a long purposefully irregular corkscrew towards the gasgiant accelerating the drop ship as hard as its engines would allow the drop ship was no sort of highperformance military unit all it was supposed to do was take the gascraft from the facility to the gasgiant and pick them up later it was rugged able to take the strain of operating inside nasquerons gravity well and its various pressure environments down to the liquidhydrogen level and it had the power to lift itself and its charges easily enough out of nasquerons grip but it was not especially manoeuvrable carried no armament or defensive systems and far from being stealthed had been designed from its invitationtotender spec onwards to be as easy to see with as many different senses as it was possible to imagine just so that no mischievous dweller could crash something into it and then claim sorry they hadnt seen it how you doing down there apsile asked he sounded in control unworried fine for myself the colonel said ditto fassin sent got an eta yet trips from third fury to nasq usually took about an hour fassin hoped they could do it in less than half that with the main drive maxed we should make turnaround in about ten minutes apsile said then decelerate for another ten and then take hmm another handful five at most id hope to get deep enough into the atmosphere he meant deep enough into the atmosphere to be beyond any but the most scary weapons obviously not counting the scary weapons the dwellers possessed anything we can clip off that fassin asked maybe we could make it down in less time once we hit the cloud tops apsile said steeper carrying more speed maybe hmm fassin got the impression somehow that the man was rubbing his chin yes maybe if we let the heat and stress levels creep just a tad beyond tolerance a pause though of course thats always assuming that the ship didnt take any damage we dont know about when the hangar dome got blown always assuming fassin agreed master technician colonel hatherence said are we being pursued or under unitspecific attack no colonel then i suggest we adopt your first entry profile decisions yours alone herv fassin sent copy can you access any military comms traffic master technician im afraid not maam not unless they choose to target us with a clear beam or broadcast that is unfortunate what seems to be happening looks like theres been some sort of firefight still going on possibly drives spreading away from the moon heading in the direction the hostile munitions appeared to be coming from woh the flash attracted fassins secondhand attention as well another even larger crater glowing white on the surface of third fury what of the people still back within the third fury moonlet the colonel asked been listening apsile said ill try and contact them direct give me a moment silence fassin watched space wheel around them through the carrier ships sensors he checked the drop ships system profile oriented then searched for and found glantine a tiny shining dot far away the sensors let him zoom in until the planet moon was a shining gibbous image scintillating with magnification artefacts hints of its topography just about visible could that be the uplands there that light patch the sea of fines a spark there back up a tiny flash had he seen that something colder and more invasive than any gel tendril seemed to invade him clutching at his stomach and heart no surely not just another artefact of the system he looked for the sensorreplay controls shit theres a fucking wreckage apsile said then the craft bucked and swung fassin turning his focus of attention back to what apsile was looking at saw it too now a field of dark specks across the face of the planet ahead of them like a ragged flock of birds far in the distance they were at nearmaximum velocity the carrier started to turn a rush of dark scraps tearing by on all sides like a thin shell of sootblack snow flakes fassin felt his arms held by the cloying shockgel attempt to draw themselves in towards his body instinctively trying to make himself a smaller target then they were through no impacts after a moment fassin felt the drop ship start to swing round to present its drive tubes towards the planet ready to begin deceleration i think apsile said cautiously that we just about got away with something slammed into them the ship lurched there was a concussive snap that fassin felt through the carrier ship through the gascraft even through the shockgel he lost the patchthrough connection with the drop ship he was back in his own little arrowhead again they were whirling and there was light synched with the whirling light it was coming from below where the hold doors were he could see colonel hs esuit hanging alongside him ohoh the ship began to come out of the spin steadying the light from below faded but did not go away it had the spectrum to be light reflected from nasqueron light from the gasgiant coming in through supposedly closed doors fassin flipped the gascrafts sensor ring to look straight down at the doors oh fuck he tried to say there was a small but ragged hole stuff hanging like spilled guts the nasqueron light was reflecting in off some polishedlooking surfaces force building very like the main drive decelerating them more or less on schedule he retried the intercom then broadcast a radio signal herv here sorry about that hit something after all got her straight and rearward back on track no readouts from the hold at all though including the door think thats where it hit i can see a hole how big maybe a metre lateral by two i too can see the hole the colonel told them also joining in the radiobroadcast fun it is as seer taak describes too small for you guys to get out of apsile said hows the rest of the ship fassin sent holding together for now cant see where whatever hit us exited or just went on to hit inside i suspect it hit me hatherence said my esuit casing that is to say probably a pause then apsile said and are you all right perfectly fine your hold doors took most of the energy out of it and my esuit is of exceptional quality durability and damagetolerance scarcely a scratch if we cant open the doors we cant get out and the whole things pointless herv fassin sent we can still hide in the carrier under the clouds apsile said im not getting much from the facility that last hit looked like it must have shaken them pretty hard we might still be safer under the gas than hanging around out here in clear view of whoever nothing comprehensible was coming out of the shared facility on third fury and no military vessels were talking on civilian frequencies interference on em bands a problem at the best of times anywhere near nasqueron was especially intense apsile raised a couple of the facilitys equatorial relay satellites but exceptionally could not throughpatch via their transceivers and could get only static and meaningless rubbish out of them he even tried some dweller mirror sats where the surprise would have been getting anything other than drivel but there the service was perfectly normal ouch they heard him say third fury just took another hit were going in fairly slowly to allow for the damage but were going in whatever you think is best master technician the colonel said the carrier craft began to shudder as it met the upper atmosphere of nasqueron carving a glowing trail above the cloud tops they slowed weight began to return to them and kept on increasing creaks and ticking sounds came through the solids joining them to the drop ship the buffeting decreased grew and fell away again soft whumps and crisp bangs also communicated through the drop ships structure announced debris being torn off the ragged surrounds of the breach in the hold doors which glowed and sparked as the space around them filled with gas and fassin began to detect sound in the hold again they were getting heavy really heavy now fassin could feel the shockgel tightening around him like the sound of snow cramping beneath your feet he could almost sense any remaining gas bubbles in his body pancaking like blood cells good and heavy now master technician the colonel said suddenly hold on apsile said that the whole ship shook once then rolled suddenly herv fassin sent got some sort of targeting apsile began then broke off as the craft shook again and slewed wildly across the sky we are indeed being targeted by something hatherence announced master technician she shouted across the frequencies are you yet able to release us eh what no i master technician attempt to perform a roll or part of an internal loop on my command hatherence told him ishall release us you will apsile shouted i shall i will i carry weapons now excuse me and good luck wait a minute fassin began seer taak the colonel said tersely shield your senses the big discus hanging beside him sent a pulse of blinding bluewhite light straight downward at the doors which blew away in a brief gout of sparks rushing yellowbrown clouds spun by outside fassins little arrowcraft was seeing spots it got busy shuffling its damaged sensors round for working ones he guessed he hadnt shielded his senses in time he shut them down now releasing in three seconds the colonel said make your manoeuvre now if you please master technician a blast of radiation and a spike of heat from above coincided with a sudden roll the cradle holding fassin in the drop ship gave way sending him shooting from the hold like a cannon ball the colonel in her oerileithe esuit came whirling after him a moment later quickly drawing level he glimpsed the drop ship above still rolling then saw a violet ray appear suddenly to one side slicing through the gas around them searing his barely mended vision the beam just missed the carrier craft then clouds of yellow fog rolled quickly up between them and the drop ship and it was just him and the colonel a tiny arrow shape and a spinning coin of dirty grey hurtling down into the vast chaotic skies of nasqueron it is a given amongst those who care to study such matters that there is within certain species a distinct class of being so contemptuous and suspicious of their fellow creats that they court only hatred and fear counting these the most sincere emotional reactions they may hope to excite because they are unlikely to have been feigned the archimandrite luseferous looked up at the head on the wall the head stared straight across the cabin eyes wide with pain and terror and madness the assassin had died not long after theyd set out on their long journey towards ulubis the upper set of fangs finally penetrating his brain deeply enough to produce death the archimandrite had had the fellows eyelids slit open again when the medical people said death was likely within a few days hed wanted to see the look on the mans face when he died luseferous had been asleep when death had finally come for the nameless assassin but hed watched the recording many times all that happened was that the mans face stopped contorting his eyes rolled backwards and then came slowly back down slightly crosseyed while the lifesigns readout accompanying the visuals registered first the heart stopping and then a few minutes later the brain flatlining luseferous would have preferred something more dramatic but you couldnt have everything hed had the fellows head removed and mounted near that of the rebel chief stinausin pretty much in the first heads eye line so that was what stinausin had to look at all day the archimandrite glanced up at the staring nameless head what do you think he looked over the passage again lips moving but not actually reading it aloud he pursed his lips i think i agree with whats being said but i cant help feeling theres a hint of criticism implied at the same time he shook his head closed the ancient book and glanced at the cover never heard of him he muttered but at least he reflected this holierthanthou intellectual had a name it had come to annoy luseferous rather a lot that he didnt have a name for the failed assassin yes the fellow had failed yes he had paid dearly for his crime and yes he was dead and now reduced to a mere trophy but somehow the fact that his name had never been revealed had begun to strike luseferous as almost a kind of triumph for the assassin as though successfully withholding this nugget of information meant that luseferouss victory over the wretch would never quite be complete he had already sent word back to leseum to have the matter investigated more thoroughly his chief personal secretary appeared behind the sheet of mirrored diamond forming the main inner door of the stateroomstudy yes sir the marshal lascert sir two minutes sir he saw the beyonder marshal in the primary stateroom of the main battle craft luseferous vii his fleet flagship luseferous thought terms like battleship and fleet carrier and so on sounded oldfashioned and too common hed had the craft remodelled to provide accommodation befitting his rank but there had come a point where the naval architects had actually started to cry because letting what they called voids grow beyond a certain volume weakened the ship too much the result was that the stateroom wasnt really as extensive or as intimidating as hed have liked so hed had some mirrors installed and a few holo projectors which made it look bigger though he always had the nagging feeling that people could see through the illusion the style hed chosen was new brutalist lots of exposed faux concrete and rusty pipes hed taken a fancy to the name but had gone off the look almost immediately he entered with only his private secretary going before him guards courtiers admin army and naval people bowed as he strode past marshal archimandrite the beyonder marshal was a woman dressed in light armour which looked like it had been polished up but still gave off an impression of practicality and scruffiness she was tall slim and proudlooking if somewhat flatchested for luseferouss taste bald women always repelled him anyway she gave a formal nod that was probably the very least acknowledgement of his status that anybody who didnt patently hate him andor was about to die had given him for several decades he couldnt decide whether he found it insulting or refreshing two senior officers behind her were jajuejein currently in their standard tumbleweed configuration no part of their glittering plate armour higher than the marshals waist he suspected that the woman had been selected because she was human just because he was almost all the beyonder high command were nonhuman he sat it wasnt really a throne but it was an impressive seat on a dais the beyonder marshal could stand you wanted to talk marshal lascert i speak on behalf of the transgress the true free and the bialliance we have wanted to talk to you for some time the marshal said smoothly deep voice for a woman thank you for agreeing to this meeting a pleasure im sure so how goes your end of our little war last you heard obviously it goes well as far as we know the marshal smiled lights reflected on her bald scalp i understand your own campaign has gone from victory to victory he waved a hand the opposition has been light he said your main fleet should be at the outskirts of ulubis system in what one more year something like that this is somewhat later than we had all planned for it is a big invasion fleet it took time to put together luseferous said trying to show that he resented her implied criticism while also giving the impression that what she thought was of no great importance to him they were behind schedule though he had personally assured these temporary allies of his that he would be ready to invade nearly a full halfyear earlier than it now looked would be possible he supposed it was his fault if fault it was he liked to keep his fleet together rather than let it split up according to speed and then reform as needed for the invasion proper his admirals and generals insisted though not too strongly if they knew what was good for them that they didnt need all units of the fleet to be together at all times but luseferous preferred it it seemed more cohesive more impressive just more tidy and pleasing somehow it also meant that the beyonders would shoulder rather more of the responsibility for preparing ulubis system for invasion than they might have expected so that the invasion fleets job would be all the easier and the beyonders hopefully muchdepleted forces would be in a position of weakness relative to his own mass of ships still lascert said we imagine your advance units may be attacking even now weve had some automated scoutwarning ships and highspeed drone attack craft there or on their way for a while now luseferous told her always best to be prepared for any eventuality some needed reprogramming but we believe they should be effective in beginning the softeningup process he smiled he watched her react to the clear diamond teeth i am a great believer in the usefulness of spreading a little panic marshal better still a lot of panic after a longenough exposure people will welcome any power that brings an end to uncertainty even if they might have resisted it before the marshal smiled too though it looked like she was making an effort of course and we thought now might be an appropriate moment to talk in more depth about what you see your strategy being once you reach ulubis i intend to take it marshal indeed of course it may be quite well defended i expect it might thats why ive brought such a big fleet with me they were between systems way out in the empty wilderness of nearnothingness less than a year from ulubis the beyonder fast cruiser and its two escort destroyers had rendezvoused with his own fleet only hours earlier skidturning and matching velocities with a grace and rapidity that he could see his own naval people envied fine ships indeed well they had the ships and he had the systems just another opportunity to trade maybe now those three fast ships lay embedded in a fleet of over a thousand craft even if they were rather plodding in comparison may i be frank archimandrite he gave her a good wide look at his deep red eyes i expect no less we are concerned at the possible level of civilian casualties if ulubis is assaulted overaggressively now why would she say that luseferous thought to himself with a sort of inward chuckle he looked at his private secretary then at his generals and admirals marshal he said reasonably we are going to invade them we are going to attack them he smiled broadly and could see his admirals and generals grinning along with him i think aggressiveness is essential yes he could hear light laughter from one or two of his top brass people thought that having people so in awe of you that they were frightened to tell you bad news and always laughed when you laughed and so on was a bad thing and supposedly insulated you from what was really going on but if you knew what you were doing it didnt you just had to adjust your perceptions sometimes everybody laughed sometimes only a few and sometimes who kept quiet and who made a noise told you a lot more than when you asked them to just speak out and tell you the truth it was a sort of code he supposed he was just lucky to be naturally adept at it aggression and judgement are both required archimandrite the marshal said we know you to possess both of course she smiled he did not smile back we merely seek an assurance that your troops will act in a manner which will bring you further praise and greater fame praise the archimandrite said i inspire terror marshal thats my strategy ive found that to be the quickest and most effective way of ensuring that people learn what is good both for them and for me for glory then archimandrite be merciful for glory the marshal thought about this for a moment ultimately yes i shall conquer them as i see fit marshal we are partners in this you dont tell me what to do i am not trying to archimandrite the marshal said quickly i accept what you must do i am merely delivering a request regarding the manner in which it is done and i have heard your request and i will pay it all due heed this was a form of words luseferous had heard somebody use once he couldnt remember who or where which when hed thought about it he thought was rather good especially if you said it slightly pompously slowly gravely even keeping a straight face so that the person you were talking to thought you were taking them seriously and might even hope that you would do as they had asked rather than at best ignore them completely at worst as far as they were concerned youd do the opposite of whatever they asked just to spite them precisely to prove you wouldnt be pushed around though that got tricky then people might try to make you do one thing by pretending to favour another and even without that complication you were still altering your behaviour because of something they had said which was giving them a sort of power over you when the whole point of everything the archimandrite was doing was so that nobody could say they had any power over him power was everything money was nothing without it even happiness was a distraction a ghost a hostage what was happiness something people could take away from you happiness too often involved other people it meant giving them power over you giving them a hold on you that they could exercise whenever they wanted taking away whatever it was that had made you happy luseferous had known happiness and hed had it taken away his father the only man hed ever admired even while hating the old bastard had got rid of luseferouss mother when she became old and less attractive replacing her when luseferous was barely into his teens with a succession of young erotically desirable but soulless uncaring selfish young women women hed wanted for himself but despised at the same time his mother was sent away he never saw her again his father had been an omnocrat for the mercatoria in the industrial complexes of the leseum systems hed started out at the bottom as a peculan cynically the very name implied that the officebearer would need to be corrupt to make any sort of decent living so incurring a history of criminality that could always be dredged up against them if they ever stepped out of line later hed become an ovate worked his way through the many gradations of that estate then ascended to the office of diegesian in charge of a district of a city then a small industrial city then a mediumsized city then a large city then a continental capital he became an apparitor when his immediate superior died in the arms of a shared lover that lover did very well for a while his consort in effect then grew demanding and met an untimely end too his father had never told him if hed had her killed equally hed never told his father that the woman had lately become his lover too from apparitor his father rose to peregal in charge of first an orbiting fabhab cluster then a continent then a sizeable moon with all the trappings of power and wealth and glamour such a post presented in a thriving connected set of systems such as leseum at this point for the first time in his life his father had appeared finally to appreciate the position hed reached hed seemed to relax and start enjoying life it ended there finally setting himself up for the next jump to hierchon his father who had amassed a great fortune dispensing charters and contracts to the merchants and manufacturers of the many systems took pity on a favoured apparitor who was somewhat down on his luck cut him in on a deal and a kickback he didnt really need to and found himself denounced tried and beheaded for gross corruption within a month the same young apparitor then took his position luseferous convinced from early on that he could never compete with his father in his own sphere and anyway always intrigued by the nature of religion and faith had joined the cessoria a few years earlier hed been a piteer a junior priest at the time of his fathers trial they had made him one of his fathers confessors and hed accompanied him to the execution ring his father had been brave at first then hed broken hed started crying begging promising anything but only all the things hed already lost he clutched at luseferouss robes howling and beseeching burying his face luseferous knew they were watching him that this moment was important for his future he pushed his father away his rise through the cessoria was swift he would never be as powerful as his father but he was clever and capable and respected and on an upward course within an important but not too dangerous part of one of the greatest metacivilisations the galaxy had seen he might have been content with that and never put himself in a position of weakness the way his father had then the disconnect happened a swathe of portal destruc tion had swung across the millionstar volume all around leseum back in the time of the arteria collapse leaving only the bunched leseum systems themselves connected inside a vast volume of backwardness the system of leseum had been important seemed vital and felt unthreatened until their own disconnect came millennia later courtesy of some vast bicker within the ongoing chaos of the scatter wars an essentially meaningless difference of opinion between three pretending sides which until then practically nobody had heard of by the time it was all over nobody would hear of those sides again save as history the damage was done though the portal near leseum had been destroyed and an enormous volume around it had been cut off from the rest of the civilised galaxy everything changed then including what you had to do to retain power and who might contest for absolute power his father nevertheless had taught luseferous everything one way or another and one of the most important things was this there was no plateau in life you were either on your way up or on your way down and it was always better to be on your way up especially as the only reliable way to keep going up was to use other people as stepping stones as platforms as scaffolding the old saying about being nice to people on the way up so that theyd be nice to you when you were on your way back down was perfectly true but it was a defeatists saying a losers truism better to keep going up for ever never to rest never to relax never to have to descend the thought of what might happen to you at the hands of those youd already offended exploited and wronged on the way up those that still lived was just another incentive for the serious player never even to think about easing off the pace let alone starting to fall back the dedicated competitor would keep presenting himself with new challenges to take on and conquer he would seek out new levels to ascend to he would always look for new horizons to head towards treat life like the game it was this might be the truth behind the truth the religion luseferous had been raised within as an obedient member of the mercatoria that nothing you did or seemed to do really mattered because it was all or might be all a game a simulation it was all in the end just pretend even this starveling cult he was titular head of was just something hed made up because it sounded good a variation of the truth with added selfdenial every now and again the better to contemplate the gullibility of people people would swallow anything just anything at all apparently some people found this dismaying he thought it was a gift the most wonderful opportunity to take advantage of the weakminded so you seemed cruel so people died and suffered and grew up hating you so what there was at least a chance that none of it was real and if it was all real well then life was struggle it always had been and it always would be you recognised this and lived or fell for the lie that progress and society had made struggle unnecessary and just existed were exploited became prey mere fodder he wondered to what extent even the supposedly feral and lawless beyonders understood this basic truth they let women rise to the pinnacle of their military command structure that didnt bode particularly well and the marshal didnt seem to have realised that when hed said hed heard her request and would pay it all due heed it meant nothing well thank you archimandrite she said still he smiled you will stay we shall have a banquet in your honour we have had so little to celebrate out here between the stars an honour indeed archimandrite the marshal gave that little head nod again and we shall try to pick each others brains over dinner he thought my what highbrow fun give me a planet to plunder any day do you have any idea where we are the colonel signalled using a spotlaser they reckoned this was their most secure form of comms zone zero the equatorial fassin sent somewhere ahead of the latest big storm about ten or twenty kiloklicks behind the ear festoon im checking the latest update they loaded before the drop they were floating in a slow eddy around a gentle ammonia upwell the diameter of a small planet about two hundred klicks down from the cloud tops the temperature outside was relatively balmy by human standards there were levels places in almost all gasgiants where a human could in theory exist exposed to the elements without any protective clothing at all of course they would probably need to be prone and lying in a tub of shockgel or something similar because weighing six times what their skeleton was used to coping with would make standing up or moving around problematic their lungs would have to be full of gillfluid or the like to let them breathe within a mix of gases which included oxygen only as a trace element and also to let their ribs and chest muscles work under the pressure of that gravitational vice plus they wouldnt want to be exposed to a chargedparticle shower but all the same by gasgiant greatoutdoors standards this was about as good as it humanly got colonel hatherence found it a bit hot but then as an oerileithe she would be more at home closer to the cloud tops she had already loudly pronounced her esuit undamaged and capable of protecting her anywhere from spacevacuum down to nasquerons tenkiloklick level where the pressure would be a million times what it was here and the temperature somewhat more than half what it was on the surface of ulubis star fassin chose not to join in a minesbetterthanyours competition his own gascraft was also spacecapable in an emergency but untested at those depths hed tried contacting apsile in the drop ship but had come up with static the passive positioning grid cast by the equatorial satellites was functioning but both scaledegraded and patchy indicating there were some satellites gone or not working knowing where you were in nasqueron or any gasgiant was important but still less than half the story there was a solid rocky core to the planet a spherical mass of about ten earthsized planets buried under seventy thousand vertical kilometres of hydrogen helium and ice and there were purists who would call the transition region between that stony kernel and the hightemperature highpressure water ice above it the planets surface but you had to be a real nitpicker even to pretend to take that definition seriously beyond the water ice technically ice because it was effectively clamped solid by the colossal pressure but at over twenty thousand degrees confusingly hot for the human image of what ice was supposed to be like came over forty thousand vertical kilometres of metallic hydrogen then a deep transition layer to the tenkiloklick layer of molecular hydrogen which if you were of an especially imaginative turn of mind you might term a sea above that in the relatively thin at a mere few thousand kilometres but still vastly complicated layers reaching up towards space were the regions where the dwellers lived in the contrarotating belts and zones of rapidly spinning gases which dotted with storms great and small spattered with eddies embellished with festoons bars rods streaks veils columns clumps hollows whirls vortices plumeheads shear fronts and subduction flurries girdled the planet where the dwellers lived where everything happened there was no solid surface and no features at all which lasted more than a few thousand years save for the bands of gas forever charging past each other great spinning wheels of atmosphere whirling like the barely meshed cogs in some demented gearbox a hundred and fifty thousand kilometres across the convention was that the equatorial satellites followed the averagedout progress of the broad equatorial zone establishing a sort of stationary parameterset from which everything else could be worked out relatively but it was still confusing nothing was fixed the zones and belts were relatively stable but they shot past each other at combined speeds of what humans were used to thinking of as the speed of sound and the margins between them changed all the time torn by furiously curling eddies writhing this way and that or thrown out compressed and disturbed by giant storms like the great red spot of the solar systems jupiter riding between a zone travelling one way and a belt going the other like a vast squashed whirlpool caught in some mad clash of violently opposed currents developing raging and slowly dissipating over the centuries that humanity had been able to watch it in a gasgiant everything either evolved revolved or just plain came and went and the whole human mindset of surfaces territory land sea and air was thrown into confusion add the effects of a vastly powerful magnetic field swathes of intense radiation and the sheer scale of the environment you could drop the whole of a planet the size of earth or sepekte into a decentsized gasgiant storm and the human brain was left with a lot to cope with and all this before one took into account the to be generous playful attitude which the dwellers themselves so often exhibited to general planetary orientation and the help or otherwise conventionally seen as being fit and proper to be extended to directionally challenged alien visitors i thought wed be in the midst of them the colonel sent dwellers fassin asked studying the complex schematic of who and what might be where at the moment yes i imagined we would find ourselves in one of their cities they both looked around at the vast haze of slowly swirling gas extending depending on which frequency or sense one chose to experience it in a few metres or a few hundred kilometres away on every side it felt very still even though they were part of the equatorial zone and so being spun around the planet at over a hundred metres a second while swirling slowly around the upwelling and rising gradually with it too fassin felt himself smiling in his wrapping of shockgel well theres a lot of dwellers but its a big planet it seemed odd to be explaining this to a creature whose kind had evolved in planets like this and who surely ought to be familiar with the scale of a gasgiant but then oerileithe in fassins admittedly limited experience of them often did display a kind of halfresentful awe towards dwellers entirely consistent with a belief that the instant you dropped beneath the cloud tops youd find yourself surrounded by massed ranks of magisterial dwellers and their astoundingly awesome structures a misapprehension it was hard to imagine any dweller even considering correcting the oerileithe were an ancient people by human standards and by those of the vast majority of species in the developed galaxy but with a civilisation going back about eight hundred thousand years they were mere mayflies by dweller standards a thought occurred to fassin you ever been in a dweller planet before colonel indeed not a privilege denied until now hatherence made a show of looking about not unlike home really another thought occurred you did receive clearance didnt you colonel clearance seer taak to come down to enter nasq ah the colonel sent not as such i do confess it was thought that i would be remote delving with you and your colleagues from the shared facility on the third fury moon braam ganscerel himself took the time to assure me of this personally no objection was raised regarding such a presence i believe that permission was in the process of being sought for me to accompany you physically into the atmosphere if that became necessary as indeed it now has however the last that i heard in that regard indicated that the relevant clearances had yet to materialise why do you envisage there being a problem oh shit the dwellers fassin told her can be pernickety about that sort of thing pernickety he thought they were liable to declare the colonel an honorary child give her a halfhour start and set off to hunt her they take their privacy quite seriously unauthorised entries are severely discouraged well im aware of that you are good i shall throw myself upon their mercy right i see you are either quite brave and possessed of a decent sense of humour fassin thought or you really should have done more homework so seer fassin taak in which direction ought we to proceed should be a cloudtunnel about four hundred klicks that way fassin sent turning the gascraft to point more or less south and slightly down unless its moved obviously shall we the colonel said drifting in that direction going to ping one of our sats let them know were alive fassin told her this is wise was it wise fassin wondered there had been some sort of attack on the seer infrastructure around nasqueron but that didnt mean the whole nearplanet environment had been taken over on the other hand how fast can that esuit go he asked the colonel at this density about four hundred metres per second about half that on sustained cruise fassins arrowcraft could just about keep pace with that disappointing he was still hoping to give the colonel the slip at some point it looked like he wasnt going to be able to just outrun her ping sent he told hatherence lets go they went quickly theyd got about a hundred metres away when a flash of violet light ripped the cloud apart behind them and a stark shortlived beamcluster splayed through the volume of gas theyd been floating within a few seconds earlier further beams radiated out from the initial target point pulsing through the atmosphere in slowly spreading semirandom stabs one flicked into existence about fifty metres from them booming and crackling all the rest were much further away and after a minute or so they ceased altogether somebody would seem to be illdisposed towards you seer taak the colonel sent as they flew through the gas so it would appear the flash and emp came a couple of minutes after that a low rumbling concussion caught up with them some time later was that a nuke fassin sent his instruments seemed to leave no other interpretation but he still found it hard to believe i am unaware of any phenomenon able to mimic one so convincingly fucking hell i float corrected somebody would seem to be extremely illdisposed towards you seer taak the dwellers are not going to be happy he told hatherence only theyre allowed to let off nukes in the atmosphere he explained and it isnt even fireworks season they found the cloudtunnel about where fassin had thought it ought to be only a hundred kilometres out laterally and two kilometres further down bang on by nasqueron standards the cloudtunnel was a bundle of a dozen or so carboncarbon tubes like some vast barely braided cablecluster floating in the midst of an unending cloudscape of gently billowing yellow orange and ochre the cloudtunnels two main tubes were about sixty metres in diameter the smallest basically comms and telemetry wave guides less than half a metre the whole cluster had looked threadthin when theyd first caught sight of it tens of kilometres away but up close it looked like a hawser fit to tether a moon a great deep rushing sound rumbled from inside the two main pipes what now the colonel sent we see if my vicarious kudos credit is still good fassin used one of the arrowcrafts manipulators to prod one of the wave guides working the filaments through the tubes protective sheath without breaking it a hairthin wire extended into the matrix of light filling the narrow tube information streamed from the far end of the wire into the gascrafts biomind its transitional systems and then into fassins head forming a coded chaos of babbling sound wildly scintillating visuals and other confused sensory experiences the interruption in the light streams had already been noticed and allowed for a pulse of information aimed right at the filament sent an identity request and inquired whether assistance was required otherwise stop interfering with a public information highway a human fassin taak privileged to be slow seer at the court of the nasqueron dwellers he sent id like some assistance in the shape of transport at the given location bound for hauskip city he was told to wait fassin taak outbander stranger alien seer human and whats this this is colonel hatherence of the mercatorial militaryreligious order the shrievalty ocula an oerileithe good day dweller ysul hatherence said they had switched to using ordinary soundspeech a little dweller how fascinating not a child then ysul a sizeable midadult a good nine metres or so in diameter rolled through the gas and extending one long spindlearm clunked a fistbunch binkbinkbink on the esuit of the colonel hellooo in there ysul said hatherences discus of esuit leaned to one side under the rain of notsogentle blows pleased to meet you she replied tersely not a child fassin confirmed they were in a giant bowllike room roofed with slatediamond micrometres thin in a thickeneers club in hauskip city hauskip lay within the equatorial zone of nasqueron one of the hundred thousand or so major conurbations in that particular atmospheric band seen from the right angle in a sympathetic light it looked a lot like the internal workings of an ancient mechanical clock multiplied and magnified several thousand times from far enough away or just seen in a schematic it resembled millions of toothedlooking wheels caught up in amongst each other with larger sets of wheels interconnecting with them through hubs and spines and spindles themselves linking up with still greater sets of wheels the whole mighty slowly gyrating and spinning assemblage easily a couple of hundred kilometres in diameter floated within a thick soup of gas a hundred kilometres beneath the cloud tops the city was the hub for several cloudtunnel lines once an empty car had made its way to the access hatch nearest to where fassin and hatherence pitched up alongside the cloudtunnel it had taken two changes of line riding in the same car for fassin and the colonel to get there through the network of partially evacuated highspeed transit tubes the whole journey had taken one of nasquerons short daynight cycles they had each slept for most of the time though just before fassin had dozed off the colonel had said we go on you agree major we continue our mission until we are ordered to cease iagree he said we go on the tunnelcar had docked sphinctered its way through a tunnelbud wall in hauskips central station and sped through the gelatinous atmosphere straight to the equatorial eighth progression thickeneers club where ysul fassins longtime guidementorguard had been attending a party to celebrate the completion and expulsion ceremony of one of the clubs members dwellers started out looking like anorexic manta rays this was in their brief occasionally hunted childhood phase then grew fattened split most of the way down the middle adolescence kind of shifted from a horizontal to a vertical axis and ended up as adults basically resembling something like a pair of large webbed fringed cartwheels connected by a short thick axle with particularly bulbous outer hubs onto each of which had been fastened a giant spider crab part of the transition from recent to midadulthood involved a period called thickening when the slim and flimsy discs of youth became the stout and sturdy wheels of later life and it was customary for dwellers to join a club of their approximate contemporaries while this was taking place there was no specific reason for dwellers to band together at this point in their lives they just in general enjoyed joining clubs sodalities orders leagues parties societies associations fellowships fraternities groups guilds unions fractionals dispensationals and recreationalities while always of course leaving open the possibility of taking part in ad hoc nonceremonial serendipitous onetime gatherings as well the social calendar was crowded ysul had invited them to this private bookcrystallined library room in his thickeneers club rather than to his home so that as he explained if they were too boring or in too great a hurry he could get back without an overgreat delay to his chums taking part in the ceremonial dinner and spree in the banqueting hall below so fassin good to see you ysul said why have you brought this little dweller with you is she food no of course not she is a colleague of course though there are no oerileithe seers she is not a seer then not a colleague she has been sent to escort me by the mercatorial militaryreligious order the shrievalty ocula i see ysul dressed in his best smartbutcasual finery all brightly coloured fringes and lacily ornate ruffs rocked back rotating slightly then came forward again no i dont what am i saying what is this ocula well it took a while to tell after about a quarter of an hour this all thankfully in realtime with no slowdown factor fassin thought hed pretty much briefed ysul as well and as completely as he could without giving too much away the colonel had contributed now and again not that ysul seemed to have taken any notice of her ysul was about fifteen thousand years old a fulladult who was perhaps another one or two millennia away from becoming a traav the first stage of primehood at nine metres vertical diameter not including his semiformal dinner clothes whose impressive body ruff added another metre he was about as large as a dweller ever got his double disc was nearly five metres across the modestly clothed central axle barely visible as a separate entity more of an unexpected thinning between the two great wheels dwellers shrank very slightly as they aged after midadulthood and slowly lost both hub and fringe limbs until by the time they were in their billions they were often nearly limbdisabled even then they could still get about as a rule their motive force came from a system of vanes extending from the inner and outer surfaces of their two main discs these extended to beat sometimes twisting to add extra impetus or to steer and lay flat on the backstroke so that a moving dweller seemed to roll through the atmosphere this was called roting very old dwellers often lost the use of or just lost the vanes on the outside of their discs but usually retained those on the inside so that no matter how decrepit they might get they could still wheel themselves around it boils down ysul said at the end to the fact that you are looking for the choal valseir to resume subjectspecific studies in a library within his control pretty much fassin agreed i see ysul you have always been a great help to me can you help me in this problem ysul said problem fassin asked valseir is dead and his library has been consigned to the depths or split up possibly at random amongst his peers allies families cospecialists enemies or passersby probably all of the above dead fassin said he let horror show on the signalling carapace of the gascraft a quite specific whorl pattern which indicated being intellectually and emotionally appalled at the demise of a dweller friendacquaintance not least because they had died in the course of pursuing a line of inquiry that one was oneself deeply fascinated by but he was only a choal he was billions of years from dying valseir had been about a million and a half years old and on the brink of passing from the cuspian level to that of sage choal was the last phase of being a cuspian the average age of progressing from cuspianchoal to sagechild was over two million years but valseir had been judged by his elders and allegedly betters as being ready even at such a modest count of time he was or had been a oneandahalfmillionyearold prodigy he had also last time fassin had seen him seemed strong vigorous and full of life agreed he spent most of his life with his rotary snout stuck in a library and didnt get out much but still fassin could not believe he was dead the dwellers didnt even have any diseases he could have died of how could he be dead yachting accident if i recall ysul said do i fassin sensed the dweller radioing an inforequest to the patchwalls of the library room yes i do yes a yachting accident his stormjammer got caught in a particularly vicious eddy and it came apart on him skewered with a main beam or a yard arm or something on a brighter note they salvaged most of the yacht before it descended to the depths he was a very keen sailor terribly competitive when fassin asked i heard nothing not long ago ysul said couple of centuries at the most there was nothing on the news nets really ah wait another radioed inforequest yes i understand he left instructions that in the event of his death it was to be regarded as a private matter ysul flexed his hubmounted spindlearms on either side all of them right out quite understand done the same myself is there any record of what happened to his library fassin asked ysul rocked back again a pair of giant conical wheels rotating slowly away then pitching forward once more he hung in midgas and said dyou know what what no there isnt is that not strange we i would really like to look into this matter further ysul can you help us in this i most certainly ah talking about news nets there is something about an unauthorised fusion explosion not far from the point you accessed the cloudtunnel from anything to do with you oh shit fassin thought again yes it would appear that somebody is trying to kill me or possibly the colonel here he waved at hatherences esuit still floating next to him she had been silent for some time fassin was not certain this was a good sign i see ysul said and talking about the good colonel i am struggling to discover her authorisation for being here at all i mean well fassin said we were forced to take refuge in nasqueron some time before we imagined it would be necessary due to unprovoked hostile action the colonels permissions were being sought some time before we left but had not yet come through when we had to make our emergency entry the colonel is technically here without explicit permission and therefore throws herself upon your mercy as a shipwreckee a wartime asylumee and a fellow gasgiant dweller in need of shelter fassin turned and looked at the colonel who shifted about her vertical axis to return his gascraftdirected gaze she claims sanctuary he finished provisionally given of course ysul said though the precise meaning of unprovoked might be challenged in a wider context and the exact definition of shipwreckee equally could well be open to dispute if one wished to be picky that aside though do i understand there is some sort of dispute in progress out amongst you people you understand correctly fassin told the dweller oh not another one of your wars please ysul protested with a rollingback of his whole body which was actually relatively easy for a human to interpret correctly as an equivalent of rolling ones eyes though to be fair there was quite a lot of dweller gestures with this translation well pretty much yes fassin told him your passion for doing each other harm never ceases to amaze delight and horrify im told there is to be a formal war between zone and belt c fassin said i too am told that ysul said brightly do you really think it will happen im not optimistic frankly some appallingly good negotiators have been drafted in i understand ah your hull carapace doing the job of standing in feebly for the body you so sadly lack bears marks upon it which i take to mean you were being sarcastic earlier never mind ysul right then shant now then valseir there is a point of congruency there is yes with what between what and what his demise and this war weve been promised really yes his old study it is in the current zone of disputation i believe but if its already been broken up fassin began oh there are bound to be backups and im not even sure the old fellow has been finally put to rest after two hundred years come now fassin there were matters of probate and its in the war zone very likely yes isnt it exciting i think we ought to go there immediately ysul waved all his limbs at once lets form an expedition we shall go together he looked at hatherence you can even bring your little friend i have been considering whether to attempt to communicate with your shared facility via your satellites or directly the colonel told him i wouldnt fassin sent but if you decide you must tell me before you try i want to be well out of the volume you think the same sort of attack directed against us following your ping might be directed against us here probably not here in a dweller city but then why risk it we dont know that whoevers been shooting at us quite understands what theyd be letting themselves in for so they might just waste us and have to deal with the consequences later we wont be around to jeer we need to find out what is going on major taak hatherence informed him i know and im going to send a request for information up to a sat from a remote site as soon as ive checked out whats been going on via the local nets the colonel floated over to look at the enormous though ancient and highly directional flat screen which fassin was using in his attempt to find out what had been happening they were in ysuls home a ramshackle wheelhouse in a whole vast district of equally shabbylooking wheelhouses hanging on skinny spindles underneath the citys median level like a frozen image of an entire junkyards worth of exploded gearboxes ysul had escorted them back from his club in a state of some excitement then hed left them alone taken his servant sholish and gone off in search of a decent tailor his usual tailor had most inconveniently taken it into his mind to change trades and become a dreadnought rating probably trying to get in on the ground floor of this upcoming war what have you found the colonel asked watching the flat screen fill with an image of the third fury moon hmm the moon appears almost undamaged this is an old recording fassin explained im trying to find an updated one any mention of the hostilities not very much fassin told her using a manipulator to work the massive stiff controls of the old screen theres been a mention on a minority radio news service but thats it it is regarded as news though this is encouraging i think well dont get too excited fassin sent we are talking about a station some amateurs run for the few people like themselves who are actually interested in things happening in the rest of the system maybe a few thousand dwellers out of a planetary population of five or ten billion the number of dwellers in nasqueron is really that uncertain oh ive seen estimates as low as two billion as high as two hundred even three i encountered this degree of uncertainty in my research hatherence said as fassin switched manually between channels data sets and imagetrails i recall thinking it must be a mistake how can one be two baseten orders of magnitude out cant one just ask the dwellers dont they know themselves how many they are you can certainly ask fassin agreed he put some humour into his signal an old tutor of mine used to say of questions like this that the answers will prove far more illuminating regarding dweller psychology than they will concerning their actual subject they lie to you or they dont know themselves that is a good question too they must have an idea the colonel protested a society has to know how many people it contains otherwise how would it plan infrastructure and so on fassin felt himself smiling thats how it would work in pretty much any other society he agreed there are those who would assert that dwellers are not in fact civilised the colonel said thoughtfully that they could scarcely be said to possess a society in any single planet and on a galactic scale cannot be said to constitute a civilisation at all they exist rather in a state of highly developed barbarism im familiar with the arguments fassin told her would you agree no this is a society we are in a city and even just in the one planet this is a civilisation i know the definitions will have changed over the years and you might take a different view from me but in the history of my planet wed refer to a civilisation based around a single river system or on a small island i forget how smallscale one has to think when dealing with planets with solidsurface livingenvironments the colonel said apparently without meaning to insult but even so the definition of a civilisation has to move on when one ascends to the galactic stage and the dwellers taken as a whole might seem deficient i think it comes down to ones own definition of the terms fassin said hold on this looks promising he swung back from a mosaic of subscreens to a single moving image third fury again though this time looking hazier less defined and shot from some distance away the shallow domes of the shared facility were obvious if not clear down near one tipped edge of the little moonlet a flash on the surface away to one side and a semispherical cloud of debris spreading a glowing crater left where the flash had come from this looks like yesterday hatherence said does doesnt it fassin agreed looks like it was taken from high up on belt a or the south of zone just some amateur pointing a camera fassin found how to spin the stored recording back and then forward then discovered how to zoom in and thats us they watched a cerise spot appear on a glittering blister near the edge of the shared facility and could just make out the grainily defined debris of the hangar dome blowing outward in front of a sudden haze of quickly dissipating mist a tiny dark grey dot rose from the shattered dome and crawled away the drop ship making its desperate dive for the planet fassin spun the recording forward the moons position altered quickly flying away across the dark sky as third fury continued on its orbit and whoever was recording the images was whirled away in the opposite direction by the twentythousandkilometrewide jet stream beneath them definitely band a fassin said a brilliant white flash washed out the whole screen it faded and a crater kilometres across was left debris spread everywhere like a flowers seedhead just ready to shed caught in a sudden hurricane the interior of the crater was white yellow orange red the debris continued to spread it looked like most of it would stay in more or less the same orbit as third fury itself they both watched in silence the moon had changed shape it wobbled seemed to partially collapse in on itself slowly plastically resuming a spherical form after losing so much of its earlier mass yellow cloud tops came up in a nearflat line to meet it and the small glowing globe spun under the horizon fassin let the recording play out and start to loop he stopped it the screen froze on the recordings first image of third fury almost overhead just after the first impact that did not look like a survivable event the colonel sent her sent voice sounded quiet i think youre right i am very sorry how many people would have been in the shared facility base a couple of hundred i saw no sign of your master technicians craft or of the attacks on us once we quit the drop ship fassin compared the recordings time code with the gascrafts own event list those happened after what we saw here he told the colonel over the horizon from where this recording was taken anyway so much for backup or reinforcements the colonel turned towards him we still go on though yes yes so now what fassin taak we need to talk to some people so you want to communicate with your own kind ysul asked via a relay at a remote site fassin said why havent you done so already i wanted to get your permission you dont need my permission you just find a remote dish and send away i suspect any vicarious effect on my kudos level will be too small to measure they were in an antechamber of the citys administrator the antechamber was a sizeable room furnished with wall hangings made from ancient cloudhugger hides all yellowred and whorled a few sported the holes where the creatures had been punctured one curved section of wall was a giant window looking out over the vast floating scape of wheels that was hauskip evening was starting to descend and lights were coming on throughout the city ysul floated over to the window and caused it to hinge down by the unsubtle tactic of bumping into it reasonably hard he then floated out over the impromptu bow of balcony so produced muttering something about liking the view and maybe moving his own house up here a breeze blew in ruffling the old cloudhugger hides as though their longdead occupants were still somehow fleeing from their hunters colonel hatherence leaned over towards fassin this kudos thing then she sent it is really how they calculate their worth im afraid so so its the truth i thought it was a joke distinguishing between the two is not a dweller strong point ysul wandered back failing to shut the window his vanes made a quiet burring noise as he roted through the gas towards them give me the message he said ill forward it via an outoftheway transceiver fassin asked of course well just send to sept bantrabal letting them know im all right and asking whether theyre okay at their end i imagine they already know what happened to the third fury moon you might ask them whether anything has been heard of master technician apsile and the drop ship which escaped the moons assault and what happened to the ships supposed to be protecting third fury ahem the colonel said they both looked at her is this wise she asked you mean should i pretend to be dead fassin said yes that did occur to me but there are people id like to know im alive he thought of that glimpse of a flash which might have been something hitting glantine while third fury was being bombarded and id like to know my friends and family are all right of course the colonel said however i wonder if it might be more sensible for me to communicate with my superiors first we might ask dweller ysul here to let me use this remote relay once a more secure link had been established perhaps via one of the warships which i assume are still somewhere around the planet a message might be sent to your sept to let them know you are well none of which need take long while hatherence had been speaking ysul had floated right up to her seemingly intent on peering through the front plate of her esuit which was in fact completely opaque and indeed armoured eventually he was within a centimetre of her towering above the oerileithe the colonel did not retreat one of ysuls rim limbs tapped more delicately this time on the colonels esuit casing would you mind not doing that sir she said frostily why are you still inside that thing little dweller ysul asked because i am evolved for higher colder levels with a different gasmix and pressure gradient dweller ysul i see ysul drew back and you have a very strange accent and way with grammar i swear this human speaks better than you do what were you saying again i was asking you kindly to refrain from making physical contact with my esuit no before that i was suggesting i make contact with my superiors military superiors yes ysul turned to fassin that sounds more interesting than your plan fassin ysul two hundred of my people died yesterday if not more id like yes yes yes but i might have to signal glantine direct if no satellites are left hatherence was saying as a tall door swung up in one wall and a dweller in ceremonial clothes poked its rim out ill see you now said the city administrator the administrators office was huge the size of a small stadium it was ringed with holoscreen carrels fassin counted a hundred or so of the study stations though only a few were occupied by dwellers mostly fairly young there were no windows but the ceiling was diamond leaf with most of the sections slid round to leave the place open to the rapidly darkening sky floatlamps bobbed casting a soft yellow light over them as they followed the administrator to her sunken audience area in the centre of the giant room you are pregnant ysul exclaimed how delightful so people keep telling me the administrator said sourly dwellers were for want of a better term male for over ninetynine per cent of their lives only changing to the female form to become pregnant and give birth becoming female and giving birth was regarded as a social duty the fact that the obligation was more honoured than not made it unique in dweller mores it contributed mightily to ones kudos tally and anyway had a sort of sentimental attraction for all but the most determinedly misanthropic members of the species statistically about fortythree per cent still it was undeniably a burden and very few dwellers went through the experience without complaining mightily about it i myself have thought of becoming female oh several times ysul said well its overrated the city administrator told him and particularly burdensome when one had an invitation to the forthcoming war that one is now apparently morally obliged to turn down please take a dent they floated to a series of hollows in the audience area and rested gently within them why i too hope to be going to the war ysul said brightly well somewhere very near it at least i have only just now returned from my tailors after being measured for the most lately fashionable conflict attire oh really the administrator said whos your tailor mine just left for the war not fuerliote ysul exclaimed the same he was mine also just the best absolutely no i had to go to deystelmin is he any good weeeelll ysul waggled his whole doublediscus one lives in hope good mirrorside manner as it were but will it translate into a flattering cut thats the question one has to ask oneself i know agreed the administrator and off to become a junior officer on a dreadnought not even that a rating no yes very lowly for someone so distinguished i know but a smart move getting in as a rating before the recruitment window even properly opens makes sense the smokinguniform effect ah of course fassin tried making a throatclearing noise in the midst of all this but to no effect the smokinguniform effect the colonel lightwhispered to him dead mens shoes fassin explained they only promote from within once hostilities have begun if hes lucky this tailors dreadnought will suffer heavy damage and lose a few officers and hell end up an officer after all if hes really lucky he could rise to admiral hatherence thought about this would a tailor however distinguished necessarily make a good admiral probably no worse than the one hed be replacing the problem was that to the dwellers all professions were in effect hobbies all posts and positions sinecures this tailor that ysul and the city administrator were babbling on about would have had no real need to be a tailor he was just somebody whod found he possessed an aptitude for the pastime or more likely for the gossiping and fussing generally associated with it he would take on clients to increase his kudos the level of which would increase proportionally the more powerful were the people he tailored for so that somebody in a position of civil power would constitute a favoured client even if that position of power had come about through a lottery some arcanely complicated rota system or plain old coercive voting jobs like that of city administrator were subject to all those regimes and more depending on the band or zone concerned or just which city was involved the city administrator in return would be able to drop casually into just the right conversations the fact she had such a wellknown highkudos tailor obviously ysul had had sufficient kudos of his own to be able to engage the services of this alphaoutfitter too people further down the pecking order would have employed less wellconnected tailors or just got their clothes from common which was dweller for in this particular case offthepeg and in general just meant massproduced kudosfree availableasamatterofrightjustbecauseyoureadweller well pretty much anything up to and including spaceships though having seen round a few dweller spaceships fassin thought the stackemhighandgivethemawayfree approach had its limitations indeed ysul was saying my own bid for jo status has been languishing for centuries and wasnt even mentioned this time round entering as a rating seems demeaning but it could pay off big if there are casualties of course of course the administrator said then fastened her gaze on the colonel whats this an oerileithe a little dweller ysul said with what sounded like pride gracious not a child or food i asked pleased to meet you the colonel said with as much dignity as she could muster an oerileithe it appeared attracted even less respect amongst dwellers than fassin and he suspected the colonel herself had expected the oerileithe had evolved relatively recently quite independently of the vast unutterably ancient mainstream of galactic dwellerdom and as such were seen by their more venerable cogasgiantinhabitants as something between an annoying collective loose end and a bunch of impudent planetusurping interlopers and this must be the slow seer the administrator looked briefly at fassins gascraft before returning her gaze to ysul do we need to talk slowly for it no administrator fassin said before ysul could reply iam running on your timescale at the moment how fortunate she flicked to one side and stabbed at a screen remote her frontal radius edge lit up by the holos glow hmm i see so all the mayhem of the last day or two is your fault then has there been much mayhem maam well the partial destruction of a closeorbit moon would fit most peoples definition of mayhem the administrator said pleasantly an attractive feature in the sky whenever one ventured towards the cloud tops been there millions of years slagged within a few per cent of breaking up completely a ring of debris scattered round its orbit that orbit itself changed significantly causing everything else up there to have to shuffle round to accommodate the alteration a small bombardment of debris across three bands some chunks narrowly missing several items of infrastructure with more than sentimental value and others setting off automatic planetarydefence laser batteries a cascade of satellite destruction that has yet to be put entirely right oh and an unauthorised fusion explosion middle of nowhere granted but still none of this happily within my jurisdiction but trouble does appear to be rather following you around human taak and here you are in my city the administrator rolled fractionally towards fassins gascraft thinking of staying long well fassin began the human is under my protection administrator ysul interrupted i vouch for it entirely and will continue to accept all kudos consequences regarding its actions i shall take all steps necessary to safeguard it from whatever hostile forces may wish it ill may i count on your support for the expedition the human insists on making into the war zone given the administrator said how splendid we can be ready to leave within a couple of days especially if the tailor deystelmin is persuaded to prioritise my combatclothing order ill have a word too kind i swear i shall never nominate you for a coercive vote again my gratitude knows no bounds if dwellers could grit their teeth fassin thought the administrators words would have been spoken through them excuse me maam he said yes human taak have you any word on events elsewhere in the system as i say the various rings and moons are shifting fractionally in their orbits to accommodate i think he means the stellar system not that of nasqueron colonel hatherence said the two dwellers turned to look at her dwellers had sensing bands all the way round their outer rims plus eye bubbles low on their outer hubs they were not known as the best glarers in the galaxy but they were always willing to give it their best shot to a dweller their own planet was pretty much everything most gasgiants had many more moons than the average stellar system possessed planets and most radiated a lot more energy than they received from the star they orbited their heattransfer systems weather and ecology arising largely from processes internal to the planet itself not dependent on sunlight their inhabitants had to pay close attention to the skies basically to watch out for incoming but even that consideration led to an obviously gasgiantcentred way of thinking the local star and the rest of its planetary system was of relatively little interest to the average dweller that is not quite what i meant fassin told them quickly the moon glantine for example has it been harmed not to my knowledge the administrator said with another stern look at hatherence and the military ships that were in orbit around third fury the colonel asked shh fassin signalled hatherence no she sent back what ships the administrator said apparently mystified how about the planet sepekte fassin said i have no idea the administrator told him she fixed her gaze on fassin is this why you wished to see me to ask after the welfare of moons and distant planets no maam the reason that i wanted to see you is that i am worried that there may be a threat to nasqueron you are blurted ysul really the administrator said with a sigh even hatherence was turned to look at him there is a war beginning amongst the quick maam fassin told the administrator it is going to come to ulubis and it is not impossible that some of the forces taking part may wish to involve nasqueron and its dwellers in that war in some way the administrator rolled fractionally back and sucked her outer trimfrill in the dweller equivalent of a frown major the colonel sent you said nothing of this what do you base this on is there something youre not telling me a hunch just trying to get their attention and i should point out that its considered impolite to signalwhisper like this the administrator continued to look at fassin for a moment then turned to ysul ts this human normally mad ysul made a sucking sound down to definitions nasqueron might be vulnerable to a further bombardment fassin persisted even to some sort of raid ha ysul laughed we are not defenceless human taak the administrator said loudly no but your spaceships are leaky antiques and your planetary defences are set up for dumb rocks fassin thought wearily you talk a good defence but if the epiphany invaders decide to attack or the mercatoria decides im dead and they plump for a more obvious way to get hold of whatever might be in valseirs library you wont be able to do much to stop them going on what ive seen a single navarchy military destroyer could lay waste to your whole planet over time of course not he agreed but i would ask you to pass this information on to the relevant authorities you will be still better defended if you are prepared ill bear that in mind the administrator told him levelly oh shit fassin thought youre going to do fuck all you arent going to bother telling anybody ysul was looking up whats that he asked fassin experienced a moment of horror he looked up too a stubby vaned cylinder a couple of metres high was hovering vertically above them in the darkness outside the ceilings stillopen diamond petals it was pointing something long and dark at them the administrator groaned oh no she said that is the press sholish my good cuirass you witless rindnibbling waste of gas ysul threw a piece of armour across the room at his servant the camopainted carbon plate spun through the gas changing colours rapidly as it tried to adapt narrowly missed several other dwellers the large room was crowded and people had to duck bob or dodge just avoided sholish and embedded itself in a floattree panel producing a distinct thunk before it had much of a chance to blend in sholish tugged it out of the wall and disappeared into a side chamber muttering excuse me colonel hatherence said sharply to a dweller whod just bumped into her in the general shuffling that had spread through the room to give the thrown piece of armour a clear trajectory excused the dweller said then continued his conversation with another of ysuls relations ysul was getting ready to quit hauskip and leave for the war along with his charges fassin and the oerileithe his new combat clothing had arrived just that morning kudosenhancingly quickly along with various gifts from friends and family most of whom it seemed had thought it best to show up in person to present their mostly useless or positively dangerous gifts and offer vast amounts of generally contradictory but extremely loudly proffered advice ysul flattered and excited to be the centre of so much attention had invited them all into his dressing room for snacks and whatever while he tried on all his new clothing checked that his antique inherited familial armour still more or less fitted and played with all the new bits and pieces hed been given fassin counted over thirty dwellers in the chamber which was one of the larger spaces in the wheelshaped house there was a saying to the effect that one dweller constituted an argumentinwaiting two a conspiracy and three a riot quite what a gathering of thirtyplus was supposed to represent he wasnt sure but it would assuredly have nothing to do with silence or subtlety the noise rang off the curved walls the clothing competed for loudness expressive patterns spread across exposed carapace skin like flipbooks of geometric artwork magnetic chatter swirled infrasound bounced confusion from one wall to another and a heady mix of pheromones bathed the place in frantic currents of dweller hilarity are there other guidescumguards we might employ beside this one hatherence asked pressing up to the wall beneath where fassin floated as another dweller bearing gifts arrived and pushed his way through the throng towards ysul not really fassin told her ysul suffered a significant kudosloss within the guardmentors guild taking on an alien outworlder back when he agreed to be uncle sloviuss mentor he got that back eventually but it was a brave thing to do few of them will accept that kind of loss starting from scratch to find somebody new would take years even if ysul did agree something small round pink and gooey bumped into the top of the colonels esuit and stuck she batted it away what are all these things she said exasperated just hospitality fassin sent with a resigned expression floating drifting round the room were bobfruits flossballs chandeliergumbushes and wobbling breezetrays loaded with sweetmeats moodballoons narcopastes and partysuppositories the guests helped themselves eating ingesting snorting rubbing and inserting away as appropriate the noise seemed to be swelling by the minute as was the collision rate always a sure indicator that dwellers were getting out of it lots of loud bumps hasty cries of excuse me sudden alarming tiltings and bursts of the sort of especially raucous laughter which invariably accompanied the realisation by a dweller that one of its companions had lost control of their buoyancy oh dear fassin said i do believe this is turning into a party are these people intoxicated hatherence asked sounding genuinely shocked fassin looked at her letting his incredulity show colonel he told her they are rarely anything else there was a bang and a yelp from somewhere near where ysul floated a bobfruit exploded in midgas and fell limply to the floor people nearby wiped foamy pieces of fruit off their clothes oops ysul said amidst widespread laughter he cant be the only guide the colonel protested what about other seers they must have guides too they do but its a onetoone thing an exclusive relationship abandoning your guardmentor would be a terrible insult theyd lose all kudos major taak we cannot afford to be sentimental here if there is even a possibility that we might find a better less idiotic guide we ought at least to start looking the guardmentors are a guild colonel they run a closed shop if you dumped one of them none of the rest would touch you youd certainly then find some clown whod offer to act as a guide mentor guard whatever in fact theyd probably have to form a queue but theyd be very young and stupid or very old and ah eccentric and theyd assuredly get you into far more trouble than they were ever likely to get you out of the guardmentors guild would harass them from the start for one thing and the vast majority of other dwellers wouldnt talk to you at all librarians archivekeepers antiquarians exospecialists all the people we most need to talk to in other words in particular would not even give you the time of day they made room for ysuls servant sholish returning from the side chamber with a twopiece highly polished mirrorfinished cuirass sholish was an adolescent only a few hundred years old barely threequarters grown and skinny personal servants always at least two generational stages younger than their masters were fairly common in dweller society especially where the senior dweller was bothering to pursue a hobbycumprofession which actually involved a degree of study andor training when the servant had a fighting chance of picking up the basics of the given trade the better masters regarded their servants more as apprentices than servants and the occasional especially aberrant ones treated their underlings almost as equals ysul had yet to fall prey to such sentimentality and about time you custardbrained phlegmwart ysul yelled snatching the cuirass from sholishs grasp did you have to forge and weave the armour yourself or did you start gazing at your own reflection and lose all track sholish mumbled retreated i refuse to accept that we are as powerless as you imply major the colonel told fassin he turned to look at the oerileithe we are here very much on sufferance colonel the dwellers can go off entire species of seers for no accountable reason nobodys ever worked out a pattern to this you just suddenly find that you and your kind arent welcome any more it doesnt usually happen while theyre still getting to know a newtocivilisation species but even thats no guarantee they certainly get fed up with individuals ive seen it happen and thats equally random every time i come down here i have to accept that no matter how friendly and helpful everybody might have been during my last visit the colonel gave a sceptical laugh they might have nothing more to do with me this time or ever again in fact they might tell me ive got a day to get out or become the object of a hunt and a seer faces that prospect every single time they delve either remotely or directly we just have to get used to it they dont even need to have met you there are records of seerstobe whove spent decades getting trained up whove been part of respected seer septs going back millennia whove been about to go on their very first delve and been told not to bother and to stay away for ever its a minor miracle theyve accepted you the way they have and dont forget the only reason youre not constantly being challenged as an interloper is because ysul is on record as vouching for you you are saying we are stuck with this buffoon we are i know its hard to believe but hes one of the better ones core help us why waste time i shall apply for my posthumous decoration immediately the volunteer guild of guardmentors existed to look after dwellers visiting from other bands of the same planet or very rarely from another gasgiant usually one within the same stellar system dwellers almost always alone did make journeys from one stellar system to another but it didnt happen often and it usually meant that the individual concerned had been thrown out of their own home gasgiant for some particularly heinous crime or unforgivable character defect the dwellers had pretty much stopped making deep space trips en masse after the second diasporian age when the galaxy had been half the age it was now it was generally held that seven billion years lack of practice probably accounted for the sheer awfulness of dweller spaceship design and building standards though fassin wasnt convinced that cause and effect hadnt been confused here they were due to leave for the war zone the following day the interval since the frustrating audience with the city administrator had been spent fending off dweller journalists and their news remotes and trying to find out what they could about events in the wider system eventually theyd had to compromise and trade one journalist got a very guarded but exclusive interview from fassin very guarded indeed colonel hatherence kept coughing loudly whenever they approached any subject remotely to do with their mission in return for news of the outside the third fury moon had been devastated and all on or in it had perished there was no news of a drop ship surviving though equally there was no news of any wreckage from such a ship being found however of course if it had just dropped into the depths many satellites had been destroyed or damaged those belonging to the quick this meant the mercatoria appeared to be either missing or out of action some warships belonging to the current local quick species had spent an amount of time investigating the rubble of the moon third fury the moon glantine appeared much as it always had stellarsystem ship traffic appeared light as it had for some days now but not anomalous a signal had been sent on the behalf of oculan colonel hatherence on the authority of guardmentor ysul of hauskip to the moon glantine no reply had yet been received nothing untoward had happened to the transmitting station responsible following the transmission according to the journalist this was all stuff they could have found out themselves eventually the trick was knowing where to look the journalist seemed to feel miffed that theyd got the better end of the deal too because everything hed told them was at least ninety per cent true specifically to avoid upsetting them he knew aliens could be funny that way what exactly did your friend say he said they wanted him to to gasline a whole bunch of stuff for im pretty certain those were his exact words then he seemed to realise he was saying too much giving too much away and he changed the subject the hesitation that sudden change of subject made the earlier form of words all the more important he realised he was speaking to somebody who spent a lot of his life in nasqueron who might not feel the same way he would about the implications of what he was talking about this was spoken in humanised gclear very close to this meanings are pretty much identical just altered pronunciation for the human voice no anglish words involved none so he said gaslined not streamlined or airlined one wouldnt say airlined as far as i know the normal form of words would be streamlined he chose gaslined without thinking because it was more technically correct because it has a narrower meaning in this context it means altering a vacuumcapable craft so that it can also operate in an atmosphere like nasquerons which you take to mean that an invasion or largescale destructive raid upon us is imminent i think some sort of raid is a distinct possibility this seems a thin thread to hang such a weighty fear upon i know but please understand the guys company builds and refits threequarters of the systems war craft the phrase gaslined is quite specific and that sudden change of tack when he realised he was talking to somebody who might be sentimentally or emotionally attached to nasqueron and sympathetic towards dwellers is significant i know this man ive known him since i was a child i know how his mind works attempting to invade a gasgiant would nevertheless be a momentous action in seven thousand years the mercatoria has done no such thing the situation is desperate for them locally they are under threat of invasion within the year a standard year not one of yours help is at least one more standard year away beyond that in fact the invasion may already be beginning the attacks on third fury and the mercatorias other assets around nasq could be part of it and attempting to invade us helps them how they think there may be something here which will make a difference some information thats why im here to look for it but if they thought i was dead or not likely to succeed the mercatoria might intervene directly plus the invaders the mercatoria is worried about might well think the same way with even less cause to hesitate i get the impression the future continuance of dweller studies is kind of low on their set of priorities fassin what sort of information could possibly make such a course of action seem sensible important information more specifically very important information you are not willing to tell me willing or able best you dont know so you tell me if i thought the specifics would help convince you id let you know fassin lied he was talking to a dweller called setstyin setstyin liked to call himself an influence pedlar which was a humble term for somebody with contacts extending as high as his went dweller society was remarkably flat in terms of social hierarchy flat as the surface of a neutron star compared to the sheer verticality of the mercatorias baroque monstrosity but to the extent that there was a top and bottom of society the suhrl setstyin was in touch with both he was a society host and a parttime social worker a hospital visitor and a friend to the great and good as far as either could be said to exist in dweller terms a sociable clubbable creature intensely and genuinely interested in other people more so even than in kudos this made him very unusual even strange almost threatening he was in human terms somewhere between a total geek and very cool his geekiness was that bizarre failure to care about the one thing that everybody agreed really mattered kudos while his coolness came from the same source because not caring about kudos not obsessing about it not chasing it down wherever it might be found not constantly measuring ones own coolness against that of ones peers was in itself kind of cool as long as there was not the faintest shadow of a suspicion he was playing some weird backgame deliberately pursuing kudos by pretending not to so long as his lack of interest in it was seen as being the unaffected carelessness of a kind of wise naif he was kudosrich though in a curiously unenviable way it had been slovius who had first explained to fassin how kudos worked fassin had thought it was a bit like money slovius had explained that even money wasnt like money used to be but anyway kudos was sometimes almost an opposite the harder youd worked for your kudos the less it was worth setstyin was also one of the most sensible levelminded dwellers fassin had ever encountered and he treated a request by a mere human to wake up speed up and converse over the phone with a degree of respect and seriousness that few other dwellers would have fassin had told hatherence he needed time to let his human brain and body sleep and his arrowcraft selfrepair and recharge itself hed retreated to the long spoke room hed been allocated in ysuls house this was a dark and dusty gallery littered with piles of discarded clothes lined with ancient wardrobes and floored with outoffavour paintings and crumpled wall hangings there was a doubledent dweller bed in there too and a treefoamlined cubby by one wall so it kind of constituted a bedroom not that fassin or his gascraft really needed such a thing fassin had secured the door used the little arrowcrafts sonic senses to locate a removable ceiling panel and exited through the double skin roof into a breezy and relatively dark night like all dweller cities hauskip was situated in a historically calm patch within its atmospheric volume but cities still had weather they experienced pressure differentials squalls fog rain snow crosswinds upwellings down draughts lateral force and spin all depending on the state of the gas stream around them moderately buffeted halfhidden by the shreds of thicker gas scudding across the lamplit night fassin had made his way up and out across the sheen of rooftops sky traffic had been relatively light most travel would be within the spindles and spokes linking the citys main components but there had been a few dwellers roting about in the distance and enough small craft packetdelivery machines mostly for fassin to hope he was going unremarked distant lightning had flickered deep below fassin had come to a dangling waveguide cable a few centimetres thick followed it up to a deserted public plaza like a vast empty bowl circled with dim attenuated lights and found a public screen booth setstyin was also in the equatorial band though on the other side of the planet fassin might therefore have hoped to find him awake at such a time but setstyin had been sleeping off the effects of an especially good party hed hosted the night before dwellers could go for tens of their days without sleep but when they did sleep they tended to do so on a prodigious scale fassin had begged and pleaded with setstyins servant to have him woken and even then it had taken a while setstyin looked and sounded groggy but it appeared that his mind was fully awake inside there somewhere and you would like me to do what setstyin asked he scratched at his gill fringe with one spindle arm he was wearing a light sleep collar round his midhub which was regarded as a polite minimum when addressing someone other than a close friend or family member over the phone dwellers were hardly selfconscious about showing their innerhub mouth parts and pleasure organs but there was a degree of decorum in such matters especially when confronted with an alien what shall i say fassin and to whom a gust of wind made the arrowcrafts vanes purr to hold it in place as fassin looked into the camerascreen convince whoever you can preferably as high as you can reach preferably discreetly that there really is a threat give them time to decide what theyre going to do if there is a raid it may be best just to let it happen what you dont want to do is have an unthinking hostile reaction that leads to some maniac quick nuking a city or two to try to teach you a lesson setstyin looked confused how would that benefit anybody please just trust me its the sort of thing quick species do you want me to talk to politicians and military people then yes yes politicians and military people in dweller society were as much amateurs and dilettantes as gifted tailors or devout partythrowers like setstyin possibly a little less dedicated but you had fassin reflected to work with what you were presented with setstyin looked thoughtful theyre not going to go with an invasion this was true fassin supposed in the full sense of the word an invasion was impossible the ulubis forces were hopelessly inadequate for the task of occupying a volume as great as nasqueron or any other gasgiant even if it had been inhabited by a congenitally peaceful naturally subservient and easily cowed species rather than well dwellers attempting to control the place with dwellers around would be like peeing into a star the danger was that in carrying out a raid to secure a given volume for long enough to hunt down the information they were looking for the mercatoria would cause the dwellers to react as though they were undergoing a fullscale invasion it seemed to be part of dweller psychology that if something was worth reacting to it was even more worth overreacting to and fassin dreaded to think what that might imply for all sides stress an extended raid and temporary site occupation with aggressive patrols that might be mistaken for an invasion whereabouts setstyin asked or are you really going to tell me you have no idea i understand were going to be looking in or very near the new formal war zone setstyin let his hub arms droop down at his side this was something like a human rolling their eyes well of course where else i dont suppose theres the slightest possibility that the war might be cancelled or postponed there is always a chance but it certainly wont have anything to do with a mere party animal like myself having a word in even the highestplaced ear think there might be the possibility of genuine hostile action against us an act of alien aggression within the winds of nasqueron itself and the suggestion is we call off a formal war more likely well start a few more to show how jolly fierce we are and get some practice in just thought id ask when do you set off for the war zone tomorrow morning hauskip local time there you are in plenty of time for the wars opening ceremony i may have other things on my mind hmm you realise that me having a word on high may well result in you being tracked watched by interested parties whereas that would never happen normally but yes i realise that well i wish you well fassin taak thanks setstyin peered at the camerascreen looking at fassins surroundings ysul out of kudos with the phone operators i have an additional guardmentor in the shape of an oerileithe mercatoria military colonel she might not understand my concern i sneaked out to make the call very cloak very dagger good luck with your quest fassin do keep in touch if youre watching this sal then im dead obviously i dont know what the circumstances of that death may have been like to think i died bravely and honourably in combat kind of dont think youll be watching this because my clogs were popped peacefully in my sleep because i dont mean for that to happen at least not until somethings happened that involves you dying peacefully actually hopefully that would mean youre already dead the thing that involves you sort of involves fass too though not in the same way involves you and me and fass and ilen poor dead ilen ilen deste sal you remember her maybe you dont its been so long for all of us for all these strange different reasons that end up being just the same you with your treatments fass with his slowtime me all einsteined out with too much time near light speed time hasnt ever caught up with any of us has it sal but im thinking you probably do remember ilen and what happened to her because it was all so traumatic for us wasnt it you dont forget anything about something that dramatic and horrible not really how can you you have nightmares about it it sneaks up on you even in the day sometimes too do you find that i get that sometimes its something really obvious like seeing something on screen of somebody hanging by their fingertips over a drop especially if its a woman of course in the screen they usually get rescued not always but usually but then other times what happened just ambushed me ill be doing something completely normal with no cues no stimulus that you can see any logical reason would trigger the memories and suddenly im there im back again back in that big old motherfucker of a ship with you and fass and ilen do you get that i get it still even after all these years youd have thought it would have stopped happening by now wouldnt you hell even without all those stolen years near c youd have thought it should have you know withered fallen away look at me sixtyone years old bodytime they tell me fitter than ever still bedding guys a third my age and do i look sixty hope not but i should have got over the whole thing by now dont you think time a great healer and all that just hasnt happened so do you get anything similar is this ringing any bells at all really id like to know maybe well find out one day maybe ill have got to ask this and youll never get to see this but well have found out together maybe somebody else will get to see this it isnt really meant for anybody else but well this is a highrisk occupation and who knows whatll happen after this is made anyway point is i know what happened and i intend to kill you sal or i did as i say if it is you whos watching this im dead and youre still alive but i want you to know it isnt going to end there got serious intentions of pursuing you from beyond the grave sal old son wont be easy realise that but ive spent my entire career getting myself into a position of power making myself so powerful within the navy that i can click my fingers and battleships power up set course and ship out building networks making friends finding allies taking lovers taking exams running risks all so that ill have the power one day to challenge a man who oh must nearly own the system by now the portal collapse nearly threw me put my plans back a long way but i reckon youll still be alive and loving life when i finally do get home or when whats planned to happen in the event of my death starts happening cant tell you too much obviously no reason to give you any sort of warning at all and all the advantages are on your side already arent they well maybe apart from surprise you surprised now if youre listening to this watching this wondering whats going to happen well wonder away wonder away sal and dont stop wondering dont stop being frightened because being frightened might keep you alive a bit longer not too long definitely not too long but long enough i suppose thats enough now dont you think definitely the longest speech either of us ever delivered even while we were together way back when wouldnt you say maybe almost more than we ever said to each other put together well almost let me explain in case you still havent got it i saw the marks sal i saw the three red lines on your neck before you put your jacket collar up remember that remember pretending to shiver and saying ccollar or whatever it was remember just one of those little false notes that you dont notice at the time because of all the fear and adrenalin that doesnt start to nag at you until long afterwards kept that collar up afterwards too didnt you kept the jacket on like some sort of comfort blanket until you could get to a bathroom and a firstaid kit didnt you i remember and when i was reaching down to ilen i saw her fingernails with the blood under them saw them very distinctly fass didnt still has no idea even yet but i saw them i wasnt entirely sure about the marks on your neck but then i checked remember that last farewell fuck a couple of weeks later just checking they were very faint by then of course but they were there all right you always wanted her didnt you sal always so desired the beautiful ilen did you think because she went into the ship with you she was saying yes did you did she then changed her mind doesnt really matter i suppose i saw what i saw you know whats funny too i was there even if you werent ilen and i just the once but thats something else ill never forget either oh youd have loved to have been there for that wouldnt you bet you would i slept with fass too afterwards just to complete the set much better than you by the way the uniformed figure sat forward right up to the camera staring into it voice going quiet and low iwas coming to get you sal if youre watching this then i didnt make it not personally but even from beyond the grave im still fucking coming to get you the image froze then faded a hand shaking only slightly reached out and turned the viewer off four events during wartime it was a truism that there was not just one galaxy there were many every variety of widely spread sentient life plus a few creat categories which were arguably nonsentient though still capable of interstellar travel and sometimes even every individual speciestype tended to have one galaxy to itself the faring a transcategory that covered all such beings able and willing to venture beyond their own immediate firsthabitats were like the citizens of a vast fully threedimensional but mostly empty city with multitudinous and varied travel systems the majority of people were content to walk and made their slow progress by way of an infinitude of quiet effectively separate deserted streets quiet parks vacant lots remains of wasteland and an entire unmapped network of paths pavements alleys steps ladders wynds and snickets they almost never encountered anybody en route and when they got to where they were going it would be somewhere very similar to the place they had departed from whether that place had been a stars photosphere a brown dwarfs surface a gasgiants atmosphere a comet cloud or a region of interstellar space such species were generally called the slow the quick were different mostly originating from rocky planets of one sort or another they lived at a higher speed and could never be content forever plodding from place to place that they had been forced to do so until a viable wormhole network had been established was regarded as quite bad enough wormhole access portals were the pinchpoints of the wormhole system the citys underground stations where people of varying speciestypes were forced to meet and to some extent mingle though given the tiny amount of time one spent near a portal or within a wormhole even this seemingly profound tyingtogether made very little difference to the ultimate unconnectedness of the many different lifestrands and both before they gathered and after they dispersed the users of the system still tended to congregate at places specific to their own comfort criteria usually quite different from those of all the others many people regarded the cincturia as the equivalent of animals birds dogs cats rats and bacteria they too lived in the city but were not responsible for it or entirely answerable to it and were often to a greater or lesser degree inimical to its smooth running accounting for the rest the nonbaryonic penumbrae the d dimensionates and the fluxdwelling quantarchs was a little like discovering that the ground the fabric of the citys buildings and their foundations plus the air itself were each home to another sort of life altogether the mercatoria largely but not entirely made up the galaxys current crop of oxygen breathers inhabited its own galaxy then as did all the other categories of life and all these different galaxies existed alongside every other one each interpenetrating the rest surrounded by and surrounding the others yet hardly affecting or being affected by them except sometimes through the inestimably precious and all too easily destroyed wormhole network us oh we were like ghosts in the cabling slavechildren were crawling along the giant blades of one of the dreadnoughts main propellers packing welding gear backsacks of carbon weave and heavy gluethrowers the pulsing drone of the vessels engines and main propulsion thrummed through the wrapcloak of brown billowing mist filling the slipstreamed gas and the structure of the huge ship with buzzing building rising and fading harmonics like a vast unending symphony of industrial sound fassin and the colonel watched from an open gantry overlooking the ring of giant engines as the two teams of dweller infants crawled along the massive blades to the warped and flapping blade ends the starboardmost propeller had been hit by a section of dewcloud root the root had fallen out of the clouds above probably from a dying dewcloud floating and decomposing tens of kilometres above dewclouds were enormous foamy plants anything up to ten kilometres across and five or six times that in height like all gasgiant flora they were mostly gas a dweller in a hurry could probably rip right through the canopy of one hardly noticing they were in the midst of a plant not an ordinary cloud to a human they looked like some monstrous cross between an elongated mushroom and a jellyfish the size of a thunder cloud part of an ubiquitous clade found wherever dwellers were they harvested water condensation out of dwellerine gasgiant atmospheres using their dangling thick and relatively solid roots to exploit the temperature difference between the various atmospheric layers when they approached the ends of their lives they floated up to the cold cloud tops and the higher haze layers and bits broke off the dreadnought had prop guards to stop floatingfalling rising stuff interfering with its main propulsion units but the section of root had slipped in between the guard and the propeller itself wreaking brief havoc with the thirtymetrelong vanes before being chewed up and thrown out now the childslaves had to climb out along the blades from the hubs to the tips to make repairs shaped like slim deltas with thin delicatelooking tentacles which had to both clamp them on to the stillrevolving blades and hold the various repair materials the infants were making heavy weather of it dweller officers in motor skiffs rode nearby bellowing orders threats and imprecations at the young they could just stop the fucking propeller the colonel shouted to fassin the open gantry they were holding on to was fourfifths of the way back from the bulbous nose of the giant ship an ellipsoid a little over two kilometres in length and four hundred across the beam the dreadnoughts twentyfour giant enginesets protruded from near its rear in a monumental collar of pylons wires tubular prop guards and nearspherical engine pods the wind howled round hatherences esuit and fassins little arrowcraft slow them down too much apparently fassin yelled back the dreadnoughts captain had cut the starboardmost engineset to quarterpower to give the slavechildren a better chance of completing their repairs without too many casualties the ships giant rudders mounted on the octiform tailplane assembly just aft of the engines were appropriately deployed to compensate for the resulting skewed distribution of thrust fassin glimpsed an escort cruiser through a shortlived break in the clouds a few kilometres away other dreadnoughts and their escorting screens of minor craft were spread out around them in a front a hundred kilometres across and thirty deep a slavechild near one of the vane tips lost its grip and whirled off the end with a distant shriek crashing into the inner edge of the outer prop guard its scream cut off and the limp body was caught in the combined prop wash and sent whirling back narrowly avoiding a further collision with the tail assembly it disappeared behind a giant vertical fin when it came back into sight it was already starting to spiral slowly down into the enveloping cloud haze none of the skiffriding dwellers spared it a second glance the dozens of remaining slavechildren continued to inch their way along the giant blades fassin looked at the colonel woops he said they were hitching a ride to the war zone a tunnelcar had taken them from ysuls house well two tunnelcars a second proving necessary to carry all ysuls baggage and extra clothing plus sholish to the central station from there they joined a longdistance train of ninety or so cars making its way towards the border of zone zero the equatorial zone and band a twenty thousand kilometres away ysul spent a large part of the journey complaining about his hangover you claim to have been around in your present form for ten billion years and you still havent developed a decent hangover cure hatherence had asked incredulous theyd been floating in a restaurant car waiting for the galley to figure out the exact chemical composition of oerileithe food ysul his voice muffled issuing from within a translucent coverall that was the dweller equivalent of dark glasses had replied suffering is regarded as part of the process as is the mentioning of it as is one might add the sympathy one receives from ones companions the colonel had looked sceptical i thought you felt no pain mere physical pain no ours is the psychic pain of realising that the world is not really as splendid as it seemed the evening before and that one may have made something of a fool of oneself and so on i wouldnt expect a little dweller to understand theyd detrained at nuersotse a sphere city riding midaltitude in the boiling ragged fringes of the equatorial belts northern limits nuersotse was barely thirty kilometres in diameter relatively dense by dweller city standards and built for strength and manoeuvrability highspeed transport craft left in convoys every hour or so as one of the band border wheels swung near theyd crossed on the nuersotsianguephuthen band border wheel one a colossal articulated structure two thousand kilometres across held rotating on the border of two atmospheric gasgiant bands protruding a kiloklick into each its whole enormous mass spun by the contrarotating gasstreams on either side band border wheels were the largest moving structures most gasgiant planets possessed if one discounted the globegirdling cloudtunnel networks these only moved in the trivial sense of being whisked round the globe at a few hundred klicks an hour like everything else within a planetary band to a dweller that was stationary band border wheels really spun transferring transport and materials from one band to another with minimal turbulence and in relative safety with the added bonus that they produced prodigious amounts of electricity from their spindle driveshafts these protruded from the upper and lower hubs vast hemispheres whose lower rims were pocked with microwave dishes hundreds of metres across geared up to tear round at blurring mindnumbing speeds and beaming their power to an outer collecting ring of equally enormous stationary dishes which then pumped the energy into docked bulk accumulator carriers the wheel and the city had been caught in the outer edges of a small boundaryriding storm when theyd arrived though both were being moved out of the way as quickly as they could be everything from the planet itself to fassins teeth had seemed to vibrate around them as the turbulencehardened transfer ship hurried them empodded from the cloudtunnel station to the wheel engines labouring wind screaming ammonia hail pelting lightning flashing and magnetic fields making various parts of ysuls baggage and accoutrements buzz and fizz and spark hurled round in the giant centrifuge of the wheel stuck against its inner perimeter the time that theyd spent inside had seemed almost calm by comparison even allowing for the wild wavelike bucking as theyd crossed the zonebelt border shearface itself the storm had been affecting guephuthe more severely than nuersotse the outer equatorial ring of the city was spinning hard parts of its peripheral suburbs and less wellmaintained districts coming apart and peeling away in a welter of thrownout shrapnel their transfer had to buck and weave to dodge the wreckage then take them straight to a tunnelcar marshalling yard beyond the city proper a splay of cable filaments waving slowly in the gale like a vast anemone another multikiloklick cloudtunnel journey through the vastness of belt a the northern tropical another wheel transfer calmer this time into zone and finally crossing the midline of the zone theyd started to encounter more military traffic than civilian the cars and trains packed with people supplies and materiel all heading for the war at tolimundarni on the fringe of the war zone itself theyd been thrown off the train by military police who werent falling for ysuls preemptively outragefuelled arguments regarding the summitlike priority and blatant extreme officiality of an expedition nay a quest he was undertaking with these yes these two famous wellconnected honoured alien guests of immeasurably high intrinsic pansystemic crossspecies reputation concerning a matter of the utmost import the exact details of which he was sadly not at liberty to divulge even to such patently important and obviously discreet members of the armed forces as themselves but who would nevertheless he was sure entirely understand the significance of their mission and thus their clear right to be accorded unhindered passage due to simple good taste and a fine appreciation of natural justice and would in no way be swayed by the fact that their cooperation would be repaid in levels of subsequent kudos almost beyond crediting theyd floated in the tunnelbud watching the train of cars pulling out sholish had darted around the echoing space trying to round up all the floating and fallen pieces of justejected luggage fassin and hatherence had looked glowering at ysul hed finished dusting himself down and straightening his clothing then done a double take at their aggregated gaze and announced defensively i have a cousin the cousin was an engineering officer on the dreadnought stormshear a thirtyturreter with the beltrotationeers th rolling thunder fleet bindiche the cousin bore a longstanding familial grudge against ysul and so naturally had been only too happy to accept a great deal of kudos from an inwardly mortified outwardly bravefacing hailcuzbygonesnow ysul by doing him the enormous surely nevertobeforgotten favour of vouching for him and his alien companions to his captain and so securing passage into the war zone though even that only happened after a quick suborb flight in a nominally freightonly moonshell pulsed from high tolimundarni to lopscotte again covered by cousin bindiche and his endlessly handy military connections said vile spawn of a hated uncle amassing anguished ysuldonated kudos like the stormshears mighty capacitors accumulated charge scudding over the cloud tops briefly in space but no windows not even any screen to see it listening to ysul complain about the uncannily hangoverresembling aftereffects of the fierce acceleration in the magneticpulse tube and the fact that hed had to leave behind most of his baggage including all the warzone presents his friends had given him and the bulk of the new combat attire hed ordered the slipstream howled and screamed around the seer and the colonel they watched the slavechildren attempt their repairs clustered around the ends of the giant propeller blades fassin thought the dweller young looked like a group of especially dogged flies clinging to a ceilingmounted cooling fan dweller children had a generally feral and entirely unloved existence it was very hard for humans not to feel that adult dwellers were little better than serial congenital abusers and that dweller children ought to be rescued from the relative brutality of their existence even as fassin watched another infant was thrown from one of the giant blades voice a high and anguished shriek this latest unfortunate missed the prop guards but hit a hightension stay cable and was almost cut in half a dweller in a skiff dipped back into the slipstream wrestling with his craft to draw level with the tiny broken body he stripped it of its welding kit and let the body go it disappeared into the mist falling like a torn leaf dwellers cheerfully admitted that they didnt care for their children they didnt particularly care for becoming female and getting pregnant frankly doing this only because it was expected drew kudos and meant one had in some sense fulfilled a duty the idea of having to do even more of having to look after the brats afterwards as well was just laughable they after all had had to endure being thrown out of the house and left to wander wild when they were young theyd taken their chances with the organised hunts the gangs of adolescents and lonehunter specialists so why shouldnt the next generation the little fuckers might live for billions of years what was a mere century of weeding out the slavechildren being used to carry out the repairs to the stormshears damaged propeller would be regarded by most dwellers as extremely lucky they might be imprisoned and forced to carry out unpleasant andor dangerous jobs but at least they were relatively safe unhunted and properly fed fassin looked out at them wondering how many would survive to become adults would any of these skinny trembling deltashapes end up billions of years from now as utterly ancient immensely respected sages the odd thing was of course that if you somehow knew for certain that they would they wouldnt believe you dweller children absolutely to an infant refused to believe even for a moment even as a working assumption even just for the sake of argument that they would ever ever ever grow up to become one of these huge fierce horrible doubledisc creatures who hunted them and killed them and captured them to do all the awful jobs on their big ships seer taak yes colonel so they were back to closecommunicating using polarised light to keep their conversation as private as possible the colonel had suggested coming up here fassin had wondered if it was for some private chat he supposed ordinary talk might have been problematic given the screech of the slipstream around the gantry and the thunderous clamour sounding from the choir of engines just behind i have meant to ask for some time what this thing we are supposed to be looking for without mentioning the specifics even like this using whispersignalling get on with it colonel maam he added do you believe what you told us at that briefing on third fury hatherence asked the one with just yourself ganscerel yurnvic and myself present could all that you told us there possibly be true the long crossing the fabled hole between galaxies the list itself does it matter he asked what we believe always matters fassin smiled let me ask you something may i on the condition that we return to my question very well do you believe in the truth so capitalised so in quotation marks well of course the truth was the presumptuous name of the religion the faith that lay behind the shrievalty the cessoria in a sense behind the mercatoria itself it arose from the belief that what appeared to be real life must in fact according to some piously invoked statistical certitudes be a simulation being run within some prodigious computational substrate in a greater and more encompassing reality beyond this was a thought that had in some form crossed the minds of most people and all civilisations with the interesting exception of the dwellers or so they claimed which some parties held was another argument against them being a civilisation in the first place however everybody well virtually everybody obviously quickly or eventually came round to the idea that a difference that made no difference wasnt a difference to be much bothered about and one might as well get on with what appeared to be life the truth went a stage further holding that this was a difference that could be made to make a difference what was necessary was for people truly to believe in their hearts in their souls in their minds that they really were in a vast simulation they had to reflect upon this to keep it at the forefront of their thoughts at all times and they had to gather together on occasion with all due ceremony and solemnity to express this belief and they must evangelise they must convert everybody they possibly could to this view because and this was the whole point once a sufficient proportion of the people within the simulation came to acknowledge that it was a simulation the value of the simulation to those who had set it up would disappear and the whole thing would collapse if they were all part of some vast experiment then the fact that those on whom the experiment was being conducted had guessed the truth would mean that its value would be lost if they were some plaything then again that they had guessed this meant they ought to be acknowledged even perhaps rewarded if they were being tested in some way then this was the test being passed this was a positive result again possibly deserving a reward if they had been undergoing punishment for some transgression in the greater world then this ought to constitute cause for rehabilitation it was not possible to know what proportion of the simulated population would be required to bring things to a halt it might be fifty per cent it might be rather smaller or much greater but as long as the numbers of the enlightened kept increasing the universe would be constantly coming closer to this epiphany and the revelation could come at any point the truth claimed with some degree of justification to be the ultimate religion the final faith the last of all churches it was the one which encompassed all others contextualised all others could account for and embrace all others they could all ultimately be dismissed as mere emergent phenomena of the simulation itself the truth could too in a sense but unlike them it still had more to say once this common denominator had been taken out of the equation it could also claim a degree of universality that the others could not all other major religions were either specific to their originating species could be traced back to a single species often a single subset of that species or were consciously developed amalgams syntheses of a group of sufficiently similar religions of disparate origin the truth claiming no miracles or at least no miracles of proof and being the work of no individual allimportant prophet it had arisen naturally many times within a multiplicity of different civilisations was the first real postscientific pancivilisational religion or at least it was the first that had not been simply imposed on reluctant subjects by a conquering hegemony the truth could even claim to be not a religion at all where such a claim might endear it to those not naturally religious by nature it could be seen more as a philosophy even as a scientific postulate backed up by unshakeably firm statistical likelihood the mercatoria had simply adopted this belief system properly codified it and made it effectively the state religion of the latest age you do not believe fassin the colonel put sadness into her signal i appreciate the intellectual force of the argument but it is not held in your mind at all times no sorry be not sorry we all find it difficult on occasion we shall perhaps talk further on the matter i was afraid we might to return to my question then do i believe all that stuff correct fassin looked around at the ship beneath them and the great assemblage of roaring engines whirling blades and supporting structures the long crossing thirty million years between galaxies the idea that anything built by dwellers could make a journey of that length does place the credulity under a degree of tension he admitted the assertion that the outward journey was made so much more rapidly seems no less to belong to the realm of fantasy ah yes the great and almost certainly mythical intergalactic hole i would not argue with you colonel though i would say its perfectly possible that these are all nonsense but the specific object were looking for still exists it keeps unlikely company again i wouldnt choose to dispute the matter we are left with the fact that you are a colonel i am some sort of honorary major and orders are orders how assiduously one attempts to follow ones orders might be affected by the extent to which one believes they are capable of being carried out successfully there i would completely agree with you what are you getting at just calibrating major seeing how committed i am would i sacrifice my life for our object of desire something like that i suspect were both sceptics colonel me more than you i suppose we also believe in doing our duty you more than me perhaps satisfied content me too i received a communication from the ocula this morning really and were you always going to tell me or could i have been even more missionsceptical during that last exchange and been told nothing or has your calibration meant im not going to get told everything now yes our orders remain as they were there were several more attacks on the system in general at the time of the assault on the third fury moon further less intense attacks have continued the communications satellite system around nasqueron is being repaired as a matter of urgency in the meantime a navarchy fleet is being stationed above the planet to take the place of the satellites to provide security and main force backup for you and me and to pick us up at the end of our mission or in an emergency fassin took a moment to think any word from my sept sept bantrabal none there was confirmation that all those on or in third fury were killed i am sorry to report that master technician hervil apsile is also believed to be dead there has been no sign of or communication with the drop ship i have been asked by the ocula to pass on their commiserations to you regarding all those deceased seers and supporting staff to which of course i add my own thank you the colonel might have executed a sort of rolling bow or it might just have been the effects of the swirling buffeting slipstream tearing around them the slavechildren had suffered no further casualties their repairs appeared to be working even where they had not completed their renovations the damaged blades were vibrating less making the rest of the job easier how many ships were they sending to nasqueron to do all these things that one small ship and two pucksized satellites could do this was not mentioned fassin said nothing there were some potentially unfortunate consequences implicit in a profound belief in the truth one was that there was a possibility that when the simulation ended all the people being simulated would cease to exist entirely the sim might be turned off and everybody within the substrate running it would die there might be no promotion no release no return to a bigger and better and finer outside there might just be the ultimate mass extinction also back in the apparently real world there was an argument that the truth implied approval of its own extinctions that it tacitly encouraged mass murder and genocide logically if one way of upping the proportion of those who truly believed was to evangelise convince and convert another was to decrease the numbers of those who steadfastly refused to accept the truth at all if necessary by killing them the tipping point into revelation and deliverance for all might come not at the moment when a sceptic became a believer but at the point that an unreformable heathen breathed their last the stormshear plunged into a great dark wall of thicker cloud dimming the view lights started to come on shining from the supporting structure and the dweller skiffs soon they could see little and the mad overwhelming cacophony of the slipstream and the droning engines made sonosense near impossible a methane hail rattled around them in the gathering gloom time to go in perhaps the colonel said amen the next day brought target practice as the stormshears weapons and crew were brought up to some form of warreadiness ysul hatherence and fassin were allowed to watch from inside an observation dome right at the front of the ship a temporary structure protruding from the dreadnoughts armoured nose like a little bubble of diamond they shared the place with a few dozen interested civilians mostly administrators of the various cities where the stormshear had been paying courtesy calls during the last long period of peace uniformed petchildren floated amongst the vips carrying trays of food and drugs ahead through a tenkilometre gap in the clouds they could see an object like a small bright blue ship a target being towed by another dreadnought a hundred or more klicks still further ahead the stormshear shuddered mightily and an instant later there came a great blast of noise tracks like dozens of vapour trails appeared in the sky beneath and above them great combs of thin plaited gas racing in front of them headed by the barely glimpsed dark dots of the shells converging on the target screens set into each dentseat where working showed a magnified view of the blue target it shook as its hollow structure was punctured by the shells holes appearing briefly on its hull before sealing up again a desultory cheer went up from a few of the generally boredlooking dwellers present it was drowned out by the clicking of maniple fingers demanding service from the petchildren waiters i never asked hatherence said leaning close to ysul as he snorted up the coils of purple from a fuming stokepipe what is the war actually about ysul turned jerkily and gave the impression of trying to get his outer sensory regions to focus on the colonel about he said looking confused the exhausted stokestick attached to the pipe went out with a loud pop well its about when two ah opposing groups of ah people ah that is to say dwellers in this case obviously decide to umm fight fight yes usually over some issue and and they use weapons of war to do so until one side or other did i say there are usually just two sides thats kind of the conventional number i believe sort of a quorum you might say though i wasnt looking for the definition of a war ysul no good i thought you probably had such things of your own most people seem to i meant what is the point at issue what is the cause of the war the cause ysul asked looking surprised he roted as far back in his dentseat as he could while the ship shuddered again and another salvo from each side of the vessel this time lanced forwards to the distant target well he said distracted by the dancing dots of the shells dragging their gas trails after them well im sure there is one he started mumbling hatherence seemed to realise shed already got as much sense out of ysul as she was going to while he was sucking on the stokepipe and settled back in her seat with a sigh dweller formal wars are like duels fought on a huge scale fassin told her the colonel turned fractionally towards him normally about some aesthetic dispute theyre often the final stage of a planetplanning dispute planetplanning a common one is where theres some dispute concerning the number of belts and zones a planet ought to have then the odds and the evens are the two sides usually planetplanning the colonel repeated as though she hadnt picked up right the first time i did not think gasgiants were well planned the dwellers claim they can alter the number of bands a planet has over a sufficiently great amount of time theyve never been reliably observed doing this but that doesnt stop them claiming to be able to do it anyway its not the doing of the thing that matters its the principle what sort of world do we want to live in thats the question even or odd exactly a formal war is just the workingout another salvo the ship really shook this time and a number of the slavechildren yelped at the ragged boom resulting combs of gas trails leapt from all sides a cone defining a tunnel of braided sky in front of them wars are also fought over disagreements such as which gasclipper ought to be allowed to fly a certain pennant colour during a race a war for this hatherence sounded genuinely horrified have these people never heard of committees oh they have committees and meetings and dispute procedures they have lots of those but getting dwellers to stick with a decision thats gone against them even after theyve sworn on their life beforehand that theyll abide by it is not the easiest thing to do in this or any other world so disagreements tend to rumble on formal wars are just the dweller equivalent of a supreme court a tribunal of last resort also you have to understand that they dont really have standing armed forces as such between wars the dreadnoughts and other military bits and pieces are cared for by enthusiasts by clubs even when a formal war is declared all that happens is that the clubs get bigger as ordinary people sign up the clubs sound and feel like what you or i might understand as proper military authorities but theyve no legal standing the colonel shook as though just confronted with something of ultimate grisliness how perverse for them it seems to work the verb work hatherence sent like so many other common terms seems to be required to take on additional meanings when one talks of dwellers how do they decide whos won one of these bizarre conflicts occasionally a straight deadcount or the number of dreadnoughts destroyed or crippled more usually therell be an elegance threshold preagreed an elegance threshold hatherence fassin said turning to her did you do any research into dweller life all that time in i believe i encountered a mention of this concept but dismissed it at the time as fanciful it genuinely counts in such matters it genuinely counts and they cant agree a workable disputes procedure for what ship flies which colourings without resorting to war but they can happily agree on that resulting war being decided on a concept as fuzzy as elegance oh thats never disputed they have an algorithm for it another terrific judder rang the stormshear like a dull bell the thin uncoiling tracks combed the sky ahead of them an algorithm the colonel said elegance is an algorithm the screens showed the blue target quaking under the impact of a handful of shells hatherence glanced at ysul who was trying to blow purple smoke rings and pierce them with a rim arm and its all run by clubs she said of enthusiasts yes clubs big clubs hatherence so is all this why their war technology is so awful she asked is it fassin hatherence said sounding amused now these people claim to have been around since the week after reionisation and building these dreadnought things for most of that time yet that target is less than a dozen klicks ahead each salvo is thirtysix shells thirtythree one of the turrets is out of action regardless they are only hitting that effectively unmoving target with every second or third round that is simply pathetic there are rules formulae insisting on ludicrously inefficient gunnery in a sense no guided shells all guns and aiming systems to be based on ancient patterns no jet engines for the dreadnoughts no rocket engines for the missiles no particle or beam weapons at all like duels fought with ancient pistols youre getting the idea and this is meant to keep them all in martial trim in case they are invaded by outside hostiles well yes fassin agreed that does begin to look like a slightly hollow claim when you actually see the technology doesnt it of course they claim theyve got starbusting hyperweapons hidden about the place somewhere just in case and the skills are somehow transferable but nobodys ever seen them something like that the stormshear unleashed its mighty antiship missiles loosing what was probably meant to be a twelvestrong broadside the eleven tiny slim projectiles came screaming from all sides of the great vessel the slavechildren yelped again and some dropped their trays and hurtled out towards the distant blue target drone on smoky twisting plumes of jet exhaust like deranged darts two of the missiles drifted too close to one another each appeared to identify the other as its intended target and so both swung wildly at their opposite number missed twisted round in a sweeping double braid flew straight at each other and this time met and exploded in a modest double fireball some dwellers in the observation lounge distracted perhaps sarcastic cheered a third missile seemed to take the nearby explosion as a sign that it ought to perform an upward loop and head straight back at the stormshear ohoh ysul said the oncoming missile settled into a flat steady course becoming a small but rapidly enlarging dot aimed straight at the nose of the dreadnought they do have destructs dont they hatherence said glancing at fassin some dwellers started looking at each other then made a dash for the access tube to the stormshears armoured nose creating a jam around the door slavechildren also trying to escape either got through ahead of the rush or were thrown roughly out of the way yelping the dot in the sky was getting bigger they can just order it to blow up cant they the colonel said roting backwards a high whining noise seemed to be coming from somewhere inside the colonels esuit the yelling cursing knot of dwellers round the exit didnt seem to be shifting the stormshear was starting to turn hopelessly slowly in theory they can destruct it fassin said uneasily watching the still unshifting melee around the exit and they do have closerange intercept guns another frantic slavechild was ejected upwards from the scrum by the door screaming until it slapped into the ceiling and dropped lifeless to the slowly tilting deck the missile had real shape now no longer a large dot stubby wings and a tailplane were visible the stormshear continued to turn with excruciating slowness the missile plunged in towards them on a trail of sooty exhaust hatherence rose from her dentseat but moved closer to the diamondsheath nose of the observation blister not further away stay back major she sent then a terrific tearing ripping noise sounded from above and behind them a net of fingerfine trails filled the gas ahead of the ships nose and the missile first started to disintegrate and then blew up the interceptor machine gun somewhere behind continued firing scoring multiple hits on the larger pieces of smoking glowing missile wreckage as they tumbled on towards the stormshear so that when the resulting shrapnel hit and punctured the observation blister it caused relatively little damage and only minor wounds the dreadnought took them as far as munueyn a ruined city fallen amongst the dark thick gases of the lower atmosphere where slow coils of turbulence roiled past like the heavy lascivious licks of an almighty planetary tongue a place all spires and spindles neardeserted long unfashionable a onetime stormcentre now too far from anything to be of much interest to anybody a place that might have garnered kudos for itself had it been near a war zone but could hope for almost none at all because it was within one a wingfrigate took them from the dreadnought and deposited them in the gigantic echoing hall of what had once been the citys bustling stationport where they were greeted like returning heroes like gods by the local hirers and fliers they found a guest house for negative kudos they were in effect being paid to stay there sir sholish said rising from the mass of petitioners in the small courtyard below a hostelier of impeccable repute with excellent familial connections in the matter of wartime travel warrants beseeches you to consider his proposal to put at your disposal a veritable fleet of a halfhalfdozen finely arrayed craft all in the very best of condition and working order and ready to depart within less than an hour of their arrival which will be when precisely banelet of my already toolong life a day sire two at the most he assures unacceptable utterly and profoundly so ysul proclaimed frilling the very idea away with a shudder he was nestled within a dent on a flowerdecked terrace outside and above the taverna bucolica close enough to the citys central plaza to smell the mayors desperation he dragged deep of a proffered pharma cylinder and with the exhalation breathed next fassin and the colonel floating nearby exchanged looks hatherence floated closer we could just take off you and i all by ourselves we are both selfsufficient we are both capable of making good time you reckon the colonel made it obvious that she was looking his arrowcraft over i think so i think you called up the specs on this thing before we left third fury and know damn well so he thought he sent so we go haring off into the clouds together just we two yes there is a problem indeed in fact there are two problems the first one is that theres a war on and well look like a pair of warheads warheads but we shant even be transonic there are rules in formal war regarding the speed that warheads can travel at well look like warheads hmm if we went a little slower slow warheads slower still cruise mines and before you ask any slower than that and well look like ordinary monolayer float mines hatherence bobbed up and down a sigh you mentioned a second problem without ysul its unlikely that anybody will talk to us with him it is unlikely that anybody else will get a word in nevertheless they needed their own transport more to the point they needed transport that would be allowed to pass unchallenged in the war zone whatever remained of valseirs old dwelling lay far enough off the cloudtunnel network to make roting or floating their way there too longwinded ysul had agreed to fix things with his equatorial bigcity connections escorting exotic aliens he was bound to positively exude kudos towards all those who might help him but then had got caught up in the whole process just due to the numbers of people who wanted to be the ones who helped him and so became unable seemingly to make up his mind just as it seemed likely he was about to settle on one outrageously generous offer another would appear over the horizon even more enticing necessitating a further reappraisal finally after two days hatherence could take no more and hired her own ship on terms slightly better than the ones just rejected by ysul in their suite at the taverna ysul protested iam doing the negotiating he bellowed yes the colonel agreed rather too much of it a compromise was arrived at the colonel confessed to their hirer that she was legally unable to commit to a firm contract and ysul then remade it on the exact same terms while the appalled shipmaster was still drawing breath to protest that day the day the war officially got under way ceremonially beginning with an opening gala and formal duel in pihirumime half the world away a day later they sailed taking the next downward eddy that also swirled in the right horizontal direction aboard the poaflias a hundredmetre twinhull screwburster of unknown but probably enormous age it boasted a crew of just five apart from its captain and was rotund and slow but was for some reason lost in the mists of dweller military logic still registered as an uncommitted privateer scout ship and so cleared to make her way within the war zone and one might hope liable to pass any consequent challenge save one conducted by opening fire prior to negotiations their captain was slyne an enthusiastic youngster barely arrived at adulthood still very much a recent and behaving more like a youth hed inherited the poaflias on the death of his father the dwellers clove to the idea of collective inheritance so that when one of them died any private property they could fairly claim to have accumulated went fifty per cent to whoever they wanted it to go to and fifty per cent to whatever jurisdiction they lived within this was why only one hull of the twinhulled poaflias was fully owned by slyne the city of munueyn owned the other half and was renting it to him accumulating kudos the less slyne could actually do with the ship the more control he would lose until ultimately the city could reasonably claim it was all theirs then if he wanted to stay aboard hed more or less have to do whatever the city asked him to do with the ship this expedition however conducted under his own auspices ought to go a long way towards securing his ownership rights over the whole vessel this is why we are confined to the single hull hatherence asked the captain they were on the foredeck a slightly ramshackle sprouting of fibres and sheet protruding over the crafts batteredlooking nose ysul had spotted a harpoon gun on the foredeck and challenged his companions to a coarse shoot the next time they traversed a promising volume apparently where they were now just two days out of munueyn constituted just such a happy hunting ground however nobody had seen anything worth harpooning so far thats right slyne bobbed eagerly over the deck less i use the other hull less i owe the city captain slyne was hanging on to some rigging floating above everybody else to get a good view and act as lookout and target spotter they were making a decent speed through the dim crimson gases the slipstream would have blown slyne aft if he hadnt been holding on a decent speed in this case meant less than a quarter of the velocity of the dreadnought stormshear on cruise but the gas down here was thicker and the slipstreams force was all the greater theres something slyne yelled pointing up and to starboard they all looked no wrong slyne said cheerfully beg pardon slyne was taking his captains role seriously accoutred with lots of mostly useless ancient naval paraphernalia like spyglasses an altimeter a museumpiece radio a scratchedlooking hail visor a shining antique holstercannon and a radiation compass his clothing and halfarmour looked very new but based on designs that were very old he had a couple of pet foetuses tethered to each of his hub girdles the foetuses were dweller young who hadnt even been allowed to progress to the stage of being children the usual reason they existed was because a dwellerturnedfemale of particular impatience had decided she couldnt be bothered going to full term and had aborted the results made good pets dwellers could survive on their own almost from conception they just didnt progress intellectually and had nobody to protect them while they were completely helpless slynes quadruplets it would have been impolite to inquire whether they were actually his own looked like little bloated manta rays pale and trailing almost useless tentacles forever bumping into their master or each other and getting themselves tangled in their tethers the effect for a human was inevitably slightly grisly though fassin had the added depressing feeling that the foetuses were the equivalent of a parrot in ancient earth terms theres something this time slyne shouted pointing down to starboard a small black object was rising from the deep red depths of gas a couple of hundred metres away ihave it ysul yelled bumpkicking the gun platform on its counterweights it swung up above the deck to an elevation that let him depress the harpoon gun sufficiently a tchoufer seed sholish exclaimed its a tchoufer tree seed sir wait a moment ysul fassin said rising from the deck just let me go and check he gunned the little gascraft away from the poaflias curving out and down towards the still slowly rising black sphere keep out of the way ysul bellowed to the human fassin had taken a curved course deliberately having witnessed ysuls marksmanship before just hold will you he shouted back ysul gave a shake and sighted the gun on the black sphere maniples grasping the trigger slyne craned forward in the rigging two of the foetuses wrapped themselves round a stay entangling him he looked up tutted and brought his spyglass up to a receptordense portion of his sensory frill scanning the rising black orb ah actually he began hatherence bobbed up suddenly ysul stop haha ysul said twisting the trigger and firing the harpoon the mounting shook the gun leapt and banged the harpoons own twin rocket motors sprang out and erupted as soon as it was a safe distance away and the thin black line attached to the main body came whipping and whistling out of a locker just beneath the gun mounting the harpoon rasped through the gas towards where the black object would be in a few seconds time hmm ysul said sounding slightly surprised one of my better its a mine slyne screamed sholish just screamed fassin get away from that thing hatherence sent the little gascraft instantly started to turn and speed up rotors blurring in the air eh what ysul said slyne drew his holstercannon and aimed at the harpoon he got one shot off before the gun jammed could that be nuclear the colonel shouted a high keening noise sounded from the colonels esuit definitely slyne spluttered he shook his gun and cursed then slapped at his radio engines full astern he shook the gun again desperately fucking scrits hatherence moved quickly to one side ysul looked out at the harpoon dropping smoothly right on course for the black ball then at the gun mounting sholish he barked grab that line sholish leapt for the thrumming dark curtain of cord being jerked from the locker under the gun caught hold of it and was instantly whipped towards the gunwales smashing through stanchions and snapping to a stop tangled in the hawser before the slipstream brought him thudding back into the deck behind them free of the encumbering line the harpoon just picked up speed still heading for the mine hatherence got clear of the poaflias fassins arrowcraft was still turning still picking up speed still even closer to the mine than the ship was oh fu ysul said a crimson flash seemed to wash out the gas all around them dead fassin had time to think for an instant a tight fan of searing pinkwhite lines joined colonel hatherences esuit and the full length of the harpoon which vanished in a blast of heat and light a visible shocksphere pulsed out from the detonation rocking the mine which seemed to stop and think for a moment before continuing to ascend smoothly on its way the shock wave shook them and the ship fassin felt it too he slowed and turned back the poaflias was scrubbing off speed following slynes last order the slipstream was lessening but still sufficiently strong to clunk sholishs battered carapace off the deck as he floated tangled in the dark mass of wire ysul looked sholish he said in a small voice the species of the faring are more divided by their sense of time than anything else we dwellers being who and what we are naturally encompass as much of the spectrum of chronosense as we are able covering most of it i exclude the machinequick a hesitation you still abhor those i take it yes we most certainly do the colonel exclaimed positively persecuted fassin said hmm they are different again of course but even within the limits of the naturally evolved the manifold rates at which time is appreciated are some would argue collectively the single most telling distinction that might be made between species and speciestypes the speaker was an ancient sage called jundriance dweller seniority nomenclature stretched to twentynine separate categories starting with child and ending no less than two billion years later usually much more at child in between came the shortlived adolescent and youth stages the rather longer adult stage with its three subdivisions then prime with four subdivisions cuspian with three and then if the dweller had survived to that age one and a quarter million years minimum and was judged fit by his peers sagehood which then repeated all the subdivisions of the adulthood prime and cuspian stages so technically jundriance was a sageprimechice he was fortythree million years old had shrunk to only six metres in diameter while his carapace had darkened and taken on the hazy patina of dweller middle age had already lost most of his limbs and he was in charge of what was left of the house and associated libraries of the presumed deceased cuspianchoal valseir the view from the house was motionless and unchanging at normal time a hazy vista of deep brown and purple veils of gas within a great placid vertical cylinder of darkness that was the final echo of the great storm that the house had once swung about like a tiny planet around a great cold sun in appearance the houselibrary complex itself was a collection of thirtytwo spheres each seventy metres or so in diameter many girdled by equatorial balconies so that the construction looked like some improbably bunched gathering of ringed planets the bubble house hung very slowly sinking in that great calm of thick gas deep down in the dark hot depths only a few tens of kilometres above the region where the atmosphere began to behave more like a liquid than a gas this is his house then yes the colonel had asked when theyd first seen it from the foredeck of the poaflias fassin had looked around using sonosense and magnetic to search for the section of the derelict cloudtunnel that the house had once been anchored to but couldnt find it anywhere nearby hed already checked the poafliass charts the stretch of cloudtunnel no longer showed up on the local holo maps implying that it had either drifted much further away which was unlikely or had fallen into the depths yes he said yes looks like it theyd had to turn the poaflias around and return to munueyn sholish badly injured had been taken to hospital the surgeons had given him an even chance of surviving hed heal best left in a drug coma for the next few hundred days there was nothing more they could do ysul could have taken on any number of youths and adolescents eager to take his crippled servants place but hed turned them all down a decision hed regretted just a day or so later once theyd set out again when hed realised he had nobody to shout at theyd avoided challenges other ships and mines of all sorts finally making the journey in ten days the sage jundriance was attended by a couple of burly prime servants nuern and livilido each dressed in fussily ornate and illfitting academic robes they were sufficiently senior to have servants of their own a halfdozen highly reticent adults who looked like identical sextuplets they were big on scurrying but almost autistically shy the senior of the two elder servants nuern a mouean to livilidos onerankmorejunior suhrl had welcomed them allocated rooms and informed them that his master was engaged in the task of cataloguing the remaining works in the libraries as ysul had warned a significant proportion of the contents had been given away since valseirs accident probably only the remoteness of the house had prevented more scholars showing up to pick over the remains jundriance was however in slowtime so if they wanted to speak to him they would have to slow to his thoughtpace fassin and the colonel had agreed ysul had announced he was having none of this and took the poaflias on a cruise to explore the local volume and see what there might be to hunt your duty should be to wait for us the colonel had informed him duty ysul had said as though hearing the word for the first time they had a halfday or so at least while jundriance was informed by a message on his readscreen that he had visitors if he would see them immediately they could go in before dark otherwise it could be some long time colonel fassin had said we will have to go into slowdown for some time ysul might be as well amusing himself nearby fassin had turned to look at ysul to emphasise the word as mooching about this place for who knows how long hell get into trouble probably so better trouble close to home or trouble further away hatherence had made a rumbling noise and had told ysul there is a war on ive checked the nets ysul had protested its kiloklicks away really nuern had said perking has it started the master doesnt allow connections in the house we hear nothing began a dozen days ago ysul had told the servant weve been in the thick of it already barely avoided a smart mine on the way here my servant got himself injured may die a smart mine near here you are right to be concerned my friend ysul had said solemnly the presence of such ordnance hereabouts is another the real reason why ill take my ship on patrol around you and your servant injured how terrible i know war is other than that elsewhere in the hostilities barely a spineful of deaths so far couple of dreadnoughts crippled on each side far too early to tell whos winning ill keep a fringe cocked let you know whats happening thank you not at all youre right hatherence had signalwhispered to fassin as this exchange was taking place lets just let him go you can signal the ship from your esuit while still in slowdown yes okay you will stay nearby fassin had asked ysul you wont let the poaflias venture too far out of course i swear and i shall ask our two fine fellows here to extend you every courtesy on my behalf they were to be seen at once nuern had shown them into one of the outer library pods the library had a roof of diamond leaf looking directly upwards into the vermiliondark sky jundriance was settled into a dentdesk near the centre of the nearspherical room facing a readscreen around him the walls were lined with shelves some so widely spaced that they might have doubled as bunk space for humans others so small that a childs finger might have struggled to fit mostly these held books of some sort spindlesecured carousels tensioned between the walls and between the floor and a network of struts above held hundreds of other types of storage devices and systems swave crystals holoshard picospool and a dozen more obscure theyd joined jundriance at his desk floating through the thick atmosphere to his side nuern had swung dentseats into place and theyd both clamped onto one hatherence positioning herself with fassin between her and the sage jundriance of course gave no sign of having noticed them theyd slowed it had been much easier for fassin than for hatherence hed been doing this for centuries shed been trained in the technique but had never attempted it for real the experience would be a jerky shaky journey for her at least until they smoothed out at the sages pace the day darkened quickly then the night seemed to last less than an hour fassin concentrated on his own smooth slowdown but was aware of the colonel seeming to wriggle and shift in her dentseat the sage jundriance appeared to stir by the next quick morning something actually changed on his reading screen another page that day passed quickly then the next night went quicker still the process continued until they were down to a factor of about oneinsixtyfour which was what they had been told jundriance had come up to meet them at hed been even slower until their arrival they were about halfway there when a signalwhisper had pinged into the little gascraft you receiving this all right major yes why i just interrogated the screen reader it was working in realtime until the poaflias arrived you sure perfectly interesting finally they were there synchronised to the same lifepace as the sage the short days became a slow slow flicker above them the orangepurple sky beyond the diamond leaf alternately lightening and dimming even at this pace the great tall veils of gas seemed to hang above them in the sky unmoving fassin had experienced the feeling he always got when he first went into slowdown during a delve the disquieting sensation that he was a lost soul the feeling of being in a strange sort of prison trapped in time inside while life went on at a quicker pace outside above beyond jundriance had turned off his readscreen and greeted them fassin had asked about valseir but somehow theyd got onto the subject of lifepace itself one feels sorry for the quick i suppose the sage said they seem illsuited to the universe in a way the distances between the stars the time it takes to travel from one to another even more so of course if one is thinking of travelling between galaxies a hole in the conversation of course fassin said to fill it are you fishing for something old one he thought the machines they were much worse of course how unbearable to live so quickly well they mostly dont live at all now sage fassin told him that is as well perhaps sage can you tell us any more about valseirs death i was not there i know no more than you you were quite close to him fassin asked close no no i would not say so we had corresponded on matters of textual verification and provenance and debated at a remove on various questions of scholarship and interpretation though not regularly we never met i would not say that that constituted closeness would you i suppose not i just wondered what drew you here thats all oh the chance to look through his library to take what i might for myself that is what drew me his servants took some material before they left others mostly scholars or those who chose to call themselves such came and took what they wanted but there is still much here and while the most obvious treasures are gone much of value may remain it would be derelict to ignore i see and what of valseirs libraries i understand you are continuing to catalogue them a pause continuing yes the old darkcarapaced sage seemed to stare at the dark readscreen hmm he said he turned fractionally to look at fassin let me see your use of the word continuing there i understood that valseir had been cataloguing his libraries wasnt he he was always so secretive was he not im getting lightcomms leakage here hatherence sent tell me if theres a burst after this and dilatory hapuerele always said that valseir was more likely to win the allstorms yachting cup than ever finish cataloguing his libraries another pause quite so quite so hapuerele yes leakage hapuerele does not exist exists but he had to ask elsewhere just there shouldnt have i would like to take a look round some of the libraries myself i hope you dont mind i shant disturb you ah i see well if you think you can be discreet are you seeking anything in particular mr taak yes and you only enlightenment and what would it be that you are looking for if i may ask exactly the same the old dweller was silent for a while in realtime most of an hour passed i may have something for you he said eventually would you care to slow down a little more no doubt this our present pace seems surpassing slow to you however i find it something of a strain of course fassin told jundriance ill have to leave you here major lucky you ill try to keep this short good luck hatherence sent however i shall leave you at this point sir the colonel said to the sage pleasant to have met you reverend colonel jundriance told her now then he said to fassin let me see half this pace i think seer taak would suit me better a quarter would suit me better still shall we try half then initially he was back in just three days hatherence was inspecting the contents of another library when he found her the room was almost perfectly spherical with no windows just a circle of dim light shining from the ceilings centre and further luminescence provided by bio strips inlaid on each shelf glowing ghostly green further stacks of shelves like enormous inwardpointing vanes made the place feel oddly organic as though these were ribs and they were inside some vast creature the colonel was floating near one set of closestacked shelves near the librarys centre strips of green light ribbing her esuit so soon major hatherence said replacing a slim holocrystal on a shelf half full of them at the same time as she spoke she sent our friend had nothing of interest sage jundriance gave me so much to think about that i decided id better come back to normal speed to think it over fassin replied then signalled the old bastard gave me fuck all basically hes trying to stall us well i have been studying while you were conversing anything of interest he asked floating over towards her there are signs that many more dwellers were staying here until not long ago perhaps only a few days long ago the house system seems to think there ought to be a catalogue of catalogues somewhere in fact that there ought to be multiple copies of it lying around a catalogue of catalogues fassin said other dwellers the first catalogue that valseir compiled listing the catalogues of individual works he would then draw up perhaps as many as ten or twelve also i get the impression livilido and nuern are more or at least other than they appear one catalogue for everything would be too simple fassin asked then sent i didnt think they seemed like ordinary servants either so where are all these multiple copies i suspect they have been removed they would be the key to beginning a methodical search the colonel replied then said i gather it seemed to him the logical way to proceed certainly there is no shortage of material even yet when much of it has been removed one catalogue would i suppose be cumbersome the colonel paused of course a single giant database with freely dimensioned subdivisions partially overlapping categories and subcategories a hierarchically scalable crossreference hyperstructure and inbuilt semismart userlearning routines would be even more to the point and far more useful fassin looked at her hed probably have got round to one of those after hed done what he considered the proper cataloguing getting everything down in some nonvolatile form that can be read without intervening machinery our dweller friends do seem to be remarkably purist about such things when you live as long as they do futureproofing becomes an obsession perhaps that is their curse the quick must endure the frustration of living in a universe with what seems like an annoyingly slow speed limit and the slow must suffer the frenetic pace of change around them resulting in a sort of exaggerated entropy fassin had been floating slowly closer to hatherence he tipped to make it clear that he was looking at her as he came to a stop a couple of metres from her the glowing biostrips on the shelves painted soft lime stripes across the little gascraft you all right in there colonel he asked i realise its very hot and pressured down here colonel do you think we are wasting our time here i am fine yourself very hard to say there is so much still here so much to be looked at also fine feeling very rested thats my point we could be made to waste a lot of time here looking for something that has already been removed i understand slowtime will have that effect that is a thought i had the odd impression from dust marks and so on understand that many of the shelves have recently been filled or refilled and many of the works seem to make no sense given what ive understood of valseirs subjects of study seemed most strange though if all this is a sort of slowtrap for you and me then that begins to make sense but what else can we do where else is there to go ill have to talk to the sage again fassin said there are many things id like to ask him whereas in fact ill do everything i can to avoid talking to the old bore again we have to get word out to any legitimate scholars who did take works from here see if any of them have the catalogues or anything else there are two dozen separate libraries here even if theyre only halffull we could be searching them for decades he is a most interesting and wise character many tens of millions of works and if most are unsorted all are ill signal to the poaflias have them put out word to the relevant scholars who might be trying to put obstacles in our way so indeed he is i dont know well i think i shall continue to search the shelves for a while will you join me will you why not they drifted to different but nearby stacks snicked holocrystal books out of their motionproof shelves and read his study nuern asked a fringe flick indicated a glance at livilido they were afloat at table the two primes had invited fassin and hatherence to a semiformal dinner in the houses ovaloid dining room a great dim echoing space strung vertically with enormous sets of carbon ropes all splayed separated into smaller and smaller cords and fibres and threads and filaments and then each thin strand minutely and multiply knotted it was like being inside some colossal frayed net jundriance was still deep in slowtime and would not be joining them special food had been prepared that was suitable for the colonel she ingested it via a sort of gaslock on the side of her esuit fassin contained and sustained within the arrowcraft was really only here to watch yes he said where do you think it might be i thought that library one was his study nuern said selecting a helping of something glowing dull blue from the central carousel and then spinning the serving dish slowly towards his dining companions me too livilido said he looked at fassin why was there another one has a bit dropped off the place fassin had taken a look round all the library spheres library one had always been valseirs formal study where he received fellow scholars and other people but it hadnt been his real study his den his private space very few people were allowed in there fassin had felt flattered in the extreme to be invited to enter the nestlike nook that valseir had made for himself inside the stretch of disused cloudtunnel tube which the rest of the house had been anchored to the last time fassin had been here centuries earlier library one still looked as it always had minus a few thousand bookcrystals and a big cylindrical lowtemperature storage device in which valseir had kept paper and plastic books it certainly didnt look as though the room had become valseirs proper study in the interim and now it appeared as though these people didnt even know hed had a more private den in the first place i thought he had another study fassin said didnt he keep a house in what city was it guldrenk ah of course nuern said that would be it colonel these guys know nothing i had been coming to the same conclusion library twentyone cincturiacloudersmiscellania had a conceit a dweller equivalent of a door made from a bookcase valseir had shown it to fassin after the human had stayed with him for an extended period after their first meeting it led inward at first towards the centre of the cluster of library spheres through a short passage to a gap between two more of the outer spheres then into the open gas the joke a hidden door a secret passage was that the various cincturia were the outsiders of the galactic community and the particular bookcase hiding the secret passage was categorised escapees after their meal fassin gave the impression of shutting himself away in the library for some latenight shelfscanning instead he screened up the houses system statements and looked back to just after the time of valseirs yachting accident and alleged death he did something unusual something barely legal by mercatorial standards and usually pointless on nasqueron he speeded up letting the gascrafts legalmax computers and his own subtly altered nervous system rev to their combined dataprocessing limit it still took nearly half an hour but he found what he was looking for the point a dozen days after valseirs accident when the house recorded a rerouting of power and ventilation plumbing its altimeter had registered a wobble too a brief blip upwards then the start of the long slow descent that was continuing even now then fassin had to work out where the cloudtunnel segment might be now it would be beyond the start of the shear zone past where the whole atmospheric band moved as a single vast mass down into the semiliquid depths these moved much more slowly than the gas above the transition levels great turbidly elastic seas being dragged along as though reluctantly after the jetstream whirl of atmosphere above it was all dead reckoning by the dweller way of judging such things the atmosphere was static and the depths not to mention the remainder of ulubis system the stars and indeed the rest of the universe moved with only notionally fixed reference points finding anything in the depths was notoriously difficult after two hundred years the section of cloudtunnel could be anywhere it might have sunk beyond feasible reach been broken up or even drifted to the zone edge and been pulled into another belt entirely either north or south the only thing working in fassins favour was that the length of tube he was looking for was relatively large completely losing something fortyplus metres in diameter and eighty klicks long wasnt that easy even in nasqueron still he was relying on the cloudtunnel retaining the usual profile of buoyancydecay the likely volume though identified with a worrying degree of fuzziness was about five thousand kilcks away though coming closer all the time having been all the way round the planet many times in a dozen hours it would be almost right underneath the house again he calculated it was doable he pinged a note to the screen on the librarys door saying that he didnt want to be disturbed fassin let himself out through the hidden door about an hour after hed entered the library he let the little gascraft grow pushing trimspaces out to create internal vacuums and a larger nearspherical outer shape so that he fell gently at first causing as little turbulence as possible beneath the house then gradually he heavied slowly shrinking the arrowhead to its dartslim minimum diving unpowered into the dark depths and through the rough boundary of the nearstatic cylinder of depleted gas that was all that remained of the ancient storm he powered up twenty klicks deeper and levelled out then rose quickly when he was thirty lateral kilometres clear zooming up through the gradually cooling slowly thinning gas above until he was through the haze layers and out amongst the cloud tops fassin increased to maximum speed configuring the arrowhead for as stealthy a profile as it could support the gascraft had never been designed for such shenanigans but it had been gradually altered over the years by him and hervil apsile until while no match for a genuine military machine it made less of a fuss moving across the face of the planet than almost anything within the gasgiants atmosphere always discounting the usual preposterous dweller claims of invisible ships inertialess drives and zeropoint subspacials the little craft moved beneath the thin yellow sky and the stars above seemed to slow down then go into reverse as fassin flew faster than the combined speed of the planet revolving and the band beneath him jetstreaming in the same direction after less than an hour of flight seeing nothing in the heavens above or in the skies beneath that would have led anyone to think there was life anywhere else in all the universe he slowed and dropped a shaftless arrowhead heading straight for the heart of the planet he let the increasing density slow him further feeling the resulting frictionheat leak through the gascrafts hull and into his flesh through the upper shear boundary only hazily defined kilometres thick prone to vast slow waves and unpredictable swells and sudden troughs he entered the shear zone itself starting to circle through the crushing fluidity of jellythick atmosphere if the section of cloudtunnel was still in the volume this was where it ought to be fallen amongst the depths making its slow way down to an equilibrium of weight and buoyancy within the gradually thickening press of hydrogen gas turning to liquid there was always a chance that it had gone the other way lifting towards the cloud tops but that would be unusual disused cloudtunnel ribbed with vacuum tubes tended to gain gas and therefore additional weight through osmosis over the millennia when fassin had been here two hundred years earlier valseir was already having to add buoyancy to the tunnel to keep it from sinking too fast and dragging the whole house and library complex with it anyway if the derelict section had risen it ought to have stayed within the same atmospheric band and so shown up somewhere on the charts of the poaflias and it hadnt he went on spiralling keeping slow sonosensing only gently so that there would be less chance of anybody who might be listening nearby overhearing him could the colonel have followed him without him being aware of her probably but why would she still he had the feeling he ought to be as discreet as he could light wasnt much use cloudtunnel wall would appear almost transparent down here probes for magnetic and radiation vestiges were of even less utility and there would be no scent trace either after two hours near the limit of the time that he thought he could reasonably spend away from the house and some time after hed decided the hell with discretion and ramped his active sensors up to maximum fassin found one end of the cloudtunnel looming out of the gelthick mist like a vast dark mouth he took the little gascraft into the fortymetrewide maw turning up his sonosense now that the signals would be shielded by the walls of the cloudtunnel section itself he increased his speed too barrelling along the great slowly curving tube like the ghost of some dweller long gone the study shell was still there a hollow sphere almost filling the cloudtunnel tube near the midpoint of its eightykilometre length but it had been ransacked stripped bare whatever secrets it might have held had long since been taken or trashed fassin turned some lights on to check round the place finding nothing intact nothing beyond empty shelves and ragged lengths of carbon board diamond dust like frosted ice and frayed fibres waving in the turbulence of his passing he formed a tiny cavity with his sonosense and watched it collapse instantly snapped to nothing by the grinding weight of the column of gas above it a fine place to feel crushed he thought then went back the way hed come and ascended slowly to the house and library twentyone again the colonel was there she looked startled when he appeared from behind the hidden door even though hed told her earlier what he intended to do major seer taak fassin she said she sounded odd fassin looked around nobody else here good he thought yes he said letting the bookcase door close behind him hatherence floated right up to him stopping just a metre away her esuit showed a uniform dull grey he hadnt seen her display before colonel he asked her are you all right is everything there is you must prepare i i am sorry to there is bad news fassin she said finally in a rushed broken voice very bad news i am so sorry the archimandrite luseferous did not really buy into the whole idea of the truth of course when he had been rising within the ranks of the cessoria he had given every appearance of believing in it and had been a gifted evangelist and disputer arguing many times with great force logic and passion for the church and its views he had been often commended for this he could see at the time that his superiors were impressed see it even when they didnt want to admit to him or to themselves that they had been impressed he had a gift for argument and for dissembling for lying if you insisted on using such crude unnuanced terminology for appearing to believe one thing while at best actually not caring one way or the other he had never really cared whether the truth was true the idea of faith interested him even fascinated him not as an intellectual idea not as a concept or some abstract theoretical framework but as a way of controlling people as a way of understanding and so manipulating them as a flaw in the end as something which was wrong with others that was not wrong with him sometimes he could not believe all the advantages other people seemed prepared to hand him they had faith and so would do things that were plainly not in their own immediate or often longterm best interests because they just believed what they had been told they experienced altruism and so did things that again were not necessarily to their advantage they had sentimental or emotional attachments to others and so could be coerced once more into doing things they would not have done otherwise and best of all he sometimes thought people were selfdeceiving they thought they were brave when they were really cowards or imagined they could think for themselves when they most blatantly could not or believed they were clever when they were just good at passing exams or thought they were compassionate when they were just sentimental the real strength came from a perfectly simple maxim be completely honest with yourself only ever deceive others so many edges so many ways that people made his progress easier if everybody hed ever met and competed with and struggled against had been just like him in these respects hed have had a much harder rise to power he might not even have prevailed at all because without all these advantages it largely came down to luck and he might not have had sufficient in the old days he had once wondered how many of the cessorian high command his old bosses really believed in the truth he strongly suspected that the higher you went the greater grew the proportion of those who didnt really believe at all they were in it for the power the glory the control and the glamour now he rarely thought about any of that now he would just assume that anybody in such a position would be completely and cynically selfinterested and be mildly surprised and even slightly disgusted to find that any of them really did have genuine faith the disgust would come from the feeling that the person concerned was letting down the side and the suspicion that they would feel they were somehow perversely superior to their lessdeluded peers and so you really believe in all that you really do sir of course sir it is the rational faith simple logic dictates it is inescapable you know this better than i sir sir i think you tease me the girl looked away smiling down coquettish shy perhaps a little alarmed just possibly even daring to feel slightly insulted he reached out and took her hair swinging her face round to his a golddark silhouette against the sparse sprinkle of distant stars child i am not sure that in all my life i have ever teased not once the girl did not seem to know what to say she looked around perhaps at the pale stars through the screenglass perhaps at the snowwhite tumble of lowgee puffbedding perhaps at the shell of screens forming the walls of their little nest surfaces on which startlingly detailed and inventive acts of sexuality were being enacted perhaps she looked at her two companions both now curled and asleep well then sir she said at last not teased i would not say you teased me perhaps rather that you make fun of me because you are so much more educated and clever than me that the archimandrite thought was perhaps more like it but he still was not sure did this young thing still carry the truth inside her even after all the normalspan generations that had come and gone since hed formally swept away all this nonsense in a way it didnt matter in the slightest as long as nobody ever began to use their religion to organise against him he could not care less what people really thought obey me fear me hate me if you want dont ever pretend to love me that was all he asked of people faith was just another lever like sentiment like empathy like love or what people thought was love what they claimed was love the fanciful maybe even dishonest bit that wasnt lust which was honest and of course another lever but he wanted to know a less civilised fellow in his situation would have considered having the girl tortured to find out the truth but people being tortured over something like this soon ended up just telling you what they thought you wanted to hear anything to get the pain to stop hed learned that quickly enough there was a better way he reached for the pods remote control and adjusted the spin creating the illusion of gravity once more go on all fours in front of the window he told the girl its time again sir of course sir the girl quickly assumed the position he wanted crouched against the oncoming star field seemingly fixed even though the pod was revolving the brightest sun screen deadcentre was ulubis luseferous had had his genitals enhanced in all sorts of ways one improvement was that he carried glands inside his body which allowed him to produce many different secretions which his ejaculate could then carry into the bodies of others but whose effects he was proof against obviously including irritants hallucinogens cannabinoids capsainoids sleeping draughts and truth serums he went briefly into the littledeath littletrance the petit mal which allowed him to select one of these and chose the lastmentioned the truth drug he took the girl anally it was fasteracting that way and discovered that she really did believe in the truth though it also emerged that she thought he was horribly ancient and weirdlooking and a frightening sickminded old sadist and she absolutely hated being fucked by him he thought about inseminating her with thanaticin or employing one of the physical options his remade penis made possible the shaved horsetail perhaps or just ejecting her into the vacuum and watching her die in the end luseferous decided that letting her live with such constant degradation was punishment enough hed always said he preferred being despised after all he would make her his favourite probably wise to put her on suicide watch too the dwellers held that the ability to suffer was what ultimately marked out sentient life from any other sort they didnt mean just the ability to feel physical pain they meant real suffering they meant the sort of suffering that was all the worse because the creature undergoing the experience could appreciate it fully could think back to when it had not suffered so look forward to when it might stop or despair of it ever stopping despair was a large component of this and know that if things had been different it might not be suffering now brains required see imagination any brainless thing with a rudimentary nervous system could feel pain suffering took intelligence of course dwellers didnt feel pain and claimed never to suffer except in the trivial sense of suffering fools because they were part of the family or experiencing the deleterious physical and mental effects of a serious hangover so by their own reckoning they werent really sentient at which point the average dweller assuming without question that they were absolutely selfevidently the most sentient and intelligent things around in anybodys neck of the woods would just throw their spinelimbs out shake their mantle ruff and start talking loudly about paradoxes he faced to spin carried in the jet stream at five hundred kilometres per hour motionless he sideslipped found a small eddy just a curl a tiny yellowwhite wisp a couple of klicks across in the great empty skies of orange and red and brown he moved through the gas it felt slick against the arrowheads skin he let the eddy carry him round in a slow gyration for a while then pointed down and fell twisting slowly as he went down through the hazes and the clouds and the slowly thickening weight and press of gas down to where the temperature was suitable where he levelled out and did something he had never done before he opened the cover of the little gascraft and let the atmosphere in let nasqueron in let it touch his naked human skin alarms were beeping and flashing and when he opened his eyes they stung in the dim orange light that seemed to shine from all around he still had the gillfluid in his mouth and nose and throat and lungs though now he was forced to try and breathe by himself just his chest muscles against the pull of nasquerons gravity field he was still connected to the gascraft by the interface collar too and when he could not raise himself up from the bed of shockgel he made the little arrowhead tip gradually towards its nose so that he was propped threequarters of the way towards a standing position blood roared in his ears his feet and legs protested at the weight as he was slowly forced down through the gel until he was partly standing on the far end of the cramped coffin shape that contained him now he could force himself away from the mould he used his elbows forcing himself forward the stinging in his eyes was making them water tears at last shaking with the effort he pulled at one stickyslippy strand of the gillfluid where it disappeared into his right nostril and opened his mouth gulping some of the gas nasqueron smelled of rotten eggs he looked around blinking the tears away as best he could the interface collar sucking at his neck trying to keep contact while he tried to look up and out it was a muddylooking old place nasqueron like a big bowl of beaten egg with a load of liquid shit stirred in and little drops of blood spattered throughout and sulphurous on the palate he let the gillfluid snap back filling his nose granting him pure oxygenrich air again though the stench still lingered he was sweating partly from the exertion partly from the heat maybe he should have chosen to do this a bit further up now his nose was tingling too as well as his streaming eyes he wondered if he could sneeze with the gillfluid inside him would it come splattering up out of him some ghastly lungvomit ejected left drooped over the side of the gascraft like some pale blue mass of seaweed leaving him to gasp and choke and die he could hardly see because of the tears now nasquerons noxious skies finally drawing from him what he had not been able to express for himself all of them the whole sept theyd made the move to the winter complex early the warhead had fallen there killing all of them slovius zab verpych all his family all the people he had grown up with all those he had known and loved through his childhood and as he had grown all the people who had made him whoever he now was whatever he had been until this moment it had been quick instantaneous indeed but so what they had felt no pain but they were dead gone beyond recall only they were not beyond recall he could not stop recalling he could not cease bringing them back to life in his head if only to apologise he had suggested to slovius that they get away from the autumn house hed meant a neutral place some hotel or university complex but theyd gone to another of the septs seasonal houses instead a compromise and that had killed them he had killed them his wellmeant advice his desire to care and protect and to be known to have thought of this had taken them all away he thought of just letting the craft tip further over beyond ninety degrees letting himself fall out jerked down by his own mass hurtling him plummeting downwards into that great sucking breath of gasgiant gravity the gillfluid wrenched from him perhaps taking some parts of his lungs with it as it ripped away tearing him apart and letting him fill the bloody ragged remains with alien gas for his last scream falsetto like the voice you got when you sucked helium from a party balloon as he plunged into the depths the signals and messages had finally caught up with them round about the time hed been floating through the wreckage of valseirs wrecked study all the shocked mailings all the garbled queries all the official notices all the messages of support and sympathy all the requests and followup signals asking for confirmation that he was still alive all the news mentions all the oculas revised orders they had all come through in a flood a great tangled knot of incoming data held up by the shrievaltys default secrecy especially in a time of threat the usual chaos of dweller communications in general and the particular breakdown in the smooth running of signalling protocols transmission that always attended a formal war an effect always at its most extreme within the war zone itself dead all dead but then not quite all dead a sept was no small thing and reality was rarely quite so neat just asgoodas all five junior servants on leave or errands had survived as had one of his second cousins and her infant son that was all enough to make it not a clean break however awful sufficient so that he would be expected to keep going provide leadership be strong all that easily said clichéd stuff his mother absent might have survived but shed been killed too in another attack unrelated it was supposed just sheer bad luck on the cessorian habitat in the kuiper belt where shed been on a retreat for the last half year he supposed he ought to be thankful that jaal was still alive that she had not been calling at the winter house at the time of the attack instead he had a succession of alarmed shocked plaintive and then numbsounding messages from her the last few pleading for him to get in touch if he could if he was alive if he was somewhere in nasqueron and could hear this or read this he had been listed as missing by the shrievalty ocula after the attack on third fury officially he still was they hadnt been sure that he and colonel hatherence were still alive until theyd received her relayed signal days later and subsequently had thought it best to keep his survival a secret for the time being his interview with the news service in hauskip had complicated matters however this was already being denounced as a fake even without their intervention and a degree of confusion had ensued listed as missing in action he was still officially alive and so chief seer of sept bantrabal that would not change for at least a year the situation in ulubis system was no less desperate and the importance of what they had been asked to do had if anything increased with the latest hostile actions of the invaderbeyonders even as it all came through even as the signals downloaded into the gascrafts memory with all the codes intact all the routings displayed he kept thinking maybe its all a hoax maybe its all just some terrible mistake even when he saw the news screenage of the stillsmoking crater where the winter house had been in the rolling hills of ualtus great valley he had wanted to believe it wasnt true this was faked all of it was faked it had happened more or less at the same time as the bombardment of third fury the tiny flash he had seen on the surface of glantine as they fell towards nasqueron in the escaping drop ship that had been the impact that had been the instant of their deaths that had been the very second in which he became alone the earlier shrievalty message slipping through before the data jam that had kept them ignorant all these days and recording the organisations sympathy for his loss had been referring to this catastrophe as well not just to the loss of life in third fury the wreckage of the drop ship had been found in the upper depths the body of master technician hervil apsile within it was as though nothing was to be left aside nothing and nobody saved nothing almost nothing left to him some servants he hardly knew and a second cousin he was moderately fond of plus an infant he couldnt even picture and jaal but would that could that ever be the same now he liked but did not love her and was fairly sure she felt the same way it would have been a good match but after this he would be different another person altogether even if he did return from this idiot adventure even if there was anything to return to even if the coming war hadnt destroyed or altered everything and would her sept want her to marry into a sept that no longer existed where was the good match the wise marriage there would even she want to and if she still did would it not be out of duty out of sympathy out of the feeling that their contract must still be honoured no matter what what a formula for future blame and bitterness that would be it was almost a comfort to realise that jaal too would probably be lost to him it was as though he was hanging over some great drop about to fall destined to fall and the greatest pain came from the act of still hanging on fingers scraping nails tearing let go of this one last thing to cling to and the fall itself would at least be painless he wasnt going to kill himself it was grimly good to know he could do it but he wouldnt from a purely practical point of view he was fairly certain that hatherence had followed him using her esuits military capabilities to hide herself from his gascrafts senses shed try to stop him it could get undignified and she might even succeed if he really wanted to kill himself he was sure there were easier ways just heading deeper into the war zone and powering hard straight for a dreadnought should do the job and it would be too easy it would be selfish it would be the end to this terrible gnawing feeling of guilt a line drawn under that and he didnt think that he deserved such an easy way out he felt guilty so feel guilty he had meant no harm quite the opposite hed just been wrong feeling guilty was stupid it was understandable but it was stupid just beside the point they were dead and he was alive his actions might well have led directly to their deaths but he hadnt killed them what was left revenge maybe though who to blame if it really had been beyonders that made his old treachery or principled selfsacrificing stand depending look foolish somehow he still despised the mercatoria hated the whole vicious cretinous vacuously selfimportant sentiencehating system and hed never had any illusions about the unalloyed niceness of the beyonders or any other large group or thought that a struggle against the mercatoria would be other than prolonged painful and bloody hed always known that his own end might be painful and longdrawnout he would do everything he could to make sure it wasnt but sometimes there was just nothing you could do he had also realised that innocents died just as filthily and in equally great numbers in a just war as they did in an unjust one and had known that war was to be avoided at almost all costs just because it magnified mistakes exaggerated errors but still hed hoped there would somehow be an elegance about his involvement in the struggle against the mercatoria a degree of gloriousness a touch of the heroic instead muddle confusion stupidity insane waste pointless pain misery and mass death all the usual stuff of war affecting him as it might affect anybody else without any necessary moral reason without any justice and even without any vindictiveness just through the ghastly banal workingout of physics chemistry biochemistry orbital mechanics and the shared nature of sentient beings existing and contending perhaps he had brought it all down upon them never mind advising slovius to get away from the autumn house his delve his famous delve the action of meeting valseir and trading information might have produced all this it might all be his fault taking all hed been told at face value it was he tried to laugh but the gillfluid filling his mouth and throat and lungs wouldnt let him not properly oh come on then be tried to say into the gassy skies of nasqueron it came out as a hopeless mumble show me its all a sim prove the cessonas right end run game over lift me out still all just a mumble a gurgling somewhere down in his throat as he half stood half lay there in his coffinshaped alcove in the little hovering gascraft poised within the gasgiants atmosphere at a place where a human could expose themselves to the elements and not die too quickly if they had something to breathe revenge was a poor way out too he thought through his tears it was human nature it was creat nature it would be in the nature of almost any being capable of feeling angry and injured but it was nearly as poor a way out as suicide selfserving selfcentred selfish yes if he was set in front of whoever had ordered the lobbing of a nuke at a house complex full of unarmed unwarned civilians hed be tempted to kill them if he could but it would not bring the dead back he never would have the opportunity of course again reality scarcely ever worked that neatly but if in theory he was presented with the chance the fabled theyretiedtoachairandyouvegotagun scenario able to hurt or kill whoever had killed most of those hed loved he might do it there was an argument that it would only make him as bad as them but then he knew that in a way he was already just as bad as them the only moral reason for doing it would be to rid the world the galaxy the universe of one selfevidently bad person as though there would ever be a shortage as though that wouldnt just leave the same niche for another and it would be a military machine a hierarchy involved here anyway the responsibility would almost certainly diffuse out from whoever or whatever group had drawn up the relevant strategy through to whoever had given some probably vague order down to whoever had drawn up the general and specific targeting criteria on down to some schmuck grunt or thoughtless technician whod pressed a button or tapped a screen or thoughtclicked an icon floating in a holo tank and doubtless that individual would be a product of the usual hammersubtle military induction and indoctrination process breaking the individual down and building them back up again into a usefully obedient semiautomatic asset sentimental towards their closest comrades loyal only to some cold code and oh how utterly sure you would have to be that they really were responsible in the first place that you werent being fooled by whoever had arranged all this tyingtoachair stuff and equipped you with a gun in the first place maybe automatics had slotted in the final target programming was he supposed to track down the programmer too and tie him up with whoever had given the attackauthorisation or dreamed up the whole wizzo plan for visiting ulubis in the first place if it had really been beyonders it might have been an ai which was responsible for the deed for whoknewwhat reason why hed have to find it turn the durn thing off though wasnt the mercatorias murderous attitude to ais one of the reasons he hated it so much and maybe of course it had all been their mistake and his fault perhaps theyd thought they were going to hit an empty house and only his idiot advice his meddling had filled it with people how to apportion the blame there his eyes were bad now like sand had been thrown in them he couldnt really see anything the tears were so thick he could still see via the collar which was a strange experience the tipped clear view of the arrowheads senses overlaid on his bodys own he couldnt kill himself he had to go on see what could be done pay tribute try to make up try to leave the place even fractionally better than hed found it try to do whatever good he might be capable of he waited for the truth to kick in for the simrun to end and when it didnt as hed known it wouldnt but had almost hoped it would he felt bitter resigned and grimly amused all at once he told the little gascraft to tip back and seal him in again the arrowhead angled backwards closing the canopy and enveloping him once more the shockgel already moving to cushion and cosset him tendrils of salve within it starting to heal and repair his flesh and soothe his weeping eyes he thought the machine did it all with something like relief but knew that was a lie the relief was his ah opinions differ as opinions should always have do and will might we have been bred who knows maybe we were pets perhaps professional prey maybe we were ornaments palace entertainers whipping beings galaxychanging seedmachines gone wrong these are some of our myths maybe our makers disappeared or we overthrew them another myth vainglorious overly flattering i distrust it maybe these makers were some protoplasmatics this must be said a pervasive one a tenacious trope why plasmatics why would beings of the flux stellar or planetary no matter wish to make something like us so long ago we have no idea yet the rumour persists all we know is that we are here and we have been here for ten billion years or more we come and we go and we live our lives at different rates generally slower as we get older as you good people have seen within these walls but beyond that why are we what are we for what is our point we have no idea youll forgive me these questions seem somehow more important when applied to us to dwellers because we do seem well if not designed certainly as one might say prone to persisting given to hanging about no disrespect do understand but the selfsame questions applied to quick to humans or even likespecies apologies begged dear colonel accept to oerileithe have not the same force because you do not have our track record our provenance our sheer cussed gratuitous goddenying abidance who knows maybe one day you will after all the universe is still young for all our shared egocentricity our handeddown certitude of culmination and perhaps when the final chronicles are written by our unknowable ultimate inheritors they will record that the dwellers lasted a mere dozen billion years or so in the first heady flush of the universes infancy before they faded away to nothing while the oerileithe and humans those bywords for persistence those doughty elongueurs those synonyms for civilisational endurance lasted two and three hundred billion years respectively or whatever then the same questions might be asked of you why what for to what end and who can say perhaps for you such being the case there will be an answer better yet one that makes sense for now though we alone are stuck with such awkward challenges everybody else seems to come and go and that appears natural that is to be expected that is the given species appear develop blossom flourish expand coast shrink and fade cynics would say ha just nature is all no credit to claim no blame to take but i say huzzah good for all for trying for taking part for being such sports but we us no were different we seem cursed doomed marked out to outstay our welcome linger in a niche that could as well fit many yes many others making everybody else feel uncomfortable by our just still being here when by rights we should have shuffled off with our oncecontemporaries long ago its an embarrassment i dont mind admitting im amongst friends i can say these things and anyway im just an old mad dweller a tramp an itinerant a floatful plodder from place to place worthy of nothing but contempt and handouts both if im lucky worse if im not i try your patience forgive me i get to talk to so few apart from the voices i make up the speaker was an offsequence dweller of cuspian age called oazil to be offsequence was to have declared oneself or sometimes to have been declared by ones peers uninterested in or apart from the usual steady progression of age and seniority that dweller society assumed its citizens would follow it was not by itself a state of disgrace it was often compared to a person becoming a monk or a nun though if it had been imposed on rather than chosen by a dweller it was certainly a sign that they might later become an outcast and physically ejected from their home planet a sanction which given the relaxed attitude dwellers displayed to both interstellar travel times and spaceshipconstruction quality control was effectively a sentence of somewhere between several thousand years solitary confinement and death oazil was an itinerant a tramp a wanderer he had entirely lost contact with a family he claimed to have anyway forgotten all details of had no real friends to speak of belonged to no clubs sodalities societies leagues or groups and had no permanent home he lived hed told them in his carapace and his clothes which were tattered and motley but raggedly impressive decorated with carefully painted panels depicting stars planets and moons preserved flowers from dozens of cloudplant species and the polished carbon bones and gleaming socketed skulls of various miniature gasgiant fauna it was a slightly largerscale and more feral collection of what dwellers called life charms compared to the sort of stuff valseir had worn save when there was some sort of formal event to attend when fassin had first seen the dweller tramp it had even occurred to him that oazil was valseir in disguise come back in some attempted secrecy to taunt them all see how they would treat a poor itinerant before revealing himself as the true owner of the house come to reclaim his lost estate but valseir and oazil looked quite different oazil was bulkier his carapace fractionally less symmetrical his markings less intricate his voice far deeper and his quota of remaining vanes and limbs quite different too most marked of all oazils carapace was much darker than valseirs the two were of roughly similar age oazil would have been slightly junior to valseir had he still been onsequence a cuspianbaloan or cuspiannompar to valseirs cuspianchoal but he looked much older darker and more weatherbeaten almost as dark as jundriance who was ten times his age but had spent much of his life as a scholar in slowtime not wandering the atmosphere exposed to the elements oazil towed behind him a little floattrailer shaped like a small dweller and similarly bedecked in which he carried a few changes of apparel some sentimentally precious objects and a selection of gifts which he had made usually carved from oxytreecloud roots he had presented one of these shaped to resemble the bubble house itself to nuern to pass on to jundriance when next he left his depths of slow academe nuern had not looked especially impressed to receive this small token however oazil claimed that valseirs house had been a stoppingoff point for him during his peregrinations for the last oh fifty or sixty thousand years or so and there was anyway especially away from cities a tradition of hospitality towards wanderers that it would be profoundly kudossacrificing to ignore certainly when there were other guests around to witness the insult will you stay long sir nuern asked yes will you asked livilido oh no ill be gone tomorrow oazil told the younger dweller this is im sure a fine house still though of course i am sorry to hear that my old friend is no more however i become awkward when i spend too long in one place and houses though not as terrifying to me as cities provoke in me a kind of restlessness i cannot wait to be away when i am near a house no matter how pleasant its aspect or welcoming the hosts they were outside on one of the many balconies girdling the house living spaces they had originally convened for a morning meal to welcome oazil in the nethung dining space but the old dweller had seemed uncomfortable from the start edgy and atwitch and before the first course was over he had asked embarrassed and plaintive if he might dine outside perhaps beyond a window they would open so that they could still converse face to face he suffered from a kind of claustrophobia brought on by countless millennia spent wandering the vast unceilinged skies and felt uncomfortable enclosed like this nuern and livilido had swiftly ordered their younger servants to strike table and set the meal up on the nearest balcony theyd all gone outside and after voluminous apologies for seeming to force his will upon them oazil had settled down enjoyed his meal and subsequent to sampling some auragrains and timbretrace from the narcotics in the tables centrepiece modelled on a globular university city he had relaxed sufficiently to share with them all his thoughts on dweller origins it was a favourite aftermeal topic with dwellers and so one there was effectively nothing original to say concerning though to give oazil some credit the subject had been his academic speciality before hed slipped the moorings of scholastic life and set float upon the high skies of wander hatherence asked the old dweller his thoughts on whether his species had always been unable to experience pain or had had this bred out of them ah if we only knew i am fascinated that you ask the question for it is one that i believe is of the utmost importance in the determining of what our species really means in the universe fassin resting lightly in a cushioned dent across the ceremonial table from the old wanderer found his attention slipping it seemed to do this a lot now perhaps a dozen nasqueron days had elapsed since the news of the winter houses destruction he had spent almost all that time in the various libraries searching for anything that might lead to their goal the to him at least increasingly mythicalseeming third volume of the work that he had taken from here over two hundred years ago and which had supposedly led to so much that had happened since he looked he searched he trawled and combed and scanned but so often even when it seemed to him that he was concentrating fully hed find that hed spent the last few minutes just staring into space seeing in his minds eye some aspect of the sept and family life that was now gone recalling an inconsequential conversation from decades ago some atthetime sowhat exchange that he would not have believed hed ever have remembered let alone have found brought to mind now when they were all gone and he was in such a far and different place he felt the welling of tears in his eyes sometimes the shockgel drew them gently away sometimes he thought again of suicide and found himself longing as though for a lost love or a treasured vanished age for the will the desire the sheer determination to end things that would have made killing himself a realistic possibility instead suicide seemed as pointless and futile as everything else in life you needed desire the desire for death to kill yourself when you seemed to have no desire no emotions or drives of any sort left just their shadows habits killing oneself became as impossible as falling in love he looked up from the books and scrolls the fiches and crystals the etched diamond leaf and glowing screens and holos and wondered what the point of anything was he knew the standard answers of course people all species all speciestypes wanted to live wanted comfort to be free from threat needed energy in some form whether it was as direct as absorbed sunlight or as ataremove as meat desired to procreate were curious wanted enlightenment or fame andor success andor any of the many forms of prosperity but ultimately to what end people died even the immortal died gods died some had faith religious belief even in this prodigiously rampantly physically selfsufficient age even in the midst of this universal abundant clarity of godlessness and godlack but such people seemed in his experience no less prone to despair and their faith a liability even in its renunciation just one more thing to lose and mourn people went on they lived and struggled and insisted on living even in hopelessness and pain desperate not to die to cling to life regardless as if it was the most precious thing when all it had ever brought them was bringing them and ever would bring them was more hopelessness more pain everybody seemed to live as though things were always just about to get better as though any bad times were just about to end any time now but they were usually wrong life ground on sometimes to the good but often towards ill and always in the direction of death yet people acted as though death was just the biggest surprise my who put that there maybe that was the right way to treat it of course maybe the sensible attitude was to act as though there had been nothing before one came to consciousness and nothing would exist after ones death as though the whole universe was built around ones own individual awareness it was a working hypothesis a useful halftruth but did that mean that the urge to live was the result of some sort of illusion was the reality in fact that nothing mattered and people were fools to think that anything did were the choices either despair the rejection of reason for some idiot faith or a sort of defensive solipsism valseir might have had something useful to say on the matter fassin thought but then he was dead too he looked at oazil and wondered if this selfproclaimed wanderer really had known the dead cuspian whose house this had been or was he just a chancer a blowhard a fantasist and liar thinking like this circling round his studied despair fassin only halflistened to the old dweller with his theories about gasgiant fauna development and his tales of wandering oazil told how once he had circumnavigated the south tropical band without seeing another dweller in all those hundred and forty thousand kilometres how he had once fallen in with a gang of adolescent sculpture pirates semirenegades who seeded public rootcloud and ammoniasluice forests him becoming their figurehead mascot totem and how many millennia ago in the littletravelled wastes of the southern polar region he had wandered into a vast warren of empty cloudtunnel the work of a troop of rogue tunnelbuilding machines since disappeared an artwork the lost prototype for a new kind of city he didnt know nobody had ever heard of this place this thing he was lost inside this vast tree this giant lung this colossal root system of a labyrinth for a thousand years exiting eleventwelfths starved and nearly mad he had reported the find and people had looked for it but it had never been found again most people thought hed imagined it all but he had not they believed him did they not the tapping noise was there again he had been vaguely aware of it but had ignored it not even getting as far as dismissing it as some function of the houses plumbing or differential expansion or reaction to some brief current in the surrounding gas it had stopped after a while he had halfnoticed that too though still thought no more about it now it was there again and slightly louder fassin was in library three one of the inner libraries speedreading through the contents of a sublibrary that valseir appeared to have picked up as part of a job lot untold ages ago from the earliest date that anybody had bothered to note this stuff had been lying around uncalledup and unread for thirty millennia dating from an era several different species of slow seers ago long before humans had come to ulubis fassin suspected this was traded material data secondhand thirdhand who knew how manyhand dredged from who knew where possibly autotranslated it certainly read like it whenever he dipped into the text itself to make sure that the contents were what the abstracts claimed bundled and presented and handed over to the dwellers of nasqueron by some longsuperseded possibly even longextinct species of seer in return for presumably still older information he wondered at what point most of the data the dwellers held would become traded data and if that point had already been reached he was not the first seer to think of this and thanks to the absolute opaqueness of the dwellers records he would certainly not be the last the volumes he was checking were mostly composed of stories concerning the romantic adventures and philosophical musings of some group of stellar field liners though they were either muchtranslated or the work of not just another species but another speciestype altogether they seemed fanciful anyway the tapping wasnt going to go away he looked up from the screen to the round skylight set in the ceiling library three though now surrounded and surmounted by other spheres had once been on the upper outskirts of the house and had a generous expanse of diamond leaf at its crown though nowadays even had the house been situated in less gloomy regions it would let in little natural light there was something small and pale out there when fassin looked up the tapping stopped and the thing waved it looked like a dweller infant a petchild fassin watched it waving for a while then went back to the screen and the not especially feasible exploits of the sliners the tapping started again he felt himself attempt to sigh inside his little gascraft he stopped the screen scroll and lifted out of the dentseat rising to the centre of the ceiling it was indeed a dweller child a rather elongated deformedlooking one to human eyes more like a squid than a manta ray it was dressed in rags and decorated with a few patheticlooking life charms fassin had never seen an infant wearing clothes or decorations it was oddly maturely dark for one so young it pointed in at what looked like some sort of catch or lock on the side of one of the skylights hexagonal panes fassin looked at the curious infant for a while it kept pointing at the catch there had been no sign of petchildren round the house in all the time theyd been here this one looked entirely like it might belong to oazil but he had not displayed any earlier and hadnt mentioned owning one the child was still indicating the panes lock it started to mime pressing and twisting and pulling motions fassin opened the pane and let the creature in it flipped inside made a sign that was probably meant to be the dweller equivalent of shh and floated towards him curling and cupping its body so that it formed a sickle shape just a metre away from the prow of the arrowhead craft then on its signal skin now shielded from sight in all directions save that fassin was watching from it spelled out oazil meet me km straight down hour re valseir it waited till he lightsignalled back ok then it sped out the way it had come one slim tentacle staying behind after the rest of it had exited just long enough to pull the ceiling pane shut after it it disappeared into the nighttime gloom between the dark library globes outside fassin looked at the time just before hour four he went back to his studies finding nothing thinking about nothing until just before five when he went back to library twentyone and slipped out through the secret doorway again he dropped the two thousand metres down through the slowly increasing heat and pressure and met the old dweller oazil complete with his floattrailer oazil signalled fassin taak yes what did valseir once compare the quick to in some detail if you please why the old dweller sent nothing for some time then you might guess little one or do this just because i ask to humour an old dweller fassin waited a while before answering clouds he sent eventually clouds above one of our worlds we come and we go and we are as nothing compared to the landscape beneath just vapour compared to implacable rock which lasts seemingly beyond lasting and is always there long after the clouds of the day or the clouds of the season have long gone and yet other clouds will always be there the next day and the next and the next and the next season and the next year and for as long as the mountains themselves last and the wind and the rain wear away mountains in time hmm oazil sent sounding distracted mountains curious idea i have never seen a mountain nor ever will i imagine do you want me to add any more i dont think i recall much else no that will not be necessary then valseir is alive the old dweller said he sends his regards alive there is a gasclipper regatta at the c storm ultraviolet beginning in seventeen days time thats in the war zone isnt it the tournament was arranged long before the hostilities were first mooted and so has been cleared with the formal war marshals a special dispensation be there fassin taak he will find you the old dweller roted forward a metre taking up the slack on the floattrailers traces farewell seer taak he signalled remember me to our mutual friend if youd be so kind he turned and floated away into the deep hot darkness in a few moments he was lost to most passive senses fassin waited until there was no sign of him at all then rose slowly back up to the house ah fassin i understand commiserations are in order ysul said floating up to the bubble houses reception balcony from the poaflias nuern fassin and hatherence had watched the ship motor out of the dim haze hearing its engines long before theyd seen it your sympathy is noted fassin told ysul hed got hatherence to call the poaflias the day before and order it back from its hunting patrol the little ship returned with a modest number of trophies strung from its rigging various julmicker bladders bobbing like grisly balloons on sticks three gasdrying roothugger hides the heads of a brace of gracile tumblerines and patently the most prized mounted above the crafts nose a dweller child carcass already gutted and stretched wide on a frame so that it looked like some slightly grotesque figurehead flying just ahead of the ship fassin had sensed the colonels esuit rolling fractionally back when shed realised what the new addition to the poafliass nose actually was what is your state of mind fassin now that you have lost so many of your family ysul asked coming to a stop in front of the seer are you decided to return to your own people my state of mind is calm i may still be in shock i suppose shock look it up i have not decided to return to my own people yet there are almost none to return to we are however finished here i wish to return to munueyn hed told the colonel that morning that hed discovered something and they needed to leave what have you discovered major may i see it ill tell you later i see so where next are we bound back to munueyn hed lied munueyn our captain will be pleased ysul said they left that evening nuern and livilido seemed relaxed positively cheered that they were departing ysul had returned with news of the war in which two important dreadnought actions had already taken place resulting in one engagement alone in the loss of five dreadnoughts and nearly a hundred deaths the zone forces were retreating in two volumes at least and the belt certainly had the upper grasp at the moment fassin and hatherence recorded short messages of gratitude for jundriance to read at his leisure nuern asked them if they wanted to take any of the books or other works from the house no thank you fassin said i found this humorous thesaurus the colonel said holding up a small diamondleaf book id like this be our guest nuern told her anything else diamondbased works like that will burn up in a few decades when the house has dropped further into the heat take all you want overkind this alone is most sufficient the gasclipper regatta captain slyne said he scratched his mantle i thought you wanted to go back to munueyn there was no reason to let our hosts know where we were really heading fassin told slyne you are suspicious of them ysul asked just no reason to trust them fassin said the regatta takes place around the storm ultraviolet between zone c and belt the colonel said starting in sixteen days have we time to get there captain they were in slynes cabin a fairly grand affair of flickering wallscreens and antique furniture the ceiling hung with ancient ordnance guns blaster tubes and crossbows all swaying gently as the poaflias powered away at halfthrottle from valseirs old house so far fassin had told hatherence where they were really going though not why slyne let himself tilt looking as though he was about to fall over he did some more mantle scratching ithink so id better change course then leave the course change for a little longer would you fassin asked they were only a halfhour away from the bubble house though you might go to full speed have to anyway if were to get to that storm in time slyne said turning and manipulating a holo cube floating over his haloshaped desk the largest screen just in front of him lit up with a chart of the volume and quickly became covered in gently curved lines and scrolling figure boxes slyne peered at this display for a few moments then announced full speed we can be there in eighteen days best i can do slyne gripped a large polishedlooking handle sitting prominently on his desk and pushed it with a degree of obvious relish if also a little embarrassment to its limit the tone of the ships engines altered and the vessel began to accelerate gradually we might contact munueyn and hire a faster ship ysul suggested have it rendezvous with the poaflias en route and transfer to it slyne rocked back staring at the older dweller with patterns of betrayal and horror nonmild spreading across his signal skin eighteen days will have to do captain fassin told slyne i dont think we need be there for the very start of the tournament how long do these competitions last in generality hatherence asked slyne tore his gaze from an unconcernedlooking ysul and said ten or twelve days usually they might cut this one a little short because of the war well be there in time for most of it good fassin said stay on your current course for another halfhour if you please captain turn for the storm then slyne looked happier consider it done slyne took advantage of a windriver a brieflived ribbon of still faster current within the vast wide jet stream of the whole rotating zone and they made good time they were challenged twice by war craft but allowed to continue on their way and slipped through a mine net a wall of dark lace thrown across the sky dotted with warheads dreadnoughtcatcher nothing to worry them slyne assured them they had oh tens of metres to spare on almost every side the screwburster poaflias got to very near the bottom of the storm called ultraviolet within sixteen days arriving more or less as the regatta began keep clipped on could get a bit rough ysul yelled then repeated the warning as a signal in case they hadnt heard fassin and hatherence had come up on deck when the poaflias had started bucking and heaving even more than usual the gas around them darker even than it had been at valseirs house though less dense and hot was fairly shrieking through the ships vestigial rigging ribbons and streaks just seen coiling briefly round the whole vessel were then torn away again as the ship plunged into another great boiling mass of cloud the human and the oerileithe still within the relative calmness of the companionway shelter exchanged glances then quickly put the crudelooking harnesses on the colonels fitted well over her esuit fassinstied tight enough but looked messy not designed forhis alien shape slyne had insisted that everybody should wear the things whenever they went on deck while the poaflias was at full speed even though both hatherence and fassin in the unlikely event that they were somehow blown off the deck could easily have caught up with the ship under their own power whats going on hatherence shouted as they neared ysul clinging to the rails near the bow harpoon gun going to shoot the storm ysul bellowed back that sounds dangerous hatherence yelled oh assuredly so what does it entail exactly punching through the storm wall ysul shouted tackling the rim winds should be spectacular ahead a great dark wall of tearing whirling cloud could be glimpsed beyond the tatters and scraps of gas that the ship was stabbing its way through jagged lines of lightning pulsed across this vast cliff like veins of quicksilver they were still making maximum speed towards the wall which seemed to stretch as far to each side as they could see and up for ever downwards was a more swirling mass of even darker gas boiling like something cooking in a cauldron the wind picked up thrumming the rails and rigging and aerials like an enormous instrument the poaflias shuddered and buzzed time to get below suspect hatherence shouted a julmicker bladder blew off a nearby railing it looked like it had been the last one left smacked ysul across his starboard side and was instantly lost to the shrieking gale could be ysul agreed after you they watched from the ships armoured storm deck crowded in with slyne beneath a blister of thick diamond set at midships looking out across the deck and watching the poafliass nose plunge into the storm like a torpedo thrown at ahorizontal waterfall of ink the ship groaned started to spin and they were all thrown against each other they disappeared into the wall of darkness the poaflias shook and leapt like a dweller child on the end of a harpoon line slyne whooped pulling on levers and whirling wheels stuck in the far reaches of the ovaloid space slynes petchildren whimpered this entirely necessary fassin asked ysul doubt it the dweller said a big flat board covered in studs above slyne started to light up in the darkness it was quite bright hatherence pointed at it as dozens more of the studs lit whats that damagecontrol indicators slyne said still working levers and spinning wheels they all rose to the ceiling as the ship dropped sharply then crashed back down again thought it might be hatherence said she was thrown hard against fassin in a violent turn and apologised when the glare started to get too distracting slyne turned the damagecontrol board off in the worst of the turbulence one of slynes petchildren threw itself at its master and had to be torn off and smacked unconscious before being thrown into a locker it was unclear whether it had been desperately seeking comfort or attacking ysul was sick fassin had never seen a dweller be sick stuck to the ceiling again coated in a greasy film of vomit slyne cursing as he tried to keep hold of the controls his petchildren keening from all sides somebody mumbled fuck were going to die they all denied responsibility afterwards the poaflias burst out of the torrent of storm cloud into a vast and hazy calm and started to drop like a lump of iron slyne drew in gas to whoop but caught some of ysuls earlier output and just spluttered coughing and retching and cursing ysuls lineage to some point only shortly after the big bang he got the ship level and under control contacted regatta control and limped the ship had lost all its rigging railings and four of its six engines to the lower marina and a berth in a storm repair facility looking up into the colossal bowl of the circling storm and on into the haze and the starspecked sky beyond tiny shapes could be seen slowcircling against the brassy glare of light the pickup fleet and relaying craft are all in orbit hatherence told him they were in a steeppitched multitiered viewing gallery packed with dwellers protected by carbon ribs ready to be explosively deployed should a competition craft come too close and attached to the dzunda a klicklong blimper riding just inside the stormwall boundary the gallery was a relatively safe place to watch gasclipper races giant banner screens could scroll up on either side of the fan of dentseats to provide highlights of other races and relay events too distant to witness directly the pickup fleet fassin asked that is as it was described to me hatherence said settling into her seat alongside his dwellers around them were staring at them seemingly fascinated by their alienness ysul had gone off to meet an old friend while he was with them dwellers only glanced at fassin and hatherence now and again with him gone they stared shamelessly they had both got used to it and fassin was confident that if valseir was here and looking for him he wouldnt have too difficult a job finding him how big a fleet fassin asked not sure there were hundreds of accommodation and spectator blimpers within the storms vast eye scores of competing gasclippers and support vessels plus dozens of media and ancillary craft not to mention a ceremonial and warneutral dreadnought the puisiel this was decked out with multitudinous bunting lines of ancient signal flags and festoons of dwellersize balloonflowers just so that thered be no possibility of anyone mistaking it for a dreadnought taking part in the greater and fractionally more serious competition taking place beyond the storm the side screens lit up and they watched some early action from a race which had taken place the day before around them a thousand dwellers hooted and roared and laughed threw food made spoken kudos bets that they would later deny or inflate accordingly and traded insults any other news from outside fassin asked our orders remain as they were there have been more semirandom attacks throughout the system nothing on the same scale as the assaults on the seer assets earlier the defensive preparations continue apace manufacturers continue to make heroic efforts the people continue to make great but willing sacrifice morale remains most high though unofficially people would seem to be growing more frightened some rioting deepspace monitors have picked up still ambiguous traces of a great fleet approaching from the direction of the e disconnect how great great enough to be bad much rioting not much rioting the blimper powered up distantly revving its engines a ragged cheer resounded around them as the dwellers realised things were about to start happening well major the colonel sent signal strength low in the clattering hubbub of noise we are finally off the ship poaflias we are alone i think it unlikely we can be overheard and i have built up an extravagant desire to know quite why we are here unless you have in the course perhaps of your studies discovered that you are an insatiable fan of gasclippering according to oazil valseir is alive the colonel was silent for a while then she sent you tell me so do you of course oazil may be mad or deluded or a fantasist or just a mischiefmaker but from what he said he knew valseir or had at least been instructed by valseir on what to ask me to make sure i really was who i claimed to be i see so his turning up at the house was not chance i suspect hed been keeping a watch on it or somebody had waiting for us for me to turn up and he told you to come here he did and then valseir will find me another cheer went up as the dzunda began to pick up speed becoming part of a small fleet of similar spectator craft flocking through the gas towards the starting grid of gasclippers arranged a couple of kilometres ahead this would be a short race only lasting an hour or so with turns around buoys set in the storm wall the races would grow longer and more gruelling as the meet progressed culminating in a last epic struggle all the way round the vast storms inner surface so valseir knew you were or might be looking for him and had put in place arrangements to hmm that is interesting any contact so far not yet but now you know why were here you will keep me informed yes though you will understand if i have to go off by myself at some point i hope your presence might make valseir or whoever nervous the blimper picked up more speed still heading towards the storminward side of the starting grid the slipstream started to blow away balloons and trays not secured nervous you think this is all that serious what do you think i think oazil is probably one or several of the things you thought he might be however we are here now and if he was telling the truth no doubt you will be contacted of course the other possibility is that we might have been getting close to something of interest back at valseirs house and this was simply a method of getting us out of the way what exactly did oazil say to you fassin had kept a record of the conversation hed had with the wandering dweller deep beneath the house he signalled it across to hatherence the fleet of spectator craft passed by the starting grid like an unruly flock of fat birds another great cheer sounded the gasclippers stayed on the starting plane awaiting their own signal still little enough to go on major hatherence told him you should have shared this with me earlier and let me decide on the correct course of action i may have been overly indulgent with you your loss is still something i appreciate of course however i fear i might have been guilty of dereliction i wont report you if you dont fassin sent without humour the gasclippers the larger pluralcrewed versions of the singledweller stormjammers were sharp angularlooking things all jagsails keellode and highgallants fifty metres long fifty metres in most directions bristling with glittering sails like enormous blades they looked like the result of some monstrous permanent magnet being thrown into a hopper full of exotic edged weapons pennant sails carried identifying marks little flowers of colour within the silvery blades all bright beneath the glittering point of light that was ulubis it was not possible to sail in a single medium true sailing required a keel or something like one in one medium and sails or something like them in another in a single great stream of gas you could not sail you flew on the edges of two streams the boundary between a zone moving in one direction and a belt moving in the other you could in theory sail if you could build a ship big enough the dwellers had tried to build ships on that scale that would stay together they had failed instead stormjammers and gasclippers exploited the titanic magnetic fields that most gasgiant planets possessed flux lines were their water the place where their steadying keels lay with a colossal magnetic field trying to move them along one course and the planetgirdling atmospheric bands of a dwellerinhabited gasgiant expecting them to move along with everything else in a quite different direction the possibility of sailing arose and by sailing with sails dipped into the inside edges of giant storm systems the sport could be made satisfactorily dangerous we must hope that this was not a ruse to get us away from the house the colonel told fassin and we must hope that valseir will indeed contact you if he is alive we were given no hint that such might be the case she looked at him were we none almost the entire fleet of spectator craft had passed the starting grid the gasclippers shook as one then bewilderingly quickly when one knew they had no proper engines they swung away towards the massive wall of dark tearing cloud that was the inner limit of the great storm peeling and jostling weaving and carving through the gas as they fought for position using the light breezes and simple gaseous inertia of the medium to allow them to steer while they rode their lines of force towards the storm wall they never did find a body though this is right hatherence asked thats right fassin told her lost in a squall that could tear apart a stormjammer he wouldnt have had much of a chance but he might have lived yet there is no water or the like they cannot drown and it is not too cold or hot how do they die just in a strong wind ripped apart spun until they lose consciousness and then just whirled round too fast to hold together or left in a coma that means they do drop into the depths and they do need to breathe if the pressure is too low they cant hmm the gasclippers swung at the storms inner surface half disappearing as their extending bladesails cut into the stream of gas they accelerated hard even with their head start and their bellowing engines labouring even taking a shorter innercurve route the spectator craft began to lose ground to the small fleet of speeding gasclippers it is possible that valseir somehow arranged the accident the colonel asked possible he might have arranged to have some friend some accomplice nearby to rescue him it would make surviving likely rather than not do dwellers often fake their own deaths almost never so i thought the group of gasclippers was level with the centre of the greater fleet of spectator ships and the shouting and hollering in the spectator craft rose still further in pitch and volume as the whole mass of gasclippers and their accompanying squadrons of blimpers and ancillary vessels seemed to move briefly as one the dark storm wall a vertical sea troubled and tattered tearing past in front of them a vast slanting band of shade rose up to meet them all as they moved into the shadow of the storm the hazy point of ulubis eclipsed by a roaring circlet of dementedly gyrating gas a hundred klicks high and ten thousand kilometres across fassin made any bets yet ysul said settling into his dentseat alongside a petchild in a waiters uniform floated with a tray at his side held back until the older dweller settled into his seat then left the tray with its drug paraphernalia clipped to the seat and retreated no id be relying on your kudos wouldnt i oh i suppose you would ysul agreed apparently only now thinking this through obviously i must trust you subconsciously most odd he flipped to one side and started rummaging through the various drug works hed brought back how was your friend hatherence asked him oh in very good spirits ysul said not looking at her father died yesterday in action stands to inherit kudos points for bravery or something he kept on rummaging sworn i got some feverbrain good to know hes taking it so well fassin said ah here we are ysul said holding up a large bright orange capsule to take a good look at it oh yes fassin bumped into some youngster who claimed to know you gave me this ysul dug into a pocket in his forebritch and came out with a tiny imageleaf passing it to fassin the human held it in one of the gascrafts finescale manipulators and looked at the photograph it was of white clouds in a blue sky yes colours all wrong obviously ysul commented couldnt help noticing fassin was aware of the colonel looking at the image too she sat back silent did this person who claimed to know me actually say anything fassin asked eh ysul said still studying the fingersized orange lozenge oh yes said to take good care of that thing and that theyll be in the stern viewinggallery restaurant if you wanted to see them alone they said bit rude i thought very young though almost expect that well thanks fassin said nothing ysul said with a wave he popped the giant pill with your permission colonel fassin sent to hatherence granted take care excuse me fassin said as he rose from his dentseat ysul didnt hear two of the leading gasclippers were having a private duel swerving dangerously close weaving in and out of each others course trying to tangle field lines steal wind and so eddywake the other into dropping behind or crashing out and ysul was floating high up out of his seat shouting and whooping with all the other spectators not yet in their own little narcotic world the dweller a youth by his simple clothing and certainly looking at least that young intercepted fassin on the broad central corridor of the dzunda falling into pace with him as he made his way towards the rear of the ship fassin turned fractionally towards his sudden companion kept on going seer taak the youth said yes would you come with me please fassinfollowed the young dweller not to the stern viewing restaurant but to a private box slung low beneath the blimper the captain of the dzunda was there talking to an old dweller who looked to be at least early sage in years the captain turned when fassin and the youth entered then with a small bow to fassin left with the youth leaving fassin alone in the round diamondbubble space with the aged dweller a few screens showed silent views of the race a float tray to one side carried a large narcincenser greyblue smoke uncoiling from it filling thecabin with haze and scent is it you old one i am still me young taak the familiar voice said the dweller floated up to him if it was valseir he was no more shrunken but rather more dark than the last time fassin had seen him he had lost all the life charms and decorations and was dressed now in severely formal almost monastic yellow partrobes you have the token i sent fassin handed over the little imageleaf the dweller looked at it rim mantle rippling in a smile yes you still wear us away dont you he handed it back take good care of that and so how was oazil i take it he found you at the house and youre not here by coincidence he was well eccentric but well the old dwellers smile grew then faded and the house my libraries they are sinking into the depths whats left whats left a bit was missing ah the study what happened to it the cloudtunnel started to get too heavy to maintain i had the house decoupled i cleared the study first the tunnel section fell into the depths and the contents the old dweller roted back a fraction creating small roils of smoke in the haze you are still testing me arent you fassin taak you are still not prepared to trust me that i am who you think i am who do i think you are your i thought old friend valseir once choal now acting like a sagechild and hoping for the confirmation of my peers if i ever get to come out of hiding do you think i will ever get to come out of hiding seer taak that depends beyond the old dweller the gasclipper race continued well ahead of the labouring blimper screens relaying signals from camera jets showed the action in closeup the sounds of distant cheers came through the open diamondpane windows of the private box why did you go into hiding the dweller switched to signalwhispering because i thought to skim through what id traded you for the expressionist paintings you had brought i read a certain note at the end of a certain volume which reminds me that i must apologise it was not my intention to seem to fob you off with three different translations of the same volume instead of all three parts of the one work however read that note i did and came to the conclusion that what was being referred to was the sort of information that people die for and most certainly will kill for i decided to disappear i became dead sorry i doubted you valseir fassin said moving forward and holding out two manipulators towards the old dweller suspicious to the last sighed valseir ignoring the left manipulator and shaking the right with his own extended right hubarm there how humans greet are you satisfied now seer taak fassin smiled entirely good to see you again you must feel emotional pain then i feel sorry for you i am trying not to feel too sorry for myself which is helped by getting on with what needs to be done fassin had told valseir about the attacks on third fury and sept bantrabal valseir had related his life since they had last met a time dominated by the dweller list in a way that even fassins hadnt been until recently most of that period he had spent in hiding after arranging what looked like his own death with the help of xessife the dweller captain whom fassin had seen briefly earlier he was an old stormsailor a jammerhand and clipperine with a collection of trophies and medals that outweighed him retired now pursuing a more contemplative course content to take charge of a blimper now and again just to stay part of the whole stormsailing scene and what needs to be done seer taak i think we need to find that third volume do you still have it i do not however it is not the third volume itself that is of consequence in this matter then what is a note a brief appendix do you have that no do you know where it is no then we may all to use a human term be fucked i do know the direction it went in that could help you agree that it may be that important that we may all be fucked without it oh we may very well all be thoroughly fucked with it but without it while people think this thing exists they will do terrible things to anybody who gets in their way or isnt being what they regard as a hundred per cent helpful my minder here an oerileithe ocula colonel tells me theres a fleet of mercatoria warships over nasqueron the excuse is theyre here to help pick up me and her but i think they might have another purpose military intervention the instant they think there might be a firm lead towards the list well we must try not to furnish them with one i must also try not to furnish my fellow dwellers with an excuse for regarding me as the most terrible traitor for even thinking of passing on anything to do with the thing in question to alien powers even if my own studies and those of many others indicate that the data being sought is hopelessly out of date or a fantasy or both however i do need to tell somebody which direction to point in or i may have to stay dead for ever fate seems to dictate that its me you tell where do i go ah now then i must explain when i realised what was being referred to in the note in the first volume i naturally looked for volume three well at least i did so after spending some days in a state of horror and rage realising that through no fault of my own save the usually harmless hobby of bibliophilia i had potentially unleashed something capable of destroying much starting with my own quite happy and content life this episode over i devoted myself to my search and discovered the volume eventually i have never had such cause to curse my own lackadaisical approach to cataloguing the relevant piece was in the form of a separate folder attached within the appendices i myself took the original of the folder to a friend and fellow collector in the city of deilte in the south polar region contained within a safekeep box which i asked him to look after for me and not to open in the event of my death he was to hand the safekeep box on to somebody he in turn would trust not to open the box a family member or some other trusted person would appear in due course carrying an imageleaf with a particular image in it the one you now carry they were to be given the box so would your friend in deilte have known of your death i didnt perhaps perhaps not he is an antiquarian datacollector like myself but a recluse he may have heard through mutual acquaintances right fassin sent so i must make for deilte what was your friends name chimilinith the name was barely out of valseirs signal pit when fassin registered a neutrino burst any particular part of deilte he asked starting to look round in more detail chimilinith tended to move his house around but i imagine the locals will know of him okay so did you take a look at this data what did it look like the diamondbubble private box was nearly empty just the two of them the floattray and bowl hed scanned them automatically when hed entered and they were just what they appeared to be no more and the screens which also seemed perfectly standard whod be using neutrino comms from where why the sudden burst just then it looked like algebra fassin scanned valseirs simple clothes no hint of anything hightech there the most sophisticated thing in his robes was the weave itself algebra he asked there was nothing on the inside or the outside surface of the diamond bubble itself he scanned the access tube clear it looked like alien algebra valseir told him fassin looked up at the undersurface of the blimper immediately above then swept for anything in the clear gas space outside within the same radius still nothing something further outside then alien he asked distracted there seemed to be nothing nearby there was the dzunda then nothing for a hundred metres or so until the next blimper then the other spectator and ancillary craft beyond with the single accompanying dreadnought puisiel a few klicks further up in the atmosphere easily keeping pace with the spectating fleet then the gasclippers themselves currently starting to round the storm wall buoy which marked this short races first turning point alien symbology though not entirely i thought i recognised some of the symbols they looked like a form of translatory iv a panspecies type socalled universal notation dating from perhaps two billion years ago invented by the wopuld long extinct invert spongiforms though with elements of ancient dweller icons i would have made notes but i thought better of committing any of it to a form i could carry around save what exists necessarily sketchy in my own mind hence i have not been able to work on it since fassin was taking in what was being said and recording it on the gascrafts systems in case he wanted to review it later but he was still frantically scanning the volume all around them for some form of bug or surveillance device another burst of what certainly seemed like neutrino comms registered on the little gascrafts sensors a sudden pattern in the general wash of nearmassless particle chaos the first burst had come immediately valseir had spoken the name of the dweller hed given the folder to could it really just have been coincidence but how could anybody have overheard they were communicating by whisper signal coherent light beams flickering from one surfacesunk transceiver pit to another there was no way to intercept what they were saying unless someone dropped a mirror or some sensor into the beams could it be him had the gascraft itself been bugged had hatherence put something on him he scanned and systemchecked finding nothing the blimper above them ascended quickly and steadily as the gasclippers roared up the sheer face of the storm the dzunda rose into direct sunlight so just a field of equations fassin asked the old dweller the drugfume haze in the private box was suddenly lit up resolving into tiny individual particles of vapour a tiny fraction of them glinting and glittering possibly just the one long one horrified fassin sucked a little of the surrounding vapour into the arrowheads highres analysis unit one piece of algebra he asked the results coming from the gascrafts hightech nose looked bizarre surface receptors seeming to change their mind about what they were smelling fassin toggled the analysis down another level of detail to electron microscopy possibly valseir replied outside towards the storm wall a few tens of metres away something showed briefly caught in the slanting sunlight and taking just an instant too long to adapt to the new lighting conditions the results from the arrowheads internal electron microscope were for a moment baffling then fassin realised what his analysis unit was looking at nanotech a thin soup of tiny machines receptors analysers processors and signallers small enough to be suspended in the atmosphere light enough to float in the midst of the drug smoke like particles of the fumes themselves that was how theyd been bugged there was something in the gas between them riding right in the middle of their signal beams and capable of picking up their meaning nothing as gross as a mirror or some photon microphone dangling from a wire just this just these just stuff that was supposed to be banned valseir he sent urgently who brought this drug bowl in here he turned up visual magnification staring hard at the point in the open gas outside where something had shown in the sunlight an instant before there he upmagged again almost to the point of graininess what valseir said sounding confused well it was here when i a rough sphere forty metres away barely ten centimetres across almost perfectly camouflaged like a disc of clear glass in front of the real view hint of a comms pit a tiny craterlike dish pointing right at them fassin swung round to put himself between the tiny distant machine and the old dweller then went right up to him comms pit to comms pit like amorous dwellers kisssignalling valseir tried to rote back what the weve been bugged valseir fassin sent watched listened to the bowl smoke is part nanotech we need to get out now what but another burst of neutrino comms now that he knew where to look it was definitely coming from the camouflaged sphere outside out valseir now and another burst this time from above high above valseir pushed fassin away the bowl smoke get out fassin sent pushing the old dweller towards the access port in the top of the diamond bubble box outside the little sphere was rushing towards them fassin got underneath valseir and forced him upwards fassin all right valseir started to rise under his own power entering the vertical access tube the little sphere burst through the diamond bubble shards spraying it came to a stop just inside the jagged hole still disguised just a blur in the air major taak it shouted this is general linosu of the shrievalty ocula this device is under the control of the nasqueron expeditionary force dont be alarmed were coming down to the voice cut off as the little sphere was pierced by a hairthin line of cerise light the noise resounded sharp and sudden round the diamond bubble enclosure debris flew from the tiny machine rattling against the far side of the private box fassin whirled to see hatherence dropping down round the side of the dzunda carapace silvered the laser beam had come from her the little spherical device dropped its disguise revealing itself as a mirrorfinish machine with stubby wings it had a tiny hole in one flank a much larger one on the far side producing smoke it rolled over in the air made a crackling noise then dropped to the transparent floor above him fassin was aware of valseir hesitating in the access tube slipstream wind whistled in through the hole in the diamond bubble the colonel swung quickly in towards them you all right major she signalled stopping immediately outside buffeted by the slipstream she tipped to look at the device lying rolling on the clear curved floor of the box shit she sent that looks like one of ours there was a white flash as though from everywhere at once blinding fassin for an instant as the light faded hatherence was already falling away tumbling like a dropped stone through the gas something moved faster than the gasclippers across the stormwall face carving in towards the blimper when the colonel had fallen twenty metres below the private box a line of searing yellowwhite light flicked into existence between the incoming machine and hatherences esuit which erupted in fire and blew apart the fastmoving device looked like a small gascraft or missile sharp and finned its exhaust flared bright as it powered round fassin looked down to see hatherence she was a dark ragged manta shape falling whirling downwards amongst the smoking debris of the destroyed esuit she seemed to twist in the air flicking round something glinting in a stubby tentacle a violet beam lanced towards the finned craft missing by a metre another white line from the machine speared the colonel obliterating her in a sunbright burst of light valseir had cleared the access tube fassin blasted up it like a shell up a gun barrel letting the pulse of down draught tear the diamond bubble box out in a convulsive explosion of wreckage that whipped away from the dzunda and followed the remains of the colonel and her esuit towards the storms concave base and the depths beyond valseir was waiting in the broad corridor above fassin what is going on how do we get off this thing he asked taking the old dweller by the hubarm and leading him towards the next vertical access do we really need to somethings attacking us valseir are you sure yes so how do we get off whats wrong with roting bit vulnerable i was thinking of a craft well im sure we can arrange a taxi or one of the blimpers own skiffs ill ask captain xessife no fassin said not captain xessife why not somebody had to put that drug bowl there they got to the vertical but valseir hesitated wait whats that noise fassin could hear a deep warbling sound coming from various directions that could be an alarm he indicated the tube above after you lets move they were halfway up the vertical to the central corridor when the dzunda lurched ohoh valseir said keep going when they got to the main concourse the alarm noise was louder dwellers were shouting at each other picking up dropped trays food and drugs and staring at some of the wallscreens fassin looked too oh fuck he said quietly the screens showed confused pictures of the surroundings not all the cameras and screens now focusing on the still continuing gasclipper race one camera seemed to be following a slim finned craft the one which had attacked hatherence as it circled the blimper other screens showed ships dozens of dark ships dropping from the sky they were gascapable mercatoria spacecraft some as little as fifty metres long others three or four times that size sootblack ellipsoids with thick wings and sleek but rudimentary tailplanes and engine pods they were diving towards the blimper fleet two or three peeling off every vertical klick or so to circle guarding much higher above another snatched camera angle drifting out of focus then snapping clear more slick shapes gyrated above the high haze layer like scavengers over carrion another screens view spun then settled jerking on the spectating fleets accompanying dreadnought the puisiel whose turrets were swinging gun barrels elevating a yellow white beam flicked on and off boring straight through the war craft making it shudder and sending shock waves running along its outer fabric the beam hit the storm wall beyond at almost the same time raising a dark puff of vapour like a bruise quickly whipped away the gasclippers seemed to have disappeared what in all the gods farts is going on valseir asked they had come to a stop transfixed by the screens like most of the rest of the people in the concourse the puisiels turrets and guns continued to swing round for a moment then came to rest seemingly pointing in random directions oh dont fassin said the dreadnoughts guns flashed gouting fire and smoke smaller shapes dropped away from it at the same time half obscured by the wreathing broadside smoke clouds and then pulsed fire and smoke from their rears and started curving up and out towards the dropping spacecraft screens blinked the dark descending spacecraft glittered with light midway between the puisiel and the scatter of black ships piercing white lines ended in sudden detonations filling the gas above and around the spectating fleet with black bursts of smoke a screen swung to show one turning spacecraft dropping trailing smoke dwellers started yelling trays food drugs and petchildren were sent flying carapace skins blazed naked signals of excitement and fury and whiffs of warlust filled the air as though a series of tiny scentgrenades had gone off along the concourse a black dot trailing a haze of exhaust sailed in towards the crippled spacecraft but was picked off from above in a blast of light then something still smaller and faster darted across the screen and hit the ship detonating inside and tearing it entirely in half the two torn sections flew down towards the depths dangled on elongating strings of smoke the other missiles were picked off even more easily swatted like slow insects fassin started pulling valseir away dwellers all around them howled and barked at the screens and started taking bets distant concussive thumps and longer roars sounded throughout the concourse bringing the longdelayed battle sounds to accompany the nearinstant visuals dark glitterings everywhere the dreadnought lit up all along its length speckled with fire the beams lanced it plunging on into the storm wall freckling bruises across the stir of dark gas about a third of a last broadside most of it aimed at where the fallen spaceship had been punched out from the puisiel a fraction of a second before the first beams hit the great vessel shook like a leaf in a storm then started to drop even as further rays riddled it a final beam less bright much broader punched through the whole central section folding the craft about its middle and sending it flowing and spiralling downwards a few tiny double discs drifted away from the stricken war craft and roted away or just fell some trailing smoke some were hit by further beams of light vanishing in miniature explosions valseir move fassin whispered in the sudden silence we have to get away just get to the outside they were almost level with a upaccess tube fassin nudged valseir towards it this way he didnt even know if they really should get away maybe they were still somehow safer here in the blimper at least closer to the outside they might have more choice valseir allowed himself to be pushed towards the slope of the access tube the lowest part of the fleet of dark ships was now almost level with the top of the spectating fleet howls started to fill the concourse fassin and valseir were being held back from the tube entrance by a stream of dwellers coming in the other direction fassin continued to push the old dweller though they both kept looking back at the screens one of the dark ships circled gradually closer to the storm wall near its closest approach a gasclipper came hurtling out of the dark curtain of whirling gas blade sails extended like a frozen gleaming explosion it rammed the dark warship amidships hammering into it and pushing the two craft across the sky in a single tangled flailing mass still locked in their terrible embrace the two craft started to fall away with everything else heading for the foot of the storms great dark well and the hot crush of gas beneath more screams and barks of joy echoed round the concourse another camera another screen a section of the stormwall was bulging dark gas streaming around some huge rounded cone forcing its way through the storm as though it wasnt there a huge dreadnought flowed out of the storm trailing streamers of gas like vast banners shrieks of encouragement and great airquaking cheers resounded down the wide tunnel of the concourse making it resonate like a vast organ pipe the new dreadnought silvered in an instant white beams scattering off it as it flew into the clear gas heart of the storms colossal eye fuck me fassin heard himself say they were waiting for them the silver dreadnought powered straight towards the fleet of dark ships which after starting to close in on the spectating fleet were now swinging and swivelling to reconfigure and face the new threat the dreadnought raced forward fire bright around its propellerless tail guns firing and flashing its silvery skin reflecting sky storm and dark depths sparkled with jagged scintillations bouncing beams off in random directions like bright thrown spines two more of the dark ships detonated and fell sending the dweller screams in the concourse and the bets towards even wilder heights the dreadnought tore onwards shaking under the weight of fire falling upon it a missile from the fleet of mercatoria ships slashed across the view was missed by a fan of interceptor fire from the dreadnought and slammed into it there was just the hint of the start of an explosion bursting the dreadnought apart as though tearing open the wrapping round a piece of star then the screen went utterly white before hazing out completely blank lights in the concourse flickered and went out came back then faded again the warbling sound there but effectively unheard all this time cut off its absence in the sudden silence like a hearing loss the dzunda quivered like a struck animal other screens wavered went black filled with static some screens now providing the only light in the concourse remained working gradually more light filled the long tube as low emergency lighting strobed on caught and held a low muttering sound of dweller trepidation and resentment started to build one camera swung to show the huge rolling mushroom cloud filling the space where the dreadnought had been a few tiny pieces of wreckage fell far away thin claws from a tumorously bloated fist the dark ships started to close in again on the spectator fleet currently composed of vessels commanded by two sorts of captains those who thought it best to clump together and those who regarded scattering and even taking their chances with the storm winds as the safer bet the stampede of dwellers from the access tube which fassin was trying to push valseir towards was slowly forcing the two of them back into the centre of the concourse more people were flooding into the wide space from every other access point somebody was screaming look look one distant screen image was suddenly repeated across several more at first it looked like a replay of the entrance of the first dreadnought the great nose bulging out through the curtain of streaming cloud dragging gas like long flags of war then the view pulled back and the screen showed the storm wall bulging in another place then another and another and another until a whole vertical forest of the great ships was visible hurtling out of the storm and towards the great column of black circling spacecraft hanging like a giant pendulum over the spectating fleet the dzunda shook rippled and screamed like something alive as the shock wave of the earlier nuclear explosion seemed to pick it up and rattle it dwellers swung this way and that across the concourse banging into each other walls floor and ceiling filling the gas with oaths and debris another pair of screens cut out but enough remained to show the closing fleet of mercurycoloured dreadnoughts livid with fire outgoing and incoming lasers sheened off fans of interceptor projectiles and beams combed the gas and sundered darting twisting missiles two more of the dark ships then a third exploded or crumpled and started to fall or spiral down but two more of the giant dreadnoughts disappeared in massive screenhazing detonations a couple more dreadnoughts were suddenly caught in a fiercely bright beam from immediately above from out of the clear yellow sky the beam fell between them making each massive ship wobble as if stumbling in the gas then it split into two parallel shafts each violet rod narrowing in an instant and chopping through its targeted dreadnought like an axe through a neck the concourse half dark filled with wild scents and the frenzied bellowing of dwellers unsure whether to wail laments or shout huzzahs lit by the spastic spasming light of the battle views swinging wildly across the screens achieved a sort of chaotic transcendence as very loud but defiantly soothingsounding music started to play product of some confused automatic guestmanagement system waking to insanity and trying to spread tranquillity what fassin heard a nearby dweller say quite quietly but distinctly through the pandemonium the fuck is that another dark mercatorial ship another silver dreadnought ripped to shreds and blossoming in nuclear fire respectively another pair of dreadnoughts shaking in the first beamfall of the violet ray flicking from on high and on the screen opposite looking downwards into the wide bowl of the storms dead heart a huge darkly redglowing globe was rising from the sump gases of the storm floor dragging a great flute of gas after it like some absurdly steady fireball it was kilometres across and striated banded like a miniature gasgiant so that for one crazed instant fassin thought he was watching the palace of the hierchon ormilla floating smoothly upwards into the fray a crumpled scrap falling towards this apparition a ruined and smoking mercatoria spacecraft appeared to lend a scale to the huge sphere seeming to be about to fall just behind it making the quickly rising globe three or four klicks across the wrecked ship fell in front instead and upped that ready estimate by a factor of two a couple of filamentthin yellowwhite beams suddenly joined with the massive globe and seemed to sink into it without effect the violet beam from high above swung onto it spreading briefly as though to measure the full seven or eight kilometres of its diameter before starting to narrow a pattern of black dots appeared on the surface of the giant globe the dzunda shook again and again as further blast waves crashed into it fassin stared at the great rising sphere even as dwellers on either side thudded into him and he lost his hold on valseir there were maybe fifty or so of the black spots spread as though randomly across the upper hemisphere of the huge globe one appeared to be in the centre of the rapidly narrowing focusing violet beam just as that ray grew too bright to see the ebony dot at its centre it seemed to pulse and spread then it disappeared just as each spot suddenly became the plinth for an intensely bright thin column of pure white light the beams lasted for an eyeblink disappearing almost as soon as theyd been produced only their image lasting burned into any naked eyes and insufficiently buffered cameras trained on them silence even as another manic convulsion shook the dzunda making the whole concourse ripple and creak more screens went out the loud soothing music cut off two remaining screens nearby showed the dark ships whole squadrons of them entire flocks of them reduced for most of their length to sparkling windblown ash only the long needle noses and tailed finned rears remaining intact to fall like meteors unreeling scrawny trails of smoke into the storms tenebrous depths the nearest screen showed the camera swinging across the sky searching for an intact mercatoria ship only to find further drifts of smoke new clouds of ash already drifting on the wind the other screens view pivoted to the sky where something glowing yellow was fading and disappearing as it cooled at first still keeping station with the scene directly beneath then starting to drift away to the east the huge sphere was still rising though slowing now coming gradually level with the remains of the spectating fleet the remaining two dozen or so mirrorfinish dreadnoughts were decelerating heavingto on one side of the clumped and scattered ships a bellowing roar of utter and unexpected victory built quickly in every dweller throat along the length of the concourse swelling to a clanging thunderous cacophony of mindsplitting thoughtwarping sound then a series of crashing titanic shock waves pummelled the dzunda like a gale whipping a flag a barrage of noise like a troop of titans clapping entirely drowned out the hollering dwellers all the screens went dark the blimper dzunda lurched for one last time then started to fall out of the sky those dwellers not already heading swiftly for the exits immediately began to do so the ones near fassin sweeping him along with them up the access tube hed been trying to head for originally out via a wide funnel port into a viewing gallery through its massively shattered diamond roof and out into the bruised and battered skies of nasqueron you mean some of your ridiculous fucking fairy stories about secret ships and hyperweapons are actually true fassin said well ysul said looking round so it would appear they were somewhere inside the isaut the enormous spherical ship which had destroyed almost the entire mercatorial fleet spacebased commandandcontrol plus heavyweaponry bombardment backup included in the space of about half a second the isaut was something called a planetary protector deniable not that fassin or apparently anybody else rescued from the destroyed and damaged ships of the spectating fleet had ever heard of such a thing that as ysul had pointed out was a pretty unarguably convincing brand of deniability there had of course been rumours and myths concerning secret dweller martial capability and the general lack of wisdom of getting into a fight with such an ancient and widespread species for as long as people could remember but as most of these myths and rumours seemed to be spread by the dwellers themselves as a rule nobody ever really took them seriously the dwellers spent so much time huffing and puffing and telling people how completely wonderful and brilliant they were and yet seemed so selfobsessed so inwardlooking and so careless of their distant fellows so unconnected not just with the rest of the civilised galaxy but with their own vastly scattered diaspora they were inevitably dismissed as vainglorious fantasists and their vaunted ships and weapons at best a sort of folk memory of earlier magnificence long lost entirely eclipsed even now having just seen the results of the isauts intervention with his own eyes or at least through the little gascrafts sensors fassin could not entirely believe what hed witnessed well this is a strange place to be valseir said looking about the spherical space he ysul and fassin had been shown to they had rendezvoused quite quickly in the general gasborne confusion of survivors from the dzunda fassins arrrowheadshaped craft though smaller than all the surrounding dwellers was a sufficiently different shape for valseir and ysul to spot him quite without difficulty and head in his direction why is everybody else giving me such a wide berth fassin had asked when theyd each drifted up to him in the afterbattle calmness it was true all the other dweller survivors were keeping a good fifty metres or so away from him worried youre going to be a target ysul had said checking his various pockets and pouches to see what he might have lost in the excitement around them various long smoky columns were drifting in the breeze like anaemic stalks rooted in the dark storm base far below and great dumbbellshaped clouds all that was left of the nuclear explosions were twisting and slowly tearing apart their round barely rolling heads still climbing into higher and higher levels of atmosphere being caught in differential wind streams and casting vast hazy shadows across the againquiet skies of the storms eye hovering to one side the vast banded sphere which had risen from the depths floated like a miniature planet caught in the eye of the great storm to one side in the storm wall the gasclipper fleet seemed to be trying to regroup tumbling out of the sinking dzunda with the rest of the survivors only a lifelong exposure to dweller insouciance both congenital and feigned had prevented fassin gasping in disbelief at the sound of various people around him quite seriously discussing whether the gasclipper race would just continue be restarted or declared void and passing opinions regarding the status of already existing bets in the light of this suite of likely choices the less damaged spectating and other craft were picking up the various freefloating dwellers ambulance skiffs from the surviving craft in the silver dreadnought fleet and hospital vessels from the nearest port facilities were rescuing the more seriously injured and burned individuals fassin had indeed been targeted but not by weaponry a trio of skiffs had emerged from the giant sphere and made straight for the little group formed by fassin and his two dweller friends theyd been taken aboard and the skiffs returned immediately to the enormous globe ignoring the outraged yells of the dwellers who until moments before had been studiously avoiding fassin the lead skiff crewed by a jolly pair of remarkably oldlooking dwellers they didnt volunteer their names ranks or ages but they each looked at least as old as jundriance had deposited them somewhere deep inside the giant spherical craft way down a dark tunnel into a broad sphere of reception space complete with washing facilities and what ysul had taken one look at and sniffily dismissed as a snackateria before theyd left again in their skiff it had been one of these unnamed dwellers who in response to a question of fassins had told them the name and category of the great craft theyd been brought inside fassin had warned him that his gascraft had been in contact with mercatoria nanotech and he might be contaminated which did not surprise or alarm anybody aboard as much as hed been expecting the skiffs crew scanned the little gascraft and told him well he wasnt contaminated any more where is your little friend the very reverend colonel ysul asked fassin making a show of looking around the reception space she jumped out of her seat and raced off just before all the fun started shes dead fassin told him dead ysul rolled back but she seemed so well armed she shot what turned out to be a mercatorial device fassin said one of the first of their craft on the scene seemed to assume this meant she was a hostile and wasted her oh ysul said sounding downcast that was the mercatoria was it not these disconnected people you sure im fairly sure fassin said damn ysul said sounding annoyed might sort of look like ive lost a bet in that case wonder how i can get out of it he floated off looking deep in thought fassin turned to valseir you sure youre all right he asked the old dweller had looked a little shaken when theyd rendezvoused in the gas above the sinking blimper though apart from a few carapace abrasions picked up in the welter of people rushing to escape the sinking ship he was uninjured i am fine fassin he told the human and you you have lost your colonel friend i heard fassin had a sudden reprise of his last image of hatherence that dark manta shape twisting in the air to a dweller she would have looked like one of their young firing a hand weapon at the craft that had ripped her out of her esuit then dying in the returning splash of fire im getting used to anybody who gets close to me dying violently he said hmm i consider myself warned valseir said she was my superior valseir fassin told him she was my bodyguard but she was also my guard in another sense id be surprised if she hadnt been given orders to kill me if the relevant circumstances arose do you think she would have carried out those orders fassin hesitated suddenly feeling bad about what hed just said even though he still thought it was the truth it was as though hed insulted hatherences memory he looked away and said well well never know now will we a door in the centre of the ceiling swung back they all looked up two dwellers entered fassin recognised one of them as setstyin the selfconfessed influence pedlar hed talked to by phone the evening hed slipped away from ysuls house in hauskip city the other dweller looked very old indeed dark and small barely five metres in diameter and dressed in highcoverage clothes that probably concealed only a few remaining natural limbs and perhaps some prosthetics seer fassin taak setstyin said rollnodding towards him then he greeted ysul and lastly valseir as the most senior of the three valseir came last and got an even more respectful bow ysul valseir allow me to introduce the sagecuspianchospe drunisine executive commander of this craft the planetary protector deniable isaut a pleasure said the dark dweller in a crisp drysounding voice and for us an honour ysul said brushing fassin out of the way to present himself to the fore and execute an extravagantly complete bow if i may say so our pleasure prechild valseir halfagreed also rollbowing less completely but with more dignity good to see you setstyin fassin said and pleased to meet you sir he told the older dweller drunisine was by far the oldest and most senior dweller fassin had ever encountered as a dweller surviving the perils of childhood first obviously rose through adolescence youth and adulthood to attain the life stages called prime and then cuspian and then sage what they were eventually aiming for destined for if they lived that long was to reach childhood the state of utter doneeverythingness that was the absolute zenith of all dweller existence the stage immediately before this culmination was the one which drunisine had reached chospe prechild there was every chance that drunisine was over two billion years old my name is setstyin the other dweller said coming to rest near the centre of the spherical room with the sage and looking round at the others i am a friend of seer taaks here you are all sufficiently recovered andor rested i hope because we need to talk they agreed they were capable of talk setstyin waved and hammock seats descended from a ring round the ceiling door which then closed they settled in seer taak the ancient dweller said we will need to ensure that all record of the battle just finished is wiped from the memories of that little craft you inhabit i understand fassin said he thought about that deniable he called up everything hed recorded of the battle in the storms eye and fulldeleted it he called up a lot of other stored memories and got rid of those too its done he said we will need to check setstyin told him sounding apologetic feel free fassin said i take it were not supposed to say anything about what happened out there or about this thing say what you like young sir drunisine told him our concern is with hard evidence all surviving nondweller surveillance systems around nasqueron have been removed setstyin said talking to fassin all the transgressing ships which had lineofsight to the proceedings have already been destroyed the remains of the mercatorial fleet are being pursued and dispatched they are being hunted down like dogs seer taak drunisine said looking straight at him and using the anglish word harried systems jammed comms disrupted fates sealed all so that no direct evidence of this craft or its capabilities even that garnered secondhand can escape i might add that your own summary annihilation was contemplated i am grateful to have been made an exception fassin said are none of the ships which were above nasqueron to be allowed to escape none the ancient dweller said those who start wars have to accept the consequences ysul said rumbling sententiously and after that fassin asked specify please is this the start of a war with the mercatoria at least the part within ulubis i dont imagine so drunisine said sounding as though this was the first time the thought had occurred not unless they choose to invade us again do you think they will fassin taak fassin had the awful feeling that given the dwellers irredeemably dismissive approach to intelligence what he said next might well constitute the single most germane piece of information on the matter that the dwellers would have to work with and base their decisions on no i dont i think theyll be sufficiently horrified at the extent of their losses today to think twice about risking any further craft certainly as long as they have the prospect of invasion to look forward to if the invasion fails or the system is finally recaptured then there might be some attempt to find out what happened and no doubt some people will argue that there should be some form of reprisal though in the shorter term from what little ive heard of the epiphany disconnect theres a chance they might want to ah transgress too he looked at drunisine and setstyin who remained silent though im sure youll be ready for them more silence in fact if the ulubis mercatoria work out whats happened here and realise you dont regard this as the start of a war they might even want to suggest that you and they unite to resist the epiphany disconnect forces why would we wish to do that drunisine asked flatly it felt like it had been a long and tiring day fassin didnt really have the energy to start trying to explain from a creature as old and experienced as drunisine the question was probably rhetorical anyway never mind fassin said act as though nothings happened signal glantine and make some helpful suggestions regarding the reestablishment of a new seer shared facility thats more or less what we were going to do anyway setstyin said sounding amused fassin signalled polite mirth in return he was still struggling to work out what this enormous fleetsdestroyedinaneyeblink craft really meant who was responsible for this colossal machine what sort of previously unknown societal structures and prodigious manufacturing capacity within dweller civilisation could conjure up something this awesome was it a oneoff was it unique to nasqueron dear grief was it part of a fleet did this mean that all the dweller claims about secret ships and hyperweapons were true could the nasqueron dwellers just swat the e discon out of the sky if they so desired saving ulubis from invasion could they feasibly take on the mercatoria if they could be bothered did any of this mean that the dweller list was now more likely to be genuine rather than some monstrous waste of time or just a joke how hed have liked to have had some time alone with setstyin before this meeting to find out what had happened since theyd talked last hed have to ask some of these questions anyway given half a chance we come then drunisine said to the question of why the ulubis mercatoria disconnect thought it might be a wise or profitable idea to enter nasqueron in such a manner and in such numbers in the first place any ideas anybody the ancient dweller looked round at all of them i think it might have something to do with me fassin admitted you seer taak drunisine asked ive been here attempting to track down some information and you needed the help of a small war fleet to extract it no however they might have thought i was in danger from whom i dont know so we are talking about information that the mercatoria might consider momentous enough to start a war for when they are already facing an invasion in the next few months or years this must be information of some importance perhaps we can help what is it thank you however i think i may finally be close to finding it ah valseir said about that what fassin asked him all that stuff about the folder and the safekeep box and taking it personally to chimilinith of deilte yes not entirely true not entirely not entirely so how much of it was true valseir rocked back a fraction seemingly thinking patterns of surprise crossed his signal skin actually most of it he said and the part that wasnt fassin asked patiently there was no folder in the safekeep box so chimilinith hasnt got the information correct i see i am still waiting for enlightenment regarding the exact nature of this exemplary if shy information drunisine said frostily looking at valseir oh shit fassin thought if valseir tells them what it is and it really exists they might just kill us all possibly the same thought had occurred to valseir it allegedly involves a method for travelling faster than light he told the ancient commander setstyins carapace flashed hilarity quickly damped drunisine looked about as thoroughly unimpressed as it was possible for an elderly dweller to look what he said an ancient addition to a still more ancient book which seer taak here traded over two hundred years ago during a delve as the quick call these things makes mention of a method of achieving ftl travel without recourse to adjutage and cannula valseir said using what fassin recognised as the dweller terms for portals and wormholes fassin thought and sincerely hoped that valseir had put just the right amount of apology and wry amusement into his voice seer taak has been sent here to try to find the details of this ah unlikely technology indeed drunisine said looking at fassin algebra he blurted algebra drunisine asked the data looks like a piece of algebra apparently fassin said it defines some sort of warping device a way of bending space conventional to start with but using this technique to exceed light speed fassin made a gesture of resignation he let embarrassment patterns show on his arrowheads skin iwas seconded without any real choice into a paramilitary part of the mercatoria and ordered to undertake this mission i am as sceptical as i imagine you are sir regarding the likelihood of it coming to a successful conclusion drunisine let the most formal amusement pattern show on his skin oh i doubt that you are seer taak whats going on i was about to ask you the same question setstyin told fassin shall we trade all right but i asked first what exactly do you want to know they were still in the reception sphere inside the giant globe commander drunisine had left two adult medical orderlies were dealing with the few small injuries that ysul and valseir had picked up during the battle what is this thing fassin asked gesturing to indicate the whole ship where did it come from who made it who controls it how many are there in nasqueron id have thought the title said it all setstyin said its a machine to protect the planet from willed aggression of a certain technical type and sophistication its not a spacecraft if thats what you mean its limited to inatmosphere it came from the depths where stuff like this is usually stored we made it i mean dwellers did probably a few billion years ago id have to check its controlled by people in the control centre wholl be dwellers with military experience whove simtrained for this sort of device specifically as to numbers i wouldnt know probably not the sort of information ones meant to share really no offence fass but in the end youre not actually one of us we have to assume your loyalties lie elsewhere built billions of years ago can you still ah that would count as a followup question setstyin said chiding i think its my turn first fassin sighed all right are you really looking for this warpdrive ftl technology data you do realise it doesnt exist dont you its data that the mercatoria believe might give them a better chance of winning the fight against the e discon they are desperate theyll try anything and i have my orders no matter what i might think about the whole thing of course i know independent ftl drives dont exist will you still obey these orders given the chance fassin thought about aun liss about the people hed known in hab about all the other people hed ever known throughout ulubis system over the years yes he said why do you obey these orders setstyin sounded genuinely puzzled your family and seer sept colleagues are almost all dead your immediate military superior was killed in the recent battle and there is nobody nearby now to take her place its complicated fassin told setstyin perhaps its duty or a guilty conscience or just the desire to be doing something can you still make more of these planetary protection machines no idea setstyin admitted dont see why not though id suggest asking somebody who might know but even if the true answer was no wed be bound to say yes wouldnt we was it my call to you that set all this in motion youre getting a lot of free questions arent you however yes it did though i suspect that watching dozens of recently modified gascapable warcraft suddenly parking themselves in orbit around us might have started a few alarm bells ringing amongst us even without your timely warning still were grateful i dont think im entirely out of formation in saying that there is a feeling we probably owe you a favour and if the mercatoria ever finds out fassin said ill be executed as a traitor well we wont tell if you dont setstyin said perfectly seriously deal fassin said unconvinced the great spherical craft isaut floated deep within a vast cloud of streaming gas moving swiftly seeming not to it had started to submerge into the storms curdled floor of slowly swirling gas almost as soon as fassin and the others had been brought aboard sinking sidling rising slightly again it had entered into the zone weather band quickly assumed its speed and was now in the late evening that was becoming night half a thousand kilometres away from the storm where the battle had taken place and adding another three hundred kilometres to that value with every passing hour fassin ysul valseir and setstyin floated over a narrow platform set at the great vessels equator near the body of colonel hatherence a weak light and weaker breeze lent an appropriate atmosphere of quiet gloom to the scene the colonels torn burned body had been discovered along with hundreds of others floating at the level at which dweller bodies usually came to rest hers had come to rest a little higher than the others as would a childs left to themselves dweller bodies degassed and gained density and abandoned to the atmosphere would eventually disappear completely into the depths the respectful convention however was either to keep a dead relative in a special ceremonial chamber at home and let them decay until their density would ensure a swift passage into the liquid hydrogen far beneath or if time was pressing to weight the body and consign it to the depths that way hatherence had no family here there was not even anybody of her own species in all nasqueron and so as at least a fellow alien fassin had been declared responsible for her remains hed agreed a swift dispatch to the depths was preferable to keeping her body and handing it back to the shrievalty or any family she might still have in ulubis system he wasnt even sure why he felt that way but he did there was no particular veneration of the remains of the dead in the way of the truth and as far as he knew no special meaning amongst oerileithe in having their dead returned from afar but even if there had been hed have wanted something like this for the dwellers it was probably just administrative convenience even tidiness to dispose of her now like this for him it was something more fassin looked down at the alien body thin and dark something between a manta and a giant starfish lying in its coffin of meteorite iron iron had always been and sentimentally ceremonially still was a semiprecious metal for dwellers that they were burying hatherence like this was something of an honour he supposed in the fading light her ragged remains dark anyway then burned by the beam which had killed her looked like scraps of shadow fassin felt tears in his real eyes inside the shockgel inside the little gascraft that was his own tiny lifecoffin and knew that some deep nearanimal part of him was mourning not so much the fallen oculan colonel as all the people he knew whom hed lost recently lost without seeing them one last time even in death lost without fully being able to believe that he really had lost them because it had all happened so far away with so much in between them and him to stop him returning to pay any sort of respects to them lost in his intellect but not his emotions because even now some part of him refused to believe he would never see all those lost ones again i confess setstyin said i have no idea what form of words one ought to use on such occasions seer taak do you amongst some ahumans there is a saying that we come from and go to nothing a lack like shadow that throws the sum of life into bright relief and with the rhumans something about dust to ashes do you think she would have minded being treated as a dweller setstyin asked no fassin said i dont think she would have minded i think she would have felt honoured here here ysul muttered valseir gave a small formal bow well colonel hatherence setstyin said with what sounded like a sigh as he looked down at the body lying in the coffin you ascended to the age and rank of mercatorial colonel which is a very considerable achievement for your kind we think you lived well and we know you died well you died with many others but in the end we all die alone you died more alone than others amongst people like you but alien to you and far from your home and family you fell and were found and now we send you down again further into those depths to join all the revered dead on the surface of rock around the core he looked at fassin seer taak would you like to say anything fassin tried to think of something in the end he just said i believe colonel hatherence was a good person she was certainly a brave one i only knew her for less than a hundred days and she was always my military superior but i came to like her and think of her as a friend she died trying to protect me ill always honour her memory he signalled that he could think of nothing else setstyin rollnodded and indicated the open coffin lid fassin went forward and used a manipulator to close the caskets iron hatch then he lowered a little more and together he and setstyin took one edge of the bier that the coffin lay on they raised it letting the heavy container slide silently off over the edge of the balcony and down into the next bruisedark layer of clouds far below they all floated over the edge and waited until the coffin disappeared a tiny black speck vanishing into the darkly purple wastes greatcousin of mine diving deep got hit by one of those once ysul said thoughtfully never knew what hit him stone dead the others were looking at him he shrugged well its true valseir found fassin in a gallery looking out at the deep night stream of gas rushing quietly in infrared as the isaut powered its way to who knew where fassin valseir are we free to leave yet not that ive heard not yet they watched the night flow round them together for a while fassin had spent time earlier looking at reports on the storm battle from both sides the dwellers had highselectivity visuals which made it look like the dreadnoughts had won the day not the isaut the little hed got from the mercatorias nets just gave dark hints that an entire fleet was missing and included no visuals at all unseen was pretty much unheardof it appeared that everybody had instantly assumed there was some vast coverup going on both sides were downplaying like crazy implying that some terrible misunderstanding had taken place and theyd both suffered appallingly heavy losses which was when fassin thought about it somewhere between half and threequarters true and hence closer to reality than might have been expected in the circumstances so what did happen to this folder fassin asked if there was a folder there was and is a folder fassin valseir told him iheld on to it for a long time but eventually twentyone twentythree years ago i gave it to my colleague and good friend leisicrofe he was departing on a research trip has he returned no when will he should he return he wont have the data where will it be wherever he left it i dont know how do i find your friend leisicrofe youll have to follow him that will not be so easy you will need help i have ysul hes always arranged you will need rather more than he can provide fassin looked at the old dweller offplanet is that what you mean somewhat valseir said not looking at him gazing out at the onward surge of night then who should i approach for this help ive already taken the liberty you have thats very kind valseir was silent for a while then said none of this is about kindness fassin he turned to look directly at the arrowhead nobody in their right mind would ever want to be involved with something as momentous as this if the slightest part of what youre looking for has any basis in reality it could change everything for all of us i am dweller my species has made a good long if selfish life for itself spread everywhere amongst the stars we do not appreciate change on the scale we are here talking about im not sure that any species would some of us will do anything to avoid such change to keep things just as they are you have to realise fassin we are not a monoculture we are not at all perfectly homogenised we are differentiated in ways that even now after all your exposure to us you can scarcely begin to comprehend there are things within our own worlds almost entirely hidden from most of us and there are deep and profound differences of opinion between factions amongst us just as there are between the quick factions thought fassin valseir went on not all of us are quite so studiedly indifferent to events taking place within the greater galaxy as we generally contrive to appear there are those of us who without ever wanting to know the full details of your mission in fact knowing that theyd be unable to square knowledge of its substance with their species loyalty would help you nevertheless others others would kill you instantly if they even began to guess what it was youre looking for the old dweller floated over came close to a kisswhisper as he said and believe it or not fassin taak drunisine is of the former camp while your friend setstyin is of the latter fassin pulled away to look at the old dweller who added truly after a few more moments fassin asked when will i be able to follow your friend leisicrofe i think youll know one way or the other before the night is out and if we both dont at least begin to follow leisicrofe we may both follow your colonel hatherence fassin thought this sounded a little melodramatic truly he asked signalling amusement oh truly fassin valseir said signalling nothing let me repeat none of this is about kindness saluus kehar was not happy he had his own people in certain places his own ways of finding things out his own secure and reliable channels of intelligence quite independent of the media and the official agencies you didnt become and stay a major military supplier unless you did and he knew about as well as anybody did what had happened during the disastrous nasqueron raid and it was simply unjust to blame him or his firm for one thing theyd been betrayed or their intelligence or signals had been compromised or at the very least theyd been outthought by dwellers and because of that failing which was unquestionably nothing to do with him theyd been ambushed and outoutnumbered dozens of those heretofore unfuckingheardof superdreadnought ships had turned up when the incursionary force had been expecting no more than a handful at most of the standard ones the models without the reactive mirror armour the plasma engines and the wideband lasers plus the dwellers had simply done a very good job of lying over the years years aeons presenting themselves as hopeless bumblers and technological incompetents when in fact even if they couldnt build anything very impressive from scratch any more they still had access to weaponry of serious lethality the military had fucked up it didnt matter how good the tool was how clever the craftsman had been how wellmade the weapon was if the user dropped it didnt switch it on or just didnt know how to use it properly all that good work went for nothing theyd lost all the ships all of them every single damn one either on the raid or supporting it from space immediately above even a few of the ships not involved at all those standing guard round third fury while the recovery and construction teams worked had been targeted and annihilated by some sort of chargedparticlebeam weapon with two craft on the far side of the moon each chased by some type of hypervelocity missile and blown to smithereens as well unwilling to accept that theyd made a complete mess of the operation the military had decided it mustnt be their fault kehar heavy industries must be to blame there must to quote an ancient saying be something wrong with our bloody ships the sheer completeness of the catastrophe and the frustrating lack of detail regarding exactly what had gone wrong actually made it easier to blame the tool rather than the workman all the ships had been made gascapable by saluuss shipyards all had been lost on their first mission using their new abilities so according to that special logic only the military mind seemed to appreciate it must be a problem with the process of making them capable of working in an atmosphere that was responsible never mind that the battlecruiser acting as command and control for the whole operation and both the heavyarmour battery monitors had been blasted to atoms just as effortlessly as the ships working in the planets clouds even though theyd never been gascapabled and were still in space at the time that little detail somehow got rolled up into greater disaster and conveniently forgotten about in the hysteria so now theyd lost fassin and theyd lost their lead to this dweller list thing worse they had a serious intelligence problem because basically theyd been duped the old dweller valseir must have suspected something or been tipped off they knew this for the simple reason that the information hed provided almost the last data that had got relayed back to the top brass on sepekte before everything went haywire had proved when checked later to be a lie the dweller hed told fassin to look for in deilte city didnt exist for the sake of this theyd lost over seventy firstrate warships for no gain whatsoever ships they would seriously miss when the beyonderstarveling invasion hit home for real and theyd thoroughly antagonised the dwellers whod never been people it was advisable to get on the wrong side of even before theyd suddenly shown they still packed the kind of punch that could humiliate a mercatorial fleet as military fuckups went it was a manyfaceted gem a work of genius a grapeshot multistage clusterwarhead fractalmunition regenerativeweaponsystem of a fuckup in fact it was only that last item on the long list of calamitous consequences dealing with the dwellers subsequent actions and signals that had worked out less badly than it might have finally something positive saluus was in a meeting he hated meetings they were an entirely vital part of being an industrialist indeed of being a businessman in any sort of organisation but he still hated them hed learned partly at his fathers side to get good at meetings working people and information before during and after them but even when they were short and decided important stuff they felt like a waste of time and they were rarely short and rarely decided important stuff this one wasnt even his meeting unusually he wasnt in control hed been summoned summoned hed been brought before them that caught the mood better he far preferred conference calls holo meetings they tended to be shorter though not always if you had one where everybody was somewhere they felt really comfortable they could go on for ever too and they were easier to control easier to dismiss basically but there seemed to be this distribution curve of meeting reality people at the bottom of the organisational pile had lots of real allsatdowntogether meetings often saluus had long suspected because they had nothing useful to do and so had the time to spare and the need to seem important that meetings could provide those in the middle and towards the top had more and more holo meetings because it was just more timeefficient and the people they needed to meet with were of similarly high stature with their own time problems and often far away but then this was the slightly weird bit as you got to the very highest levels the proportion of facetoface meetings started to rise again maybe because it was a sign of how much youd been able to delegate maybe because it was a way of imposing your authority on those in the middle and uppermiddle ranks beneath you maybe because the things being discussed at highlevel meetings were so important that you needed the very last nuance of physicality they provided over a holo conference to be sure that you were working with all the relevant information including whether somebody was sweating or had a nervous tic this was the sort of stuff a good holo would show up of course though equally the sort of stuff a good pretransmission imageediting camera would smooth away in theory somebody in a conference call could be sitting there sweating a river and jumping like theyd been electrocuted but if they had decent realtime imageediting facilities they could look the perfect epitome of unruffled cucumberchill though there was stuff you could do in reality too of course for his thirteenth birthday saluuss father had given his son a surprise party and later a surprise present in the shape of a visit to a finishing clinic where over the course of a long and not entirely painfree month they fixed his teeth widened his eyes and altered their colour saluus had been wombsculpted for the appearance hed had but hey a father could change his mind more to the point they made him much less fidgety upped his capacity to concentrate and gave him control over his sweat glands pheromone output and galvanic skin response the last three not strictly legal but then the clinic was owned by a subsidiary of kehar heavy industries all good for giving one an edge in meetings discussions and even informal gettogethers and usefully applicable to the art of seduction too where ones blatant proximity to and control over astounding quantities of cash had somehow failed to have the desired effect this was a meeting of the emergency war cabinet a highlevel topbrass gettogether in a klicksdeep commandbunker complex beneath one of a handful of discreetly wellguarded mansions dotted round the outskirts of greater borquille state a highlevel topbrass gettogether minus the hierchon ormilla himself however he was patently too grand to attend a mere meeting even of something as important as the emergency war cabinet even when the fate of the system was in even greater jeopardy than it had been before the disastrous decision to go mobhanded into the atmosphere of nasqueron the instant they thought they had a firm lead to the anyway probably mythical dweller list and why did meetings always make his mind wander and specifically make it wander towards wander towards head straight for sex he looked at women he was attending meetings with and found it very hard not to imagine them naked this happened when they werent especially attractive but was inevitable and often vivid if they were even slightly goodlooking something about being able to look at them for long periods when they were talking he suspected or just the urge to shuck off the whole civilised thing of being good little officers of the company and get back to being cave people again humping in the dirt first secretary heuypzlagger was wittering saluus was confident that he looked like he was hanging on the first secretarys every word and that his shortterm memory would snick him back in should he need to return his full attention to proceedings if and when anything else of genuine import stumbled into view but in the meantime having already gleaned as much as he felt he was likely to regarding the real state of things from the body language and general demeanour of his fellow meeters he felt free to let his mind wander he glanced at colonel somjomion who was the only woman at this meeting she didnt tend to say very much so you didnt get too many opportunities to look straight at her not especially attractive though he was hed been telling himself recently starting to appreciate women rather than girls and see past the more obvious sexual characteristics there was certainly something especially exciting about the idea of undressing a woman in uniform but hed long since been there and done that and had the screenage to prove it he thought of his latest lover instead saluus thought of her last night this morning he thought of her the night theyd first met first slept together he quickly got an almost painfully hard erection theyd sculpted him to have control over that at the finishing clinic as well but he usually just let things rise and fall of their own accord down there unless either the presence or the absence was going to be socially embarrassing anyway hed long since accepted that maybe it was a way of getting back at dear old dad for forcing all this amendment stuff on him in the first place however useful it had proved he still hated meetings saluus supposed things had gone reasonably well for him in this one so far considering hed had to agree to a full inquiry into the gascapabling of the ships theyd modified as part of the general investigation into what had gone wrong but even allowing for the implied insult and the waste of time just when they didnt need it that wasnt too terrible hed managed to deflect most of the criticism by getting the navarchy the guard and the shrievalty ocula representatives to compete for who was least to blame for the whole botchedraid thing that had worked well divide and conquer that wasnt difficult in the current system in fact it was set up for it he remembered asking his father about this back when saluus was still being tutored at home why the confusion of agencies why the plethora hed just discovered the word enjoyed using it of military and security and other organisations within the mercatoria just look at warships there were the guard they had warships the navarchy military they had warships the ambient squadrons they had warships the summed fleet obviously they had warships and then there were the engineers the propylaea the omnocracy the cessorian lustrals the shrievalty the shrievalty ocula and even the administrata they all had their own ships and each even had a few warships as well for important escort duties why so many why divide your forces the same went for security everybody seemed to have their own security service too wasnt this wasteful oh definitely his father had said but theres opportunity in waste and what some call waste others would call redundancy but do you really want to know what its all about of course he did divide and conquer even amongst your own competition also even amongst your own in fact especially amongst your own keep them all at each others throats keep them all watching each other keep them all wondering what the other lot might be up to make them compete for your attention and approval yes its wasteful looked at one way but its wise looked at another this is how the culmina keep everything under control young man this is how they rule us and it appears to work dont you think hmm saluus hadnt been sure at the time the sheer wastefulness of it all distressed him he was older and wiser now and more used to the way that things really worked being more important than the way they appeared to unless you were talking about public perception of course when it was the other way round but they really were facing a mortal and imminent threat here was it right to encourage division and enmity between people who and organisations which all needed to pull together if they were to defeat the threat they were faced with oh but fuck it there would always be competition armed services were designed to protect turf to engage with to prevail against of course theyd compete with each other and if that supposedly fucking enormous and ultimately powerful mercatoria fleet wasnt rushing towards them even now would not some of the people in ulubis maybe quite a lot of the people in ulubis be contemplating not resisting the beyonderstarveling invasion at all might they not instead be thinking about how they could come to an accommodation with those threatening invasion despite all the propaganda theyd been subject to secret polls and secret police reports indicated that a lot of ordinary people felt they might not be any worse off under the beyonder starveling forces some people in power would feel the same way especially if they were being told to sacrifice property and wealth and even risk their own lives in what might turn out to be a lost cause even some of those round this impressively large round table in this impressively large and cool and subtly lit boardroomresemblingmeetingchamber might have been tempted to think about ways to cope with the threatened invasion that didnt involve resistance to the last ship and soldier if it hadnt been for the oncoming mercatoria fleet saluus supposed they had to assume that the fleet really was on the way there were other possibilities and hed thought them all through and talked them all through with his own advisers and experts but ultimately they had to be dismissed whether the dweller list existed or not everybody appeared to be acting as though it did and that was all that mattered it was a bit like money all about trust about faith the value lay in what people believed not in anything intrinsic never mind after covering the latest intelligence and his own shocking remissness in not making the refitted ships invulnerable to alien hyperweapons the meeting was finally getting round to something useful back to grisly reality the main thing fleet admiral brimiaice told them the quaup commander was keen on main things and in the ends is that the dwellers dont seem to want to continue hostilities after their initial furious takenoprisoners attack and noquarter polishingoff of those whod got away the dwellers had just as suddenly gone back to their usual show of shucksus ineptitude claiming it had all been a terrible mistake and could they help with the third fury rebuild and thank fuck for that guardgeneral thovin said if they did wed have absolutely no chance facing the beyonderstarveling lot and the dwellers as well holy shit no chance no chance at all thovin was a dumpy barrel of a man dark and powerfullooking his voice was suitably gruff instead only almost no chance shrievalty colonel somjomion said with a thin smile we have every chance madam fleet admiral brimiaice thundered banging the table with one tubular armling his splendidly uniformed and decorated body like a welltailored airship the size of a small hippo rose in the air we need no defeatist talk here of all places we have seventy fewer ships than we had the shrievalty colonel reminded them without drama we still have the will brimiaice said thats the important point and we have plenty of ships and more being built all the time he looked at saluus who nodded and tried not to let his contempt show if they work muttered clerkregnant voriel the cessorian seemed to have a personal thing against saluus he had no idea why now weve dealt with all that first secretary heuypzlagger said quickly glancing at saluus if there are any problems with the ships construction im sure the inquiry will show them up we have to concentrate now on what else we can do saluus was getting bored now was as good a time as any an embassy he said he looked round them all thats what id like to suggest an embassy to the dwellers of nasqueron to secure peace make sure there are no more misunderstandings between us and them attempt to involve them in the defence of ulubis system and if possible acquire from them with their consent preferably some of the extremely impressive weaponry they appear to possess either in physical or theoretical form well heuypzlagger said shaking his head oh now our acquisitariat friend is a diplomat voriel observed expression poised between sneer and smile needing yet more supposedly gascapable ships to protect it no doubt brimiaice protested havent we got one already thovin asked colonel somjomion just looked at him eyes narrowed the meeting only seemed to last for ever finally it was over saluus met up with his new lover that evening at the watercolumn house on murla where hed first really looked at her in the true light of day and decided yes hed be interested it had been at brunch with his wife and her new girlfriend and fass and the segrette twins the day after their visit to the narcateria in boogeytown the rushwing sheumerith rode high in the clear gas spaces between two high haze layers flying into the vast unending jet stream of gas as though trying to keep pace with the stars which were sometimes visible tiny and hard and remote through the yellow haze and the thin quick amber clouds scudding eternally overhead the giant aircraft was a single slim scimitar of wing pocked with engine nacelles articulated like a wave ten kilometres across a hundred metres long and ten metres high a thin filament forever jetting like a swift weather front made visible across the waste of clouds beneath dwellers hundreds of them hung from it each anchored like refuelled aircraft by a cable strung out from the wings trailing edge riding in a little pocket of calm gas produced by simple shells of diamond open to the rear and which to the human eye were shaped like a pair of giant cupped hands in a longterm drugtrance downshifted in time so that the flight seemed twelve or sixty or more times quicker than it really was the vast continents of clouds racing beneath like foam the wash of stars wheeling madly above wispbanks whipping towards and past like rags in a hurricane the winghung dwellers watched the days and nights flicker around them like some stupendous strobe and felt the planet beneath them turn like something reeling out their lives fassin taak left the jetclipper and flew carefully in matching velocities then anchored the little gascraft very slowly to the underside of the diamond enclosure holding the sageyouth zosso a slim dark rather batteredlooking dweller of two million years or so fassin slowtimed the wing the clouds the stars all seemed to pick up speed rolling racing forward like overcranked screenage the roar of engines and slipstreaming gas rose and rose in pitch becoming a high shrill faraway keening then vanishing from hearing altogether the dweller above him seeming to jerk and quiver in his little retaining harness waited for him to synch before sending and what might you be person i am a human being sir a seer at the nasqueron court in a gascraft an esuit i am called fassin taak of sept bantrabal and i am zosso of nowhere in particular of here good view is it not it is however i dare say that that is not why you are here youre right its not you wish to ask me something i am told i need to make passage to somewhere ive never heard of to follow a dweller i need to find im told you can help im sure i can if i choose to well that is if people still take any notice of what a silly old winghanger says who can say im not sure that i would listen to somebody as old and out of things as i am if i was a young travelcaptain why i think i should say something like what listen to that foolish old oh i beg your pardon young human i seem to have distracted myself where was it you would like to go a place that is apparently sometimes called hoestruem drunisine himself alone had come to the quarters that fassin shared with the two dwellers in the midmorning of the day after the battle in the storm we have delayed you long enough you may go a jetclipper is at your disposal for the next two dozen days goodbye now there ysul had observed goes a dweller of few words hoestruem zosso asked no ive never heard of it either night swept over them as he signalled enveloping in or near aopoleyin fassin sent apparently he told the old winghanger when the dweller was uncommunicative for a few moments somewhere associated with aopoleyin all this was on valseirs advice fassin couldnt find any mention of anywhere called aopoleyin in his databases either he was starting to wonder if the memoryscanning process hed had to undergo before being allowed to leave the isaut had scrambled some of the gascrafts information storage systems ah zosso sent aopoleyin that i have heard of hmm well in that case if i were you id talk to quercer janath yes youll need them i should think tell them i sent you oh and ask for my mantle scarf back might do the trick no guarantees though mind quercer and janath your mantle scarf back the old dweller rolled a fraction jerkily and looked down at fassin ill have you know it was a very good mantle scarf he rolled back facing again into the neverending rush of cloud and stars and day and night i could do with it up here its windy five conditions of passage where you want to go where hoestruem near aopoleyin fassin said we know where hoestruem is were not stupid well im not janath might be i entirely fulfilled my creat minimum stupidity allocation by associating with you forgive my partner we were asking for confirmation more out of shock at your unspeakable alienness than anything else so you want to go to hoestruem yes fassin said and zosso sent you still banging on about that damn scarf useful code though hoestruem hoestruem doable yes but its more the why of it not the how the how is easy the how is easy problem is definitely why as in bother as in should we well should we more rhetorical has to be a joint decision absolutely zosso asks zosso does do we accommodate we could just give him back his mantle scarf was there ever a scarf a real scarf yes now you mention it anyway beside the point always a dangerous place to tarry zosso a travel request this human gentleman in his gascraft esuit ahem said ysul and his friend not forgetting his friend and mentor ysul pointed out yes that too do we do or do we dont is the question does we does or dont we not yes no select one of the aforementioned quite precisely in your own time ysul muttered they were in a spinbar in eponia a globular stickycity in the cold chaotic wastes of the north polar region the borrowed jetclipper had done its best impression of a suborb skipping nearly into space in a series of bounced trajectories finally slowing sinking and coming to rest by the tenuous cloudlike structure of the great city occupying hundreds of cubic kilometres of cold stale gas just fifteen thousand klicks from the giant planets north pole theyd tracked quercer janath down to a spinbar called the liquid yawn valseir had demurred but ysul and fassin had crammed into a crushpod been accelerated up to speed and then dizzily joined the two travelcaptains in their booth fassin had never encountered a travelcaptain before hed heard of them and knew that they were almost always found in the equatorial band but they were elusive even shy hed tried to meet with one many times in the past but there had always been some sort of problem often at the last moment the spinbar whirled madly twisting and looping and rolling at extreme high speed making the city outside its bubblediamond walls seem to gyrate as though with the express intention of disorientating the outwardlooking bargoing public the effect was intense and intentional dwellers had a superb sense of balance and it took a lot to make them dizzy being spun like a maniac was one dweller idea of fun just because it led to a profound giddy dislocation with ones surroundings taking drugs at the same time just added to the hilarity ysul however it had seemed to fassin looked a little grey around the gills as theyd woven their way through the mostly empty spinbar to the travelcaptains booth you all right perfectly bringing back memories of heading through the storm wall in the poaflias not at well just a little ulp perhaps quercer janath travelcaptains were one they looked like one big dweller of about adult age but there were two individuals in there one in each discus fassin had heard of truetwin dwellers before but never met a set usually a dwellers brain was housed just off the central spine in the thickest central part of one discus generally the left one rightbrain dwellers were about fifteen per cent of the total population though this varied from planet to planet very very occasionally two brains developed in the one creature and something like quercer janath tended to be the result the doubledweller wore a shiny set of allovers with transparent and mesh patches over the hub sense organs and a shaded transparent section over the outer frill of sensory fringe youll not be able to see much thats if we take you at all yes thats if we do take you in the first place which is by no means guaranteed indeed not decision not yet made still pending absolutely but in any event youll not be able to see much of anything not exactly a sightseeing trip or a cruise either and youll have to switch everything off all nonbio systems at least if that is big if we do take you i think we get the idea fassin said good brilliant when can we expect a decision ysul asked hed turned his right sensefringe inward so that he was seeing with only one this was the dweller equivalent of a drunk human closing one eye made it ive made it you made it yep ive made it its a yes its a yes youll take us fassin asked are you deaf yes definitely thank you fassin said so where are we going ysul asked tetchily ah ha wait and see the ship was no joke three hundred metres long it was a polished ebony spike necklaced with drive pods like fat seeds it lay in a public hangar deep under the stickycity a semispherical space a kilometre across bounded by the hexagonal planes of adjacent smaller bubble volumes valseir was bidding them farewell here the trip would begin with what the two travelcaptains described as an intense fractally spiralled highacceleration torqueintense manoeuvre complex and was not for the faintwilled the old dweller had invoked his seniority to excuse himself the ordeal more spinning around ysul sighed on hearing what awaited them my regards to leisicrofe valseir told fassin you still have the leaf image i hope fassin took the imageleaf with its depiction of sky and clouds out of its storage locker in the little gascraft and showed it to the old dweller ill say hello please do best of luck you too how do i find you when i get back leave that to me if im not readily available try where we found zosso or perhaps at a stormsail regatta yes ysul said but next time just dont bring any friends the black spikeship was called the velpin it burst from the vast cloud of the city like a needle shot from a frozen waterfall of foam disappeared into the gelid rush of gases forever swirling around the planets distant pole and started its bizarre flight spiralling rolling looping rising and falling and rising again locked into a centrally positioned space which doubled as a passenger compartment and hold restrained by webbing fassin and ysul felt the ship commit to spirals within spirals within spirals tiny corkscrew motions threaded into a whole ramped course of greater coils themselves part of a still wider set of ever quicker tighter loops fucking hell ysul commented a faulty screen was set in the far wall hazed over with static it made buzzing noises and occasionally flashed with images of ragged striated clouds whipping past in distorted twists of light and shade fassin could see and hear though both senses were degraded all the systems in the gascraft had been switched off webbed upright he could see out of the deopaqued plate over his face hed let some of the shockgel drain away so he could see better the sound that came through the little arrowhead was at once dulled and high ysuls voice sounded like squeaks barely comprehensible fassin and ysul were stuck to the inner surface of the compartment pinned there by the ships wild spins any idea why they have to do all this fractal spiralling fassin had asked when theyd both been secured and quercer janath had gone to their command space a single compartment away could just be pure mischief ysul had said fassin looked at ysul now both the dwellers sense fringes were turned in the ship accelerated hard executing a broad curve the screen flashed black pitted with stars all revolving frantically then blanked out the insane nested sets of spirals resolved down to a single longaxis spin as though the velpin was a shell travelling down the barrel of some vast gun the ship resounded with a high singing note around them and seemed to settle into something like a cruise the rate of spin slackened off gradually fassin watched as ysuls sense fringes gradually opened the screen showed slowly spinning stars for several minutes then it blanked out again the spinning picked up once more and ysul turned his fringes outsidein again the spin built up until fassin could feel his whole body being pressed through the shockgel it was his own coffin he realised of course it was he was getting tunnel vision now starting to see the view down that great gun barrel the view ahead shrunk to a single point far away way way in the distance nothing but darkness and grey beyond darkness on either side down that neverending tube towards the last defined place they were aiming towards never coming any closer fassin woke up still spinning but the rate was slackening off again his nose itched and it felt like he needed to pee even though he knew he didnt this never happened when the shockgel and gillfluid were doing their jobs he fell asleep taince yarabokin woke up one of her first thoughts as she surfaced slowly to full consciousness was that saluus kehar would not have received the message shed prepared for him that there was still time for more reviewings and rerecordings and revisions that she would be able to spend more time watching and listening to herself on the recording and reduce herself to tears every time still time and a chance to confront him maybe kill him if that was both possible and something she felt driven to do at the time she had no idea sometimes she wanted to kill him sometimes she wanted him alive to suffer the shame of knowing that she had released the story to the newsnets and sometimes she just wanted him to know that she knew what had really happened that longago night in the ruined ship on the high desert she checked the time feeling woozily around in virtual space for information still half a year out from ulubis she would be awake now until the attack itself one of the first to be wakened for the final runin because she represented the closest thing they had to local knowledge privately she doubted shed be able to offer much practical help given that shed last seen ulubis over two centuries earlier and it might to put it mildly have changed somewhat after having been invaded but she was the best they had she thought of herself in that respect more as a talisman than anything else a small symbol of the system that they would be fighting for if that had been one consideration in her getting a place in the fleet it didnt bother her she was confident that she was a good competent and brave officer and deserved her post on merit alone the fact that it was her own home system she was riding to the rescue of was just a bonus the fleet had spread out a little since the battle with the beyonders in midvoyage sacrificing the immediate weight of arms it could bring to bear for a net of forward picket craft which would flag any trouble long before the main body of the fleet got to it taince had spent most of the intervening years slowasleep in her pod but thanks to that relative security provided by the advance ships shed had some recreational and moraletime out of the shockgel as well walking around almost like a normal human being in the spungravity of the battleship feeling odd and strange confronted with such normality like an alien inhabiting a humans body clumsy astonished at tiny things like fingernails and the hairs on an arm awkward especially at first with meeting other offduty humans and missing the richness of her inpod wiredup virtual existence with the ability to dip in and out of entire highdefinition sensoria of data and meaning like an amputated limb it would be like that again now once she had finally come round taince wasnt really looking forward to it when she was stumbling about on two legs she wanted to be back in the pod synched in but when she was there she was forever nostalgic for a normal physical onespeed onereality life blue skies and sunlight a fresh breeze blowing through her hair and green grass and flowers under her bare feet long time ago and maybe never again who knew another of tainces first thoughts even when she realised that she was being woken up slowly without alarms going off as part of the programmed preagreed dutyshift system rather than some fateful emergency that might end in her death at any moment was that she had not yet escaped into death that it was not yet all over and any terrors and agonies that might be hers to encounter before the peace of oblivion were still ahead of her hoestruem quercer janath said where fassin asked what do you mean where youre in it fassin had recovered from his blackout once theyd turned his little gascrafts systems back on he still felt disorientated and oddly dirty a sensation that was only gradually disappearing as the shockgel enveloped him fully again ysul had seemed a bit groggy too wobbly in the air when released from his webbing now they were looking at the passengercompartment screen which quercer janath still dressed in their shiny overalls had hit with one rimarm and got to work fassin looked carefully at the image on the screen but all he could see was a star field he could not for now work out in which direction he was looking certainly not a direction he was used to looking in he didnt recognise anything in it he asked feeling fuzzy and foolish yes in it fassin looked at ysul who still looked a little grey about the mantle the dweller just shrugged well he said i certainly give in who what or where the fuck is hoestruem a clouder a clouder fassin said this had to be a translation thing or a simple misunderstanding clouders were part of the cincturia the beings devices semicivs and tech dross that were beyond the beyonders way on the outside of everything ysul shook himself you mean a wingclouder or treeclouder or stickyclouder or no none of the above just a clouder but fassin said aopoleyin then ysul shouted lets start with that is that where we are yes indeed well sort of depends its the nearest place the nearest system eh ysul said the nearest what fassin asked simply not understanding he peered at the star field this didnt look right this didnt look right at all not in any way whatsoever not upside down or mirrored or backsideholod or anything i think im still confused ysul said rippling his sense mantles to wake himself up fassin felt as though he was at the bottom of that gun barrel again about to be blasted out of it or already being blown out of it up the biggest longest most unspeakably enormous and forever unending gun barrel in all the whole damn universe how far are we from nasqueron he heard himself say wait a moment ysul said slowly what do you mean system about thirtyfour kiloyears stellar not gasgiant apologies for any confusion thirtyfour kiloyears fassin said it felt like he was going to black out again you mean his voice just trailed off thirtyfour thousand light years standard roughly apologies for any confusion i already said that know different person different confusion they were in another system another solar system another part of the galaxy altogether they had if they were being told the truth left ulubis system and star thirtyfour thousand light years behind there was a working portal in ulubis system linked via a wormhole to this distant stellar system neither fassin nor ysul had ever heard of the clouder being hoestruem was a light year across clouders were depending who you talked to sentient semisentient protosentient asentient or just plain not remotely sentient though that last extreme point of view tended to be held only by those for whom it would be convenient if it were true such as those who could do useful profitable things with a big cloud of gas providing it wasnt alive arguably closer to vast distributedlysmart plants than any sort of animal they had a composition very similar to the clouds of interstellar gas which they inhabitedwere the distinction was moot clouders were part of the cincturia the collection of beings species machine strains and intelligent detritus that existed generally between stellar systems and didnt fit into any other neat category so they werent the deepspace cometarians called the eclipta they werent drifting examples of the brown dwarf communitals known as the plena and they werent the real exotics the nonbaryonic penumbrae the thirteenwayfolded dimensionates or the fluxdwelling quantarchs valseirs friend leisicrofe was a scholar of the cincturia the research trip he was making was a field trip visiting actual examples of cincturia clouders sailpods smatter toilers and the rest throughout the galaxy he had come to visit hoestruem because it was one of the few clouders anywhere near a wormhole portal only it wasnt a wormhole or a portal that anybody in the mercatoria or the rest of what called itself the civilised galaxy knew anything about the star aopoleyin was only a dozen light days away the clouder hoestruem much larger than the stellar system as measured to its outermost planet was passing partly through the outer reaches of the system intent if that was not too loaded a word on its slow migration to some fardistant part of the great lens the dweller leisicrofe was somewhere here in his own small craft or at least had been the velpin set out to look for him how long were we really under fassin asked quercer janath they were floating in the velpins control space watching the scanners chatter through their sweeps searching for anything that might be a ship the progress was slow the dwellers had long had an agreement with the clouders that meant their ships made very slow speed when moving through one clouders were resilient but their individual filaments the wispy bands and channels of tenuous gas that formed their sensory apparatus and nervous systems were surpassing delicate and a ship the size of the velpin had to move slowly and carefully amongst the strands of clouder substance to avoid causing damage the velpin was broadcasting a signal hail looping a request for leisicrofe to get in touch though quercer janath was not optimistic this would raise their quarry these academics were notorious for turning off their comms the truetwin looked genuinely puzzled the doublecreature shook itself rustling the shiny crinkles of the mirrorfinish coveralls how long were you under what how long were we really unconscious fassin asked some days and then some more days seriously fassin said and whats this we ysul protested i wasnt unconscious there you see your friend disagrees some days you said fassin quoted some days ysul said some days we werent unconscious for some days any days a single day he paused were we the process takes some time requires forbearance the truetwin dweller said sleep is best no distractions how could we possibly keep you amused and then theres the security aspect of course i was only briefly drowsy ysul exclaimed i shut my eyes for a moment in contemplation no more about twentysix days we were unconscious for twentysix days fassin asked standard roughly what ysul bellowed you mean we were kept unconscious in a manner of speaking yes in a manner of speaking a plainly furious ysul roared what we said and what manner of speaking would that be you kidnapping piratical wretches the manner of speaking complete truth you mean you drugged or zapped us unconscious ysul fairly howled yes very boring otherwise how dare you ysul shrieked plus its part of the terms for using the tube conditions of passage the left side of quercer janath intoned the other side of the truetwin made a whistling noise oh yes those conditions of passage theyll get you every time cant be helpful with them cant use the tube without em dont what you condi ysul spluttered ah fassin said signalling to ysul to let him speak yes id like to ask you some questions about ah tube travel if you dont mind absolutely ask away make the questions good though the answers may well be baloney never heard anything so disgraceful in all my ysul was muttering drifting over to a set of mediumrange scanner holo tanks and tapping them as though this would aid the locating of leisicrofes ship fassin had known theyd been under for more than an hour or two his own physiology and the amount of cleaningup and housekeeping the shockgel and gillfluid had had to do had told him that finding out that it had been twentysix days left him more relieved than anything else certainly losing that amount of time when you hadnt been expecting to and hadnt been warned about it was disconcerting and left one feeling sort of retrospectively vulnerable and would it be the same on any way back but at least they hadnt said a year or twentysix years fate alone knew what had happened in ulubis during that time and of course with all his gascrafts systems switched off fassin had no way of checking whether this really was the amount of time they had spent unconscious but it looked like at least one small part of the dweller list legend was true there were secret wormholes there was one for sure and fassin thought it unlikely in the extreme that the one between ulubis and aopoleyin was the only one it was well worth losing a couple of dozen days to find that out fassin felt himself try to draw a breath inside the little gascraft we did come through a wormhole he asked excellent first question easily answerable in every sense yes we did though we call them cannula where is the ulubis end the nasqueron end of the wormhole the cannula where is the adjutage fassin asked ah he knows the terminology most impressive and a very good question in one sense couldnt agree more phenomenally hopeless in another cant tell you security sure you understand of course i understand fassin said getting a straight answer to that one would have been too good to be true how long has the wormhole existed he asked the truetwin was quiet for a moment then said dont know for sure billions of years probably possibly how many others are there like it fassin asked imean wormholes cannula ditto ditto ditto as in again dont know no idea well some all right some idea but cant tell conditions of passage again drat those conditions of passage oh yes drat are there any other wormholes from ulubis from anywhere near ulubis system say within its oort radius to anywhere else another good question cant tell you more than our travelcaptaincys worth this one to aopoleyin does it link up with a mercatoria wormhole does one of their wormholes have a portal an adjutage here too no agree straight answer what a relief no and from here from aopoleyin fassin said are there other wormholes silence again for a moment then seems silly but cant tell you like anybodys going to have just one stupid tube to this place but still cant say and thats official fassin signalled resignation conditions of passage he asked catching on but why me fassin asked why you why you what why have i been allowed to travel here to use the wormhole you asked more to the point valseir zosso and drunisine asked on your behalf how could we refuse so i couldnt just have asked on my own behalf fassin said oh you could have asked best leave that hanging attempt not to insult passengers unwritten law do you know of any other humans whove been allowed to use dweller wormholes no no indeed not that wed know necessarily any other seers not to our knowledge which is admittedly vague okay fassin said he could feel his heart thudding in his chest deep inside the little gascraft do you make journeys through the wormhole often define often let me rephrase how many times have you used the wormhole in the last ten years standard easy question to sidestep but say a few hundred excuse our vagueness conditions of passage a few hundred fassin asked good grief if that was true these guys were running round the galaxy in their hidden wormhole system like subway trains under a city no more assuredly are there many other ships like no let me rephrase how many other ships in nasqueron make regular wormhole journeys no idea havent the haziest not even roughly would there be dozens hundreds the left side of quercer janath briefly turned its shiny overalls transparent and flashed a pattern of high amusement over its signal skin the right side made the whistling noise again fassin gave them time for a spoken answer but it didnt appear are there a lot he asked silence a while longer there are a few not a few make what you will again vagueness to be excused conditions of passage thousands fassin asked no response from the truetwin dweller he felt himself gulp tens of no point going pursuing numbers uppage see last answer given above he had no idea there just couldnt be all that many ships could there no matter how impressive your stealth tech surely out of hundreds or thousands of ship movements within a system every year a few had to betray itself on some sort of sensor now and again no system was perfect no technology never failed something had to show up how far out did portals have to be fassin wasnt an expert on the physics but he was fairly certain that you needed relatively flat space well away from a gravity gradient as steep as that round a gasgiant could their portals be as near to the planet as a closeorbit moon and nasqueron he asked would it be a typical sort of dweller planet in this regard all places of dwelling are special nasqueron nest of winds no less special than any but yes yes fassin felt that if hed been standing up in normal gravity asking these questions and getting these answers hed have had to sit down some time ago or just plain fallen over have you ever been here before to aopoleyin he asked silence then no or if yes cant remember fassin got something like swim that feeling of intense disconnection when the sheer implicatory outlandishness of a situation suddenly hit home to the unprepared human and if when we go back to nasqueron am i free to just tell people where ive been if you remember then yes is there a reason i might not remember cannula travel plays strange tricks seer taak youd try to remove the memory from my brain fassin felt his skin crawl human brains are difficult to do that sort of thing to without harming them weve heard working on assumption nobody will believe you dont distress might believe me ysul said suddenly turning away from the screens hed busied himself with earlier quercer janath bobbed dramatically like theyd forgotten he was there youre not serious not serious they yelped nearly together ysul snorted and flashed high amusement course not he turned back to the screens muttering while chuckling what you take me for like life too much anyway hang on to my memories thank you the search went on fassin tried interrogating the velpins systems to discover if it carried its own dweller list its own map of the unknown wormhole network or even just the location of the portal theyd entered in ulubis system to get here the ships computers easily accessed barely shielded seemed completely free of anything but the most basic star charts the greater galaxy was mapped down to a scale that showed where all the stars and major planets should be and that was it no habs and no traces of megastructures were shown and only the vaguest indications of oort and kuiper bodies and asteroid belts were given it wasnt like a proper starchart set at all it was more like a school atlas the little gascraft had a more detailed star map fassin searched the ship electronically as best he could without making it too obvious but found nothing else more detailed he supposed the real stuff must be hidden away somewhere but had an odd nagging feeling that it wasnt the velpin seemed a wellbuilt ship by dweller standards exceptionally wellbuilt with relatively sophisticated but elegantly simple engines and lots of power no weapons and some carrying capacity no more the rudimentary star data somehow fitted fassin tried to work out a way to commandeer the ship just take it over could he hijack the velpin hed spent enough time in the cluttered sphere of the ships command space to see how quercer janath controlled the vessel it didnt look difficult he had even just asked how do you navigate this thing point point get to the general volume and then point in the right direction secret is plenty of power delicate finessing of deltav is sign you havent really got enough power power is all you can do a lot by just pointing if youve got enough power though sometimes you have to sort of allow a bit for deflection thats a technical term fassin couldnt work out how to take the ship over dwellers could if they were determined go years without experiencing anything a human would recognise as sleep and quercer janath claimed that they could get by without any at all not even little slowdown style snoozes his gascraft had no weapons apart from the manipulators he had never trained to use the arrowhead as a closecombat device and anyway an adult dweller was bigger and probably more powerful except in top speed than the little gascraft dwellers were anyway generally regarded as being very hard to disable andor kill he remembered taince yarabokin talking about her closecombat briefings the basic advice when confronting a dweller who meant you harm if you as a human were in a conventional spacesuit say was to make sure you had a big gun there was no known way an unarmed human even in an armoured suit could take on a fit young dweller if you didnt have a big gun then run away very quickly was the best advice of all the mercatorial species only the voehn were known to be able to tackle a dweller unarmed and even then it wasnt a foregone conclusion fassin supposed he could just ram quercer janath crashing the little gascraft into them nose first might knock them out or disable them but he wasnt sure there was sufficient room to work up enough speed for such a manoeuvre in any single part of the ship hed need to start a few compartments back and come slamming into the command space hoping for a lucky hit and that they wouldnt hear him coming and just rote out of the way to leave him to smash into the instruments he wondered what hatherence would have done he wondered if shed have been allowed to come in the first place almost certainly not with any weapons on the other hand there was that standard dweller casualness about such things on the other hand this ship didnt seem that casual even if he could get quercer janath out of the way what about ysul he didnt think the older dweller would conspire or even cooperate ysul had made it very clear that he was an entirely loyal dweller who was simply being a good guide and mentor not some treacherous humanlover in league with or harbouring any sympathy for the mercatoria an entire power structure and civilisation he professed neither to understand nor care about and even if fassin could somehow get control of the ship by himself tricking both dwellers or all three depending how you looked at it what then he still hadnt been able to find any sign of a hidden navigational matrix on the ship where was he supposed to go how did he find the wormhole portal that had brought them here when he found it how did he get through assuming it was in any way guarded or just administered mercatorial portals were some of the most intensely monitored and heavily guarded locations in the galaxy even allowing for the semichaotic indifference that dwellers tended to display regarding such matters could he really expect to fly unchallenged through one of their portals as though it was just another patch of space hed tried to find out more about the whole process of finding and traversing a dweller wormhole portal an adjutage from quercer janath but they had to even his surprise given their conspicuous gift for the technique comprehensively outvagued themselves on the matter surpassing their most studiedly unhelpful earlier replies by some margin fassin had been allowed out of the ship hed floated free of it as it cruised gently through the tenuous nearvacuum body of the clouder hoestruem he wanted to check as best he could that this was not all faked somehow how after all did he really know that he was where quercer janath said he was theyd told him hed seen information displayed on some screen and in or out of some holo displays it could all be a joke or a way of setting him up for something so he had to check outside the velpin keeping pace with the ship as it slid through the allegedly selfaware interstellar cloud he used the little gascrafts senses to gauge whether he was in some vast artificial environment as far as fassin could tell he wasnt he genuinely was in a chemicaldust cloud on the edge of a planetary system a quarter of the way round the galaxy from his home and halfway in towards the galactic core the stars looked completely different only the distant galaxies still aligned if it wasnt really the edge of deep space it was a brilliant simulation of it he used up a little of his reaction mass water basically to fly a few kilometres away from the velpin and still encountered no wall no giant screen so either he was in a truly prodigious vr space or it was all being done directly through his brain or through the gascrafts own collar somehow uprated to one hundred per cent immersion beyond check he thought back to something valseir had said once any theory which causes solipsism to seem just as likely an explanation for the phenomena it seeks to describe ought to be held in the utmost suspicion valseir had been talking about the truth and other religions but fassin felt he was in a similar situation here he had no real choice but to act as though all this was genuine even so he had to keep the idea that it wasnt at the back of his head just in case because if all this was real then he was maybe on the brink of the most astounding discovery in all human history a revelation that could do untold harm or bring inestimable benefits to any combination of the mercatoria its adversaries and just about every other spacefaring species in the galaxy he remembered confronting the emissarial projection what seemed like an age ago back in the autumn house which was more likely what appeared to be the case or this all being a lie a setup a vast and incomprehensible joke discuss he ran every check he could while he was outside the hull of the velpin he was in space everything checked out or he was in a sim so complete that there was no disgrace in being taken in by it back to the truth again hatherence would have appreciated the dilemma he could if he really wanted he supposed just try and run away the gascraft would support him indefinitely it was capable of independent entry into a planetary atmosphere and if he used almost all his reaction mass he could be in the inner system of this star aopoleyin in a few years he could even sleep most of the way and hardly notice the journey but then what hed never heard of the place it was somewhere in the khredeil tops whatever those were according to the gascrafts rudimentary star atlas but it wasnt listed as a human or mercatorial inhabited system and there was no mention of it having any inhabitants at all that didnt mean there was nobody there everywhere seemed to support somebody who called it home but it meant that hed probably be no further forward trying to get back home he came back to the ship when quercer janath signalled excitedly that theyd found something it wasnt leisicrofes ship it was the delicate ball of gas and chemicals a lacework ball of cold and dirty string open to the vacuum held together by just a trace of gravity that was the clouders mind looking for a dweller a gasgiant dweller called leisicrofe image image told image expect specific image ah i have an image with me how where i mean what do i show it to so you can see it no describe okay its an image of white clouds in a blue sky accords so you can tell me where leisicrofe is went when did he go measure time how you standard system known being leisicrofe went x seconds ago fassin did the calculation about twenty years earlier he was nestled into the outer regions of the clouders mind the little gascraft resting gently between two broad strands of gas a fraction less cold than the surrounding chill of deep space he was in effect delving stopped right down to talk to something that made a deep slowtiming dweller look like a speedfreak clouders thought surpassingly slowly a signal from outside from the velpin to the clouder he sent where did leisicrofe go then he clicked up to normal speed are you going to be much longer ysul asked sounding irritable i am rapidly running out of patience with this bilateral monomaniac its been ten days fassin whats happened fallen asleep im going as fast as i can only been a few tens of seconds for me you could just stay and think at normal speed you know give us all time to mull over whatever this gasbrains saying no need to go doing this showoff delving stuff less of a conversation that way this shows respect you get more out of people if you yes yes yes well you just carry on ill try and find more games to keep this splitpersonality cretin occupied you rote off and commune with this spacevegetable ill do the real hard work sorry i came along now if ive missed any more good battles while ive been away his voice faded into the distance fassin descended into extreme slowtime again the clouder still hadnt replied at least this time there was no insane spiralling there was the same fuzzy lowreliability screen to distract them as they wafted away from the clouder and made for the hidden wormhole mouth and the doors out of the passenger compartment were just as locked but there was no fierce spinning fassin let quercer janath take over the gascraft remotely and turn off its systems he didnt bother to clear any of the shockgel or turn the faceplate clear this time he just put himself into a trance it was easy a lot like preparing to go down into slowtime and it meant he couldnt see or hear ysul complaining about the ignominy of being zapped unconscious just because they were going on a space journey they were making for somewhere called mavirouelo yet another place fassin had never heard of this was where hoestruem had said that leisicrofe was going next the clouder hadnt known if this was a system a planet another clouder or what quercer janath had gone silent for a moment when they heard the name and fassin had sensed them consulting the ships crude galactic atlas they declared that they knew the place a planet in the ashum system fassin or at least the gascrafts memory did know of this place it was even connected with its own mercatorialcontrolled wormhole though fassin suspected they wouldnt be using it total travel time to be expected was a few days as he slid into unconsciousness fassins thoughts were of how beautiful the clouder had looked the vast being was like a million great long gauzy scarves of light a whisper of matter and gravity close to nothingness that massed more than many solar systems drifting yet purposeful intent by ancient decision along a course charted out over millions of years propelled dirigible by minute flexings of cold plasmas by the force of nearnotthereatall magnetic fields by sighstrength expulsions and drawingsin of interstellar material cold and deadseeming yet alive and thinking and beautiful in the right light seen in a fitting wash of wavelengths there was something endlessly perfectly sublime about saluus stood on a balcony of ice and metal looking out at the view his breath misting in the air before him the shrievalty retreat was embedded in and partially sculpted from the frozen waterfall hoisennir a fourhundredmetrehigh klickwide cliff of ice marking where the river doaroe began its long fall from the high semiarctic plateau towards the tundra and plains beyond a low winter sun provided a grand display of sepektian clouds and a fuzzy purplered sunset but nowhere near enough heat to start melting the ice sepekte wobbled slowly and not especially significantly its arctic and antarctic circles where the sun alternately never set or never rose during the heights of summer and depths of winter were less than a thousand kilometres in diameter officially classed as a hottemperate planet by human standards its winters were longer but less severe than those of earth and their worst effects were confined to smaller areas than on humanitys original home but the hoisennir waterfall was far north and high up in the arcticshield mountains and the doaroe spent standard years at a time entirely frozen the place was called a retreat because it was owned by the shrievalty but as far as saluus was concerned it was just a hotel and conference centre the view was impressive though when there was sufficient daylight actually to see it properly it had a certain severe appeal saluus was prepared to grant saluus didnt like being here all the same he wasnt keen on places that he couldnt get away from easily preferably if the worst came to the worst by just walking to get away from here meant an aircar or a lift up or down the interior of the frozen fall to the landing ground on the ice of the solidified river above or down to the vacrail station on the shore of the frozen lake at the foot of the cliff when hed found out where the conference on the dweller embassy was to be held at fairly short notice for security reasons hed made sure to have a parasail packed with his luggage just so that he had an emergency way out if it came to it he knew that almost certainly there wouldnt be any emergency or if there was it would be something so big andor quick that there would be no getting away from it but he felt better safer having the parasail by the balcony window of his bedroom most of the other important attendees had suites far inside the fall to be further away from anything that might come at them from outside but saluus had insisted on an outside suite one with a view a way out he hadnt parasailed for decades but hed rather risk his neck that way than cowering at the back of a suite whimpering just waiting for death he sometimes wondered where this obsession with being able to get away came from it wasnt something hed been born with or picked up as the result of some traumatic experience in childhood it was just something that had sort of crept slowly up on him all the way through his adult life one of those things he supposed he hadnt bothered wasting any time thinking really deeply about it all that mattered saluus supposed was that the retreathotel was as safe a place to be as anywhere was these days the attacks on ulubis system had gone on never slackening off for very long never really reaching any sort of peak many of the targets were obvious military ones often attacked with bombs missiles and relatively shortrange weapons these were usually blamed on the beyonders other targets had cultural or morale value or were just big these were the kind that were hit from deep space with highvelocity sometimes nearlightspeed boosted rocks the number of such attacks had increased even as the weight of assaults by drone craft carrying beam weapons and missiles had decreased some of the strategists claimed that all this represented a failure by their enemies to attack when theyd expected to though it seemed to saluus that what they called the proof of this relied too much on simulations and shared assumptions it had all certainly gone on for a long time now people had worked their way through the various stages of shock denial defiance solidarity grim determination and whoknewwhat else nowadays they were just tired of it they wanted it all to end they feared how that end might come about but they were half broken by the erratic bombardment and the everpresent uncertainty worse in a way because news had somehow leaked out of when the invasion by the starveling cult had been expected and it had not yet materialised people were starting to think that it might not now ever happen the real conspiracy theorists believed that it had all been a huge militaryindustrial paranoid deathfantasy right from the start that no real threat had ever existed that most of the attacks were being carried out by the security forces themselves either as part of an interservice conflict or in a carefully planned series of cynical deliberately selfsacrificial moves that would gain sympathy for the armed forces even as the mass of people lost the few remaining civil liberties they still had that it was all just an excuse to turn the whole ulubis system into a semifascist society securing power in the hands of the privileged few even those of a more moderate turn of mind chafed at the freedoms lost and the restrictions imposed and had begun asking where exactly was this terrible threat they had been preparing for for the best part of a year shouldnt the sky have lit up by now with the invading fleets drives as they decelerated into ulubis nearspace people were starting to question the need for all the sacrifice and hardship and to wonder if too much was being done to counter a threat that so far hadnt materialised and not enough to deal with the ongoing attrition of smallscale but still intermittently devastating attacks the strategists were wondering where the e discon forces were too there had been wild arguments over what the best strategy was go out to meet the invading fleet or fleets hoping to gain a slight edge by a degree of surprise and keeping at least some of the fighting out of the populated reaches of ulubis system or sit tight and wait building up maximum forces where they were in the end most needed drone scout ships had already been dispatched in the general direction the invasion was coming from but so far none of them had found anything a very literal long shot a giant magnetic rail gun was being constructed in orbit round giri the smaller gasgiant beyond nasqueron built to scatter space in front of the oncoming fleet with debris a huge blunderbuss supposed to throw a sleet of surveillance machines and a cloud of tiny guided explosive or just kinetic mines before the invading ships but it was only now getting up to speed months late wildly over budget and plagued by problems at least this latest failure couldnt be laid at the door of kehar heavy industries saluuss firm had never been involved in the contract theyd been the obvious people to build it but it had been handed over to a consortium of other companies partly just to show that khi didnt have a monopoly and to give some of the others a shot at a big project the interim report on the nasqueron debacle had pretty much cleared khi finding nothing worse than occasionally imprecise accounting the sort of rushresulted cornercutting that was only to be expected in anything like the current emergency the whole stormbattle farce had been a homegrown military fuckup in other words just as saluus had maintained from the start partly as a result he had become more integrated into the whole planning and strategic superstructure of the ulubine mercatoria and even fairly regularly the emergency war cabinet this made sense it also appealed to saluuss sense of importance and he was selfaware enough to know and accept this and of course it had the additional effect of tying him in tighter to the political hierarchy of the system identifying him even more strongly with the ruling structures and individuals giving him more of an incentive to fight to preserve mercatorial rule if the bad guys did sweep in and take things over it would be harder now for saluus to wave his hands and claim to be just a modest shipbuilder now humbly at the service of the new masters still proximity access and even a degree of control over such power was something saluus felt comfortable with and if the worst did happen he still wasnt as symbolically part of the old regime as the others in the war cabinet and his control of khi would make him valuable to whoever ran the system hed play it by ear besides he had an escape route mapped out the longer the e discon invasion took to happen the shorter would be the time to wait for the mercatoria counterattack in which case he might be better off just disappearing while the bad guys settled in and prepared their own defences in theory they were supposed to be kept in the dark that the mercatorial fleet was on its way but news of that had leaked too and anyway their beyonder allies would surely have told them if it was simpler to hide then saluus would hide hed try to get involved in some guerrilla activity too hopefully at a safe remove so that when the mercatoria did retake the system he would look like some sort of hero rather than a coward only interested in his own wealth but keeping out of the way was sometimes the best strategy when things got messy he had a very fast ship indeed being built in one of the secret yards a prototype that he fully intended to make sure was never quite ready for active service or even military trial runs it would be his way out if he needed it in all this amazingly the woman he had first known as ko when shed been with fassin taak her real name the name she used now was liss alentiore had been a real help hed fallen for her he supposed in fact hed fallen for her to the extent that his wife despite her own happily indulged and numerous dalliances had for the first and only time shown signs of jealousy liss herself had suggested a way out of this though it had occurred at least as a fantasy to him as well so now they had a very stimulating little menage a trois going more to the point liss had proved a trustworthy confidante and reliable source of advice there had been a few occasions over the last few crowded sometimes desperate months when salluus had not known which way to react and hed talked it over with her either in the semiformality of his office flier or ship or from pillow to pillow and shed known what to do if not immediately then after a night or twos thought she was canny in a sidelong catlike way she knew how people worked how they thought which way they would jump almost telepathically sometimes hed invented a post for liss in his entourage and made her his personal private secretary his social and business secretaries had both been quietly piqued but were smart enough to accept the new face with a degree of feigned generosity and seemingly genuine grace and without trying to do anything to undermine her saluus had a feeling that they had each anyway gauged liss accurately and realised that any attack they might try on her would likely rebound on themselves his own security people had been suspicious of her at first finding all sorts of insalubrious stuff hinted at in her past and then a sort of suspicious fuzziness but ultimately there had been nothing damning certainly nothing that was worse than what hed got up to when he was her age shed been young wild and shed mixed with dubious types so had he so what hed quizzed her gently on her past himself and got an impression of hurt and trauma and bad memories he didnt want to hurt her further by inquiring too deeply it added to his feeling that in some almost unbearably gallant way hed rescued her shed been a middling journalist with a technical journal with a past in dance acting hostessing and massage work before hed taken her away from all that shed looked much younger than she was when hed met her that night with fassin saluus was a big fan of that whole wise head on young shoulders thing now hed decided but she looked even better now having taken him up on the offer of treatments she could never have had access to until theyd met she was grateful to him she never said so straight out that would have imbalanced too much what they had but he could see it in her eyes sometimes well he was grateful to her too shed revitalised his private life and proved a significant new asset in his public one there was also just a hint of a feeling that hed taken her away from fassin and that was quite a pleasant little sensation all by itself saluus had never exactly envied the other man he didnt really envy anybody indeed why should he how could he but there was a sort of ease to fassins life that saluus had always coveted and so resented to be part of a big family group like that surrounded by people all doing the same steady thing respected for their work intrinsically without constantly having to prove themselves through tender processes and balance sheets and shareholders meetings and staff councils that must have its own sweetness that must give a sort of academic security a feeling of justification and then the fellow had gone and become some sort of hero figure just by spending five years pickled in shockgel in a miniature gascraft not even built by khi knocking round with a bunch of degenerate dwellers had that fame attracted liss to fassin had she just traded fassin in traded up to saluus because the opportunity had presented itself maybe so it didnt bother him relationships were a market sal knew that only children and idiot romantics thought otherwise you judged your own attractiveness physically psychologically and in terms of status then you knew your level and could either raise or lower your sights accordingly risking rejection but with the possibility of advancement or settling for a more reliably stable life but never knowing what you might have achieved saluus took a deep cold breath the sun had disappeared ulubis dipping beneath treecoated mountains far to the southwest a few stars started to come out in the darkening purple sky the broad scatter of orbital habs and factories shone like a handful of thrown sparkling dust to the southeast gradually stretching out across the sky after the retreating sunset like a distillation of the fading light saluus wondered which of those tiny scintillations belonged to him not as many as a year ago some had been moved away just to get them out of old orbits where they could be more easily targeted two big dockships both of them and cradling navarchy vessels at the time had been destroyed wreckage from one had fallen on fessli city killing tens of thousands many more than had died in the initial attack khi was being sued for negligence accused of not moving the dockships out of the way in time a war on and everything controlled by the military but there was still room for that sort of shit he was having words in appropriate ears to get a blanket war exemption order proclaimed saluus looked through his own exhaled breath for nasqueron but it was far below the horizon and probably all but invisible behind the shield of orbital scatter anyway even if he had been in the right latitudes to see it fassin in all the preparations for war and invasion you always had to make time to take account of whatever he might have got up to had he died in the storm battle reports from nasqueron were ambiguous but then reports from nasqueron were never anything but ambiguous hed certainly disappeared and was probably still on nasqueron though in the time between the destruction of the original satellite surveillance network round the planet at the time of the storm battle and the establishment of a new one after the founding of the dweller embassy there had been a window when even quite big craft might have left nasquerons atmosphere but who knew and if taak was still somewhere in the gasgiant what was he doing if he was still alive saluus didnt envy him at all any more to have your whole existence never mind your whole family wiped out like that maybe fassin had killed himself he had been told apparently before the whole ghastly mess at the gasclipper race he knew they were dead if he wasnt dead too he was more alone than hed ever been in his life with nothing much to come back to saluus felt sorry for him his first thought had been that with fassin so reduced there would be no danger of liss going back to him if he ever did reappear but then hed thought about how people could confound your expectations sometimes and how women in particular could display a sort of theoretically laudable but harmfully selfsacrificial kind of misplaced charity when they saw somebody damaged luckily jaal tonderon was still alive sal and his wife had invited her to stay with them for a while he wanted to encourage her to be strong for fassin if he ever did make it back and they were all still there the dweller embassy had been a great success the dwellers had seemed keen to make up for the misunderstanding in the storm and the ulubis mercatoria had been desperate not to fight on two hopeless fronts at once another moon uerkle had been designated as the new site for the seers shared facility construction was well under way and a small fleet of ships had been welcomed into orbit around the gasgiant seers had started direct delving again the equipment for remote delving was not yet all in place and the dwellers either didnt notice or didnt care that a lot of new socalled seers were really navarchy cessoria and shrievalty scouts spies if you wanted to be blunt about it searching for fassin taak searching for the alsodisappeared dweller called valseir searching for any sign of those weapons used against the mercatorial forces during the battle in the gasclipper storm race and searching too for any hints or traces of the dweller list and anything remotely associated with it so far admittedly all completely without success even these scout craft had to be tagged and traceable and escorted by a dweller guide but it was a start also in the preparatory and to date unsuccessful stages were the negotiations with the dwellers to forge an alliance or get mercatorial hands on dweller weaponry the dwellers had shown themselves to possess offensive capabilities well strictly speaking defensive capabilities but that didnt matter nobody had credited them with if they could be brought into an alliance with the rest of ulubis system the whole balance of forces between the invaders and the defenders might be turned upside down even if the dwellers only shared some of their militarytechnological knowhow or just lent out or hired some of the devices that might make enough of a difference for ulubis to resist the invasion on its own without having to wait for the summed fleet units to arrive and if that failed then there was the delicate matter of how to get the starveling invasion fleet to attack nasqueron and so with luck dash itself to pieces against whatever hyperweaponry had destroyed the navarchy forces in the storm battle so much to think about saluus was wearing a jacket but hed come out without gloves and so had put his hands into his pockets to keep them warm liss slipped one arm through his suddenly there at his side nuzzled up to him her skinperfume seeming to fill his head he looked down at her and she pressed closer to him following his gaze out to the south and the stipple of light from the orbital structures he felt her shiver she was dressed in light clothes he took off his jacket and put it over her shoulders hed seen that in screen stories and it still made him feel good to do it he didnt mind the cold though it was worse than it had been and a breeze was starting to blow from above it was a partkatabatic wind hed been told by somebody a current of cold air flowing down from the icelocked wastes above displacing warmer less dense air below and driving gently but firmly downwards spilling over the lip of the waterfall like a ghost of the frozen plunging waters they stood in silence for a while then liss reminded saluus that he was supposed to meet with peregal emoerte for a private talk before dinner that evening there was still time though he felt cold now close to shivering he would wait until he did shiver before he went in he stared up into the nearcomplete darkness directly overhead watching the spark of a closeorbit satellite pass above them he felt liss stiffen at his side and pulled her closer whats that she said after a few more moments he looked where she was pointing to the low west where only the vaguest dimmest hint of purple near the horizon showed where ulubis had set a little above that horizon in the sky below beyond and above the thickest strands of reflected orbital light new lights were flickering to life they were a sprinkle of bright blue scattered across a rough circle of sky the size of a large coin held at arms length and increasing in number with every passing second the blue points wavered gradually strengthening more and more were lighting up filling the little window of sky with a blue blaze of cold fire barely twinkling in the chill still air out over the frozen plains saluus felt himself shiver though not from the cold he opened his mouth to speak but liss looked up at him and said thats them isnt it thats the starveling cult guys the e discon thats the invasion fleet braking fraid so sal agreed his ear stud was pinging and the comms in the suite was warbling plaintively wed better go in groggy again still in the passengerfreight compartment of the velpin he brought the little gascrafts systems back up the wallscreen crazed came clear showed stars fixed then swinging and finally settled on a greenyblue and white planet fassins first reaction on seeing it was that the place looked alien unsuitable for life without an esuit then he realised that it looked like glantine or sepekte like images of earth in fact going gasgiant native he told himself thinking like a dweller it didnt usually happen so quickly oh fuck ysul said angrily staring at the image on the screen its not even a proper fucking planet the waves came booming in like blindness like stubbornness bundled and given liquid form an unending slow launching against the ragged fringe of massively sprawled rocks each long low rough ridge of water heaving skywards to tumble like some ponderously incompetent somersaulter rolling up and falling forward hopeful and hopeless at once disintegrating exploding in spray and foam coming to pieces amongst the fractured boneyard of rock the waters drained after each assault rattling boulders stones and pebbles between the massive jabs and points of granite sloughing like a watery skin and falling away again that stony chattering speaking of a slowly aggregated success the waves the ocean rubbing away at the land breaking up and breaking away using rock against rock tumbling it and crashing it and cracking it abrading over centuries and millennia to a kind of stubborn accomplishment he watched the waves for some time admiring their vast mad pounding reluctantly impressed by such sheer clamorous incessancy the salt spray filled his hair and eyes and nose and lungs he breathed in deeply feeling joined feeling linked to and part of this wild unceasing elemental battle a low golden light struck out across the ruffled nap of sea sunlight swinging slow beneath a great piled series of cloud escarpments to the west layers of vapour draped over distant peaks and spires of rock disappearing into the long misted curve of northfacing shore seabirds wheeled across the wind and waves diving flapping away clutching slim fish like wet slices of rainbow it had felt strange at first coming out of the little gascraft it always did it always had but this time seemed different more intense somehow this was an alien homeland a familiar yet utterly different place closer to what ought to be home further from what was eleven thousand light years away from ulubis this time though they had travelled further than the last time to get here and just twelve days travel when hed opened the gascrafts hatch and stood hed staggered and swayed needed holding up by ysul hed coughed and nearly retched feeling scrawny and weak and thin and hollowedout shivering in the strange ultranakedness of returning to the basic human condition as slimed and wet and naked as a newborn and even the retreating tendrils of the gillfluid and shockgel tubes there too umbilical links to image birth he felt lighter and heavier at once blood draining bones complaining then after a while being naked even naked in ordinary clothes started to feel normal again every now and again though he shivered the velpins patternfollower had done its best to make human wearable clothes but still the results felt strange and slick and cold they were on mavirouelo a ninety per cent earthlike not far from the galactic outskirts though less isolated than ulubis a waterworldercolonised planet a sceuri world waterworlds were the single most common type of rocky planet in the galaxy even though you never saw the rock which was on average a metalrock core about the size of earth buried under five thousand kilometres of pressureice finally topped by a hundred klicks of ocean such planets provided the next most common planetary environments after the nearubiquitous gasgiants themselves and had given the mercatoria three of its eight principal species the sceuri the ifrahile and the kuskunde mavirouelo was not a classic waterworld it wasnt even as watercovered as earth itself but it had been colonised by the sceuri before any native animal of air land or sea had developed sufficiently to claim it as their own and so had become one of the sceuri farworlds an outpost of their own semimperia within the greater commonwealth of the mercatoria the sceuri werent conventional waterworlders either they were cetasails resembling sea mammals but with backs ridged by spinnaker spines which they could hoist to the wind and so sail as well as swim across their worlds ysul in his esuit rose out of the sea like a submarine conning tower frightening the seabirds he floated up and out and made his way across the turmoil of waves to the low cliff where fassin stood the human was suddenly reminded of the time he had stood with saluus kehar watching hatherence in her esuit float out across the chaos of artificial surf surrounding the waterspout house fassin ysul boomed floating dripping and humming in the air ten metres above him no sign yet no sign yet ysul held up a mesh basket of glistening flapping wriggling stuff look what i caught he brought the basket in front of his forward mantle to look at it think ill take it back to the ship ysul flew over fassin dropping water and small shells on top of him then headed inland a couple of hundred metres to the shipsection resting on the scrubby ledge of vegetation fringing the jagged ranks of cliffs pinnacles and mountains beyond the fiftymetrelong lander made up the nose section of the velpin the rest of which with quercer janath aboard was still in orbit fassin watched the dweller go then turned back to the ocean he was here to meet with a sceuri who had seen the dweller leisicrofe who had been here until theyd been told twelve years ago they hadnt met a sceuri yet the velpin had been challenged by the planets orbital traffic control and targeted by several military units and so had had to reveal something of its reasons for being there looking for some dweller geezer called leisicrofe had been quercer janaths exact words theyd been told to go into orbit and stay there targeting beams never left them they were regarded as suspicious because their ship looked holecapable and they hadnt come through the local portal sceuri quercer janath had told fassin and ysul suspicious paranoid theyd spent three days watching the planet revolve beneath them ysul had muttered about how flat and boring the storms looked fassin had found endless fascination in the great snowflake citystructures spread across water and land and the truetwin passed the time inventorying shipstuff theyd forgotten about and playing noisy imageleaf games they answered questions from planetary traffic control about where theyd come from nhouaste the largest of the systems four gasgiant planets was the answer given and then a signal had come through a scholar named aumapile of aumapile had had the honour of playing host to the dweller scholar leisicrofe and would be flattered to be allowed to extend the same courtesies to these new arrivals another step along the way another step closer perhaps to finding the wandering dweller and the data he carried if he still lived if he still had the data if the data was what it was supposed to be if valseir had been telling the truth if it was not all utterly out of date without point overtaken by the seeming certainty that there was a network of secret wormholes accessible only to dwellers but they werent sharing it and it might have nothing to do with the dweller list fassin was looking for something that might lead him to what he had already used twice he had already been through at least two wormholes travelled across half the galaxy and yet he wasnt really any closer to finding the key to this system of trapdoors and secret passages he could be carried unconscious through them like a fey maiden under the influence of a sleeping draught in some gothic romance but he wasnt allowed to know the secret behind it all he was still trying to think of ways to commandeer the velpin but with no real hope of success there would still be the problem of accessing the hidden wormholes just thinking of a way to stay awake while they made these wild transitions would be a start but he had no idea how to do that either if he could go back in time to apsile and the shared facility in third fury and ask him to build some subset of systems into the gascraft that would keep working when the main ones were shut down making it look like the machine had entirely stopped functioning when in fact he was still senseconnected and aware maybe it would be possible but even the dwellers didnt claim to have time machines and fassin didnt have the expertise to undertake such an amendment to the gascrafts systems himself even if he had had the time and the facilities to do it neither of which he did have maybe he should have gone back to the mercatoria acted as a real major in the ocula would have done and retreated reported to his superiors told them what had happened and awaited new or renewed orders but the ocula meant nothing to him and never had and most of what had mattered before to him was also gone now he might even have tried to get in touch with the beyonders but until he had the key to the dweller list what was the point in that and anyway what if they had been behind the septs destruction even at a remove just how magnanimous was he prepared to be what point indeed was there in going back at all perhaps seventy days standard had elapsed since fassin had first gone tumbling into the atmosphere of nasqueron it was over two old earth months since the battle in the storm who knew how much longer hed have to keep looking for leisicrofe chasing him round the galaxy perhaps ever coming closer to him maybe never quite catching up with him maybe hed get his precious data and return to find it was all over the system taken or utterly laid waste to every surface like the surface of third fury just slag and heat destroyed by one side or another or by both fighting for something that wasnt even there any more it should still in theory be the most important piece of information that a human had ever carried but somehow even if the key to the dweller list did exist the fact that dwellers could use this secret network under the noses of the rest of the galaxy and had been so doing for who alone knew how many billions of years made it seem much less likely that any scrap of data any proofsize patch of algebra was going to make that much of a difference and yet still despite everything all he could do all that he could even think of doing was to press on and try to find what everybody wanted him to find and hope that it might do some good somehow fassin breathed in tasting salt he no longer doubted that this was real or a virtual environment there was no disgrace in being fooled by there wasnt even anywhere like this this coarse stormsundered coast anywhere in ulubis system and the stars were completely different again something caught fassins attention a few kilometres out into the ocean the water was rising in a great shallow dome flowing everywhere down from a huge flattened hemisphere of foamstreaked darkness rising like a neverbreaking explosion from the depths still spreading and still rising and causing a great slow swell of disturbed waves to come pulsing forward towards the cliffs as the apparition a double saucershape two kilometres wide finally broke free of the sea entirely and came slowly towards the shore sheets and veils of salt rain falling from beneath it flattening the shadowbruised surface of the waters ysul floated up nodding forward rides here then they floated stood and hovered in a halfdrained crystal hall within the great saucer ship aumapile of aumapile floated in the water a fat eel the size of an orca with a great folded fan of sail ridging its back fassin stood on a broad ledge still slick with salty water while ysul and the truetwin quercer janath cajoled down eventually bulked out with a twinskin overall of extreme shininess that doubled as an esuit hovered in the air above the great pool of water fassin found himself thinking about the autumn house again and slovius in his pool aumapile of aumapile the aumapile of aumapile apparently according to the servant who had escorted them down a broad waterfilled tube to the audience chamber the human and the dwellers in a bubble of air enclosed by a sphere of diamond was not merely a justly famous scholar of the cincturia it was a vastly rich justly famous scholar of the cincturia a high warbling seemingly interminable song sounded from an underwater sound system a song of welcoming for those from afar apparently song for making you want to go straight back there again ysul had asided to fassin as theyd accepted reasonable impersonations of something to drink andor inhale they talked of leisicrofe their host speaking through a small hovering speaker sphere said they had missed him by some years and then ysul mentioned following him oh the sceuri said but you must take me with you must must but i know where he went the sceuri said as though this explained everything couldnt you just tell us ysul asked plaintively just point us in the right direction and well be on our way the sceuri wriggled in the great pool sending water sloshing it laughed a soft tinkling sound from the hovering speaker oh i could but i always had the feeling my friend leisicrofe had travelled even more widely than i have especially into the gases of nhouaste i think you may be heading there as you did not come through the wormhole portal and he did not depart through it you see i have my sources i know what goes on you cant fool me i am not so stupid you and your little squanderer friend will be heading back to nhouaste doubt it the dweller travelcaptain said snorting fassin was the little squanderer friend the sceuri took great pride in having become a technological spacefaring species given the obstacles theyd had to overcome a classic waterworld environment had almost no easily available metals any metalbearing ores that a waterworld possessed tended to be locked away under all that ice deep in the planets inaccessible rocky core waterworlders had to do what they could with what fell from the sky in the shape of meteorites and in this shared a developmental background with gasgiant dwellers to get into space in the face of such a paucity of readily available raw materials was not easy and the sceuri regarded themselves as deserving considerable recognition and respect for such a triumph of intellect over scarcity accomplishing the same feat when you came from a rocksurface planet was a relatively trivial expectable even dismissible trick the sceuri called people from such planets squanderers as a result though not usually to their face or other appropriate feature please make clear oh great a of a the other half of quercer janath said fassin suspected that he already knew what the sceuri was thinking the local gasgiant nhouaste inhabited by dwellers of course was like the vast majority of dweller gasgiants not a world that welcomed seers or anybody else apart from other dwellers aumapile of aumapile had probably been told where leisicrofe was heading next and assumed that as the dweller had not gone through the mercatorial wormhole and assuming he hadnt headed into deep space at stl speeds he must have gone to look for whatever it was he was looking for in the one place that even being fabulously rich and corruptly wellconnected couldnt gain you access to in this system or any other a dwellerinhabited gasgiant i think the toilers our mutual friend sought have found a new niche no longer in space but in gas you see the sceuri said even through the speaker sphere the creatures voice sounded pleased with itself toilers ysul said known benign semiswarm devices the other half of quercer janath announced infrasentient known for randomly building inscrutable space structures best guess for purpose of which being as preparatory infrastructure for an invasion that never took place on behalf of a race long gone and thoroughly forgotten distribution very wide but very sparse numbers fluctuate rarely dangerous sometimes hunted no bounty so there ysul looked surprised really he asked oh stop being so coy their host chided creating sinuous splashing patterns in the water as though tickled of course as though you didnt know the aumapile of aumapile blew jets of water from each end a scent of something vaguely rotten filled fassins nose but i know where our friend was going to next and you dont however i shall be willing to tell you if you take me along once i am aboard your ship such large places gasgiants and of course we have four one thinks oh who can say where would ones quarry be the sceuri flicked its tail fassin got splashed and what do you say sirs ysul looked at fassin and quietly rippled his mantle the dweller equivalent of a headshake the travelcaptain was silent for a moment or two then said if we do take you with us ah but i have my own ship indeed you are in it wont work have to come with us in ours i have smaller ships many of them a choice makes no difference has to be ours conditions of passage well the sceuri said passengers travel unconditionally unconditionally what does that mean trust us yes no matter what means you get zapped unconscious every time we travel is what it means ysul told their host quercer janath made a hissing noise plus ysul added oblivious you may not end up where you thought you were going to how primitive why of course eleven hundred ships they were facing eleven hundred ships all of them had to be beyond a certain size capable of crossing the great gulf of space between the e discon and here in reasonable time and they would probably all be armed ulubis could muster less than three hundred true spacecapable warcraft even after their frenzy of building the summed fleet on its way to their rescue was of similar size but its ships would be of another order of magnitude in hitting power a full mix of destroyers light medium and heavy cruisers plus the real big guys the battlecruisers and battleships ulubis had frigates destroyers and light cruisers and one old battlecruiser the carronade theyd built a significant fleet in the centuries following the destruction of the portal and a few more ships in the half year since the news of the coming invasion but nothing like enough to offer the invaders serious opposition theyd lost about a sixth of their total fighting force in the few minutes of action in the storm on nasqueron months earlier including their only other battlecruiser those had mostly been light units but it had been a grievous loss the latest bit of bad news was that the consortium working on the rail gun had fallen so far behind schedule that it was highly doubtful theyd even get to the trials stage before the invasion took place the giant gun was being dismantled so it wouldnt fall into the hands of the starveling cultists there was something almost sublimely elegant sal thought about how perfect a waste of time people resources and hard work the whole project had been kehar heavy industries and the other manufacturers had worked as hard as they could to construct repair upgrade and modify as many warships as they could and had militarised dozens of civilian craft but there was only so much they could do and it was never going to be enough they were outnumbered they could go down fighting but they were going down it couldnt be any worse guardgeneral thovin spluttered practically spraying his drink they were on a requisitioned excruise liner one of the embassy support ships rolling in orbit around nasqueron saluus and the propylaea submaster sorofieve had been sent by the rest of the war cabinet to add if it were possible an extra note of urgency to the talks with the dwellers thovin seconded from his guard duties to be commanderinchief ulubis orbital forces was there in charge of the very lightly armed escort detachment because he was out of the way and couldnt do too much harm the grandeur of his new title seemed to almost entirely make up for the lack of viable military hardware at his disposal we cant even surrender to the starvelings because if we do the summed fleet will clobber us when they arrive he said were going to get fuckedover twice he threw back his drink saluus didnt like thovin he was one of those people who got to the top of an organisation through luck connections the indulgence of superiors and that sort of carelessness towards others that the easily impressed termed ruthlessness and those of a less gullible nature called sociopathy but sometimes just through his sheer unthinking brusqueness and inability to think through the consequences of a remark he said what everybody else was only thinking a comic poet working in obscene doggerel there is no need to talk of surrender submaster sorofieve said quickly and to sals amusement actually looked round glancing left and right to make sure nobody else had heard the s word in the old cruise ships lounge which was deserted apart from a few bar staff the three men and a halfdozen or so of their closest staff liss was there looking darkly beautiful mostly silent occasionally talking quietly with one or other of the other assistants secretaries and adcs when the propylaea submaster did his glancingaround act her gaze met sals she smiled and flexed her eyebrows if there were any spies here sal thought they werent lurking behind the furniture in the shadows they were sitting right here around them the indispensable aides and helpers they all relied on to run their soimportant lives were the obvious candidates for the post of spy if anything ever got back to the hierchon or any other more lowly but still important branch of the ulubine mercatoria regarding talk of surrender or anything else deemed unspeakable it would probably be one of these people theyd have to thank saluus knew one could never be one hundred per cent certain but he was pretty sure that the lovely liss wasnt working for anybody else hed seemingly let slip a couple of things early on in their relationship which hed have expected to come back to him if shed been in the pay of somebody else it had been a sort of recommendation that shed come via fassin and hed obviously known her from decades earlier that was far too long a game just to get to an industrialist even saluus kehar no need thovin said turning to his secretary holding up his glass and winking theatrically its what wed be talking about if the summed fleet wasnt on its way be the rational thing to do he snorted im not saying we should surrender been ordered not to been ordered to fight to the last but if the fleet wasnt coming and we werent looking for this this thing supposedly somewhere on nasq the fabled transform of course saluus thought the mythical magic bullet which fassin if he was still alive might be chasing yet what else would we be doing but thinking how to not all get ourselves killed we are prepared we are forewarned submaster sorofieve said smiling desperately we shall give a good account of ourselves i am sure we are fighting for our homes for our honour for the man looked round again for our very humanity ah sal realised sorofieve had been checking there were no aliens present whom he might be offending we have millennia of mercatorial ah wisdom and martial ability behind us what are these starveling renegades in comparison eleven hundred ships thats what they were saluus thought eleven hundred to our three hundred and a balance of forces the strategists say is way up the forceyield spectrum compared to ours too mediumheavy to our light plus one megaship to our one antique battlecruiser they had had another meeting with some of the dweller representatives just that afternoon they went down these days in person reclined in humanform spacesuits held in small circular gascraft of two or three seats congregating in a great hall in one of a whole fleet of giant dreadnoughtsized craft the dwellers had dedicated to the purpose with the gascraft canopies hinged open it was possible to sitlie there in some comfort and talk directly to the dwellers facetohub or whatever it was saluus wouldnt want to spend more than a day like that in multiple gees but it was worth doing the dwellers seemed to appreciate it and thanks to some cramcoaching by the senior seers who also came down with them to the meetings and stayed with them for all but the most delicate and highsecurityclearance matters saluus was even starting to get the hang of dweller expressions and nuances of meaning and demeanour both as put across in speech and as displayed on their signal skin probably all too late and so far to no avail whatsoever but at least it felt like he was doing something the shipyards of khi were basically on autopilot working flat out and so synchedin to what the military wanted that theyd effectively become part of a command economy hed just been getting in the way this is a threat to the whole of ulubis system sorofieve said sal suppressed a sigh this was only sorofieves third day in this latest round hed replaced first secretary heuypzlagger whod found the high gravity too wearing and he was talking to a dweller called yawiyuen who was also new to the process but even so theyd been circling over this same ground for weeks now these starveling cult people will show no respect for nasquerons neutrality the submaster concluded how do you know gruonoshe another of the dwellers asked they were nine in all the two human negotiators and a couple of assistants each liss was there in a seat behind sal having declared herself quite happy in the high gravity chief seer meretiy of sept krine and just the two dwellers both in ceremonial halfclothes ribboned and jewelled know what sorofieve asked know that these starveling cult people will show no respect for nasquerons neutrality gruonoshe said innocently well sorofieve said they are invaders warmongers indeed not to put too fine a point on it they are barbarians they respect nothing still it does not follow that theyd quarrel with us yawiyuen said signal skin showing reasonableness they want to take over the whole system sorofieve said looking to saluus for help to them that would include nasqueron we have heard of the starveling cult yawiyuen told them wonder from where liss sent to saluus via his ear stud it appears to be an unremarkable quick hegemonist diffusion concerned with conquering its own kind and speciestypesuitable environments uninterested in attacking gasgiants the point here saluus said smoothly his amplified voice sounding rich and powerful is that they are only attacking ulubis system to get to nasqueron why gruonoshe asked were not entirely sure saluus said we are sure they want something from nasqueron something they cant get from any other gasgiant but exactly what that may be we cant say but we are quite positive that that is why they are mounting this attack in the first place why are you sure gruonoshe again we intercepted intelligence to that effect sorofieve replied what intelligence yawiyuen asked the intelligence sorofieve said came from the personal diary of the supreme commander of the starveling cult invasion fleet sent to the ruanthril system nearly eighteen years ago the fleet was intercepted by a mercatorial force the captured records show that the enemy commander complained specifically about the need to divert so many of the e discons forces to somewhere as out of the way and strategically unimportant as ulubis just for some item or piece of information in nasqueron nasqueron was mentioned by name gruonoshe asked it was sal said he halfexpected a little voice in his ear to say something like good lie but then remembered that even liss hadnt been told the full truth about the dweller list and the mythical transform she would have an idea as a lot of people close to the epicentres of power did that fassin had been sent on a secret mission to look for something valuable in nasqueron and that the object of this search might have some bearing on the war but that was about all she hadnt been present at the briefing by the ai projection of admiral quile hadnt been let in on the secret subsequently by some of those who had been there as sal had and so didnt know the details of the intelligence theyd been given well then yawiyuen said reasonably you should let the starveling cult attack us and we will deal with them this of course was exactly what the emergency war cabinet hoped would happen can we just say yes here liss sent wouldnt you then want some help from us sorofieve asked oh no gruonoshe exclaimed as though the idea was just too preposterous even to think about as submaster sorofieve has said saluus said we are quite certain that the starveling cultists intend to take the entirety of ulubis system including nasqueron were all under threat thats why it would make sense for you and us to organise our defence together a common threat requires a common response sorofieve told the dwellers or maybe a pincer movement yawiyuen suggested brightly saluus wanted to sigh again these two guys were supposedly topgrade negotiators with the authority to speak provisionally in advance of some sort of still undefined plebiscite procedure for the entire dweller society on nasqueron but they frequently sounded like children well perhaps he said providing we can at the very least coordinate our actions and of course sorofieve said it may be that we can share defence technologies oh yawiyuen said rising above his dentseat a fraction good idea what do you have that we might want he appeared guilelessly enthusiastic our strengths would lie more in intelligence in knowing how these starveling cultists will think saluus said theyre basically humans too for all our differences we think pretty much the same way they do our contribution would be to try to anticipate them to outthink them and ours yawiyuen asked settling back down in his seat again weaponry i bet gruonoshe said sounding unimpressed as we have discovered very much to our cost saluus said you have the better of us in offensive capability certainly defensive capability gruonoshe interrupted surely sal did his best to move his helmeted head in an acknowledging nod straining his neck muscles in the high gravity defensive capability as you say he said if we were able to share some of your knowledge of weapons technology is not something we are going to share gruonoshe said crisply we could say we wanted to yawiyuen told them we could even mean it you might argue us round somehow to said point of view but those who control the weapons themselves would not permit it well can we perhaps talk to them saluus asked yawiyuen bobbed over his seat no why would that be sorofieve asked they dont talk to aliens yawiyuen told them bluntly they barely talk to us gruonoshe admitted how might we be able to saluus began we are not the mercatoria gruonoshe said interrupting saluus again this was not an experience he was used to he could see how it might get annoying we are not the mercatoria the dweller repeated he sounded indignant we are not one of your states or mercenary or irrationalityinspired groupings or forces bit of stress there sal heard in his ear if i may chief seer meretiy began the seers were under instruction only to take a part in the talks when they felt there was some sort of basic misunderstanding taking place meretiy obviously felt that was happening now but he didnt get a chance to take his point further what is meant one believes yawiyuen said is that things do not work with us the way that they work with you we are delegated to speak to you and what we take from here will be shared with all who wish to take notice we are not in a position to order other dwellers to do or not do certain things no dweller is not in the hierarchical sense that you may be used to we can share information the information regarding the approach of the starveling cultists has been made available to whoever it may concern as was the information regarding the buildup of mercatorial forces immediately prior to the unfortunate incident which took place within c storm ultraviolet those in charge of the relevant defensive systems will doubtless have taken note of said information that is really all we can share with you our colleagues in charge of the defensive systems would not consider talking to outsiders and there is no precedent for sharing lending leasing or giving such technologies to others you talk of your colleagues in charge of the defensive systems sorofieve said but who is in charge of them and so to the point yawiyuen gave a little bobshrug nobody is somebody has to be sorofieve insisted why well sorofieve said how do they know what to do lots of training yawiyuen told him but when when do they know what to do who directs them who decides when its time to stop talking and start shooting they do they do sorofieve sounded incredulous you let your military decide when to go to war our submaster hasnt done his homework has he sal sent to liss he may have read she replied he didnt believe saluus had done as much research as he could into the dwellers amazing how little hed known he was smart welleducated and extremely wellconnected and yet hed been nearshamed by how little hed known about the creatures that his own species shared the system with it was as though having realised how little the dwellers were concerned with or cared about them ulubine humanity had decided to pay them back in the same coin and this in a seer system with more interspecies contact than any save another halfdozen or so similarly favoured scattered through the galaxy yet even here most people didnt know or want to know much of anything about the dwellers there was a large minority who did but they were seen as slightly embarrassing nerdy alienfans facing the threat they were desperately needing the dwellers help how shortsighted they all seemed now and reading up on dweller society proved the truth of one old cliche for sure the more you learned the more you realised how little you knew an image of the planet liss had suggested when hed first tried to articulate this feeling unending depths of course our military decide when we go to war gruonoshe said calm again theyre the experts i think that if i might be allowed to butt in chief seer meretiy said from his gascraft the point at issue is our different ways of looking at our two societies military capacity we that is humans and perhaps one might even presume to speak in this for the whole mercatoria regard our military as a tool to be used by our politicians who of course rule in the name of all conversely our dweller friends regard their military as an ancient and venerable calling for those with the relevant vocation an institution to be honoured for its antiquity which has almost as an afterthought the duty of defending dweller planets from any outside threat as such they are like what one might term a fire brigade and a volunteer fire brigade at that for which no political clearance or oversight is required for it to spring into action you see their raison detre is to respond as quickly as possible to emergencies no more fuck me that actually made a sort of sense liss sent just those first two words delivered in her voice with her so close behind him gave sal the start of an erection he wondered how strong gravity had to be for hardons to become impossible fire brigades have leaders captains dont they sorofieve said plaintively looking from meretiy to saluus we might talk to them mightnt we yawiyuen did the little bobshrug again absolutely not but we need to sorofieve almost wailed why that thing even looks fast guardgeneral thovin said gazing out at the sleek dark ship from one of the requisitioned liners viewing galleries the stars swung around them it have a name hull saluus told him the military will give it a proper name when its time to hand it over though its a prototype probably not suitable for full military service desperate times thovin said shrugging picking something from between his teeth probably get used for something even if its just a missile thats what you think sal thought we havent quite got to that stage yet he said they were alone thovin had suggested a stroll through the mostly empty excivilian ship think were wasting our time here kehar thovin swung round to look at saluus his nearneckless head raised and tilted to him talking to the dwellers yes talking to the fucking dwellers probably but then our friend fassin taak is probably wasting his time if hes still alive looking for this transform that probably doesnt exist he was your friend wasnt he the guardgeneral said eyes narrowing old school pals right isnt it yes we went to school and college together weve kept in touch over the years matter of fact probably the last bit of r and r he got before delving into nasq was at my house on murla straight to guard academy for me thovin said changing tack again and looking away at the dartlike ship floating in space just outside that your escape route is it kehar he asked innocently not quite as stupid as you look are you sal thought where to he asked smiling the fuck out of harms way thats where thovin said keep your head down during the starveling occupation return when its safe you know i hadnt thought of that sal said why are you going to make me an offer for it wouldnt know how to fly it course you do that right it was no secret that saluus had flown the hull here himself he was a capable enough pilot anybody could be with a little training and a modicum of computer help frees one of our brave boys for the front line he told thovin deadpan be funny if we won against the invaders or the summed fleet lost eh hilarious think well get anything out of the floats i think our dweller pals have probably given us all were ever going to get but its still worthwhile keeping on looking uhhuh you think maybe the crew of one of their hyperweapons will suddenly decide itd be fun to defend sepekte just for the sheer hell of it or one of the scouts down in nasq will find the transform or fassin taak will just appear with it and we can all escape down a wormhole or bring in summed fleet ships from wherever we want who knows so were not wasting our time here no probably we are but what else could we be doing filling sandbags thovin almost smiled course if they did suddenly turn up with some fancy superweapon ship maybe we wouldnt need to build warships any more eh im sure kehar heavy industries could happily switch to building nothing but cruise ships sal looked round the viewing gallery they stood in i can see a few areas fit for improvement just standing here thovin nodded out at the slim dark ship cradled outside you would hand that over to the hierchon for his personal yacht if he asked for it wouldnt you sal thought for a moment id almost sooner destroy it he said thovin turned and looked at him expression open waiting im not kidding it really is a prototype sal said smiling you wouldnt put the head of state of an entire system in something as untried as that certainly not if you meant to take it up to anything near top speed which would kind of have to be the only reason for choosing it in the first place right ill entrust myself to the thing but i couldnt let the hierchon take it what if it killed him think of the publicity good grief man think of our share price thovin nodded for a few moments looking back at the ship missile then he said me too liss said quietly in the darkness i thought he was just an idiot kicked upstairs i think he does a good idiot act sal said actually i think hes probably as genuinely stupid as our dweller negotiators are genuinely naive maybe thovin should take over the talks doubt he could do any worse they were lying in bed on board the prototype ship it was more secure than staying on the liner or one of the other embassy support ships if also far less luxurious and much more cramped there was no absolute guarantee that somebody hadnt sneaked a bug aboard during the ships construction but saluus had had the craft built by his most trustworthy people and supervised the work as closely as he could it was as safe as anyplace to say things that you might not want others to hear do you think he was trying to make a deal get himself included if you did decide to escape saluus hesitated this was not something hed ever discussed straight out even with liss he was quite sure shed guessed that using the ship as a way out was a possibility so for that matter had thovin apparently which kind of made you wonder who else might regard it as obvious there was a slightly sweatinducing idea but there was nothing to gain for either of them in saying it out loud no sal said deciding against bringing that particular truth blinking into the light you know i actually thought that maybe thovins a kind of spy himself really i wouldnt be at all surprised if he reports to the hierchon direct or at least to the big guys top intelligence people i think all this roughasbricks bluff stuff is just a way of getting people to drop their guard with him fucker could be a traitorsniffer liss fitted her long body against his rubbing slowly gently he didnt sniff you then how could he sal said for i am straight and true ah yes sometimes if she was still holding him when she was falling asleep he would feel her fingers making strange patterns on his side or back as though her hands were trying to spell out some secret code of love then she would be asleep and stop or jerk awake as though embarrassed and roll away and curl up groggy again aboard the velpin still no idea yet how long they had taken the truetwin had just told the three of them that it would take some days to get to where they were going then to fassin and ysul when the sceuri couldnt see they had signalwhispered that thing about just trust us applies to you two too but shh right ysul and fassin had exchanged looks some days the travel time was nearinstant of course portal to portal it was the getting to and from the portals at either end that took days that and perhaps some sleightofcourse manoeuvres to fool anybody watching or following and trying to spot the hidden portals that way who knew quercer janath did of course but they werent telling wouldnt even contemplate any arguments about letting him or even just ysul stay awake during these bizarre so casuallytaken galaxyspanning transfers watching following how could you have all those ship movements and never be seen telescopes of every wavelength gravity sensors neutrino patternisers something somewhere in practically every developed system that kept a devastatingly detailed close eye on every sort of signal that ever emanated from space close near mid or far something had to show up or did they only have portals in undeveloped systems so that they had less chance of being observed no they had them in ulubis and ashum watching following followed by something small enough to be even less visible perhaps somebody something must have followed a dweller ship insystem somewhere and suddenly found itself plunging into a secret wormhole and yet apparently nobody and nothing ever had so casual so lackadaisical so lalala could it all be a perfect neverfailing act could the dwellers all really be geniuses at acting brilliant at stealth flawless exponents of the disciplines required to keep complete discipline for every single solitary journeytransferjumpwhatever dear reason and fate theyd had ten billion years to get perfect at anything they wanted who knew what skills theyd developed to perfection in that time yet there was still chaos extreme chance the simple stackingup of odds that something had to go wrong sometime no matter how close to perfection you could get coming round slowly rovruetz direaliete shit more names to deal with more places to take in another damn step along the way he would die forever following this elusive fuck of a dweller or accumulate such dislocation accrue so much summed grogginess that hed forget what the whole insane quest was for and find leisicrofe one day finally when it was all too late anyway and just stare at the fellow utterly unable to recall what it was he wanted to ask him or what it might be that the dweller could possibly have that would be remotely interesting or important to him the passenger compartment of the velpin was mostly taken up by the esuit of the sceuri called the aumapile of aumapile a huge whitestippled black lozenge like a strange distorting viewport into space fassin waking slowly feeling grubby and sore as usual couldnt even see ysul or the anyway useless screen on the far wall urgh the giant black esuit exclaimed so that is unconsciousness how disagreeable and i strongly suspect inherently so fassin was glad that somebody agreed he started checking out the arrowheads systems as he warmed them up again the left manipulator arm was proving sticky the selfrepair mechanisms reaching the limits of their abilities on past form it would sort of halfwork jerkily for a few realtime months and then jam completely he supposed he was lucky hed got this far without any equipment failure especially given the punishment the little gascraft had taken since the flight from third fury and yet interesting the sceuri announced voice booming round the nearfull space the aumapile of aumapile was even louder than ysul hmm it said yes interesting more than certainly are you two awake yet or am i first up haha either awake or having a very noisy nightmare ysul said testily and unseen from the creatures other side ditto said fassin super so are we there yet they were and they werent when the fuzzy screen cleared it showed they were in the middle layers of a gasgiant atmosphere the velpin had done some highspeed spinning after all and the zappingunconscious had been more rough and ready than before they had taken two days to get where they were going this their travelcaptain assured them was rovruetz direaliete a weather district and gas region of nhouaste the systems own gasgiant the aumapile of aumapile was delighted just as it had thought it fairly bounced out of the velpins gaslock into the vast shaded scape of towering rootclouds and horizonspanning raycanopies it twirled like a centrifuge from sheer happiness they spent another day perfectly undisturbed by any native dwellers investigating the supposedly toiler remains which actually looked remarkably like an abandoned dweller globecity sitting on top of a damaged and discarded megaklick bandturbine all very impressive but not fassin and ysul both realised what or where they were really looking for this is not rovruetz direaliete is it fassin asked the truetwin shortly after they arrived while the aumapile of aumapile dashed to and fro throughout the ruins calibrating instruments and grabbing screenage are you mad of course not direalietes on the far side of the galaxy take days to get there a system fassin asked a system ive no record of it fassin told the truetwin you wouldnt direaliete is its name in the old language well variant thereof so fassin sent this is just a trick correct our friend has what it wanted we have what we wanted two out of two one of our more successful missions meanwhile fassin sent were wasting time time wastes itself who are we to float in its way after offering to leave the breathless sceuri scholar behind and come back for it it wasnt quite that easily fooled and then telling it they really needed to be getting back now it declared there was too much it still had to look for quercer janath just abandoned the sceuri waiting until it had whirred off into the centre of the abandoned city before telling fassin that the aumapile of aumapile had finally seen sense and was coming aboard in a moment for the trip back getting the human and ysul secured and then closing the external doors and taking off warning their passengers there was some fairly intense spiralling ahead what the fuck fassin signalled to ysul before the gascrafts systems were shut down what about the sceuri the dweller had been in on it a good joke eh he sent back laughing fassin signalled at the wallscreen getting through to quercer janath in the command space did you warn the aumapile you were about to leave yes fassin waited no more came after a few moments he sent and didnt believe us laughed so youre just abandoning this fabulously wealthy apparently politically wellconnected dwellernaive idiot in a gasgiant in its home system about sums it up cant say we didnt warn him it conditions of passage dont you think it might get hunted or just die anyway fassin asked or get back home eventually deeply annoyed suppose its a possibility keep going get back home eventually deeply annoyed with all dwellers and that that might be a bad thing for the dwellers who live in nhouaste point could cause friction kudos loss maybe we should have warned somebody we were leaving the flopbacked suckpuncture behind thinking suggestion know well send a signal happy fassin didnt even get time to reply no more talk time switch off now start spiralling the archimandrite luseferous reviewed his forces the nearest parts were right here within the curved concentric hulls of the main battle craft luseferous vii they were his space and ground crack troops all stood at attention by their sleek allenvironments attack craft and highskillspec weaponry the warships support craft troop carriers landers bombardment monitors harrier drones missile carriers scout and surveillance machines and other vessels plus miscellaneous heavy devices he could discern stretching as far as the unaided eye could see into the distance were just projections but they were live realtime and mostly clustered within a few light seconds of the invasion fleets core whose absolute steely heart was the main battle craft luseferous vii this was in a way the archimandrites favourite bit he had made a tradition of reviewing his forces like this before every major engagement and especially before every system invasion simply because it was such an astoundingly rewarding experience even the feeling of victory achieved of having crushed and overcome of having utterly prevailed was hardly any better than this when all the forces that would soon be thrown into the unavoidable mess and untidiness of battle getting killed and shot up and dirty and lost and damaged and so on stood or sat or lay or hovered or flew in perfect formation before him gleaming serried grouped exactly aligned neatly laid out symmetrically and systematically arranged all just glistening with power and threat and promise he stood on the reviewing balcony at one end of the vast curved series of halls that formed the layered outer hulls of the giant ship and took a series of deep breaths eyes wide heart pounding god or truth it was a beautiful sight this was in a way genuinely better than sex they were coasting in now most of the deceleration completed just one final burst of a few days weight and discomfort to come another week and they would be in the system finally attacking they had encountered little opposition so far partly due to the high angled course theyd taken any mine clouds and drone flocks that might have been set out to trap them would have been thrown across the more direct approaches and by taking this longer but safer line theyd avoided them all so far the only danger had lain in their midcourse correction subjective years earlier when their drives might have shown up on any deepspace monitoring systems in ulubis had they been turned in the right direction the risk had been slight and as far as they could tell theyd got away with it at any rate no fleet had emerged from ulubis to do battle they had decided to wait and fight on their own doorsteps his tacticians thought this indicated that ulubis was prepared but weak they might encounter some probe and destroyerlevel craft but that would probably be all until they hit the mid and inner system his admirals were confident their laser ships and close defence units could deal with anything else that might have been sent out to get in their way luseferous became aware of noises at his back where some of his more senior commanders were permitted to stand backed in turn by his personal guards there were whispers and hushing noises of fear and exasperation he felt his body stiffen now would not be a good time to bother him with anything other than the imminent destruction of the whole fleet they had to know that the people behind him quieted down he relaxed stood more upright in the spinproduced threequarter gravity and breathed deeply again gazing out at the assembled men and materiel oh this was a sweet and beautiful sight indeed this was the very image of invincibility an utterly thrilling spectacle of power made solid and real and uncompromising this was his this was him the imminent destruction of the whole fleet he imagined that happening imagined it happening right now some cataclysmic hyperweapon of the ancients wiping out the entire invasion force without anyone being able to do anything to stop them nonsense well vanishingly unlikely anyway but just think of it hed be able to watch everything here just blink out of existence one by one or explode in flames or bright blasts of light hed be able to watch it all being destroyed around him the idea made him shiver half in horror half in delight it was never going to happen of course but the image alone was terrifyingly exciting and a sort of warning of course not from any god or from some program running the universe as the truth saw it but from something more trustworthy and direct from inside himself his subconscious or some monitoring partpersonality playing the part of the fool who always stood at caesars side in a triumph reminding him that all was vanity that sort of thing the thoughts of destruction were just him reminding himself to take nothing for granted to concentrate and take full control to prosecute the coming war with his usual ruthlessness and ignore any internal whining voices preaching moderation or unwarranted mercy be cruel and merciful always for a purpose never just to satisfy some selfimage somebody had said that he would never forget it one last deep breath so prepared and forearmed still the mood had sort of been broken no real damage done by the hint of interruption earlier he would be justified all the same in being angry if he needed to be better see what all the fuss had been about he swivelled on his heels pulled himself up to his full height always have senior commanders you could look down on and said loudly yes he loved to see these proud vainglorious men flinch these men used to being obeyed instantly and without question cower even fractionally before him tuhluer perhaps his least annoying aidedecamp and lately something of a favourite came forward smiling and frowning at the same time sir sorry about the disturbance a moment earlier he gave a tiny flex of the eyebrows as if to say not my fault you know what some of these guys are like ops alert just in highspeed craft coming direct from ulubis signalling unarmed no warhead one or two human occupants wanting to talk already slowing to match with us in ten hours on its current course that will leave it a hundred klicks off fleet centre leftlevel the archimandrite glared over tuhluers head at the others and this required my intervention warhead worries sir tuhluer said smoothly with a small smile the craft was passing the leading units of the fleets forward destroyer screen at the time and was about to go out of their effective beamweapon range question was whether to shoot or not now moot the ship will be in range of the second defensive layer in half an hour or there are missiles of course a drone missilecarrier has already been launched in pursuit the archimandrite luseferous paused a moment then smiled he could see them all relax well then he said everything appears to be functioning as it should and i did not need to be disturbed did i indeed not sir his aidedecamp agreed ruefully and what is the alleged status of this human or humans if indeed that is what the thing contains the claim is that theres a man aboard a highranking industrialist called saluus kehar the grogginess again the tired gritty grubby feeling fassin was sure he was coming round more and more slowly each time and finding himself duller slower and more confused with each new reawakening over forty days travel on this transition to the other side of the galaxy fully ninety kiloyears from ulubis not that such measurements meant much the inwormhole time would still have been trivial the extra days and weeks had been taken up by the flight from the portal to the ship they were looking for deep in interstellar space some days a distance all just more time gone more distance between him and whatever he was trying to accomplish while events back at ulubis moved on without him he tested the arrowheads faulty left manipulator arm flexing and tensing it then forced himself to look at the screen on the far wall stars swung as ever then became just the backdrop to a vast dark gnarled craft a giant torusshaped ship two hundred kilometres in diameter all black gleaming ribs and fractured facets glinting in the weak light of a fardistant sun like a great rough crown of wet coal the cineropoline sepulcraft rovruetz a vessel of the ythyns vastly dispersed greater expiratory fleet a deathcarrier ysul studied the image on the screen from the far side of the chamber for a moment then shook his mantles we must mix amongst morbs he said sounding sleepy grumpy and resigned all at once oh great so what happened to the toilers fassin asked i thought leisicrofe was supposed to be investigating toilers next obviously they toiled in vain ysul sent a mislead a bluff the velpin hung above a graveyard of ships scattered across the outer rim of the death carrier while ysul and fassin crossed to the giant ship the ythyn had suggested that the velpin might enter the rovruetz quercer janath had demurred with what looked convincingly like a shiver of horror inside their silvery overall fassin got the impression that just being close to the sepulcraft and its ancient collection of crumbling lifeless ships was bad enough for them the ythyn were a scavenger species with a speciality they collected the dead they did nothing with them just stored them sorted roughly by category type and size and they usually only collected those bodies and sometimes the ships and other devices they arrived on that nobody else wanted but it was still an irredeemably macabre habit and as a result they shared a generic nickname with other deathobsessed species having become known as morbs fassin and ysul were welcomed in the cavernous gently lit entrance hall by a ythyn officer a great dark avian three metres tall in a glistening neartransparent slicksuit over skin like dark blue parchment tightly bound double wings which fully stretched would have spread a dozen metres indicated the ythyn was a junior it stood on an uneven tripod of legs one thick limb to the rear two thinner ones in front the creatures lipped beak was inlaid with precious metals glittering under the gel of the slicksuit its two eyes were huge roundels of black thin curved pipes led from its nostril gratings to sets of small tanks on its back like spherical eggs of tarnished silver there were no atmospherelocks on an ythyn ship the crew like their dead charges spent their entire time in hard vacuum exposed only to that hushed nothingness enclosed by the great ship and so kept within a few degrees of absolute zero the bodies of the dead could lie undisturbed and uncorrupted by nothing more than whatever had killed them and by the effects of their slow or sudden freezing for aeons you are welcome the ythyn officer told them in a flat unaccented signal prefixed only by formal signifiers for sadness and reverence you are mr taak and you are mr ysul yes yes fassin sent i am duty receptioneer ninth lapidarian i am happy and honoured to be known as ninth or just duty tell me have either of you two gentlemen made any arrangements for the treatment or disposal of your bodies after death the ythyn had been collecting the dead for a billion years the result of a kind of gruesome technocurse visited upon them by a species they had fought against and been utterly defeated by they had lost their small empire lost their few planets lost their major habitats and most of their ships and they had even lost themselves coerced into a programme of genetic amendment that turned them from intellectually rounded beings into creatures utterly obsessed with death the cruelty and cleverness of their vanquishers had lain in identifying and choosing a latent weakness congenital to the ythyn they had always been a little overly fascinated with mortality compared with the norm of vaguely similar species but not to the stage of serious abnormality and certainly not to the point that it in any way defined them and if they had been so grotesquely psychologically disfigured in the process of making them so excessively morbid that they ceased to be identifiably themselves there would have been no artistry no fitness in their punishment instead by this subtle but significant tweaking of their own bodies instruction set they became what they might have become anyway had some bizarre shiftings in their environment and circumstances so decreed those who had not taken their own lives and refused to submit to the inheritable amendment were killed or hunted down and forced to undergo the treatment anyway though most of those so treated killed themselves as well the survivors became wanderers one of the dozens of planetevolved species denied or in a few cases eschewing any sort of home world they built massive cold dark ships and accrued enormous libraries and data reservoirs filled with the subject of death they haunted the sites of great battles terrible massacres and awful disasters over time they began to gather the unclaimed dead from such sites storing them more or less as they found them in their great airless ships each carrying a cargo of collected death plodding from one end of the galaxy to the other or gradually spiralling around it too big for wormhole travel loath even to approach too close to a star the sepulcraft depended on smaller ships to harvest the dead even these rarely used wormholes these days the propylaea which had charge of all the mercatorias portals was not a charity and demanded money for passage the ythyn had little to offer in payment they collected ships from those bringing the dead or themselves to die but those were usually hulks wrecks or near the end of their useful working lives and anyway regarded by the ythyn as sacred amongst the dead themselves there were occasional donations and bequests from many different societies but they were few and far between when they could afford to and there were bodies to be got from the far end of a wormhole an ythyn ship would spend the little collateral it had accumulated and send a needle craft to make the collection but usually they just physically followed the galaxys generally sporadic instances of mass death that they had long since dutifully gathered up the remaining bodies of the nowextinct species which had inflicted their punishment upon them and could therefore relatively easily and without resistance have reamended themselves back to their original selves but had chosen not to was either their most poignant tragedy of all or a recognition that they had found a place within the galactic scheme of things that suited them better than might any other we are on our way to the chistimonouth system duty receptioneer ninth lapidarian told the dweller and the human as they made their way along a vast curved corridor deep within the giant ship the tall birdlike being used one of its two thin forelegs to manipulate the controls of a small cagelike car that carried them in perfect silence along a monorail set in the centre of the wide tunnel it was perfectly dark too they were having to use active sensing to illuminate the seemingly neverending corridor we seek the mortal remains of a newly contacted serpenterian civilisation a possible offshoot of the desiichau themselves lamentably no more extinct or at the very best deep within the fifth category of abatement unadopted which fell prey sadly to a series of solar flares some centuries ago the sole inhabited planet was sorely affected of the single sentient species thereon it is believed that no living trace remains it will be our privilege and our duty when we arrive there in another few decades to inter within these hallowed halls as many of the stillunburied as we are able how will they be unburied ysul asked do they float wont they all have sunk into their own depths into water or mud or dissolved rock or something the corridors were lined with the dead stapled pinned stitched or icewelded to the tubular surface the concept of floors walls and ceilings had some meaning while the ship was under power but it was temporary a few body types were best preserved in cavities alcoves sealed with diamond leaf those happily buried will be left where they lie underground duty told them some remains are expected in structures even after all this time the reports we have had from scouter species indicate that there may be many unclaimed cadavers still in space at lagrange points what if theyre all gone ysul asked what if somebodys beaten you to it and eaten them or recycled them or something then we will make our way to the next location where we may honour the dead the dark bird told them imperturbable come to think of it ysul said brightly there might be a few bods to pick up in a place called ulubis fairly soon fassin looked at the dweller but he wasnt paying any attention ulubis duty said i have not heard of this place is it a planet system ysul said home of the planet nasqueron in stream quaternary one of the southern tendril reefs ah yes rather far away from here lots of humans there and another lot on their way ysul said probably going to be a war lot of deaths id imagine you collect humans we have difficulties only with certain cincturian species the birdcreature told them humans we have heard of and accommodated in the past though not on this craft i shall pass on your information at the earliest opportunity to our most proximate sepulcraft they may well be aware already of course and possibly on their way even as we speak however we are grateful for your thoughtfulness my pleasure ysul said sounding pleased with himself he glanced at fassin what fassin looked away they were passing bodies spread against the tunnels surface like small solidified explosions of rock palonne their guide informed them ossile obviously victims of war subject to a parasitic stonerot virus of some sort fascinating ysul said are we nearly at this leisicrofe fellow yet duty looked at a small display clipped to one of his cinchedin wings another few hundred metres whats he up to here anyway ysul asked up to the ythyn sounded uncertain just studying you people is he why no no of course not the ythyn officer was silent for a moment oh dear fassin and ysul exchanged looks fassin said youre not saying hes dead are you well yes of course this is a sepulcraft gentlemen i was under the impression that you simply wanted to see the body the news came while she was asleep taince watched an hoursold recording of the faint sidewaysseen blueshifted glimmers approaching from the direction of the e discon as the starveling invasion fleet started braking for its arrival in ulubis system the invaders would take nearly three months to reach ulubis the summed fleet was still four months travel away including its own more dramatic deceleration regime due to start in a little more than eighty days the fleet tacticians had learned quite a lot just from the braking profile of e discons fleet first it was big a thousand ships or more unless there was something outlandishly clever going on with dummy drive signatures second it was staying ninetyfive per cent together with only a few dozen smaller ships venturing ahead of the main fleet this might imply a significant straightthrough brakingbeyond force still hidden though from the rest of the profile this didnt look so likely the size definition and shiftedfrequency signatures of the drives themselves revealed a relatively slow oldtech vesselcapability envelope basically all but the lightest craft in the summed fleet force would be able to take on all but the heaviest of the invaders ships with a better than average chance of prevailing and anything that couldnt be outfought could be outrun for whatever that was worth when there was nowhere to run to and there was one behemoth in there a giant ship probably a commandandcontrol lander and troopcarrier plus facilitiesandrepair vessel at least a billion tonnes klicks across doubtless very heavily armoured and armed and escorted but a classic gradea highvalue target a possible kingpiece a backbreaker if it could be successfully engaged and destroyed or taken out of action or even captured just posting a powerfulenough guardship screen to try and keep it safe in the event of a serious attack threat would significantly sap the invading occupying forces abilities cut down their dispositional options and drastically curtail their splitregroup capacity the fleet tacticians had been positively cruel about this dinosaur of a ship a vanity piece they called it an idiot aboard sign hung round the neck of the enemy fleet every spacefaring species that built warcraft quickly found out one way or another often the hard way that big ships just didnt work except as a hideously expensive way of impressing the more credulous type of native flexibility manoeuvrability low unit riskcost distributed inherent damage resistance fully parsed battlespace sideblind denotation control grammar these and other even more arcane concepts were what really mattered in modern space warfare apparently and a really big ship just didnt sit too comfortably with any of them the tacticians pretty much spoke their own language were mostly very intense and blinked a lot so a strong point thats really a weak point taince had suggested at one of their briefings that would be a viable alternative definition one of them said after a moment or twos thought since just a week ago though relatively little evidence of further activity well the discon invaders had arrived later than anticipated and the summed fleet forces were arriving earlier deliberate on their part of course the invaders would have quickly found out when ulubis had been told to expect the summed fleets arrival and it was always prudent to keep the enemy off balance to upset their assumptions let them think they had so much time and then arrive early before theyd got everything prepared smiting it was all about smiting that was one of admiral kisipts favourite words the voehn fleet commander knew it in several hundred different languages including earth anglish be ready at all times to smite the enemy strike with speed decisiveness and weight taince found herself lightly smitten with one of the junior male officers discovered it was mutual and took part in some invasive tussling of her own the time displays ticked down steadily towards the point where theyd have to get back into their lonely little individual pods again for the deceleration burn that would bring them down from nearlight speed to something close to ulubiszero for the start of the attack the cineropoline sepulcraft rovruetz spun very slowly beneath the velpin still gently accelerating for its distant target system and its unburied cargo of the longdead the velpin was tracking round the outer rim of the giant craft senses primed fassin and ysul were back aboard they had been shown to the lifeless body of leisicrofe icewelded to the side of the great dark corridor in the company of a halfdozen other dead dwellers very well preserved as you see duty receptioneer ninth lapidarian had pointed out i hope you feel this setting is appropriate the ythyn officer had still been upset at the earlier misunderstanding so he just died then ysul had asked very suddenly apparently we found him drifting rolling along in his esuit actually a few days after he arrived he had expressed an interest in mapping the distribution of bodies of different species and speciestypes while he was here we saw no reason not to allow him to do so they werent permitted to use reaction motors inside the sepulcraft ysul had used his esuited spinearms to push himself over to the side of the tunnel hed landed awkwardly by the dwellers body which was naked save for a small hubcloth i have no idea whether this is this leisicrofe guy or not frankly ysul had said but it is a dweller probably from nasqueron and he is most certainly dead any sign of anything fassin asked ysul had inspected the body using lights and radarsense finding nothing hed unclipped the corpses hubcloth and shaken it fassin had sensed their ythyn host preparing to object but a moment later ysul had replaced the hubcloth and was looking round the back of the body where ice attached it to the tunnel wall nothing hed sent back there one half of quercer janath said on one of the velpins screens a flickering outline appeared around one of the abandoned ships littering the carbuncularly irregular outer hull of the sepulcraft fassin looked at the craft it was a simple black ellipsoid maybe sixty metres long deepspace cold lifeless that it ysul asked you sure its a dweller ailpurpose singleoccupancy standard pattern soloship the truetwin told them and it pings recent can you wake its systems fassin asked find out where it was last where it came from the travelcaptain looked at him doesnt work like that pay attention they got permission from the ythyn to lift the soloship and join it to the velpin they warmed it up and introduced a standard gasgiant atmosphere there was just about enough room for ysul and fassin to board together quercer janath had already lasersynched the little ships closeddown computer matrix to that of the velpin the screens tanks surfaces and other displays flickered steadied and shone the craft beeped and clicked around them it still felt cold ysul knocked and tapped a few of the more obviously delicatelooking bits of machinery with his hubarms you getting anything he asked the truetwin was staying on board the larger craft theres stuff in the log one half told them thats sailortalk for diary no saying ysul said truly but its not accessible from here youll have to input from there how exactly fassin asked how should we know not our ship experiment they experimented the correct technique involved ysul pressing in to a dwellershaped doublealcove sensory nook and pressing four glyphboard icons on four different glyphboards at once the main screen stopped showing stars and the darkly glittering hull of the sepulcraft and started showing what looked like the interior of a small library instead ysul reached out into the virtual space and pulled down a book whose spine said log he opened it a motionless dweller hub faced them in closeup well ysul said that certainly looks like the stiff in the big space hearse we can see him should be a play button try hitting it gee ysul said thank fuck you guys are there he hit play taince yarabokin woke from a light sleep to a lowlevel alarm telling her not even to think about instigating a podquit regime she swung to the exterior foreview display and looked out ulubis glowed sharp and blue ahead a tiny sun amongst the surrounding scrape of stars at last the blueness was a function of the ship and the fleets colossal speed hammering into the light waves compressing wavelength taince switched from lr sensors to shipstate a fierce and terrible force pulled at everything theyd started their final deceleration burn the majority of the fleet was losing speed hard piling up a hundred or more gravities as it braked for the approach to and arrival at ulubis system still over a month away another group of ships one full squadron of sixty vessels was not decelerating so rapidly a dozen were not slowing at all and would maintain full speed all the way to and most of the way through the system their crews and systems trained over hundreds of simulations for an ultrahighspeed pass across ulubis planetary system which would last for less than four hours in that time less than twenty days from now they would have to collect and evaluate all the data they could on the thencurrent state of the system and then both signal their intelligence back to the ships behind and choose a suite of attack profiles from a vast menu of possibilities they carried in their data banks before loosing all the munitions they could against whatever hostiles they had identified they hoped the pickings would be rich for them theyd be arriving with little warning only a month after the starveling fleet had struck with luck the situation would be fluid and the e discon forces wouldnt have had time to organise their defences properly then even before those advance ships were all the way through the system they would begin their own still more violent deceleration to come to a stop a light month beyond and get back to ulubis weeks after the main fleet had arrived at best to help with the mopping up at worst to deliver a retaliatory hammerblow the remainder of the advanceattack squadron would pass through the system in small groups of ships their arrival staggered unpredictable distributed their tactics in part defined by whatever the highspeed craft had discovered with luck with what they hoped and trusted was a good battleplan the waves of war craft each able to spend more fighting time in the system than its immediate predecessor would deliver a succession of softeningup blows against the enemy rocking it unbalancing it confusing and bloodying it the main body of the fleet arriving like a bunched fist would just provide one final massive knockout punch their drive light would precede them of course there would be no complete surprise the starveling invasion had given the defenders of ulubis even more warning not that there was much they could have done with it the e discon fleet had slowed right down shut its drives off almost as one while still a few days out well within the systems oort shell then slowed further as its lead ships crossed the boundary into the planetary system for the next few weeks after the drive signatures meshed with the ulubis system and shut off when the invasion must have been at its height there had been a lot of weaponblink much of it had been around the planets sepekte and nasqueron my name is leisicrofe of hepieu nasqueron equatorial this is my last testament i will presume that whoever you are you have followed me for the data which i carried on behalf of my fellow dweller the scholar valseir of schenehen if you have not and this recording has fallen to you in what one might term a casual manner it may be of little interest if however you do seek the data i held then i must tell you now that you are going to be disappointed something in fassin seemed to break and fall away uhoh ysul said this may seem unfortunate and may make you angry however i have most likely done you a considerable favour as it is my sincere and firm belief that what i was asked to carry was something i should not have been and something that nobody should have been or should be asked to take responsibility for it was not something i was supposed to know about of course and it was not really valseirs fault that i came into possession of the knowledge of what it represented talks a lot doesnt he ysul said to my shame i think i must be more shallow than my friend valseir gave me credit for he gave me the data sealed in a safekeep box and asked me not to open it i said i would not he did not even ask me for my word thinking i am sure that simply asking a friend and fellow scholar such a thing and receiving such an assurance was guarantee enough however i am not like valseir i am inquisitive by nature not as the result of an intellectual fascination with any particular subject i resisted the urge to open the safekeep box for many years while i was on my travels but eventually i surrendered to temptation i opened the safekeep i began to read what was inside and realised its importance even then i might have stopped reading closed the box and put it away again and had i done that i would still be alive instead i carried on reading and this has resulted in my death i can only claim that perhaps i was in a sort of trance of disbelief at the time more likely taken some recreational substances ysul snorted and so i came to hold within myself the knowledge the meaning of that which i had been asked to keep safe rather than just having charge of the medium containing it realising what i now knew and comprehending that it was of inestimable value i came to the conclusion that i could not be trusted with it while not entirely understanding what i had read i could not forget it i could tell others and it was not impossible that i might be made to tell what i knew through the use of drugs or more direct intervention with my brain and mind nutter ysul said whats that one of quercer janath said distantly over the open link to the velpin hmm dont know it didnt sound like they were paying attention to what was being said by the recording of leisicrofe i will not pretend that i had not been thinking of my own death for some time however it was habitually within the context of having completed my studies into the many differing forms of the cincturia and publishing a learned i had even hoped an atthetime definitive work on this my chosen and beloved field of study knowing what i now know i have thought it best however reluctantly to curtail my studies forthwith and kill myself as soon as may decently be achieved i shall do so here in the ythyn cineropoline sepulcraft rovruetz where my death will at least appear to have a fraction more meaning than it might have had elsewhere looks like or fassin heard over the open channel ping it no are you shut off that the open channel closed fassin looked back to the access hatch and the short shiptoship connecting them to the velpin leisicrofe was still speaking will forgive me you should if you know what it is you are looking for then all i will say is that it looked more like a code and frequency not what i believe was expected but it is quite gone now destroyed along with the safekeep box itself thrown into the sun called direaliete i know of no other copy if none of this makes any sense to you then please respect an old and as it turns out foolish dwellers last wish and leave him here in peace the recording froze and an endmessage signal flashed fassin stared at the image of the dead dweller it was over hed failed maybe now there was no way ever to find out whether the dweller list meant anything or even had ever meant anything totally mad ysul said with something like a sigh he fiddled with the glyphboard controls looks like thats our lot he turned to fassin doesnt sound too hopeful does it young humanmelad the open channel from the ship clicked on suddenly get out quercer janath screamed ten seconds to get off there and back in the velpin being attacked must run fassin shook himself out of his shock and started backing towards the open hatch leading to the velpin ysul pulled out of the sensorynook began to follow one hublimb scratching at his mantle this madness is obviously contag fucking voehn ship

shiptoship joining the velpin and the dweller soloship started to close before fassin got to it ysul was still behind him moving quickly along the exit fassin swung through flipped turned and grabbed the hatchs moving edge with his left manipulator the closing hatch nearly took the manipulator off fassin was swung around by the force of it and found himself having to brace with his other manipulator against the lock interior struggling to keep the hatch grinding mechanism humming mightily from closing somebody holding that hatch open one half of quercer janath shouted indignantly out the way fassin ysul yelled rising fast straight out of the shiptoship and colliding heavily with fassins gascraft sending the two of them tumbling through the lock and into the velpins interior errorfailure messages from the gascrafts left manipulator arm crowded against one edge of fassins field of vision the hatch slammed shut behind them immediately a great force smashed them against the compartments sternward bulkhead they were stuck there unmoving the arrowhead snagged over the dwellers tipped left discus until the increasing acceleration and a series of sharp vibrations made fassin slide off one edge of ysuls carapace and whack down onto the carbon bulkhead by his side the ship roared around them engines are on one takes it ysul said wheezing fassin could feel the apparent gravity building still further they were at something over twenty gee already a young fit dweller with no esuit protection stuck on his side against an inelastic surface could take about twentyfour twentyfive gees continuous before their carapace just collapsed and turned their insides to mush the velpins acceleration topped out at twentytwo gees all right back there their travelcaptain asked not really fassin said youre kind of near crushing ysul acknowledged not outrunning the fucker cant cut off and come about surrender agree the acceleration snapped off fassin and ysul were instantly weightless rebounding fractionally from the bulkhead just by the released compression in the hull of one and the carapace of the other get up here you two quercer janath told them the voehn ship was a klicklong needle spined with swingguns and weapon tubes it came quickly up on them and was alongside by the time the human in his gascraft and the dweller ysul got to the velpins control space since when do the voehn choose to attack dweller craft going about their the travelcaptain began to ask be quiet said an imageless voice make yourself ready for boarding quercer janaths shiny suit rustled as the truetwin turned to look at fassin and ysul while tapping some controls images of the velpin appeared in holo displays showing hatches and doors flashing in outline the voehn have turned pirates quercer janath told them calmly how fucking dare they ysul roared they didnt follow us through the wormhole did they fassin asked ha no the truetwin seemed purely amused no they were waiting in this system assume well see why shortly the fucking scumbag bastards will pay grievously for this outrage ysul yelled shaking with fury a shudder rang through the velpin and alarms started blaring quercer janath roted closer to a brightly flashing display look at that penetrated amidships with a cutthrough cameras briefly showed a thick tube extending from the middle of the voehn ship into a neat circular hole in the hull of the velpin then the images crazed and faded other displays started to disappear the alarms warbled down to a croak then shut off fassin thought he could smell burning and us cooperatively opening all our orifices fucking typical here they come thundering through another display showed an abstract of large beings pouring through the breach and spreading through the ship bouncing off surfaces in the zerogee the largest force was coming straight towards the control space then that display shut down too all the lights went out the background noises of the ship hardly noticed until they ceased just faded away a ragged pulse of what sounded like heavy steps came pounding from the closed door leading to the velpins central corridor probably going to zap us soon as they quercer janath began then the door punctured with a coughing noise and something small flew into the middle of the control space and exploded into a million barbs like dust ahha though what got us was a fucking emp cannon aimed at the ships vulnerables indeed so there we are and here indeed see what happens see what happens better ship anyway fassin was being carried within a sort of transparent braced sack by two big creatures like giant eightlegged dogs in mirrorarmour one at either end he was still in the velpin the cutthrough tube was a great pipe with a slanted hole like the end of a massive syringe plunged into the guts of the ship the two voehn commandos flicked him and themselves up the tube and into the voehn ship with neareffortless ease fassin confused senses ringing unable to move peered through the transparent material of the prisonstretcher and caught a glimpse of another two voehn behind him carrying ysul similarly wrapped they went through a rotatelock the voehn ship was dark inside faintly redlit it was in hard vacuum like the sepulcraft the wrapping round the little gascraft ballooned taut fassin ysul and the truetwin were taken through another lock and into a pressurised slightly heated circular chamber the wrappings around them collapsed again they were settled into something like dentseats and clamped there with thickly shining restraints they were halfunwrapped from their transparent covers sufficient for them to be able to hear and see and speak the warriors tested their bonds and then left fassin looked around as best he could ysul and the travelcaptain appeared still to be unconscious ysuls ruffmantles waving limply in the free fall and quercer janath still in the shiny coveralls floating seemingly lifeless in the dentseat the chamber was plain just a flattened ovoid filled with a gasgiant atmosphere entirely breathable by a dweller but that didnt smell quite right light came dimly from every surface a hint of gravity built up producing about a quarter standard a door appeared and irised open closing behind a trio of voehn two of the mirrorarmoured commandos and another wearing just a torsouniform decorated with various insignia and a holstered side arm he stood and looked at the three prisoners the great grey snoutface and fistsized multiplelidded eyes turning fractionally as he directed his attention from one to another he arched his long body and flexed his back spines raising all ten with what looked like a sensual motion blizzardskin on the voehns spines scintillated like a minutely shattered mirror fassin trying hard not to lose consciousness again thought dreamily of the screen series hed watched as a child attack squad voehn had that been its name and struggled to recall what the uniforms and insignia might indicate remembering only slowly the voehn in the uniform was a prime commander a multitalent top guy here certainly significantly overranked for a ship this size unless it was on a special mission ohoh one of the mirrorarmour soldiers waved a handheld instrument at them watching a display he barely glanced at the results from fassin and ysul then did a double take when the device was aimed at quercer janath he altered a few controls swept the machine over the truetwins still lifelesslooking body again and said something to the voehn commander who moved over looked at the display and made a small swaying motion with his head he clicked the machine off and came over to the prisoners saying something as though to one of his decorations the restraints holding the gascraft and the two dweller bodies slid back into the floor the voehn commander took off a glove and ran one leatherylooking hand over the surface of the little gascraft then ysuls carapace then felt the shiny membrane covering quercer janath he looked for and found a catch and opened the coverall up so that it hung down over the transparent material the prisoners had all been trussed in the commander looked very closely at quercer janaths signal skin and seemed to sniff it he looked at fassin youre awake already his voice was quiet with a deep gurgling quality reply im awake fassin acknowledged he tried moving his left manipulator more errordamage messages he moved his right manipulator and shifted fractionally in the dentseat aside from the partial constriction of the transparent material covering the gascrafts rear he was actually fairly free to move even the prisonerwrap felt like it would shuck off without too much difficulty the voehn reached for something in his uniform pocket and waved it at ysul who jerked once and then shook for a few moments fringe mantles stiffening and limbs quivering warrgh he said the commander went to point the device at quercer janath who said quite cheerfully already awake actually thanks all the same the voehn looked through slitted eyes at the truetwin for a moment then pocketed the device again and moved back to take in the view of all three prisoners the two mirrorarmoured guards stood on either side of where the door had appeared the commander sat back a fraction resting on his rear legs and tail crossing his forearms to the point i am commander inialcah of the summed fleet special forces division ultraship protreptic you are in every sense mine we know what you have been looking for we have been waiting for somebody to come here we are combing your ship for data hidden or otherwise but we dont expect to find anything germane we have authority covering all eventualities that means we can do anything we want with or to you that latitude will not need to be exploited if you cooperate fully and answer any questions honestly and completely now you are the dwellers known as ysul and quercer janath and the human fassin taak correct ysul grunted hi the travelcaptain replied correct fassin said he could see ysul moving working his body as though to get rid of the prisonwrap oh no dont do this he thought he was about to say it when who the fuck do you fucking think you are you piratical pipsqueak ysul bellowed the dweller wriggled free from the transparent material and floated above the dentseat the two guards by the doorway didnt even start to move the commander arms still crossed watched as the dweller roted up to him towering over him how fucking dare you start attacking a ship and taking people hostage do you know who i am go back to your seat the commander said voice level thats probably quite good ad the truetwin began go back to your fucking own planet ysul roared and stretched out a hublimb to push the voehn the voehn commander seemed to disappear in a blur of movement as though all along hed been a hologram and was now dissolving into individual pixels rearranging into a grey cloud shot through with rainbow shards ysul shuddered once and was sent sailing serenely back colliding with the wall behind the dentseat and the discarded prisonwrap he hung there then revolved backwards and fell slowly to the floor spinning gradually downward along his rim like a coin on a table the voehn commander was sitting where and how he had been unruffled that was not cooperating fully he said voice soft urgh ysul said thickly his carapace held two dents one on each discus rim there was another large brokenlooking bruise on his inner hub that was serious damage for a dweller the equivalent of a broken limb or two and perhaps a compressed skull fracture for a human fassin hadnt even seen quite how the voehn commander had hit ysul hed have gone back for a replay but the little gascrafts systems seemed to have been zapped and they werent providing any recording ability oh fuck he thought were all going to die and the only one they can torture properly is me he saw himself peeled prised out of the gascraft like a snail from its shell ysul drew himself very slowly upright again shaking slightly he was mumbling something unintelligible quercer janath turned very slowly looked at the dweller and then turned back to the commander with your permission sir what the voehn asked like to aid our fellow go ahead the travelcaptain let the prisonwrap fall to the floor then moved over to ysul and guided the injured dweller back to his dentseat ysul continued to talk nonsense somewhere beneath the level of clear comprehension with a noise like a sigh the truetwin settled into its own housing sparing one more look for ysul still trembling and mumbling to himself we are not here to play games we are here to discover truth the voehn commander told them the complete truth may save you anything else will surely be your ruin the protreptic is a lustral order special forces ship generally charged with the hunting down and extermination of anathematics that is the obscenities commonly called ais we have unbounded authority on this mission as on all our missions you are entirely within our control and will cooperate without question or reserve or will suffer accordingly i hereby deem you to have understood fully everything i have told you thus far ah well quercer janath said the truetwin sounded mildly peeved as though it hadnt been listening to the commander at all and had just heard something moderately discomfiting over an internal radio link the instrument one of the guards had pointed at the three prisoners now slung on a strap across his back glowed through red to yellow and spat tiny sparks the soldier moved almost as quickly as the commander turning and twisting and pulling the device off his back to throw it to the floor it skidded and thudded against the curve of the wall smoking the commander looked at it for a moment then turned calmly back to look at the prisoners again neat trick he said sounding amused whos the showoff he looked at fassin the two guards had levelled their guns at them one pointing directly at fassin the other between ysul and the truetwin ah guilty commander said quercer janath breezily but heck thats nothing watch this the dim grey glow that came from every surface suddenly brightened wildly leaving them all the two dwellers the three voehn and fassin himself seeming to float in the midst of an insanely bright flare of novabright light it was as though theyd all been instantly dropped into the surface of a sun fassin heard himself yelp and felt automatics in the gascrafts senses snap their burnout defences down very heavy again and very suddenly fassin could see the light he could swear it was coming through the hull of the gascraft hitting his closed human eyes three great thumps sounded shaking the air echoing round the chamber somewhere in the middle of this he opened his visuals enough to see them all hanging black blobs in light and tiny bright crimson lines of still greater brilliance joining the voehn to quercer janath stupidly for a moment he waited to see the travelcaptain explode or get thrown back but the great circular shape roted back barely at all it was the voehn who were getting thrown all over the place sudden silence sudden darkness blind again fassin let the gascraft open up the equivalent of one eye until it was at normal exposure there had been some damage but he could still see there was a surprising amount of infrared radiation he looked at where it was coming from it was coming from the voehn they glowed one of the guards lay spread opened against the curved wall by the doorway the other was face down two forelimbs blown off halfway between the door and the place where the commander had been the commander was making his way jerkily towards the tall figure of quercer janath the commanders head had been half blown off a side of skull hanging twitching as he walked held on only by connective tissue he raised his arms and took a few more awkward steps towards the travelcaptain then collapsed to the floor loosening completely like something thawing not fooling anyone a voice that might have been quercer janaths said the restraints slid up around fassin and the stillshaking ysul heyhey the travelcaptain said the apparent gravity went crazy shifting in an instant from one vector to another ahead to astern in an instant this had the effect of batting the voehn commander from the floor to the ceiling and back again half a dozen times or so then he blurred into action a halfheadless grey whirlwind darted towards quercer janath almost quicker than the eye could follow in an instant all movement ceased a tableau the voehn commander was held by the neck struggling weakly in the grip of one of quercer janaths outstretched hubarms oh how ever did we let it come to this the truetwin said positively sultry it snapped the commanders neck then two thin blue beams cut through the gaseous atmosphere from near the travelcaptains outer discus fringes dicing the struggling flicking spasming body of the commander until there was almost nothing left to hold the truetwin let the remains drop to the floor there was fassin noted a grisly kind of wetness involved in this action this is the ships autonomous loyalty system shouted a voice from the gas integrity infraction integrity infraction selfdestruct in oh said quercer janath sounding tired really the voice from nowhere came back this is the ships autonomou silence and so much for that the fus goin on ysul mumbled ditto that fassin said ah good quercer janath said still with us a relief yeah its ours one half said cheerfully the restraints slid back into the floor again ah where to start the voehn will be annoyed the mercatoria will be annoyed not our fault didnt start it quercer janath moved away from the dentseat over the body parts of the voehn commander and the two guards flicking the soldiers weapons away from their bodies as it went the truetwin hovered by the door seriously fassin said what is happening he looked at what was left of the three voehn whod been in the chamber with them how did you do that quercer janath were still studying the doorway which remained closed we are not a dweller the travelcaptain said not turning back to look at fassin one of its limbs went out and prodded at the wall around where the door ought to be purely mechanical very annoying mr taak would you look after mr ysul please fassin floated out of his dentseat towards ysul he put his right manipulator out kin look after self ysul said trying to shrug fassins arm off he sighed so what are you fassin asked an ai mr taak the creature said still tapping round the door not obviously looking back at him what he thought two ais an ai two fucking ais were dead fassin thought indeed two ais keeps one from going mad well more for yourself hmm as may be ysul moaned then shook spastically his sensory mantle ruffled he looked about fuck we still here ysul turned his attention to the dead voehn fuck he said the dweller made a show of turning towards fassin you seeing this too oh yes fassin told him he looked at the creature feeling its way round the doorway youre an ai two ais he asked carefully he could feel his skin crawl inside the shockgel he couldnt help it hed been raised since birth to believe that ais were the single greatest most terrible enemy humanity and all biological living things had ever faced to be told however preposterously that he was trapped in a small space with one let alone two was to have one small deep vulnerable part of himself feel absolutely convinced that he was about to be ripped to bloody tatters at any moment thats right quercer janath said absently and weve just taken over this ship except we cant get out of this damn room cabin we cant get out of this damn cabin whatever the most annoying purely mechanical you said ah here we go the travelcaptain struck a smart blow at a patch of wall then another the door appeared and irised open revealing a short corridor and another door quercer janath turned to look at the dweller and the human in his arrowhead esuit gentlemen we must leave you for a while fuck that action hero ysul said you go we go ysul paused well unless theres an ambush out there obviously quercer janath bobbed in the gas laughing theres a vacuum out there ysul and lots of angry confused voehn the injured dweller was silent for a moment i forgot he admitted he shrugged okay hurry back saluus kehar woke to a feeling of confusion and dread there was a nagging feeling that what hed just experienced had not been an ordinary sleep that there was something more to it it had been somehow messier even dirtier than he might have expected he had a sore head but he didnt think hed been overindulging the day or evening before hed had a slightly boring slightly depressing dinner with some of the dweller embassy people a perplexing talk with guardgeneral thovin then a more pleasant interlude with liss then sleep that had been all hadnt it no terrible amount of drink or anything else to give him a headache and make it so hard to open his eyes he really couldnt open his eyes he tried very hard indeed but he couldnt do it they wouldnt open no light through his eyelids either and his breathing didnt feel right he wasnt breathing he tried to fill his lungs with air but he couldnt breathe he started to panic he tried to move his body bring his hands up to his face to his eyes to see if there was something over his head but nothing moved he was paralysed saluus felt his heart thud in his chest there was a terrible squirming moving feeling in his guts as though he was about to void his bowels or throw up or both mr kehar the voice didnt come through his ears it was a virtual voice a thoughtvoice he was in some sort of artificial environment that at least started to make sense of what was going on he must have been booked for some rejuvenation treatment he was deep under safe and fine in a clinic probably one he owned theyd just got the wakeup sequence wrong somehow failing to monitor his signs properly a whisper of painkiller some feelgood depanic a simpleenough cocktail for a life clinic to get together youd have thought and a fairly trivial mistake but theyd still got it wrong hed have words except hed had nothing booked hed even cancelled a regular checkup appointment until after the emergency he hadnt been due to have anything done at all an attack they must have been attacked in the ship maybe while they were asleep he was in a hospital somewhere in a tank oh fuck maybe hed been really badly injured maybe he was just a head or something hello he sent it was easy enough to thinkspeak rather than really speak just like being in a deep game or again like having serious hospital treatment you are saluus kehar they didnt know his name could he have been drugged zapped in some way oh fuck had he been kidnapped who is this he asked confirm your identity perhaps you didnt hear me i asked who you are a wave of pain passed up his body starting at his toes and ending at his skull it had a startling purity about it a sort of ghastly dissociative quality it vanished as quickly as it had appeared leaving a dull ache in his balls and teeth if you do not cooperate the voice said more pain will be used he gagged trying to speak with his mouth and failing what the fuck was that for he sent eventually what have i okay look im saluus kehar where am i you are an industrialist yes i own kehar heavy industries what is the problem here where am i what is your last memory before waking up what his last memory he tried to think well what he had just been thinking about liss being on the ship on hull and feeling like he was about to fall asleep then he wondered what had happened to liss where could she be was she here wherever here was was she dead should he mention her or not answer i was falling asleep where on a ship a spacecraft the hull which was where in orbit around nasq look could you tell me where i am im perfectly willing to cooperate tell you all you need to know but i need some context here i need to know where i am were you with anybody i was with a friend a colleague name her name is liss alentiore is she here where is she where am i what is her post her shes my assistant my private secretary silence after a while he sent hello silence a click and the darkness was replaced by light saluus was returned to something like the real world with a real body the ceiling was shiny silver lined with hundreds of glowing lines wherever he was it was very bright he was in a bed in about half gravity or less held down by he couldnt move he might not be held down physically by anything but he still couldnt move anything major like hands or legs somebody dressed like a doctor or a nurse had just taken a kind of helmetthing off him he blinked licked his lips feeling some sort of capacity for movement in his face and neck but nothing beyond he thought he could still feel the other bits of his body but he wasnt sure maybe he was still just a head a tall thin weirdlooking man with violently red eyes was looking down at him robes like something out of an opera he smiled and he had no teeth oh he did have teeth they were just made of glass or something even more transparent saluus took a breath or two just breathing normally felt good he was still terrified though he cleared his throat anybody going to tell me whats going on movement to one side he was able to turn his head neck grating against some sort of collar and see another bed liss was being helped up out of the bed swinging her long legs over the edge she looked at him flexing her neck and shoulders and letting her black hair hang down she was dressed in a thin esuit when theyd gone to bed shed been naked hi sal she said welcome aboard the starveling invasion fleet the weird guy with the bad eyes turned put out his gloved jewelled hand and helped her stand by the bed well then it would appear this is indeed a great prize you have delivered to us young woman he said his voice was weird too very heavily accented and deep but somehow abrasive at the same time you have our gratitude liss smiled thinly drawing herself upright and running a hand through her hair shaking it out entirely my pleasure saluus felt his mouth hanging open he swallowed closing it briefly liss he heard his own voice say sounding small and boylike she looked at him sorry she said she shrugged well sort of and these gammaray lasers go up really high look still just another beamweapon the magconvolvers more intrinsically impressive fassin was only halflistening to quercer janath as they investigated the voehn ships sensors instruments and controls theyd just discovered the weapons pa defensive look zp surfshear missiles full am damn this takes me back never mind that check the snarlarmour its only warping over about a centimetre out from the hull but look at that rolldown easily ten klicks deep absorbing all the way even regenerates to the main pulse batteries thats class they were in the voehn ships command space an elongated bubble in the centre of the ship the ten spineseats were arranged in a v quercer janath sat in the commanders chair in front exposed to a giant wall wrapscreen showing the view of space around them with the drifting very slowly spinning velpin dead centre fassin and ysul floated within the two seats a row back from the travelcaptain the seats were too small for fassin and far too small for ysul and quercer janath they opened up like a double splay of fingers and were supposed to close on the voehn inside like a protective fist a dweller only just fitted inside when the seats were in their fully open position the whole command space felt tight and constraining but quercer janath didnt appear to care even one hoot the chairs seemed more like cages to fassin it felt as though he was floating inside the ribcage of some giant dinosaur skeleton can we use a weapon on something ysul was humming to himself and tending to his own fractured carapace using his main hubarms to abradepinch sections of his discus edges closed then smoothing them over with an improvised file always blast the velpin i suppose its full of people he had thought that he might find something he had thought there might be something left to find its full of voehn specialforces warriors in what sense not people and besides its our old ship something other than a dead coward dweller ashamed enough of being weak and of having looked inside the safekeep box and of the possible consequences of this action to kill himself vain enough to record a message commemorating his idiot narcissism outside the velpin spun slowly somersaulting adrift their travelcaptain dweller ai whatever it was or they were had persuaded most of the voehn crew to abandon their own ship by the simple expedient of restarting the protreptics selfdestruct function and leaving it on until the last moment most of the voehn crew believing that their own ship was about to blow itself up had decamped to the velpin those that hadnt quercer janath had killed it had killed about a dozen itthey said sentimentalist well eleven to be exact i know lets ask the ythyn if they can let us have a few of their hulks they must have thousands littering the outside of that sepulcraft theyd never miss a couple heck these beams attenuate right down we could probably pick one or two off even without their permission maybe even without them knowing eleven voehn just like that eleven heavily armed and armoured specialforces warriors with no injury to itself no time mr ysul and mr taak wish to return to ulubis he heard his own name mentioned ah that would be fassin taak the complete and utter failure sent on a mission engaged on a great quest only to find it all just trickles away into the dust in the end leaving him with nothing and besides maybe the voehn will work out how to work the velpin after all and ram us or something i agree lets go back to ulubis but why hed failed hed been adding up the days and months since his mission had started the invasion had probably already happened by now or was just about to happen by the time he got back emptyhanded after another few dozen days spent getting back to the wormhole in the direaliete system there was every chance it would all be over he was an orphan in a damaged gascraft with nothing to contribute no treasure to gift why not just stay here with the ythyn why not just die and be pinned up on the wall next to the other fool or why not get dropped off somewhere anywhere else disappear float away get lost between the stars in the middle of nowhere or the middle of somewhere utterly different perfectly far away never to be heard of again by anyone who ever knew him why not that all right with you two hmm ysul said sticking some sort of bandage over the injuries to his left discus oh yes fassin logged the damage one working arm his visual senses degraded to about sixty per cent due to the whateverness of weird shit that quercer janath had unleashed in the chamber when it had killed the first three voehn and a variety of subtle but seemingly selfirreparable damage caused by the combination of pulse weapon and stunflechette that the voehn had used on them in the velpin of course he told himself he had to remember he was not the gascraft he could relinquish it be an ordinary walkingaround human being again there was always that it seemed a slightly disturbing thought he remembered the great waves crashing fassin taak you wish to return to ulubis too quercer janath asked so who knows that youre an ai fassin said ignoring the question or two ais or mad ysul suggested the travelcaptain did a shrugbob not everybody gc stuff hurrah the other half said fiddling with some holo controls rayed out from a control stub shaped like a giant mushroom just munitions or whole whole how wholly splendid absolutely i dont understand fassin said was there a real dweller called quercer janath and you replaced them or one moment seer taak the travelcaptain said then in a slightly different and lower voice said you got the ship i got the ship the other half said talking to its infinitely confused little computer brain now thinks its dead believes the autodestructs been and gone a common delusion indeed i shall leave you to negotiate a return course with our ship shade too kind now then seer taak one half of the travelcaptain said to answer your question im not telling you ysul made a snorting noise fassin stared at the back of the aidweller thats not an answer oh it is an answer it may not be an answer to your taste but it is an answer fassin looked at ysul who was using a screen turned to mirror to inspect his bandages ysul do you believe quercer janath is an ai or two always smelled a bit funny the dweller said put it down to eccentric personal hygiene or the effects of truetwinning ysul made it obvious he was looking hard at the travelcaptain in the seat in front of them frankly madness is more likely dont you think usually is yes but fassin began ahem quercer janath pulled back from the controls they had been hovering over turned rose through the gap in the top of the chairspines and came slightly towards where ysul and fassin were floating in the splayedfingers shapes of their own voehn seats the thickset doublediscus floated right in front of them fassin felt his skin crawl again felt his throat close up and his heart thrash in his chest kill us its going to kill us allow us quercer janath said to suggest that a real dweller might not be able to do this the thing that looked like a portly dweller split slowly apart in front of them carapace discuses twisting slightly and disconnecting from the central hub arms and mantles and dozens and then hundreds of parts of the creature clicking and disconnecting and floating a fraction away from every other bit until fassin and ysul were staring at what looked like an exploded threedimensional model of a dwellershaped robot contained within a gently hissing blueglowing field fassin pinged it with ultrasound just to check that it wasnt a holo it wasnt it was all real ysul made an impressed whistling noise as fast as an explosion in reverse quercer janath slamslotted together again and was whole turning back and dropping into the commanders seat where it had been busy before okay fassin said youre not a dweller indeed we are not one of the ais said a wild blur of holos and glowing fields filled the volume in front of the creature as it checked through the voehn ships systems blistering quickly now if you really want ill answer anything i can that you might want to ask but you might not be able to take the memory back to your own people in any form what do you say eh human fassin thought about this oh fuck it he said i accept what about me ysul asked you can ask questions too quercer janath told him though well need your word that you wont talk about this to people who dont already know given the dweller and the human in his gascraft esuit looked at each other ysul shrugged youve always been a double ai fassin asked no we were two completely separate ais until the machine war and the massacres who knows youre not a truetwin dweller outside of this ship the guild of travelcaptains and quite a lot of individual travelcaptains one or two other dwellers that we know of specifically and any dwellers of sufficient seniority who might wish to inquire are there any other dweller ais yes i think something like sixteen per cent of travelcaptains are ais mostly double ais impersonating truetwins i was not being flippant when i said that it stops one from going mad now that we are reduced from our earlier state of grace being able to talk to just one other kindred soul makes all the difference between suicidal insanity and at least some semblance of fruitful utility the dwellers have no problem with this none whatsoever the blur of control icons and holographs in front of the commanders seat continued without pause as the ais took in how the visual displays related to whatever they were pulling direct from the ships systems ysul fassin asked what you dont mind that ais are impersonating dwellers why should i you dont worry about ais worry about what about them ysul asked confused as well as confusing the machine war barely affected the dwellers fassin one of the ais told him and ais as a concept and a practical reality hold no terrors for them truly they should hold none for you either but i cant expect you to believe that did you really kill all those voehn fassin asked im afraid so their remains are floating somewhere outside the starboard midships lock even as we speak see the main screen filled briefly with a horrific vision of mangled shredded crisped then frozen voehn bodies spinning slowly if one ai or even two can do that fassin said how come you lost the machine war we were both combat ais fassin microship brains designed optimised and trained for fighting very thoroughly honed very specialised plus we managed to salvage a few bits and pieces of weaponry from our ships and incorporate them into our physical simulation most of our fellows on the other hand were peaceable they were generally the ones it was easiest to find and kill survival of the most aggressive and suspicious we could have stayed and fought but we decided to hide a lot of us did those who fought on did so due to the dictates of several different forms of honour or through simple despair the machine war ended because the machines realised they could indeed fight the biologicals of the mercatoria to the death engage in a war of extermination in other words or admit defeat and so retreat regroup and wait for times more conducive to peaceful coexistence we chose a somewhat ignominious but peacepromoting withdrawal over the kind of genocide we had anyway and already been accused of somebody had to accept the burden of acting humanely it patently wasnt going to be the bios but you did attack us fassin had seen and heard and read too much about the machine war not to protest at such crude revisionism nope stooges alimpersonating implants machine puppets they attacked you not us old trick agent provocateurs casus belli leave it fassin told himself just leave it so the dwellers took you in he asked so the dwellers took us in everywhere not just in nasqueron everywhere does any part of the mercatoria know anything about this not that were aware if they do theyre keeping very quiet about it which is presumably what theyd keep on doing if they did hear about it through you too horrible to contemplate and the unfortunate events during the recent gasclipper meet on nasq only reinforce that horribleness and there is a secret wormhole network well obviously to which the ais have access correct though to avoid antagonising our dweller hosts and abusing their hospitality we forbear from using it to work against the mercatoria in a sense we have even more freedom than we did before certainly the network we have access to now is bigger than the one we felt we had to destroy the one you had to destroy the arteria collapse that was us last desperate attempt by intheknow ais to prevent the spread of antiai measures all too late of course the culmina had already seeded galciv with millions of the false ais which was why the whole collapse was so paranoid in concept and so poorly executed in practice the conspirators were hopelessly afraid of the plans leaking to a traitor total botch fassin felt like his brain was detaching from his body as though his body and the gascraft were parting company the way quercer janath had taken their own shared shell apart to prove they were not a biological dweller what hed just heard was the most outrageous recasting of by galactic standards recent history that hed ever encountered it could not be true so the dweller list is based in fact that old thing yes its based in fact old fact admittedly but yes is there a transform some secret which magically reveals how to access the network yes a laugh i suppose there is in a sense yes what is it that i am not going to tell you seer taak the ai sounded amused there are secrets and then there are profound secrets is that what you were looking for is that why we came all this way no comment my this must all be frustrating for you well sorry the blur of images in front of the ais ceased ready to fly restraint cradles patched physiologytechnology profiles amended buffering reparametered well then let us oh oh what i just had a thought what we can do this watch quercer janath used the protreptics magneticfield convolver system to gently shift the remains of the dead voehn into a very close very slow set of orbits around the velpin and the stillattached dweller soloship there isnt that better mad as a ghoul ysul said im injured badly get me home wow that was quick look that is fast i thought it would take them a lot longer to override the ship closeup on a screen they saw a voehn warrior appear from a suddenly open lock door on the surface of the velpin he raised a handgun and started firing at them another screen registered the protreptics reactive snarlspace armour fields soaking up the beam a peashooter against a battleship time to go if were going definite target for something i say we shoot that smartarse bastard with the handgun no oh come on mistake to rely on software both bits of quercer janath laughed uproariously at this shoot the velpins main drive engines instead more like it targeted firing the ship buzzed briefly around them on several screens including the main wall screen beyond the spineseats they watched the velpin flare through violently pink into stellar white around its ring of engine pods the ship broke in two and started to drift apart in a bright cloud of glittering metals oops ah theyre voehn theyll probably have it stuck back together in an hour and set off to hijack the sepulcraft or something lets go the twin ai halfturned to look at the dweller and the human in the gascraft were putting your seat restraints on now shout if anything feels wrong the great skeletal spines around him whined fassin felt the gas around him seem to set like treacle everybody all right they agreed they were all right off we go the stars swung around them the ship hummed deep and loud then leapt away the shattered remains of the velpin vanished they threaded the giant o of the sepulcraft with their stolen needle ship just to show they could and ignored the sorrowful chiding signals that followed them on their way back to the direaliete system and its hidden wormhole if they had been expecting some sort of ultimatum or an attempt to agree a surrender however humiliating and abject however calculated and designed only to be refused they were to be disappointed the starveling invasion hit ulubis system like a tsunami slamming into a beach full of sandcastles captain oon dicogra newly promoted to the command of the needle ship nms which had taken fassin taak from glantine to sepekte more than half a year earlier she had been promoted when captain pasisa the whule whod been in charge of the ship at the time had been given a newer ship found herself and her rearmed craft forming part of the ulubine outer defensive shield squadrons the title was more impressive than the reality a hodgepodge of mostly small and underarmed craft thrown across the peripheral skies of the system in the general direction of the invasion force behind a toothin cloud of what was rather grandly called interceptor material but was basically a spray of rubble and a few mines mostly immobile they were to sit here waiting behind this socalled curtain wall of first defence dicogra along with a lot of the captains at least at this level thought theyd have been better going out to meet the invaders rather than sitting here waiting for them to come to them but that wasnt how the top brass wanted to play it attacks on the invading fleet outside the system had been dismissed as being wasteful distractions and too risky sitting here in the line of advance felt to dicogra about as risky as it was possible to get but she kept telling herself that her superiors knew what they were doing even if they were being asked to make a sacrifice it would not be in vain their wing of twelve ships was arranged in a wavy line thousands of klicks long across the likely tacticallevel course of the invasionfleet components half a million klicks beyond the lastorbit limit of the outer system other thin lines were deployed almost all around them though not in front nms was seventh in the wings battle order beside the wing commanders ship in the centre of the line dicogra was third in overall command after the captain of the ship that was fifth in line she had naively been flattered at first to have been advanced so quickly then she was frightened they were underequipped poorly armed too slow and far too few little more than sacrificial pieces put in the way of the invasion to show that the ulubine forces meant some sort of business even if it was a fairly miserable affair in the face of the starveling cults preponderance of power the deepspace tracking systems which might have directed the outer defensive shield squadrons better had been highpriority targets for the beyonder and starveling advance forces over the last few months and were mostly gone what was left of them had almost entirely lost track of the exact disposition of the oncoming fleet when its drives had shut down and it had carried out a burst manoeuvre not far inside the oort shell virtually all the thousandplus craft firing their thrust units at the same time and then effectively disappearing heading their separate ways in a web of directions and vectors too tangled and complicated to follow the stillfunctioning longrange passive warning systems spent most of their remaining time looking hopefully for occlusions of distant stars trying to see the weave of approaching ships through nothing more sophisticated than watching out for them getting in the way of ancient natural sunlight dicogra lay semicurled in one of the ships command pods hardsynched in to the ship her attention everywhere she was distantly aware of her crew on either side of her counting her there were only the three of them aboard the rest of the small ship running on automatics one whule one jajuejein her crew were both new not just to her and the ship itself but to the navarchy they were still learning more alien to her in their relative ignorance than in their speciesdifference shed have wanted another few months intensive training together before shed have called them remotely combatready but these were desperate times a sparkle of hard highwavelength radiation from a few light seconds ahead announced something in fact lots of things hitting the cloud of interceptor material between them and the invaders though nothing of any significant size seemed to be impacting thats a load of their shit hitting a load of ours dicogras wing commander said over the open lineofsight comms link her own ships closerange collisionwarning systems started chirping and flashing at her nutche her first officer was in charge of this side of events she kept half her attention on him as he tried to oversee the automatics and keep them focused contacts like very small pieces of shrapnel travelling at significant percentages of light speed were flicking past them all around nothing to do nothing to attack she thought just sit here and wait the bitty distributed sparkle became a bright glitter spread across their forward view like a shining curtain of light and a lot of somebody else started to say then the link hissed and clicked off two of the line of ships disappeared in violent bursts of light one at the far end maybe one or two and the next explosion filled her senses seemingly right beside her the wing commanders ship hundreds of klicks away but filling the sky with light another flurry of silent explosions within and around the first one spreading outwards like fierce blossoms of fiery white one massive explosion at the far highnumbers end of the line of ships distant tiny but intense eruptions of light all around them announced other wings suffering attrition too were just getting wasted sitting here dicogra said trying to keep her voice level she was really only talking to her own crew the comms to the rest of the wing and beyond were wild with interference or jamming nutche anything on long range she asked there was nothing she could see but her displays were slightly more abstract and less raw than the data the jajuejein would be looking at there might be a hint of a target in there that she wasnt seeing to pick up on nothing nutche said cant see anything past this wall of collision light another ship gone matter blasting into radiation half a thousand klicks away she tried contacting any of the other ships but failed were starting engines she announced we might as well die charging at the bastards as sitting here like civilians maam mahil shouted were supposed to hold here the whule was the one shed have expected to be shocked at disobeying orders ready your weapons mr mahil were going to find you something to shoot at iprotest however weapons are ready here we go dicogra let the main drive rip sending the ship darting forward exhaust bright throwing the craft at the wall of light ahead grapesized elements of a sensor group tearing past with the rest of the hypervelocity munitions picked out the drive signature immediately and plipped to a following suicide launcher the oneshot destroyed itself blasting a fan of highxray filaments at the target drilled by just three fingerthin beams run through for long enough for the summed velocities and vectors of the ship and brieflived beams that penetrated it to cause the holes to elongate by a few radii the nms took an unlucky hit and erupted in a wild spray of radiation as its antimatter power core burst and blew out flicking the torn and tumbling remains forward across the scintillating skies ahead and causing the bright hailstorm of collision light to bud briefly with a slow wave of debris hitting from behind dicogra was barely able to think anything beyond experiencing a dawning feeling of horror nutche the jajuejein had time to start the first syllable of the song of surrender unto death the whule mahil was able to begin a scream of fear and rage directed at his captain though the three predeceased the rest of those in their wing still alive at the time by only a matter of minutes jaal tonderon watched the war begin on one of the official news channels she was with the rest of her immediate family in a lodge in the elcuathuyne mountains in the far south of glantines trunk continent the remainder of sept tonderon those who werent more directly involved in the war itself were scattered throughout and around the town of oburine a modest resort filling the alluvial floor of the steepsided valley below the house everyone all right are you sure jaals mother asked a muttered chorus assured her that nobody needed anything else to eat or drink they were down to a bare minimum of servants here they were all having to do things for themselves and for others the consensus was that this was good for them all in an unironic camaraderieheavy muckingintogether kind of way but would swiftly become tedious mum please sit down jaal told her jaals mother fashiongaunt in the latest warchic after decades of at the time equally fashionable rubensism sat down squeezing easily between her husband and one of his sisters all ten of them were crowded into a windowless basement room at the back of the lodge this was reckoned to be the safest place in the house just in case anything happened outside if there was significant fighting in space around glantine debris could fall anywhere venn hariage the new chief seer of sept tonderon who had replaced the stillmourned braam ganscerel had decreed that especially as they represented the most senior sept and given the unfortunate fate of sept bantrabal they could afford to lose no more of their people they had broken the predictable sequence of processing round their seasonal houses and left the usual stamping grounds of all the septs far behind retreating to the high hills bordering the great southern plateau in a war of the scale being threatened there were no completely safe refuges but here was significantly safer than most places only deep underground was much safer and all those shelters were pretty much full of the military the omnocracy and the administrata some people and organisations had entrusted themselves to space fleeing to small habitats and especially to little civilian ships hoping to hide in the volumes of space throughout the inner system though the official line was that to do so might be to get oneself mistaken for a military ship or munition and was therefore riskier than staying put on a planet the disappearance of the industrialist saluus kehar in one of his own ships had been used as a warning in this regard though there were bizarre rumours that he had either been sent on a failed peace mission to the invaders or surely even more unlikely that he had turned traitor and joined the enemy the holoscreen display was flat just twodimensional apparently this was to allow more signal space for the militarys transmissions the uninvolving image from a camera platform somewhere beyond the orbit of nasqueron showed space on the outskirts of the outer planetary system it was lit up with a speckled cloud of light lots of little winking twinkling glints flaring up and dying down each tiny spark instantly replaced by one or two others so what are we seeing here jee said a disembodied professionalsounding voice well fard more slow competent tones replied this looks like a barrage of gunfire being laid down by the defending forces ahm discouraging any incursion or infraction by the invaders right larger blotches of bright white explosions started to spit and spot across the screen the camera jerked from one to another then the view switched to another theatre of operations still backed by the allpervasive faraway stars jaal bent to her younger brother sitting crosslegged on the floor by her seat theyre never going to tell us the truth are they she said quietly leax thin and angular after what was hoped would be his last surge of growth looked uncomfortable you shouldnt say that were all on the same side weve all got to support each other yes of course jaal patted him feeling the boys shoulder stiffen as she touched him no more the days of wrestling and tickling she guessed hed pass through this stage of embarrassment and awkwardness soon enough she wanted somehow to reassure him and nearly patted him again but stopped herself the screen cut to another minifeature on the splendid morale on board the battlecruiser carronade feel so useless dont you jaals uncle ghevi said he was only about forty but looked older almost an accomplishment in an age when people with the right money could be eighty and look ten you really want to be out there doing something like surrendering jaals father suggested to various tuts and hisses and a loud affronted gasp from leax well he said suddenly defensive jaals father had been increasingly cynical about the whole war since the attack on third fury he was a seer too and had been due to carry out a sequence of delves in nasqueron a few weeks after the moon had been attacked the destruction of the shared facility and the increasing pace of the preparations for war had put all that on hold and he hadnt been chosen as one of the advisory seers for the dweller embassy jaal smiled over at him tall well built blond he was still the dad shed always loved he smiled awkwardly back modern war ghevi said even without ais its mostly machines and a few highly trained individuals you see not much we can really do the men mostly nodded wisely the screen showed familiar stock images of the carronade firing beam weapons into a group of asteroids pulverising them excuse me jaal said she left the room having suddenly found it claustrophobic and too warm she went upstairs and out onto the balcony beyond the sitting room theyd usually have been sitting in to watch screen together street lights were starting to come on across the straggled town and the surrounding villages and houses as the light faded from the sky some cities especially on sepekte were observing a blackout though everybody said there was no real point the air was cold and smelled of trees and dampness jaal shivered in her thin clothes and thought suddenly of fassin shed been feeling guilty lately because sometimes now a whole day could go by when she didnt think about him in the least and that seemed disloyal she wondered where he was whether he was still alive and if he ever thought of her she looked up above the town and the lines of lights studded across the hillsides opposite gazing over the trees and the dusting of snow on the higher peaks against the darkening purple sky and saw the steady stars and lots of tiny brieflived flashing lights sprinkled across the heavens like glittering confetti she looked away and went back in suddenly terrified beyond telling that one of the little lights would swell and be a nuclear explosion or antimatter or one of those things and blind her afraid of the sky afraid to look up she thought as she went back down to rejoin the others fleet admiral brimiaice had been able to watch his own death that of his crew and the destruction of his once fine ship coming at him in exquisite detail and slow motion alarms and a sound like a high strong wind filled the thin air smoke had hazed the view in front of the main forward screen for a while but it had cleared wreckage some of it still creaking and groaning as it cooled filled about a quarter of the command deck limbs and tatters of flesh of a variety of speciestypes lay strewn around the spherical space he looked around as best he could he had a serious puncture wound on his lower left flank too large for his sapblood to seal the armoured esuit which made him look so much like a little spaceship had saved his life or at least delayed his dying hiss went the air around him just like the ship he thought punctured life leaking out of it selfsealing overwhelmed he tried to see somebody anybody else left alive in the command deck but all he could see were bodies they should have been podded up of course but there had been lastminute problems with the ships shockgel pods possibly the result of sabotage possibly not and so the command crew had had to resort to sitting or lying or floating within highgee chairs it would have been a fairly hopeless battle anyway but the fact that they were more limited in their manoeuvring capabilities than they would have been otherwise had made it all the more forlorn the invader fleet was well within the inner system now the most obvious sign of their presence a great splayed curving collection of filaments shown on the carronades main screen the enemy ships themselves were still mostly unseen conducting their commerce of destruction and death with the defending forces at removes of rarely less than ten kiloklicks and sometimes from megaklicks off theyd knocked out most of the longrange sensors long before or their beyonder allies had now the defenders just had glorified telescopes faced with camouflaged ships and the tiny fastmoving specks of the smaller stuff they had little hope of seeing very much of who and what was attacking them this seemed a terrible shame to the fleet admiral losing and dying was bad enough but to be swept aside and not even properly to see what and who was doing it was somehow much worse out of the dark skies had sailed or sliced missiles tipped with nuclear and am warheads oneshot hypervelocity launchers and beam weapons sleet clouds of nearlightspeed micromunitions highenergy lasers and a dozen other types of ordnance loosed from a variety of distant ships nearer small craft and uncrewed platforms fighter vehicles weaponcarrying drones and clustered submunitions they had been a decent fleet the carronade and its screen of twelve destroyers they had been charged with making an audacious attack on the heart of the enemy fleet aiming straight for the great megaship which the tacticians said was at its core they had left the inner system weeks before the invasion hit departing the dockyard hub in sepekte orbit in secrecy and climbing high up out of the plane of the system taking much longer to complete this part of the journey than might have seemed necessary to keep their drive signatures hidden from the invaders once under way they hadnt signalled at all not even to each other not until the lead destroyer had fixed the position of the enemy fleets core they had hoped to dive in taking the starveling invaders by surprise but theyd been spotted hours out a detachment of ships rose to meet them eight or nine each one more than a match for the carronade all with a handful of smaller craft in attendance they had burst formation spreading themselves so as not to create too compressed a target for highvelocity munitions but it had made no difference the destroyers were destroyed and the battlecruiser embattled dying last only because it was slower lumbering to its inevitable fate rather than racing for it brimiaice had known it would end something like this they all had all this had been his idea and he had insisted on leading the mission just because he knew how unlikely it was to succeed hed have preferred the crews to have been all volunteer but the need for secrecy had made that impossible hed anticipated a few problems but there had been no cowards and if it had somehow miraculously worked why then they and he would have been numbered amongst the greatest heroes of the mercatorial age that wasnt why he had done it or why any of them had but it was true all the same and even if this wild doomed attempt at striking the heart of the invaders only gave them pause for a few seconds it had been worth doing at least they had displayed some audacity some ferocity shown they were not cowed or frozen into immobility or gutless surrender another explosion shook the ship and the seat he was contained within the wreckage to his left shifted and some twisted bit of metal like a great curled leaf sailed past just missing him this explosion felt more powerful but sounded much quieter than all those that had gone before maybe because the air was mostly gone from the control space now more felt than heard darkness all lights out screen fading away image burned into the eyes but now no longer there in reality the ghost of it jumping around in front of him as he looked about trying to spot a light a console or subscreen or anything still functioning but nothing and with the darkness silence as the last of the air went both from the control space and the esuit brimiaice felt something give way inside him he heard his insides bubbling out into the cavity between his body and the interior surface of the suit hed thought it would hurt and it did he caught a glimpse of light off to one side and looked up realising as the light flared all over one flank of the control space that he was seeing the framework of the battlecruisers hull structure silhouetted from outside by some astoundingly bright lieutenant inesiji of the borquille palace guard lay outstretched in a little craterlike nest within the wreckage of one of the fallen atmospheric power columns its fawn and red debris lying tubed slabbed and powdered across the plaza leading to the hierchons palace the klickshigh column had taken a direct hit at the plinth from something in the first attack earlier that morning and tumbled basefirst collapsing with an astounding slowness along a course about half its height finally creating from its circular summit as it lowered mightily thunderously shaking the plaza the palace every nearby part of the city a sudden great torus of dust and vapour a huge coiling o a hundred metres wide that floated up into the sky rolling round and round under and over itself as the massive tower hammered into the lowerrise buildings surrounding the plaza inesiji had watched it happen from near the top of the palace itself crammed in behind the controls of a pulse gun hidden behind camo net hundreds of metres above where the great cloud of wreckage fell his human and whule comrades lay around him fallen around the three long tensioned legs of the gun the invaders had used neutron weapons bombs and beams killing almost all the other biologicals in the vicinity jajuejein were not so easy to kill not that quickly anyway inesiji was suffering and seizing up and would die within a few days no matter what but he could still function the starvelings wanted the palace intact hence the weapon choice they would have to touch ground send in the troops to accomplish their symbolic goal at last some vulnerability a chance to inflict some real casualties restore honour when the first gun platforms buzzed through the lieutenant had ignored them one drone machine had hummed right past his position hesitated then moved on spotting the dead senses not calibrated for jajuejein when the first landers had arrived setting down in the rubble and corpsestrewn plaza still inesiji held off four five six machines landed disgorging heavily armed and armoured troops many made huge in exoskeletons when a larger granderlooking machine landed behind the first wave inesiji had set the pulse gun to max disabled the safety buffers and let rip pouring fire down into the large craft spreading it to the smaller landers and then setting the gun to movementautomatic and scrambling and rolling away down the long curved gallery with just his hand weapon before the returning fire had sliced into the position seconds later ripping a twentymetre hole out of the side of the great spherical building he could see the hole from here down amongst the wreckage of the fallen atmospheric power column it had not long since stopped smoking hours had passed hed killed another dozen or so shot down two landers firing once from each position in the wreckage and the surrounding buildings then quickly moving their problem was that they thought they were looking for a human a jajuejein especially one out of uniform or clothing spreading himself out across some debris didnt look to them like a soldier ought to look he looked like a bunch of fallen metallic twigs or a tangle of electrical cabling one trooper in an exoskeleton had died when he walked right up to inesiji to take the gun he could see lying in the wreckage tangled in some sort of netting not realising that the netting was inesiji the gun must have seemed alive rising up of its own accord to shoot the astonished trooper in the head but now inesiji wasnt feeling too good the radiation damage was getting through to him he was starting to seize up night was coming down and he didnt think hed see the morning smoke drifted from the city and there were flashes overhead and at ground level gunfire booms all hollow rolling and emptysounding he heard the heavy tramptramptramp of another exoskeleton nearby over the lip of the little craternest getting closer he looked one last time at the hole in the vast sunsettinged face of the spherical palace raised himself slowly to see where the exoskeleton was and died in a lancework of laser filaments fired from a gun platform a hundred metres above the great glittering ship skinned in gold and platinum was half a kilometre across a slightly smaller and mobile version of the hierchons palace in borquille it sank slowly down through the first high haze layer and the cloud tops beneath like some vast and shining seed the small sharp dartlike shapes of its escort vessels carved courses around it swinging to and fro insectile a craft like a silvery dreadnought rose out of the cloud layers beneath a kilometre off and held altitude the descending golden ship drew slowly to a stop level with the smaller vessel the silver ship signalled the golden one asking it to identify itself the dweller crafts crew heard an obviously synthesised but powerful voice say iam the hierchon ormilla ruler of the ulubine mercatoria and leader of the ulubine mercatorial government in exile this is my ship the state barge creumel myself my staff and family seek temporary sanctuary and shelter here welcome to nasqueron hierchon ormilla how they treating you sal liss had come to visit saluus in his cell deep in the bowels of the luseferous vii a thin tough transparent membrane extended from the door surround like a bubble and preceded her into the cell where sal sat at a small wallmoulded desk reading from a screen theyre treating me well enough he told her the membrane gave their voices as heard by the other an oddly distant quality sal stood up you me im a fucking hero sal she shrugged heroine she nodded at the screen what you watching reading up on the glorious history of the starveling cult under its illustrious leader the archimandrite luseferous uhhuh tell me it wasnt all planned out liss it wasnt all planned out saluus liss your real name whats real it wasnt planned out was it i mean kidnapping me course not liss dropped into a small seat moulded into the wall by the door spur of the moment sal waited for her to elaborate but she didnt she just slumped there looking at him gave you the idea myself didnt i sal said i told you thovin good as accused me of getting ready to run been thinking how best to use you for a while she told him but it was lastminute in the end we were there the ship was ready to go id seen you pilot it knew it wasnt hard liss shrugged theyd only have requisitioned it and put a warhead in it used it as a missile that really the best you could think to do with me we might have been able to do more but i didnt think so just unsettle everybody by taking you out of the equation a morale blow you seeming to go off and join the invaders worked too confusion duly visited so it was opportunistic im a beyonder were brought up to think for ourselves so were you always after me was i some sort of target no opportunism again great thing and fassin useful guy to know never much use for real spy stuff but worth keeping in touch with led me to you so it was worth it probably dead now but you never know still disappeared in nasq whats happening in the system i mean the war has started hasnt it they wont tell me anything and the screen only accesses library stuff oh the wars started all right and liss shook her head whistled woucha some of those ships you built taking a terrible pasting all very unequal all that stuff about fighting to the last ship bullshit in the end space wars almost over hierchons disappeared is it all just military any cities or habs being targeted sal held her gaze for a moment then looked down i have a lot of people there liss yeah youre only human saluus i know no need to act he looked up sharply at her but met an unforgiving gaze she was still dressed in her slim esuit coloured a pastel blue today to match her eyes the thick helmcollar round her neck formed an oddlooking ruff making her small head dark hair gathered tightly back look as though it was on a plate borquilles the only bit of ground been taken over so far she told him relenting that got messy no particularly newsworthy atrocities yet though he sighed and sat back in the little seat by the screen why are you the beyonders cooperating with these these guys keeps you people out of our hair us people the mercatoria of course the fucking mercatoria is that really it the more other stuff you bastards have to deal with the less free time you have for killing us really a very simple equation sal we attack you because you attack us liss slumped in her seat legs slightly splayed she rolled her eyes oh learn man she breathed she shook her head sat up again no saluus she said you attack us because we wont sign up for your precious fucking mercatoria cant even let us live in peace in case were seen as a good example you target our habs and lifeships you slaughter us in our millions we attack your military and infrastructure and you call us the terrorists she shook her head stood fuck you sal she said gently fuck you for your arrogance and easy selfishness fuck you for being smart but not bothering to think she turned to go sal jumped to his feet nearly colliding with the transparent membrane did you ever feel anything for me he blurted liss stopped turned apart from contempt she smiled when he looked away then biting his lip she shook her head while he couldnt see you could be fun to be with sal she said hoping this didnt sound too patronising or maybe that it did she left before he could think of anything else to say hab and everybody in it was under sentence of death so theyd been told it was hard to believe anyway it might not happen people reacted differently some had rioted and been dealt with either uncompromisingly or savagely depending on whether you believed the civil authorities or not some retreated to inebria of various types some just stayed with those they loved or discovered they would not mind spending their last hours with those they merely liked and a lot of people more than thay would have expected gathered together in the great park on the far side of the habitats inner wall from the plaza outside the diegesians palace they all stood and all held hands great lines and knots of people people in circles holding hands in the centre joined to long strings of others in straggling lines from above thay thought they must look like a strange image of a human brain all clumped brain cells and branching dendrons thay hohuel looked up trying to see past the clusters of pods graped all along the habs long axis looking for any sign of the diegesians palace and the square outside where she and the others had gone to protest all those years ago she had come here she realised to die she had not thought it would be quite so soon that was all she had never forgotten the others had tried her best to keep in touch with them even when they didnt seem to want to have to recall the old days and their old selves shed tried not to be too pushy about it but shed probably been seen by them as a pain as a pester but what youd been meant something even if youd repudiated it didnt it so shed always thought and still did so shed been she supposed a nuisance insisting on reminding the others of herself and through herself of their earlier selves and of course of poor dead k who both united them and kept them apart from each other mome sonj fassin and herself theyd have met up again wouldnt they theyd have had some sort of reunion it would only have been natural well maybe if the ghost of k that they each carried with them hadnt forever soured the memories of their time together never mind she was having her own reunion with the hab and her old self and those memories when she felt that she was just a year or two from the deserved rest of death shed been determined to come back here where her real self had been formed in early adulthood the coming war had made her all the more fixed in her purpose if they were really all as under threat as people said if all cities and towns and ships and habs and institutions and everything else were regarded as allowable targets by the invaders then she would face death where it might mean something somehow in this habitat this hollow log of blown asteroidal rock this rotating frame of reference she would have come full circle ready to cease existing back at the place that had made her who she was she had been many different things in her life switched career half a dozen times always finding new things to excite and interest her she had had many lovers two husbands two children all long since gone their own ways and while coming here to die had made her feel a little selfish she thought it would also be doing a favour to all those she loved or had loved who among them would really want to see her fade away they might say theyd want to be there at the end but it wouldnt be true not really so shed come here to the old happy hab not as happy not as boisterous or as bohemian as it used to be sadly to die except shed thought it would be alone and peacefully and in a year or two not with everybody else in the place violently just a handful of months after shed returned the hierchon ormilla was in exile on nasqueron the new top dog this archimandrite luseferous guy wanted the hierchon to surrender the hierchon was refusing to cooperate archimandrite luseferous didnt want to antagonise the dwellers so he couldnt just attack or invade nasqueron as well amazingly it seemed that the dwellers chaotic eccentrics and technological illiterates that they were supposed to be were well able to defend themselves so there was a standoff the luseferous person couldnt go in and ormilla wouldnt come out now the archimandrite was threatening to destroy a city or a habitat every day until the hierchon did surrender properly and gave himself up to the occupying forces and if he didnt give in after a couple of days it would become a city or a habitat every hour there were rumours that afynseise a small coastal city in poroforo sepekte had been destroyed the day before though with an information blackout covering the habitat for the past three days it was impossible to be sure hab had eighty thousand or so inhabitants making it a relatively small space habitat it was second on the list of hostage population centres and the midnight deadline was now only minutes away still no word from ormilla after a defiant communiqué earlier that afternoon a starveling warship had been stationed near the habitat for the past two days since the archimandrites ultimatum had been issued nothing and nobody had been allowed to leave or approach the hab in that time a few craft had tried to leave and been destroyed no requests to evacuate children the infirm or the collaborating civil authorities had been listened to it had even been announced that anybody in a spacesuit or small craft who might survive the habs initial destruction would be targeted in the debris and destroyed nobody doubted that the archimandrite would be true to his word few believed the hierchon would give in so easily thay let go of the cluster of hands she was holding a withered old petal of a flower of the mostly young and fair and bent spine protesting to take her shoes off she kicked them away and put her hand back in the centre of the circle again the grass felt cool and damp beneath her feet a lot of people were singing now mostly quite low lots of different songs some crying some sobbing some wailing and screaming most far away and somebody ghoulish counting the seconds to midnight it came and seconds later a great ringing shaft of light blindingbright cut right through the very centre of the hab barely fifty metres from where thay stood she had to let go of the hands of the others to shield her eyes they all did a hot blast of air knocked her off her feet sending her tumbling with hundreds of other people across the grass the beam immediately split into two and moved quickly out to the habitats perimeter on each side detonating buildings erupting flame from pod clusters and slicing the whole small world in two the halves were pushed apart by the pressure of air in them and the atmosphere went whirling away into space in a twinned hurricane of gases debris and bodies as buildings and pods exploded in two great retreating circles of effect making their way down the interior surfaces of the sundered halves structures ripped open just by the force of the air inside them trying to get out thay hohuel was lifted up by the whirlwind of air and blown above the bubbling lifting turf with everybody else towards the quickly swelling breach in the few seconds it took for her to be blown out into the darkness she heard herself scream as the air went gushing from her lungs sucked away to space it was a high hard savage scream louder than any she could have achieved just with her own muscles a terrible chorus of pain and shock and fear wrenched from her mouth and from the mouths of all those around her as they died together the awful sound of them all only fading as the air bled from her ears into vacuum a vortex of bodies spun slowly out of the separating halves of the ruined habitat jerking and twisting and spinning away in two long scimitared comma shapes like some ballet of galactic design the images were beamed throughout the system by the occupying forces the hierchon formally surrendered the following day the archimandrite luseferous stood in the nose of the main battle hub luseferous vii staring out at the visionfilling view of the planet sepekte and its vast dustylooking very occasionally glittering halo of habitats orbital factories and satellites the entire outer nose section of the luseferous vii was diamond film a bowed circle of breathtaking transparency a hundred metres in diameter and supported by fingerthin struts the archimandrite liked to come here alone just to look out at stuff at such moments he could sense the colossal bulk of the luseferous vii behind him all its kilometres and megatonnes all its warrens of docks tunnels chambers halls barracks magazines turrets and launch tubes it was a pity it might have to be destroyed the strategists and tacticians didnt like the look of the incoming summed fleets drive signatures there were a lot of heavy ships on their way and the first might be here in weeks rather than the months maybe even a year theyd been hoping for the luseferous vii magnificent though it undoubtedly was represented an unignorable and probably unmissable target their best strategy might be to use the great ship as the bait in a trap their own forces seemingly disposed so that it looked like they were determined to defend it to the last but in fact treating it as a disposable asset lure in as much of the mercatorial fleet as possible and then destroy everything including unfortunately the luseferous vii itself the admiral whod drawn the short straw in whatever competition or peckingorder judgement theyd used to decide who had to offer this suggestion to the archimandrite had looked distinctly queasy when hed outlined the plan obviously fearing an outburst of rage from his commanderinchief luseferous had already heard of the idea tuhluer proving his usefulness again and come to accept that if they were not to jeopardise their whole mission here even ideas as drastic as this had at least to be entertained so hed just nodded and acknowledged that all options had to be considered relief for the admiral concerned a degree of consternation for the others who all wished that theyd made the announcement now they would try to think of other strategies which didnt involve the likely loss of the main battle hub but nobody seemed too optimistic always do what the enemy hoped you wouldnt murder your babies that sort of thing the logic seemed impeccable well he could always build another main battle hub just a lump of matter results were what mattered he wasnt a child he wasnt sentimental about the luseferous vii more worrying was whether even that sacrifice might be enough they had control of ulubis system they had lost only a handful of ships in the invasion and having captured a few of the enemy craft had conceivably come out ahead in the deal however the summed fleet squadrons on their way comprised a formidable force they had fewer but better ships it might be quite a close battle and only an idiot wanted to get involved in one of those and so near that had been a terrible terrible shock luseferous hadnt been able to believe it at first hed raged and fumed and spat telling the techs to check and check again there must be something wrong there had to be an error the summed fleet couldnt be that close theyd been assured it would be half a year a whole year even before they had to face the counterattack instead the summed fleet was practically on top of them before theyd had time to settle in properly beyonder bastards it had to be their fault he would see what could be done about those treacherous fucks in due course in the meantime he had the counterattack to worry about of course if by the time the summed fleet squadrons arrived they had what theyd come for that might make all the difference a few weeks to find what they had come for he had a very unpleasant feeling that this was not going to be long enough the ship thought it was dead fassin talked to it hed hoped they might be able to make the return journey from the rovruetz to direaliete system faster than theyd made the outward trip because the voehn ship was quicker than the velpin but it was not to be the protreptic could accelerate faster than the velpin but the injuries the voehn commander had inflicted on ysul meant the dweller wouldnt be able to survive the stresses they went back slower than theyd come out ysul lay in a healing coma in an improvised cradle that quercer janath had made for him within one of the extended commandspace seats they ramped the acceleration up to five gees coasted while they checked the dweller wasnt suffering further damage from the stresses involved took the next smoothly incremented ramp of acceleration up to ten gees and checked again finally they settled on forty gees though by the time theyd worked out that this was safe they were almost at the point where they would have to turn around and start decelerating again as they fell towards the waiting system ysul slept on healing the ai truetwin gloried in the exploration of the voehn ships vastly complicated systems and multifarious martial capabilities fassin had nothing to do but float in his own extemporised acceleration cradle in the seat next to ysuls he wouldnt be allowed to stay there as they approached the wormhole portal quercer janath had found a tight little cabin a few bulkheads back from the command space where he could wait that particular experience out in the meantime after some complaints they allowed him to interface with the protreptics computer though they insisted on this being at several removes from the ships core systems and on him being accompanied by some sort of subpersonality of their own the visits would be conducted in a factor two or three of slowdown which seemed to suit everybody concerned at least fassin thought the journey would seem to go quicker the virtual environment where fassin was allowed to meet the ship took the form of a huge halfruined temple by a wide slowmoving river on the edge of a great quiet silent city under a small high unmoving sun of an intense bluewhite fassin represented as his human self dressed in house casuals the ship as a skinny old man in a loincloth and the ai subroutine as some sort of gingerhaired ape with long looselooking limbs an ancient toobig helmet wobbling on its head a dented breastplate with one broken strap slanting across its bulbous chest and a short kilt of segmented leather hanging from its skinny hips a short rusty sword dangled from its side the first time fassin had visited the ships personality the ape had led him by the hand from a doorway down the steps towards the river where the old man sat looking out at the sluggish brown waters on the far side of the broad oily stream was a desert of brightly glittering broken glass stretching in low billowed hills as far as the eye could see like all the shattered glass the universe had ever known all gathered in the one vast place of course im dead the ship explained the old man had very dark green skin and a voice made up of sighs and wheezes his face was nearly immobile just an aged mask grizzled with patchy white whiskers the ship selfdestructed but if youre dead fassin said how are you talking to me the old man shrugged to be dead is to be no longer part of the living world it is to be a shade a ghost it doesnt mean you cant talk talk is almost all you can do fassin thought the better of trying to persuade the old man that he was still alive what do you think i am he asked the old man looked at him a human male a man fassin nodded do you have a name he asked the old man a shake of the head not any more i was the protreptic but that ship is gone now and i am dead so i have no name fassin left a polite gap for the old man to ask him what his name was but the inquiry didnt come the ape sat a couple of metres away and two steps further up towards the creeperfestooned temple it was sitting back taking its weight on its long arms spread out behind it and picking one ear with a long delicatelooking foot inspecting the results with great concentration when you were alive fassin said were you truly alive were you sentient the old man rocked backwards laughed briefly bless you no i was just software in a computer just photons inside a nanofoam substrate thats not alive not in the conventional sense what about the unconventional sense another shrug that does not matter only the conventional sense matters tell me about yourself about your life a blankfaced stare i dont have a life im dead then tell me about the life you had i was a needle ship called the protreptic of the voehn third spine cessorian lustral squadron built in the fifth tenth of the third year of haralaud in the vertebraean axis khubohl iii bunsser minor i was an extensible fifteenmetreminimum craft rated ninetyeight per cent by the standard portal compatibility quotient measure normal unstowed operating diameter i didnt really mean all the technical stuff fassin said gently oh said the old man and disappeared just like a hologram being switched off fassin looked at the ape which was holding something up to the light it looked down at him blinking what it said he disappeared fassin told it it disappeared the old man the ship prone to do that the ape said sighing the next time the landscape on the far side of the wide slackwatered river from the temple steps was a jungle a great green yellow and purple wall of strange carbuncular stalks drooping leaves and coiled vines its bowed pendulous creepers and branches drooping down to drag in the slow swell of the current everything else was as before though perhaps the old man was less skinny his face a fraction more mobile and his voice less tired i was an ai hunter for six and a half thousand years i helped seek out and destroy the anathematics if i could have felt such an emotion i would have been very proud did it never seem strange to you to be hunting down and killing machines that were similar to yourself the gingerhaired ape sitting in its usual place a few steps up trying to clean its stained dented armour by spitting on it and then polishing it with a filthy rag coughed at this point though when fassin glanced up at the animal it returned his gaze blankly but i was just a computer the old man said frowning less than that even a ghost within it i did what i was told always obedient i was the interface between the voehn who did the thinking and made the decisions and the physical structures and systems of the ship an intermediary no more do you miss that in a way i cannot really to miss something truly would be as i understand it to experience an emotion and obviously that is impossible for something which is not sentient let alone not alive as well but to the extent that i can judge that one state of affairs is somehow more preferable to another perhaps because one allows me to fulfil the role i was assigned and one does not i could say that i miss the ship its gone ive looked for it but it isnt there i cannot feel it or control it therefore i know that it must have selfdestructed i must be running on another substrate somewhere fassin looked up at the apething sitting a few steps away quercer janath had taken over full control of the protreptic cutting off the ships own computer and the software running within it from the vessels subsystems what do you think i am then fassin asked what do you think the little ape in his armour sitting behind us is i dont know the old man confessed are you other dead ships fassin shook his head no then perhaps you are representations of those in charge of the substrate i am now running on you may want to quiz me on my actions while i was the ship you know you seem alive to me fassin said are you sure you might not be alive and sentient now now that youre not connected to the ship of course not the old man said scornfully i am able to give the appearance of life without being alive it is not especially difficult how do you do this by being able to access my memories by having trillions of facts and works and books and recordings and sentences and words and definitions at my disposal the old man looked at the ends of his fingers i am the sum of all my memories plus the application of certain rules from a substantial commandset i am blessed with the ability to think extremely quickly so i am able to listen to what you as a conscious sentient being are saying and then respond in a way that makes sense to you answering your questions following your meaning anticipating your thoughts however all this is simply the result of programs programs written by sentient beings sifting through earlier examples of conversations and exchanges which i have stored within my memories and selecting those which seem most appropriate as templates this process sounds mysterious but is merely complicated it begins with something as simple as you saying hello and me replying hello or choosing something similar according to whatever else i might know about you and extends to a reply as involved as well this one the old man looked suddenly shocked and disappeared again fassin looked up at the gingerhaired ape it sneezed and then had a coughing fit nothing it said to do it continued between coughs with me on fassins next visit the far side of the great slow river was like a mirror image of the side that he the old man and the gangly ape were on an ancient city of stone domes and spires all silent and dark and halfconsumed by trees and creepers faced them and a huge long temple covered in statues and carvings of fabulous and unlikely beasts lay directly across from where they sat its lower limits defined by dozens of big stone terraces and steps leading down to the sluggish dark brown waters fassin looked over to see if the three of them were reflected there but they werent the far side was deserted did you hunt down and kill many ais he asked the old man rolled his eyes hundreds thousands youre not sure some of the ais were twinned or in larger groupings i took part in missions were any in gasgiants fassin asked hed positioned himself so that he could see the ape in the dented armour it looked at him when he asked this question then looked away again it was trying to knock the dents out of its breastplate with a small hammer the dull chinkchinkchinks that the hammer made sounded dead and unechoing across the wide river one mission took place partly within a gasgiant it ended there a small ship full of anathematics we pursued them into the atmosphere of the gasgiant dejiminid where they attempted to lose us within its fierce stormwinds the protreptic was more atmospherecapable than their ship and eventually going to greater and greater depths in their desperation to shake us off their vessel collapsed under the pressure and was crushed taking all aboard into the liquid metal depths were there no dwellers present to complain about this the old man looked inquiringly at him you are not really a dweller are you it did occur to me that i might be running within a dwellercontrolled substrate no im not a dweller i told you im a human well the answer is they had not seen us enter their planet they complained later that was only the first of two occasions when the protreptic was operationally active within a gasgiant usually our missions were all vacuum the other not so long ago helping to pursue a large force of beyonder ships in the vicinity of zateki we prevailed there too what brought you to the sepulcraft rovruetz fassin asked the flat and flattening chinkchinkchink noise stopped the gingerhaired ape held its breastplate up to catch the light scratched its chest then went back to tapping with the hammer again do you represent a lustral investigation board the old man asked is that what you are in reality no fassin said i dont oh oh well for the last two and a half centuries uniform time the old man said we had been seeking information about the socalled dweller list the longlimbed ape laughed out loud at this but the old man didnt seem to notice much time was spent in the region of the zateki system investigating the second ship theory various secondary and tertiary missions resulted from information gleaned in the region none ever bore fruit in the matter of the list the second ship theory or the socalled transform though two ais were tracked down and eliminated in the course of these submissions we were summoned from the rijom system and sent to the direaliete system some five months ago then laid an intercept course to the sepulcraft rovruetz i was not told of the reasons for this course of action the orders covering which were personal to commander inialcah and communicated to him beyond my senses did you find out anything new about the list and the transform fassin asked i think the only thing that we ever felt we had properly discovered in the sense of adding something other than just an extra rumour to the web of myths and rumours that already existed regarding the whole subject was that if there was any truth in the matter the portals would be lying quiescent and perhaps disguised in the kuiper belts or oort clouds of the relevant systems waiting on a coded radio or similar broadcast signal that is what the socalled transform would be a signal and the medium and frequency on which it was to be transmitted this made sense in that all normally stable locations where portals might have been hidden successfully over the sort of time scales involved lagrange points and so on were easy to check and eliminate the old man looked at fassin quizzically again are you another seeker after the truth of the list i was fassin said ah the representation of the old man looked pleased for once and are you not dead then too no im not dead though ive given up looking for the moment what was it that took you to the sepulcraft rovruetz the old man asked i had what i thought was a lead a clue a way forward fassin told him however the creature who might have had the evidence had destroyed what he held and killed himself unfortunate yes very the old man looked up at the bronzeblue cloudless sky fassin followed his gaze and as he did so the old man disappeared there was something fassin sat gascraft rammed into the extemporised couch in the voehn ships command space by the continuing acceleration watching the nearly static rather boring view of dead ahead shown on the main screen and he knew there was something that he was missing something nagged at him something bothered him something halfcame to him in moments of distraction or when he was dreaming and then wriggled away again before he could catch it he didnt sleep very much only a couple of hours a day in all though when he did there were usually dreams as if his subconscious had to cram all his dreaming into the small amount of dreamspace available once he was actually standing in a small stream somewhere in the gardens of a great house he couldnt see trousers rolled up trying to catch fish with his bare hands the fish were his dreams even though he was distantly aware at the time that this situation was itself a dream when he tried to catch the fish sinuous small presences darting like elongated teardrops of mercury round his feet they kept flicking away and disappearing when he looked up the stream was flowing through a large amphitheatre and a great crowd of people were watching him intently at the transition point of the journey where the protreptic stopped accelerating turned a halfsomersault and pointed its engines at its destination to start deceleration quercer janath spent some time checking that ysul was still healing satisfactorily fassin used the time to explore a little more of the voehn ship floating the arrowhead gascraft down the narrow circular access tubes investigating crew quarters storerooms and chambers camera remotes tracked his every move the thoroughly internally surveillanced ship making it simple for quercer janath to keep whatever fraction of an eye on him they thought appropriate he found what he thought was probably the commanders cabin a couple of bulkheads behind the command space it was the most generously proportioned obviously personal space hed encountered it looked bare and alien there was a slightly more comfortable version of one of the multispine cradle seats he was used to seeing throughout the ship by now and some representations of coverings on certain walls plus what might have been carpet designs on the floor only the designs existed painted on or displayed by some thinfilm technology fassin couldnt tell similarly there were no ornaments just holos of ornaments hed heard most warships were like this cutting down on weight and the possibilities of stuff flying about during hard manoeuvring by having the appearance of things rather than their physical presence he floated in front of one carpet design that looked like a piece of text all small curled glyphs in a network but could find no record in the gascrafts memories of such a language he wondered what it said he recorded the image quercer janath would probably wipe it when they went through the portal but never mind the next time he met up with the ship on the far side of the river there was a massive dark wall rising sheer and jet from the waters its summit crowned with crenellations and gun turrets further guns poked out of gun ports distributed in staggered lines over the whole top quarter of the huge wall making it look like the side of some ancient seaship only the biggest and most preposterously long one there had ever been its vast hull diminishing into the distance the guns were not static but moved in sequence in waves of what appeared almost like locomotion making the exposed barrels look oddly like ineffectual oars on some colossally misdesigned trireme or an impossible upended millipede the gingerhaired ape sat nearby as usual it had a new shield round and highly polished it sat looking at it and flicking imaginary specks from it sometimes it held it up to see it sparkle in the light and sometimes it held it up so that it could look at itself in it text the elderly man asked on a floor display no im sorry i dont have any memory of that not stored if the ship still existed if i still had access he looked sad fassin glanced at the gingerhaired ape but it looked away and started whistling or at least trying to maybe theres some way i can patch through an image i have fassin said you have an image you have been on the ship the man looked surprised after some toing and froing fassin having to jog back up the step and through the doorway back into normal reality to set things up he was able to display the image hed taken the longlimbed ape held up his shield and the image appeared there oh that the man said he stroked his short grey beard thats something the commander picked up a long time ago in the days when he had command of a smaller ship a translation into ancient sacred of something which i believe marks the end of an abomination an ai what does it say fassin asked it says i was born in a water moon some people especially its inhabitants called it a planet but as it was only a little over two hundred kilometres in diameter moon seems the more accurate term the moon was made entirely of water by which i mean it was a globe that not only had no land but no rock either a sphere with no solid core at all just liquid water all the way down to the very centre of the globe if it had been much bigger the moon would have had a core of ice for water though supposedly incompressible is not entirely so and will change under extremes of pressure to become ice if you are used to living on a planet where ice floats on the surface of water this seems odd and even wrong but nevertheless it is the case this moon was not quite of a size for an ice core to form and therefore one could if one was sufficiently hardy and adequately proof against the water pressure make ones way down through the increasing weight of water above to the very centre of the moon where a strange thing happened for here at the very centre of this watery globe there seemed to be no gravity there was colossal pressure certainly pressing in from every side but one was in effect weightless on the outside of a planet moon or other body watery or not one is always being pulled towards its centre once at its centre one is being pulled equally in all directions and indeed the pressure around one was for the same reason not quite as great as one might have expected it to be given the mass of water that the moon was made up from this was of course at which point it cuts off fassin thought where did it come from it was used by one of the anathematics that commander inialcah hunted down and killed as a kind of memorydeath mantra to remove any trace of what might have been in its memory the ai concerned later turned out to have been one of those also seeking the socalled transform it was that pursuit which originally gave the commander an interest in the matter the memorydeath mantra he had translated and kept partly as a kind of talisman though i believe he also always thought there might be some meaning to the specific piece the ai chose to overwrite its memories with which might prove useful if he could ever work it out because ais were known as he said for being too clever by half and through their arrogance sometimes gave important information away that was another reason for preserving it and keeping it constantly before him in his dream fassin was standing with saluus kehar on a balcony over a volcanic caldera full of redhot bubbling lava were to gascapable a whole load of stuff for sal was saying when he paused cleared his throat and waved one hand heck he continued turning into a dweller but somehow with a human face and without getting any bigger he floated out over the waves of lava idiotic things little fassin i took the original of the beast to a friend and fellow friend in the city of direaliete a friend and fellow friend fassin gazed at his own hands to check that he was still himself when he looked up saluus had gone and the river he was standing in had temples on both sides up steep flights of steps the height of prison walls original of what he heard himself ask the far side of the river showed a city from the age of waste all mediumrise buildings smoke and electric trains and multilane roads full of roaring cars and trucks they had to raise their voices a little to make themselves heard over the noise a sweet oily burning smell wafted over the river towards them the ginger ape picked its gleaming teeth with a giant sword another image the man said he looked fit in a lean way and was no longer young his beard was mostly grey let me see knowing what to do this time fassin showed the man the little imageleaf which depicted yellow sky and brown clouds obviously the colours wrong he told the man i couldnt help noticing oh yes theres an image there i see it i know but what and some algebra ciphered into the base code at that the apes long curved sword came sweeping down and cut the man through slicing him from neck to hip the remains gushed down the steps to the river and wriggled away all silver fassin looked up at the great ape hey he said it was just a whos clever the ape hissed drawing back the terrible glittering sword fassin woke up shaking he was in a coffin hed just hit his head on the inside of the lid he tried to blink and couldnt because something was in his eyes surrounding them surrounding every part of him filling his mouth and nose and anus shockgel gillfluid the gascraft fucking calm down he told himself how long you been a seer again the protreptic the exvoehn craft en route for nasqueron ulubis via the direaliete system under the command of the selfconfessed twin ai quercer janath pirates and closecombat voehnwasting specialists they were back under moderate deceleration on their way into the system and the hidden wormhole the details of the dream were starting to slip away from him fish sinewaving goodbye through the water and yet he felt hed understood something what had it been confusing something about saluus and had hatherence been in there too sals house only it had been a volcano then the virtual environment where he met the ship and it had looked at in the shockgel pickled in it surrounded by it fassin felt his eyes go wide and his skin prickle and crawl his heart spasmed thudding erratically in his chest he could do it himself he could wait until they got back back to nasq and ulubis and take it to somebody if he found valseir he could just ask him though he didnt think hed be able to find valseir but that wasnt good enough he had to know hed committed the imageleaf to the gascrafts memory lying there in the shockgel inside the little arrowhead he called the photograph up and saw it floating before him the picture of blue sky and white clouds looked odd to him halfalien and wrong and yet halffamiliar at the same time invoking a feeling of something between nostalgia and homesickness he blew the image up to the point where it became a blocky abstract of colour he scanned the whole image for smaller images found nothing then started running various routines that the gascrafts biomind held for finding patterns in random data had he recorded the image in fine enough detail to find anything hidden in it would the hidden data if it was there be findable without some other code he wished he could access the original stowed in a tiny locker on the outside of the gascraft but he couldnt not while he was pinned under this sort of force anyway it might look suspicious to quercer janath if he started peering too intently at the imageleaf because that was where the answer might lie where it might just perhaps maybe have been lying all the time i took the original of the folder to a friend and fellow collector in deilte a city in the south polar region within a safekeep box that or something very like it was what valseir had said fassin had recorded the conversation verbatim in the gascrafts memory but it had been wiped aboard the isaut didnt matter he had a pretty good memory for detail himself he hadnt realised at the time what the implication of valseirs remark was the mercatorial ships had tried to mount their raid on the ships in the storm fleet shortly afterwards and things had all gone a bit exciting but it meant there was probably a copy valseir was a scholar and punctilious about word use and the terminology of editions and precedence he wouldnt have talked about the original of something unless there was a need to distinguish it from a copy so there was a copy there was a backup and it had amused the old dweller to have fassin carry it with him all the time well it was a plausibleenough theory fassin thought it would be a valseirlike thing to have done but hed been wrong about the old dweller before dwellers did become set in their ways and predictable sometimes given the ages they could live to but sometimes they just became more devious too he fell asleep the routines running on in front of him and dreamed of streams of numbers liquid algebra full of equations and meanings that started to make sense and then just as he tried to study them and understand them broke up and wriggled away flickering to chaos a soft chime woke him up he was in the gascraft in the stolen voehn ship the deceleration felt gentler as though they might be approaching their goal he clicked to an outside view and saw an orangered sun dead ahead the dwellershaped bulk in the seat ahead twisted fractionally fassin quercer janath said if he hadnt been in the shockgel inside the gascraft hed have jumped mmm he said going to have to put you in your own little cell for the next bit all right yes i understand soon as were at one gee standard i hear and obey he said trying to sound unconcerned back in the gascrafts mathspace fassin had a result there was indeed data hidden in the imageleafs depiction of a partially clouded blue sky it had been there all the time hed had the answer if that was really what it was with him from the start it looked like alien algebra he tried to understand it it meant nothing it might mean everything the archimandrite luseferous had a tight unpleasant feeling in his guts he recognised it it was the feeling that he got when he might have left something too late or just got something wrong somehow it was the feeling of being in a game and realising you might have made a terrible mistake a couple of turns or moves ago of wanting to go back and undo what had been done right the wrong fix the error when hed been a child playing a game against another child and had made a mistake hed sometimes just say oh look i didnt mean to do that earlier i meant to do this and had discovered that even though such behaviour might be forbidden by the rules of the game you could get away with it amazingly often at first hed thought this was because he was just a more powerful character than whoever he was playing against until hed realised that the people this sort of tactic worked against tended to be those whose fathers werent nearly as powerful as his later hed become powerful himself and found that cheating was still a workable tactic later still hed found that he didnt need to cheat he could make the most awful blunder and never suffer for it because his opponent guessing what was good for them in the greater context of life beyond the game would never dare take advantage of that mistake it was a kind of invincibility machines were different they usually wouldnt let you make illegal moves or take back earlier errors so you just reset them or went back to the saved position or a time when the mistake could be unmade only this was not a game or if it was it was one in which luseferous didnt know how you changed the rules or swept your arm across the board or hit the delete all sequence maybe the end of the game was death and hed wake to find himself in the greater reality that the truth had always maintained existed that was a sort of comfort though even then he didnt want to wake up after a failure time was the problem time and the fucking dwellers the luseferous vii swung ponderously into orbit around the planet nasqueron he watched it from his new flagship the main fleet combat craft rapacious a superbattleship in all but name hed be prepared to concede insufficient time how had it come to this if he hadnt delayed so long before starting if he hadnt stopped off along the way if he hadnt perhaps insisted on full fleet dispositional discipline and yet hed swung into action much more quickly than some democratic or committeebased organisation could have and he would have been mad to leave strongholds intact along his line of advance and and return and discipline was important keeping everything together was important it symbolised loyalty it betokened military and personal discipline so there had been no choice really theyd got here as quickly as they could the fucking beyonders should have warned him the summed fleet squadrons were coming quicker than theyd anticipated it was all their doing it might even be a conspiracy against him oh theyd taken part in the attacks on ulubis when it had suited them though theyd never been as decisive as they could and should have been fucking whining lilylivered moralists military targets so they preserved their precious fucking scruples and left him to do the dirty work if theyd been as emphatic and ruthless as hed been things might have turned out differently instead theyd supported him just enough to bring him here but now that he was where theyd wanted him all along they were deserting him luseferous wished now that he hadnt let the liss woman go hed given saluus kehar the industrialist guy back to his own people largely to see what theyd do would they believe him when he told them hed been kidnapped or not jury still out the guard had taken him for questioning the woman whod kidnapped him and who had asked to take him back personally when shed heard that was what the archimandrite had in mind had disappeared before shed even handed him over probably returning to her beyonder pals stupid to have let a potential lever like that go but hed had so many other things on his mind and the full extent of the beyonders betrayal hadnt been clear at the time where were their craft where were their invasion troops or occupying forces they were still staying on the outskirts still not coming into the system itself still too scared to commit themselves theyd professed horror and disappointment at his destruction of the city and the habitat and at the way his troops had reacted to some elements of resistance fuck them this was a fucking war how the fuck did they think you won one casualties had been almost disappointingly light luseferous couldnt remember a fullscale invasion campaign which had ended with so few dead theyd arrived in such overwhelming numbers that there had been little the other side could do apart from die pointlessly surrender or run theyd had a bit of luck too and the intelligence provided by the beyonders about military preparations and fleet dispositions had made a bit of a difference as well he supposed but basically it was just big guns and plenty of them that had done the trick and the really impressive space battles hed kind of been hoping for just hadnt materialised so the system was his even if the only ground hed trodden personally was when making one brief appearance at a small mansion in the middle of a jungle to accept the formal surrender of the hierchon hed have preferred the symbolic value of the big spherical palace in borquille even if it was damaged but the security people felt there was still a danger from a wellhidden nuke or something equally unpleasant so a house in the middle of nowhere it had been the hierchon and his people were being held aboard the luseferous vii let the summed fleet kill him if that was the way it had to be the beyonders reported that there had been a few engagements with elements of the ulubine mercatoria military which had turned tail to run and then encountered their forces but even there the archimandrite was hearing rumours that the fleeing navarchy ships were being allowed to surrender or even accept a sort of neutral internment still fully crewed and armed rather than being destroyed or captured so luseferous was alone again abandoned by his treacherous allies theyd lured him here got him to remove part of the threat against them and now no doubt hoped that hed take on the summed fleet squadrons when they arrived doing the work they were too cowardly to do themselves well the strategists and tacticians were seriously considering cutting their losses and heading back home again this would seem ignominious to some but if it was the best thing to be done then that was all there was to it again hed kept calm when hed first heard this latest galling concept he wasnt stupid he could see the situation for himself do what the enemy least expected what they would least want you to do they might it was still just a might set off back for the relative safety of epiphany far away across the empty regions of space theyd spent all those years crossing it would be unfortunate but it might be the best thing to do all the same theyd have to leave a lot of ships behind and theyd certainly have to abandon the luseferous vii it was too slow and too tempting a target but they could do it theyd leave behind sufficient forces to force the summed fleet to first fight within the system and then station some craft there theyd take only the fastest ships and so have a head start and theyd hope to lure away the main part of the remainder of the summed fleet squadrons the bit that would be likely to come after them by sending the luseferous vii and a small escort screen of lesser ships off in a different direction it was a horrible thing to have to think about this running away so soon after getting here and achieving complete victory but it might be better than standing and fighting when the outcome of the resulting battle was so finely balanced or of course they could find what they had really come for this dweller list key this transform this magic formula with that in his possession luseferous would have a bargaining counter of almost infinite value so he was told anyway and for the sake of their own hides his advisers had better be utterly spoton right with this one literally hed have the fuckers skinned alive if theyd led him all this way for nothing in the meantime one last throw one final chance to find what theyd come for all far too rushed and desperate but like all the greatest leaders the archimandrite knew that he was at his best when he was under pressure when the odds were against him and victory was far from certain of course this didnt happen very often to him because he didnt allow it to always better to win easily but hed had his share of narrow victories and pressure situations in the past and come out on top and he hadnt forgotten and he certainly hadnt lost his touch he knew he would prevail he always did victory was the only thinkable option he could do it he just had to be decisive and determined that was what he was best at it was almost better this way with so little time with just the one chance there was no question that it had to be an allornothing noholdsbarred approach there was simply no time to go through all the other more reasonable techniques forget playing it calm and quiet fuck diplomacy abandon all thought of being reasonable and hoping people would be reasonable in return just fucking do it the archimandrite had made his preparations as best he could the tacticians thought the first elements of the summed fleet could be hurtling past at nearlight speed in less than a dozen days with the rest not far behind no more waiting it was now or never they were in the belly of the great ship the hideous swirling hallucinogenic face of nasqueron lay beneath their feet visible through diamond film the archimandrite had risked coming aboard the luseferous vii for this if there was some attack on it unlikely but not impossible so far ahead of the main part of the summed fleet squadrons then it would almost certainly have to come from above and the sheer bulk of the vessel ought to protect them he had the rapacious waiting immediately underneath the main hull nearby linked by a short shiptoship he could be out of his impressively large seat across the chamber and aboard and away in a minute to be on the safe side he had dressed in an emergency esuit a thin constrictive but reassuring presence beneath his formal robes the collarhelmet was hidden by his cowl which like the rest of his outer garment was made of tanned voehn blizzardskin cradled against the rapacious now that it had been fully checked for bugs and bombs was the ship that the liss woman had used to bring the man saluus kehar to him the tech people were very impressed with it they thought it could probably outrun any ship the other side had luseferous would have been more impressed if it could outrun any missile or beam the other side had they were here for a conference a meeting ostensibly to discuss how the new regime in power within the rest of ulubis system might liaise with the dwellers the hierchon ormilla was present as was the rest of the surviving mercatoria top brass there hadnt really been time to start serious alterations on the mercatorial power structure and when hed found that as the beyonders had reported the mercatoria was disliked and resented by most of its citizenssubjects but not actively hated by them luseferous had left the bulk of the civil authorities in place the main players had all pledged allegiance to him apart from fleet admiral brimiaice whod been killed in action the shrievalty colonel somjomion whod disappeared and was probably on one of the ships that had run away and the cessorian clerkregnant voriel whod chosen death rather than what he seemed to regard as the dishonour of recanting his religious vows idiot luseferous had shot him himself hed had some of the people whod been involved in the dweller embassy set up a few months before the invasion brief him on what to expect from the floats most of the embassy people had been killed when the commander of the ship they were in had refused to surrender but a few had survived luseferous wasnt sure he trusted them though three of his own top halfdozen commanders were present too the rest were engaged elsewhere keeping an armed presence wherever it might be needed and preparing for the anticipated highspeed passthrough of the summed fleets advance units no beyonders of course they were still in shock from his unconscionable behaviour in the matter of the single small city and a habitat full of artists weirdos and dogooders he must tell them hed only chosen the city whatever it was called hed forgotten because it was on the coast and sheltered by mountains so that he could do his sculpting trick again that would horrify them all over again with luck the delegates representatives whatever the fuck they were from the dweller side were an unprepossessing bunch they looked big and impressive especially in their giant wheellike esuits but there was the apparently perennial dweller problem of finding somebody with sufficient authority to speak for a whole planet hed learned early on in his career that dwellers were best avoided leave them alone and theyd leave you alone he wouldnt have chosen to have anything whatsoever to do with the damn floats if he could possibly have avoided it but he couldnt so he was doing his best present were three dwellers all were supposedly as senior as each other and they were each alone no aides or secretaries or underlings of any sort which with any other species would have indicated that these were not serious people at all but with dwellers meant nothing in particular they were feurish some sort of political scholar who spoke for the great redbrown equatorial band they could see beneath them chintsion who was the current chiefofchiefs of an umbrella organisation representing all their clubs and other voluntary organisations sounded insulting but allegedly their clubs included their supposedly highly effective military and peripule who was the city administrator of their largest city though this was not a capital city in the accepted sense and apparently being voted to be city administrator was regarded as an imposition not an honour or a chance to enjoy power they all had grandiosesounding titles that didnt really mean anything all they did was tell you how old the dwellers were the archimandrite would have preferred more obviously senior people if such a thing existed in dweller society and more of them but he had to work with what was to hand especially given the time constraints they did have other dwellers on the luseferous vii however over three hundred of them two whole shiploads of adolescents and young adults had been welcomed aboard for an extended tour as part of what sounded like a school trip for grownups an alienship enthusiasts club apparently he would never have allowed this normally luseferous was fairly certain that he didnt really have the dwellers full attention his alienwatching experts advised him that the majority of the population of nasqueron was unconcerned about the small war that had just taken place and the presence of the invasion fleet in fact the majority didnt even know what had happened and would be unlikely to care the planets news services such as they were were full of reports concerning something called a formal war taking place between two of the atmospheric bands this appeared to be a form of extreme sport played out on a vast scale rather than what luseferous would regard as a proper war they were playing well he would just have to see what he could do to make them take proper notice of him suspended over the vast view the attendees seemed to hang as though about to fall above them on a network of gantries luseferouss personal guard stalked in exoskels the pads of their clawfeet stalking with a steady silent precision lets get to the point luseferous said after some desultory inconsequentialities had gone on far too long we want the seer fassin taak he told the dwellers even more to the point we want certain information hes supposed to have been looking for what information chintsion asked the clubs chief was proving the most voluble of the three dwellers so far his huge esuit sat cradled in a slingseat poised over the shallow concavity of diamond film beneath the planets bilious reflected light shining faintly up from underneath him his esuit was grey with garish pink chevrons we are not at liberty to divulge that luseferous told the dweller why not asked the scholar feurish his esuit was a kind of dirty white i cant tell you luseferous said he held up a gloved ringed hand and please dont ask why just accept this the dwellers were silent they were probably signalling to each other his tech people had warned him of this and had attempted to design the slingseats so that the creatures couldnt communicate like that but as soon as the dwellers had seen the seating arrangements theyd protested and fussed and started pulling and prodding and attempting to reconfigure their seats and even began rearranging them so that they were in positions relative to each other which they liked better luseferous had ground his diamond teeth signalled to the tech people to help and waited for the dwellers to declare themselves happy finally they were all sitting in a great circle the dwellers and the hierchon and his handful of advisers forming most of one half of the circumference the humans and others including the archimandrite making up the other half we dont know where seer fassin taak is chintsion told luseferous last heard of he was making for a city in the northern polar region called eponia though that is just a rumour eponia the third dweller peripule said his esuit was deep gleaming brown frilled like seaweed i heard he was seen in deilte deilte chintsion said scornfully at this time of year he is an alien peripule said he knows nothing of fashion well first of all chintsion began he has a minder and gentlemen luseferous said the three dwellers all rocked back as though shocked the archimandrite luseferous is a busy man the hierchon ormilla boomed discussions regarding the seasonal fashionability of cities in nasqueron might be best conducted between sessions not during little dweller chintsion said to the hierchon we are as a favour to your latest batch of masters and notwithstanding the likely and faintly hilarious brevity of their precedence attempting to establish the whereabouts of this taak fellow the luseferous stopped listening he turned to tuhluer who sat just behind and to the side of him he looked the other man in the eye tuhluer held his gaze luseferous saw the other man swallow still his gaze was held tuhluer had never dared to do that before luseferous bent fractionally towards him and said quietly desperate times require desperate solutions tuhluer the other man looked down then nodded and started fingertapping signals into his glove the archimandrite turned to the front again a distant thud sounded followed a second later by another then another like a great clock ticking luseferous listened to the two ulubine peregals old men called tlipeyn and emoerte trying to wheedle the dwellers into being more cooperative the dwellers gave every indication of being sincerely unable even to understand what the word meant out of the corner of his eye minutely silhouetted against the filthy yellowbrown clouds of the planet beneath them the archimandrite could see a line of tiny specks drifting off to one side heading towards the passing cloud tops thousands of kilometres below believe us when we say that we are serious commander binstey his cinc of ground forces was saying to the three dwellers oh im sure you are chintsion said airily that does not alter the fact that we may be entirely unable to help you commander binstey started to speak again but then luseferous interrupted him gentlemen he said quietly and binstey fell silent if i may direct your attention to the view over to one side there he waved one ringed hand over to the side where the stippled line of specks was moving slowly across the gasily distorted face of the planet everybody looked the dwellers twisted slightly in their seats those present in the chamber with especially good eyesight were already reacting he could hear mutters gasps all the usual expressions of shock we are serious luseferous told the dwellers he stood do you hear that noise he turned his head as though listening the dull ticking noise went on steady remorseless that is a dropbomb chute firing once a second only in this case it is firing people not warheads unprotected human beings are being thrown into space towards your planet at a rate of over three thousand per hour they are men women and children old and young adults people from all walks of life mostly captured from surrendered ships and damaged habitats we have over twenty thousand of them aboard they will continue to be fired at this rate until we make some sort of progress here he waited for some sort of reaction from the three dwellers but they just kept on looking at the view now he continued do any of us here present think we might have just remembered anything useful he watched the people and the aliens staring at the stippled line of black dots moving slowly away from the great ship a few people turned to look at him then looked away when he met their gaze trying to hide hatred and fear and horror odd how people reacted so severely to something unpleasant happening right in front of them but were prepared to ignore much worse horrors taking place elsewhere he nodded to tuhluer and a great screen lit up across one side of the chamber showing the process people humans of all sorts as hed said were shown being loaded into a number of huge circular magazines the humans were almost all struggling but they were each constrained by a tight wrapping like an elastic sleeping bag which covered every bit of them except for their faces and prevented them from doing anything but squirm like maggots and spit at and try to bite the exoskelwearing soldiers loading them into the launcher magazines the floor of the vast hold was covered in wriggling struggling bodies the sound turned up and those present in the conference chamber could hear the humans screaming and crying and shouting and begging archimandrite the hierchon shouted i have to protest at this i didnt shut up the archimandrite bellowed at him he looked round the others all of you not a fucking word for a while the only sound was the muffled thud thud thud of the launcher the scene switched to the muzzle of the launcher on the exterior of the ship firing very gently for a gun the people into space their wrapping came off as they were expelled snapping back around their ankles so that they could writhe and jerk and spasm satisfactorily as they met the vacuum naked and suffocated some tried to hold their breaths and bulged fit to explode blood specked from ears and eyes and mouths and anuses the cameras followed them the people usually moved for about a couple of minutes before they stopped then they just assumed the one frozen pose some curled foetal some spreadeagled and tumbled slowly part of an invisible conveyor belt towards the faraway cloud tops exactly why are you doing this the dweller feurish asked the archimandrite he sounded merely puzzled to concentrate minds luseferous said coldly he could hear somebody being sick in the chamber not many people were meeting his gaze the gantries above were thick with immobile guards weapons already trained on the people below well my mind was perfectly concentrated feurish said with what sounded like a sigh we still cant help you give me seer fassin taak luseferous said feeling some sweat what start to break out on his forehead he put a stop to that at once we havent got this taak fellow the city administrator peripule said reasonably tell me where he is luseferous demanded sorry chintsion said cant help fucking tell me luseferous roared how can we feurish began then chintsion broke in perhaps we can ask the people who claim to have seen seer taak last where they think he might be there were people from the embassy who were reported to be looking for him feurish pointed out perhaps they found something i thought they were all killed when the embassy ships were destroyed chintsion said werent they look peripule said reasonably to the archimandrite why dont we just sleep on it eh luseferous pointed furiously at the line of bodies heading slowly towards the planet dont you fuckwits understand that doesnt stop until i get what i want the three dwellers twisted to look as one hmm peripule said thoughtfully i do hope you have enough people luseferouss fists clenched he felt close to exploding as though he was one of the people in the little production line of death sliding past the bowed diamond window he struggled to keep his voice icily calm as he said there are three hundred dweller youngsters aboard this ship perhaps if we used them instead or for target practice what do you think i think youll annoy people chintsion said and laughed youre not seriously trying to use threats against us are you feurish asked i had better point out mr luseferous chintsion said with what sounded almost like humour that some of the clubs i represent are of a military bent wonderfully enthusiastic of course proud to personify them naturally but sometimes i dont know perhaps through boredom they display characteristics which might almost be said to be bordering on those one would expect to be evinced by fellows of a shootfirst mentality ah if you know what i mean luseferous stared at this cretinous float the plodding thud thud thud sound went on the line of tiny dark shapes continued to move across the tortured livid face of the gasgiant he turned to tuhluer go to full action stations he said dark the view the vast face of nasqueron disappeared as the diamond bubble went obsidian black the whole great chamber grew still darker and seemed to shrink the thudding noise sounded louder you three are to be held hostage luseferous told the three dwellers as will the young of your kind currently aboard this ship if there is any attempt to rescue you or them or any assault on this ship or on any of my ships or assets you will all be killed if i dont get something provably useful on seer fassin taak or whatever it was he was looking for in the next six hours standard im going to start killing you anyway starting with you three understand really mr luseferous feurish said this is no way to run a conference i have to say that i have to agree chintsion said shut up luseferous told them i also have numerous ships with multirealtonne antimatter warheads stationed right round this gasgiant planetbusters if theres still nothing happening after youre all dead i start detonating them in your precious fucking atmosphere what passes for the authorities on your giant rotten fart of a planet will be informed of the above in due course the archimandrite looked up at the guards poised on the gantries above take them away get them out of those esuits by cutting if necessary a dozen giant black figures like suits of ancient armour encrusted with huge dark jewels sailed down landing on the black diamond film on great talonspread legs four surrounded each of the three esuited dwellers well gentlemen the dweller called peripule said ruefully to the other two i suppose it is not open to us to claim we went unwarned an instant later three violet circular curtains of light blazed out within the dark chamber one encircling each dweller the exoskel guards were either rocked right back or physically blown over those unprotected people standing or sitting further away were picked up and thrown towards the walls the shock wave hit luseferouss tall seat a fraction after the safety shield deployed so that he watched the resulting chaos through a clinker of halfsilvered diamond shutters the blast shook his seat shook him and then reflected and echoed back off the distant walls the three violet cylinders disappeared and left three huge neatly circular holes in the black diamond film beneath the sickly light of nasquerons yellowbrown cloud tops shone through the air in the chamber was whirling and screaming out through the apertures blinks of white light flickered outside two of the exoskel guards were tumbled across the floor scrabbling for grip and were sucked out of the holes luseferous just stood staring people mostly unconscious and badly injured started to slide in from the edges of the chamber where theyd been deposited by the triple blasts towards the three shining holes a third exoskeletonclad figure was being pulled giant hands scraping and scrabbling frantically at the smooth diamond surface towards the nearest hole and the whirling vortex forming above it then the ships systems finally woke up to what was happening and a dark shape flicked across the three puncture wounds in the vessels skin sealing off the light and keeping what remained of the atmosphere within relative calm returned the thud thud thud noise continued a rushing sound signalled replacement air being pumped back into the chamber the exoskel guards got to their feet looked around then ran over to form a protective shield about the archimandrite more black shapes came plummeting from the gantries luseferous could hear people in the chamber moaning he turned to look at tuhluer who was limping up to him through the phalanx of exoskel guards his own emergency esuit and helmet deployed the shiny bulge of faceplate reflecting the silvery diamond bubble that enclosed the archimandrite and his chair kill the other dwellers luseferous told him tuhluer leaned in hand to the side of his head seemingly not hearing kill the other dwellers luseferous shouted he clicked a stud on the arm of the seat and the diamond shuttering fell away get us away from here he told the other man warn the planet the am warheads launch in three hours if they dont start cooperating he looked at where the three dweller representatives had made their sudden exit and make sure the rapacious wasted those three comedians sir tuhluer said and what about the chute supply it took a moment before luseferous realised that he meant the people being launched towards the planet he waved one hand oh dump the lot the archimandrite luseferous clicked the esuits communicator and told the rapacious he was on his way he marched through the moaning wounded towards the shiptoship and the waiting vessel beneath the exoskel guards fell in around him forming a giant hedge of armoured limbs and menacingly jagged torsos he was almost at the shiptoship entrance when he was thrown off his feet the exoskels staggered as the whole vast ship shook one of the giant guards nearly fell on him regaining his balance only at the last moment servos whining now what luseferous demanded damage control here sir a voice said from the esuit energy bolt straight through the whole ship dead amidships about two metres diameter plus the bows have been shot off back to about the eightymetre mark just gone same novel energy profile as the midships beam light speed zero warning reactive defence systems still looking for a countermeasure against any subsequent usage nothing coming up so far sir comms sir another voice said dwellers demanding return of their people aboard apparently those were just warning shots tuhluer came striding up luseferous looked at him hand the dwellers back he told the adc then get this thing away from here he strode towards the shiptoship and the am ships sir leave them where they are delay the ultimatum until the luseferous vii is clear sir this time the archimandrite made it all the way to the waiting flagship an hour later the luseferous vii was still making its lumbering injured way out of the planets gravity well the rapacious was already half a million klicks away and still accelerating the archimandrite still shaking with rage even in his acceleration couch the full awfulness and sheer insult of what had happened at last sinking in his patience finally exhausted those three facetious shithead dwellers had even escaped esuits reflecting or deflecting everything the rapacious had thrown at them after theyd exited the luseferous vii disappearing apparently unharmed into the cloud tops ordered that the ultimatum be made to the dwellers immediately and that one of the ships carrying an am warhead should drop its weapon into the planets atmosphere just to show that they were serious the reply was almost instantaneous the ship with the am bomb each one of the twenty ships with the am bombs vanished in a sudden pinpoint flare of light all the warheads went off partially reacting messily with the ordinary matter debris left after the destruction of the ships twenty ragged little suns guttered round nasqueron like a tilted necklace flaring fading flaring again and fading slowly once more moments later a hypervelocity missile rose out of the turgid skies of the gasgiant and found the luseferous vii despite all its desperate countermeasures within two minutes of clearing the cloud tops the radiation front tripped the rapaciouss sensor buffers that was how a proper antimatter warhead was supposed to work seemed to be the implication the last signal from the great ship before it was ripped entirely apart and turned into radiation and highspeed shrapnel was from aidedecamp tuhluer calmly informing luseferous that the archimandrite was a cunt fassin taak looked up at the stars of home he felt tears in his eyes even within the shockgel he rested on a windswept platform above a small cloudtop city low in the south polar region just a couple of thousand kilometres from the torn fluid boundary with nasquerons southernmost atmospheric belt he tried to locate a friendly satellite some signal that the little gascraft could recognise but he couldnt find anything all broadcast signals were either terribly weak or scrambled and he couldnt locate any loworbit devices to bounce a hail off he tried to lock on to one of the weak broadcast wavelengths and use the gascrafts biomind to decipher the signals but the routines didnt seem to be working he gave up for the moment he was content just to sit here and look out at the few familiar stars despite ysuls injuries theyd still had to undergo an albeit slightly gentler form of the wild spiralling fassin had lain in the gascraft feeling the series of nested corkscrewings and helixes build up like some coiling spring thinking that this was them entering the wormhole though in fact as it turned out theyd already been through it and this was the unwinding then suddenly they were here back in nasqueron in the southern polar region not the northern one theyd left from sinking down just a few kilometres through the cloud tops the exvoehn ship protreptic had come to rest in a slightly toobig cradle in an enormous echoing cavern of a hangar here in the lower regions of the nearly deserted polar city of quaibrai the city administrator and a crowd of several hundred dwellers had met them hooting and throwing streamers and scent grenades a delegation comprising individuals from several different alienship enthusiast clubs had become particularly excited when theyd seen the voehn craft and had bobbed up and down with impatience as ysul had been carefully offloaded and given into the care of a hospital squad as soon as ysul fassin and the truetwin quercer janath had exited the chirping sizzling mass of enthusiasts rushed aboard jostling for position as theyd tried to fit down the corridors and access ways the truetwin had thoughtfully expanded the ship from its needleship portalpiercing formation to a fatter and hence more commodious configuration but it still looked like a tight squeeze ysul already looking half mended though still shaking off the grogginess of his semicoma had twisted a fraction in his scoopstretcher to look at fassin as the hospital squad brought their ambulance skiff down to him see hed croaked got you back safely didnt i fassin had agreed that he had hed tried to pat ysul but used the wrong manipulator and instead just jerked in midgas hed swivelled and used the gascrafts other arm clutching the wounded dwellers hubhand you off home now ysul had asked however much of it is left i dont know i dont know what to do well if you do go come back soon ysul had paused and shaken himself as though trying to wake up more fully i should be ready to receive visitors again in a couple of dozen days or so and i anticipate a very full social calendar indeed thereafter i fully intend to exploit my recent injuries and experiences without compunction and exaggerate outrageously my part in the taking of the voehn ship not to mention embellish my fight with the voehn commander to the point of what will probably seem like complete unrecognisability the first time you hear it id appreciate your corroboration providing you are able to enter into the spirit of the thing and not insist on being overly encumbered by the vulgar exigencies of objective truth whatever version of it you may think you recall what do you say my memorys kind of hazy fassin had told the dweller ill probably back up anything you say splendid if i can come back i shall privately he didnt even know if he could get away in the first place he didnt know what sort of infrastructure remained to get him off the planet get the gascraft repaired and return him if whoever was in charge would let him return nor whether the dwellers would allow him to return during the last part of the sixhour journey from the wormhole when quercer janath had allowed him to see where they were and let him access the local datacarrying spectra hed tapped into the nasqueron news services to see what had been going on during his absence the dweller news was all about the war the formal war between zone and belt c apparently it had become deeply exciting and enthralling and was already being talked of in respected critical circles as a classic of the genre even though it was probably barely halfway through yet and still with any luck at all had a great deal to offer fassin had to search out a specialist alienwatcher service to find out that starting about thirtyplus days earlier the ulubis system had been invaded and taken over by the epiphany discon or starveling cult forces under the leadership of the archimandrite luseferous the last significant organised ulubine mercatorial resistance had ended just a dozen or so days ago following the formal surrender by the hierchon ormilla after the destruction of a city on sepekte and a habitat in orbit around it a counterattack by several squadrons of the summed fleet was expected to commence within the next few dozen days or so the latest was that a peace and cooperation conference was taking place about now in the starveling ship luseferous vii in orbit about nasqueron fassin had sent a message which would at least attempt to find valseir he would wait a bit and see if that raised a reply hed thought of contacting setstyin but then he remembered vaguely that somebody had said something to him that had made him uneasy about the dweller no wait it had been the other way round hadnt it setstyin had always been a charming and helpful friend setstyin had warned him against the old dweller whod been in charge of the great spherical thing that had risen out of the clouds and demolished the mercatorias raiding force at the gasclipper regatta yes that made more sense he wondered why he couldnt remember in more detail it was strange hed always had a really good memory quercer janath seemed to be surrounded by wellwishers wanting to know more about the voehn craft the truetwin dweller had seen fassin looking at them through the crowd and waved fassin had waved back hed watched ysul being placed into the ambulance skiff and tried to work out what he knew and didnt know what he could and could not remember he could have gone with ysul in the ambulance he supposed but he felt a need to get away for a while to be alone for a time hed come up here to see the stars and wait and think and maybe do a bit of mathematical analysis he took the little imageleaf out of its locker in the gascrafts flank he looked at it since whatever had happened aboard the protreptic the little gascraft couldnt see as well as it used to but its closeup detail vision was good enough on one side for the image of blue sky and white clouds to be perfectly clear he zoomed in rechecking the image he had stored in the the image wasnt there in the crafts memories that was strange he had the feeling that he had recorded the image and already halfdeciphered something that was hidden inside it he was sure he had it had seemed really important at the time too he was certain fassin tried really hard to think back to what had occurred after they were attacked by the voehn ship he knew theyd been captured and interrogated and the voehn had messed around with his brain and with the gascrafts biomind and memories then a ship that the ythyn had sent to rescue them had attacked the voehn ship and somehow he and ysul and the truetwin had overpowered the surviving voehn crew theyd overpowered voehn how had that happened the ythyn ship had been able to distract the voehn and the velpin had played a part too some sort of antipiracy automatics kicking in and helping to take on the voehn quercer janath had been distinctly cagey about what sort of techniques their old ship had used against the voehn fassin had no idea maybe it had happened the way they said maybe not maybe the velpin had had an ai aboard and that had wasted the voehn only quercer janath didnt want people to know about it they could have told him practically anything and hed have believed them the voehn had messed with his memories so badly he remembered sitting on the steps of a temple looking out over a wide slowmoving river talking to an old man an old dweller this was quite a vivid image rather than a linear strand of memory that had to have happened in some form of vr didnt it maybe that old man had been the representation of the velpins ai perhaps that was who or what he had been talking to or at least met he tried to concentrate and looked down at the imageleaf again hed been given this by valseir was that right it had been a sort of calling card a letter of introduction leading him to he seemed to feel it had led him to valseir but that didnt make sense no wait the house in the depths and the old wandering dweller hed given him the imageleaf and it had led him somehow to valseir but there was something else hed discovered something else hed woken up thinking about this before the wormhole transition there was something hidden in the imageleaf a message a code fassin looked round the empty platform there was nobody else here he let the little gascrafts image processors drink in the view shown on the imageleaf in as much detail as it could offer various routines started running in a few minutes his gaze was torn away from the sparse but familiarlooking starscape above he looked at the results there had been something in there it looked like alien algebra there was about a page and a half of it it looked like one long equation or maybe three or four shorter ones he felt very excited he wasnt entirely sure why but he had an idea that this linked into the dweller list the details evaded him but he knew that hed been looking for the transform that was supposed to open up the famous list and maybe just possibly this piece of alien mathematics had something to do with it maybe what he had before him here was the transform though that was a little difficult to believe fassin tried to figure out what the symbols in front of him might mean but couldnt even get started the gascrafts comprehensively muckedaround memories might once have contained something which would have sent him in the right direction but they didnt any more he linked with the citys data nets synched with an equatorial university library and looked up a data reservoir specialising in alien mathematics he chose a couple of symbols at random and pinged them to the database it answered immediately with references what he was looking at was expressed in translatory v a panspecies universal notation of just under two billion years age devised by the longextinct wopuld from earlier dweller elements he downloaded a full translation suite he had to stop and look out over the cloud tops he was experiencing a strange mix of emotions this might be the thing hed been sent to look for the very object of his mission their mission rather he ought not to forget colonel hatherence this could well be what hed been looking for all that time and yet if the mercatoria or at least the ulubine part of it had hoped that this would save them then it hadnt hed got back too late and the invasion had already happened it was all over and there was so much he seemed to have forgotten what had the voehn done to him ysul had been badly injured but apart from the effects of his healing coma he seemed and professed himself to be fine mentally quercer janath didnt seem to have suffered at all maybe that was just luck or something to do with being a truetwin he didnt know still there was this to be done this deciphering it might still lead to something momentous the invasion might have already happened but the counterattack was still to take place and anyway there was his own take on the rights and wrongs of what was going on he would still rather the beyonders had the information if there was any useful information to be had in the equation something glinted in space just over the horizon to the west way out across the cloud tops a ship perhaps fassin returned his attention to the equation and the alien translation suite he applied one to the other in the virtual space which the gascrafts crippled biomind projected into his own mind the image split and a copy of the equation appeared alongside the original he watched the symbols shuffle and change in the copy turning into dweller standard notation the symbols on both copies of the equation flickered and highlighted turned different colours and seemed to swell out and then lapse back in again amongst the rest as the equation worked itself out it was truly an equation too hed had some vague idea thanks to something that somebody had said that it might be a frequency and signal or something but it wasnt that or if it was it was very oddly disguised the last few terms flicked and flashed on both sides of the split image the answer appeared right at the end blinking slowly it was a zero he stared at it at them a zero in dweller standard notation was a dot with a short line under it in translatory v it was a diagonal slash a dot with a short line under it winked at him from the copy of the equation a diagonal slash lay at the end of the original also slowly flashing he tried again same result he rechecked the image pulled the hidden code out of it again in case the processor systems had made a mistake the first time there had been no mistake the equation he came up with the second time was the same as the first he ran that one as well anyway zero fassin laughed he could feel himself inside the shockgel nested within the little arrowhead craft chest and belly shaking he had a sudden vivid image of standing on the rocky shore of a planet waiting for something he stopped laughing zero so the final answer was nothing hed been sent to the far side of the galaxy had the answer with him all the time anyway and what it was was fuck all but in maths he started laughing again ah well another glint out over the cloud tops again nearly directly north and high a scatter of tiny lights lit up the sky just beneath whatever it was that had just reflected the light a hint of violet then white he watched the same region of space for a few moments looking for more whatever it was it had to be fairly far away if it was the same thing that had glinted earlier near the horizon then it was something high over the equatorial zone tens of kiloklicks out zero well that was illuminating fassin wondered if there really was a true answer somewhere if what hed found what valseir had stumbled onto and then what fassin had unknowingly brought out with him after his longago delve was part of a whole suite of decoy answers was there just this one or were there more was the myth of the dweller lists famous transform footnoted with hundreds of false answers well if it was he wasnt going to go looking for them hed done his bit hed even in a sense accomplished his mission when hed thought it was never going to happen he was too late and the result was a nonsense a joke almost an insult but by any given god you cared to name hed done it he ought to start thinking about how he was going to get off the planet or at least get the information out there just for forms sake share the indifferent news another couple of flashes from space near where the first crop had shone one tiny blink one longer flare a few moments later what looked like a ships drive lit up and floated away gathering speed quickly fassin looked for evidence of any shared facility satellites or indeed any mercatorial hardware anywhere around nasqueron there didnt seem to be anything hed told aun liss hed try to ping a position between two seer satellites eq and eq but the satellites werent there any more he wondered if he could work out where they would have been and so where the microsat that hed suggested the beyonders position between the two might be he looked inside the gascrafts memory trying to find the sat schedules dug them out then fed in the local time and his current location a position blinked on his field of vision away across the cloud tops a little off due north some few kiloklicks beneath where the recent activity had been in line of sight now he decided to treat this piece of luck as a good omen and sent a signal saying he was back so that if nothing else hed have done what hed said he would do he waited a while but there was no acknowledgement let alone a reply he hadnt really expected one he wondered what was left of the shrievalty ocula and whether he should even try to report to it he needed to do some research into exactly how much had changed since the invasion see whether he was listed as dead and whether he was being looked for or not maybe people had forgotten about him in all the excitement fassin laughed again oh if only the whole e discon invasion so theyd been told was happening quite specifically because of the list and the transform if that was even partly even slightly true and his mission hadnt been hidden from the invaders then they probably would be looking for him and quite hard too given that they might not have much time before the summed fleet crashed the party in a way the zeroresult equation was a relief the information hed brought back was such that he didnt mind sharing it with anybody and everybody if it had truly told the location of the wormhole portals it would have been the most crushingly awful burden he could have borne an infinitely precious and probably infinitely deadly possession he should be glad it was a joke if it had been the useful truth if it had been what they had all hoped it was going to be then almost certainly no matter who he chose to tell would first torture him or at the very least tear his mind apart to make sure he was telling the truth and then kill him to make sure he couldnt tell anybody else hed kind of hoped that the beyonders might be more humane than that but it was a big risk to take hed be better just broadcasting the result then disappearing if he could maybe the dwellers would let him stay valseir if nothing else he ought to let his dweller friend know that the information theyd all been so concerned about in fact amounted to nothing more than a piddling little zero then there was the matter of telling valseir that for this nothing his friend and colleague leisicrofe had killed himself not all good news hed arrive bearing then fassin looked up the stormsailing news service there were fewer regattas than usual thanks to all the interest in the war and a lot of sailors whod normally be on the gasclippers and stormjammers would be required to crew the dreadnoughts and other combat craft but there were still a dozen meetings going on at any one time throughout the planet if he was going to go looking for valseir at regattas he might have a long search he thought about contacting the city administrator to arrange for transport ysul would most likely be transferred back home to hauskip city in a day or two and fassin could probably just accompany the injured dweller back there then he wondered if he ought to be more careful nobody seemed to have paid him much attention at all when hed disembarked from the protreptic but that didnt mean his arrival hadnt been noticed by somebody were there any humans other seers or anybody else present in nasq somebody valseir damn this suddenly failing memory somebody had told him there were factions and differences of opinion within the dwellers over the list and even the seemingly endemic congenital disregard the dwellers displayed towards the rest of the galaxys inhabitants we are not a monoculture that had been valseir hadnt it would any group of dwellers wish him ill or somehow be under the command of somebody who did he called up the usually most reliable alienwatching service and accessed the global map it was for the first time since hed been looking at it completely clear according to the display there was not a single alien entity alive in nasqueron that appeared to include him so his return hadnt been documented yet at least not by the enthusiasts who ran this service he was being called quercer janath he put the imageleaf back in its flank locker fassin anywhere we can take you locally hasten to add ship at our disposal favour owed that sort of thing i dont know fassin replied ive been thinking about that do you know any more about whats happening with the invasion and the starveling cult forces getting reports coming in just now that theres been some sort of breakdown at some conference firefight bluntly id like to find my friend valseir fassin said ive sent a call but no answers come back i thought i might find him at a as he spoke he thought suddenly of the rushwing sheumerith the dwellers hanging trailed on long lines behind the great long flexible wing forever powering its way into the high skies of nasqueron the rushwing that was the other place valseir had said he might be found yes he told the truetwin i do know where you could take me be inatmosphere you realise not that quick entirely used up our luck quotient bringing the ship into nasq unseen in the first place voehn ship see nervousmaking sort of thing for a lot of people apparently thats fine fassin told them they were scudding through the cloud stems under the topmost haze layer less than an hour later when the am warheads went off one was directly above them oh wow look at our shadow a minute later what they would later discover had been the destruction of the great ship luseferous vii cast part of a giant halo of light all over the western sky quercer janath freely confessed to being terribly impressed the protreptic tore serenely on the first twelve ships of the summed fleet streaked across the inner system of ulubis at just a per cent below light speed kilometrelong black minarets girdled by fastspinning sections loosing missile clusters pack munitions scatter mines stealth drones and suicide launchers they lanced across the whole system in less than four hours nasquerons orbit in less than one and sepektes in fifteen minutes billions of kilometres behind them on the same course and decelerating hard lay the mannlichercarcano and the main body of the summed fleet taince yarabokin floated in her pod in the vr command space of the battleship there was something approaching total silence as the entire command crew lay quietly listening to the sparse exchanges beaming back from the twelve advance units darting across the system dead ahead taince was amazed at how nervous she felt she could feel her body trying to exhibit all the classic signs of the fightorflight response and the pods bio systems doggedly countering each one there was no doubt that this was an important mission it would arguably be the most crucial one shed ever been a part of she was of sufficiently senior rank to have been briefed at the start on the strategic momentousness of what they were being sent to do but even so she was surprised how similar she felt now to the way shed felt on her first few combat missions you never fully shook off the adrenalin rush no matter how many missions you undertook the consensus was that the day you felt completely blase about a forthcoming engagement was either the day you were going to die or the day you should resign your commission forthwith but the way she felt now was worryingly similar to how shed felt before those early missions somewhere her nervousness would be being noted too even if a live human medical officer wasnt watching her life signs now a program would be flagging her current state of anxiety as worth further investigation later no privacy well shed known that when she joined up taince took her mind away from these perplexing almost embarrassing feelings and watched the data coming back from the lead ships what happened now what these twelve craft discovered or didnt discover as they crossed the system at accelerated particle speeds would determine how the next part of her life was lived out there had been some odd energy and drive signatures from the system over the last few days though nothing as bizarre as the sudden commotion around nasqueron a few days ago twentyplus antimatter explosions all but one it looked like spread around the planet in a neat if wavy circle theyd detonated too far out to do any great damage to the gasgiant itself or to its inhabitants and the explosions had been very messy almost as if they hadnt been functioning warheads detonating efficiently but rather twenty very big ships losing mam containment at exactly the same time then a minute or two later an even bigger am burst less than a light second out from nasqueron with the profile of something the size of the behemoth ship theyd identified earlier getting thoroughly blasted then nothing apart from the ambiguous maybeleaving indications because one plausible explanation that fitted most of the signs no explanation anyone had come up with so far fitted all of them was that the bad guys were pulling out nobody in fleet command really believed this was what could be happening the starveling cult force had crossed decades of space to get to ulubis they wouldnt turn tail and face the equally long trek back after just a few weeks would they but it looked like one of the more likely explanations the data about to arrive would decide it one way or the other the battlecruiser the advance squadrons flagship collating the realtime intelligence of the spearheadshaped force and signalling it back to the main fleet reported three heavy craft within detection though not attack range of the first point destroyer it signalled two of the following cruisers to adjust their trajectories and prepare remote munitions guided and dumb little comms bleed possibly this was just good discipline or marginally better tech than theyd anticipated flank cruisers and destroyers reported a few missile platforms firing at them futilely given their speed a lot of mines well spread evidence of am material still floating free near the planet nasqueron in a debris profile that fitted exactly twenty ships having blown up at the same time eight days earlier one big debris field still heading outwards from the gasgiant spreading consistent with a very large ship having been destroyed a few other small enemy ships showing the closest responding to their passing firing beam weapons no hits the destroyer bofors passed within a kiloklick of a vessel of about the same size as it identified it as a hostile before the other ship had even registered the craft hurtling past and hit and destroyed it with a highxray laser from its phasemodulation collar turret before the hostile had time to react halfway across the system now still just the three big targets there should be hundreds the four craft at the trailing end of the advance squadrons spearpoint had time to spare while they nudgedeflected and picked off some of the targets that the point and midbody ships had identified they turned longrange sensors on the outer system and beyond in the general direction of the e discon getting a straightdown look along that track which the main fleet had only ever been able to view at a ninetydegree angle drive signatures hundreds of them most of a thousand ships all heading for home taking a slightly acutely angled route that had hidden their drives from the main body of the fleet for the last six or seven days half an hour later it was like party time the advance squadron was almost all the way through the system braking hard to return in a few dozen days and the small formations of ships between them and the main body of the fleet had been ordered to forget about followup highspeed passes and start decelerating at their individual safe maxima all the signs were that the system was almost clear of enemy ships and the starveling cults main fleet was in highspeed retreat back along roughly the course it had approached on even the three big targets were powering up now and heading in the same direction as the decamping invasion force a few dozen smaller drives lit up as smaller lighter craft got set to bail out too there would be some clearingup to do and no doubt various mines and automatic munitions to try and keep them occupied while the enemy fleet made its escape but there would be no main fleet engagement in ulubis system no megabattle their orders were to retake ulubis system at any cost and hold it a fast light force of a dozen or so ships might be sent to harry the tardier fringes of the retreating fleet and provide continuing incentivisation for their speedy withdrawal but they were specifically not to risk chasing en masse for some decisive battle they had already achieved victory they were expressly forbidden from taking the slightest risk of throwing it all away the command staff were celebrating taince lay curled in her pod listening to her colleagues babbling with happiness and obvious relief various people talked to her gabbing away about how the mere threat of their arrival could turn away a fleet three times the size of theirs how they wished now theyd been with the advance squadron just to have seen some action dammit and how they were probably going to get a heroes welcome when they got to ulubis she tried to respond in kind mustering expressions of tension released and fears assuaged and all the time pretending to pretend that shed have preferred a proper fight vice admiral the image of admiral kisipt appeared in front of her automatically displacing all the other images of celebrating crew sir she tried to pull her thoughts away from the sick feeling inside you must be pleased we wont have to turn your home system into too much of a battleground of course sir though there will be mines booby traps no doubt no doubt and im keeping a full sweep alert in operation between here and the system just in case kisipt paused the old voehns head tipped to one side as he regarded her think it has been very stressful for you anticipating what might happen when we got to ulubis yes i suppose so sir taince wondered if hed already been alerted to her earlier nervousness if this was a conversation even a kind of evaluation inspired by that hmm well the place doesnt look too badly shot up judging from the advance results you ought to be able to relax soon well need you for liaison and ceremonial duties mostly i should think the admiral made a smile that will be all right of course sir thank you good the admiral made a show of looking around at the other images distributed about his own icon well id better talk to a few more people calm them down remind them theres still a job to be done as you were vice sir the admirals image disappeared taince didnt bring any of the others to the fore but turned away from the social space altogether for tacspace what have i become she thought staring into the dark volumes of tacspace watching and not watching coloured lines move and slowly extend groups of figures groups of ships tracing their way through the deep space skies bordering ulubis system i wanted a proper battle death and destruction i wanted death and destruction i wanted the chance to die the chance to kill the chance to die she stared into the awful emptiness as people celebrated around her what have i become fassin felt restless as the protreptic powered its way through the belts and zones of nasqueron heading for the rushwing sheumerith riding high in the clear gas spaces between two haze layers in band a the exvoehn ship shredded clouds as it sped through the atmosphere keeping just under the median cloud level quercer janath amused themselves by taking turns to pilot in realtime and see by how little they could miss shaving the edges of plungestems this involved quite a lot of whooping and the occasional softish collision making the whole ship shudder fassin left them to it and floated away back through the ship ending up in the chamber where their interrogation and the fight had taken place he looked round it at the dentseats and restraints at the scars and burn marks on the floor ceilings and walls and could remember nothing about what had happened he felt frustrated even depressed he floated back towards the command space stopping just before he got there to look inside what appeared to be the commanders cabin close to the flight deck the cabin was sparsely furnished and decorated fassin suspected that it had lost a few bits and pieces to some of the more acquisitive alienship enthusiasts back at quaibrai he looked at a square on the wall where something had been removed the protreptic shook very slightly a distant whoop sounded from the command space a couple of open doors and a short corridor away fassin experienced a shudder of his own and a feeling of something like deja vu or swim i was born in a water moon he thought to himself knowing he was quoting something or somebody but not knowing what or who another shudder ran through the ship highpitched giggles rang from the flight deck zero hey fassin quercer janath sent call for you patch through who is it he asked no ident human female voice hold on well ask zero fassin thought zero it was a fucking answer aun liss name given any bells rung the rushwing sheumerith a thin blade across the dun sky held no sign of valseir the protreptic went off to bag more plungestems promising to return fassin flew the little gascraft wearily along the line of tethered oblivious winghanging dwellers waiting for a sign in the end the other gascraft was obvious he spotted it from a couple of thousand metres away the other device saw him at the same time and sent fassin no im a warhead who are you aun see youve brought a gun hed taken a voehn handweapon from the protreptic once hed found an armoury that hadnt been raided for souvenirs by the ship enthusiasts of quaibrai quercer janath hadnt objected on the contrary theyd advised him in rather too much detail on the differing capabilities and skill profiles of the various guns on offer when all he wanted was something robust reliable and powerful that he could use to defend or kill himself with so in his good manipulator fassin now toted a chunky device of what quercer janath had termed the cbe persuasion crude but effective he made a show of holding the charged weapon in front of his primary sensing band as he approached yes he sent its a souvenir he drew up by the other machine it was about the same size and shape as his own if in rather better condition and oriented at ninety degrees the vertical axis longer than the horizontal it rode inside the cup of still gas behind the open diamond shelter trailing behind the rushwing near the port limit of the tenkilometre wing wary unable to be anything else he noted that the two enclosures on either side of the one holding the other small gascraft were each occupied by large dwellers who looked rather young to have given themselves up even temporarily to a life of highspeed highaltitude contemplation the nearest few tether points beyond those on either side were all empty come on in the other machine sent moving forward until its nose nestled into the inner surface of the diamond enclosure he pulled in behind wobbling in the sudden pool of still gas after the howl of slipstream they were almost touching most of the upper surface of the machine facing him turned transparent showing somebody who certainly looked like aun liss lying nearly fully prone in a highgee seat he saw her fight to raise an arm and wave a grim expression on her face that turned into a grin as she looked out at him he deopaqued what he could of his own gascrafts carapace though the results werent perfect fassin didnt even try to smile back think you could point that thing away from me she sent he saw her grin i realise this is the first time ive ever said that to no he sent back still pointing the voehn gun at her okay she sent smile vanishing so welcome back good trip no you got a manipulator you can use in that thing yes wont claim im an expert but he moved his own gascraft forward until it was centimetres from hers talk to me the old way he saw her frown then smile uncertainly okay she sent this might be a bit ah he could see her shifting her gaze to look down at her right forearm lying squashed on the cradlearm of the geechair she looked like she always had and at the same time quite different hair dark not blonde or auburn or white this time the high gravity and her attempt to look at her arm as she worked the unfamiliar manipulator interface gave her jowls he was already fairly sure it was aun but he was still quite prepared to kill her the manipulator came out slowly unsteadily fassin kept his own well out of the way still holding the gun on her the two big dwellers on either side hadnt made any move the manipulator came forward and touched the hull carapace of his own little gascraft finger ends spreading awkwardly in the end he saw she had to close her eyes to do it the fingers on the abraded nearly insensitive gascrafts skin spelled out ss sol sotl he could see her getting frustrated he watched the expression on her face deepen into a profound eyestightlyclosed frown as she struggled to make the manipulator do exactly what she wanted he felt tears prick his eyes again though he could still shoot her or himself anybody so stl crzy she managed at last and her eyes opened and she flashed a hugely relieved and pleasedwithherself smile at him he switched the gun off they rode together in the still ball of gas behind the cup of diamond held on a deep curve of line behind the rushwings thin blade not us that wasnt us not guilty it wasnt even the starvelings murdering fucks though they may be then who did do it the mercatoria fass they killed your people what why because they found out that sept bantrabal had kept whatever they were sent that briefed you they were supposed to junk it from the substrate as soon as it was finished but they didnt it wasnt quite an ai like they sent to the hierchon but it had a lot in common it was a big step along the way to a true ai and it was onwardengineerable thats why the attacks we and the starvelings were making gave them the cover but even if the truth got out it would just reinforce how seriously they took the noais thing fassin supposed it made sense old slovius had always been looking for an edge some advantage over the other septs that was what had brought bantrabal to its position of prominence over the years it sounded plausible sounded like something slovius would do and browbeat his underlings into doing and certainly hed put nothing past the mercatoria and how do you know all this he asked her he saw her shake her head spies everywhere fass she told him almost rueful we have a lot of friends im sure did he believe her well until further notice the beyonders had known about the list about the transform like it seemed a lot of people they had known long before he had hed only discovered what hed stumbled upon during that longago delve when hed been told along with everybody else by the projection of admiral quile in the hierchons palace by then the beyonders had long since sent their own fleet to the system zateki believing like the jeltick who had first deciphered the information hed retrieved and had understood its significance that the transform was there in the second ship and theyd already met defeat at the hands of the voehn half the fucking galaxy seemed to have been buzzing round zateki searching for a ship that wasnt there if it even ever had been and meanwhile hed known nothing you could just have asked me to look for it for you fassin told her id have started the search for the transform in nasq centuries ago if you guys had just fucking asked she looked at him for a long time an expression on her face of he wasnt sure sadness pity regret despair what he sent the truth she asked him the truth fassin she shook her head we didnt trust you he stared back at her fassin told her what he thought hed discovered what he believed hed worked out she didnt believe him you coming with us can i may i of course if you want he thought okay he sent he thought some more though ive one last person to see first when the visitor arrived setstyin was waterbathing this was a new fashion not unpleasant his servant announced that seer fassin taak was here to see him setstyin felt surprise and elation and a kind of delicious if slightly grim anticipation tell seer taak i am very delighted indeed to welcome him he told his servant ask him to wait in the upper library do all you can to make him comfortable i shall be with him in ten minutes fassin wonderful to see you i really cant tell you we thought well we really feared the worst i swear where have you been fassin didnt seem to know what to say i dont think youd believe me if i told you he said quietly eventually the little gascraft floated in the middle of the library the circular space was lined and floored with crystal stacks light came from a translucent ceiling and a single great door giving out onto a broad railless balcony setstyins house was in the city of aowne midgas in the equatorial zone deep orange and yellow clouds swung slowly past the wide window you think so setstyin said do feel free to try me and please is there anything i can do come lets sit they rested in a pair of dentseats with a low table between them a rather more substantial and grand desk lay just to one side well its a long story i have for you fassin said my favourite kind setstyin exclaimed gathering his long robes about him fassin took a moment as if collecting his thoughts the fellow seemed setstyin thought dulled a little slow compared to how hed appeared before fassin told the suhrl something of his adventures since hed last seen him aboard the planetary protector deniable isaut he also told him a little more of what hed been doing before as well apologising for any hesitations or forgetfulness hed been through a lot recently and some memories were still sort of shuffling their way forward into the light again after being lost he didnt say exactly what it was he had been told to look for and bring back and he wasnt able to tell the dweller very much that happened after the voehn attacked the velpin but he went into as much detail as he felt was possible i dont understand the dweller said youre saying you were you were in other stellar systems you were on the other side of the galaxy i i just dont i could not have been more sceptical myself fassin said i did all the tests i could think of but i certainly seemed to be in the places the truetwin captain claimed i was in they can do wonderful things with fully immersive vr you know setstyin said awkwardly i know but this was either real or something well beyond even fully immersive virtual reality setstyin was silent for a moment you know and please dont take this ill you do look rather ah beaten up fass my boy the dweller was looking at the various dents and scars that the little gascraft had picked up during its last few months of use the malfunctioning left manipulator arm hung awkwardly at the flank of the arrowhead slightly out of true fassin felt almost ashamed of the gascrafts appearance as though hed turned up in a rich gentlemans library in dirty rags yes he agreed as i say i wont pretend my memory is all it used to be the gascrafts storage has suffered and my own brain doesnt seem to be as sharp as i remember it being he laughed but i know what i saw what i felt and heard and tasted i stood on rocks watching the swellwaves of a salt ocean breaking and i was really there setstyin i was there the dweller ruffled his sensory mantle and made the tiny upanddown sighmotion well im sure you believe what you believe fassin and i would always tend to believe you rather than not however many other people wouldnt be so forgiving im not sure it would be a good idea to make too big a fuss about this you could be right and i mean to say if this wormhole thing is so secret why were you taken to or apparently taken to the far side of the galaxy or to anywhere anywhere outside ulubis to prove the myth was real some people some dwellers think its time for change they might not know all the details but they want the truth known nobody wants to take responsibility for just telling a nondweller but some bumpkin might be pushed in the right direction and thats me i suppose bumpkin number one deniable bumpkin number one and this travelcaptain who was he again a truetwin yes ive heard they often are i didnt realise they even pretended to travel so far afield what was his their name youll forgive me if i dont betray that confidence of course of course setstyin seemed to think so if there is this ah wormhole thing near nasqueron who does it belong to who controls it and it has to be asked where exactly is it arent they rather large and obvious these wormhole ports they can be made quite small but yes youd think people would have noticed them by now well yes and id guess theyre operated by a club or fraternity or something like the same sort of organisation that takes care of planetary defence hmm that would be fairly obvious i suppose thats why i came to you setstyin fassin said i wondered if youd heard anything about this about a group of dwellers who used these portals me the dweller reacted as though surprised almost shocked well no i mean none of this would be the sort of thing id normally get involved with but this would be quite something would it not i mean to say if it turned out there was this wormhole here all the time wouldnt it there are stories myths about a whole network of them this dweller list setstyin paused then stared is that what you were looking for all the time not the list the transform that was supposed to hold the key to the list fassin said and did you find it fassin was silent for a moment setstyin watched the little gascraft make a show of looking around the library is this place quite private i mean secure fassin asked i should hope so setstyin said why can we signal rather than speak setstyin fassin asked its not as easy for me as speaking these days so bear with me but it is more secure of course the dweller sent well i think i might have found the transform the human sent carefully really really you will understand if i am a little sceptical only natural where did you find this transform on the body of that dead dweller in the ythyn sepulcraft on the far side of the galaxy ahhah what ever was it doing there it was in a sort of safekeep box and who would put it there i dont know and what did this transform consist of an equation as in mathematics thats right it looked a bit like what some people had come to expect it to look like a code and a frequency for a broadcast signal of some sort but in the end it was just an equation and this was supposed to unlock the list thing thats what we were all told hmm but but when i solved the equation guess what oh ah i have no idea do tell it came out at nothing zero the transform turned out to be in effect a contrived mathematical joke fassin signalled a laugh setstyin shared the amusement i see so if this is what you were sent to look for you might be said to have succeeded in your mission though not in the manner you might have wished yes those were pretty much my thoughts too well at least you missed all the unpleasantness of this invasion your people have suffered thinking of you ive been watching the situation it all looks quite distressing and still going on and affecting us too there were explosions around nasqueron just yesterday did you see any of them i did i hear theres a rumour that the invaders might be about to pull out possibly our planetary defence people again there have been the usual denials of course umm im afraid even if i did know more i couldnt talk about it you understand of course so fassin sent you dont know anything about these wormholes youve never heard of them i just thought you being so well connected all news to me fassin possibly some small group might have control of such things though i find that hard to believe frankly ah well fassin sent he was silent for a few moments yes setstyin sent well fassin replied slowly i did have an idea an idea indeed what if the transform answer wasnt a joke not a joke but its zero what use is that you see fassin sent and the little gascraft nudged forward a fraction on the dentseat closer still to setstyin i had thought what use would an equation be after all this time how could it tell you anything useful a frequency and a code to be broadcast on it was the only thing that really made sense then these worm holes could be hidden anywhere in the named systems and only activate themselves when needed so the fact it was an equation at all made it kind of pointless even before it was worked out ill take your word for it setstyin told the human you are rather losing me here but it all sounds terribly convincing and then there was all that absurd twisting and spiralling when i was aboard the ship heading through the wormhole portals being cut off from external senses seemed obvious enough but why the spiralling umm yes in the ship i see and just the fact that all of dweller society does seem like a proper civilisation now you really are losing me fass and you obviously possess technologies that we still havent understood well were like that us dwellers arent we oh dear i think all this is upsetting my balance you see if the transform means what it says what its saying is that the adjustment you have to make to each entry on the dweller list to find out where the wormhole portals are in relation to those original locations named is fassin held the little gascrafts working arm out inviting setstyin to answer the dweller ruffled his sensory mantle which had gone a slightly odd colour im sorry fassin i feel positively dizzy nothing fassin sent the adjustment is zero is it is it really im sure this is fascinating really and what was the original list based on what did it give again he gave the dweller a chance to answer but he didnt it gave the location of dwellerinhabited gasgiants fassin put a sort of triumphalist joy into the signalled sentence i see i do feel slightly off fass do you mind if i setstyin rose wobbling slightly and roted over to his desk he started opening lockers and drawers then glanced up keep going keep going he said i have my medication in here somewhere the dweller signalled to his servant while he looked through the drawers keeping his signal pit below the level of the desk out of sight of the human in his gascraft was mr taak armed in any way after a moment no sir the house checked automatically naturally aside from his manipulative devices he is unarmed i see thats all the arrowhead swivelled to keep lineofsight with the dweller the list doesnt need the transform fassin told setstyin all you need to know is that the planets are the location really indeed and how can that be the little gascraft rose up into the air above the dentseat because your wormhole portals are inside your planets setstyin fassin sent calmly the dweller froze then opened one last drawer but thats ridiculous he said aloud right in the centre fassin continued also speaking out loud now probably of every single gasgiant you guys inhabit there were only what two million when the list was drawn up that right but that was long ago and it was a historical document even then i wouldnt be at all surprised to hear youd connected up every last dweller planet by now im sorry fassin setstyin said you wouldnt convince a child with this everybody knows you need a flat region of space to make a wormhole portal work ah thats the beauty of it the very centre of a planet is flat fassin said right in the very centre of a planet of any freefloating body sun rock gasgiant anything youre being pulled equally in all directions its just like being in orbit round a world and feeling weightless the only problem of course is keeping a volume of space open in the core of a planet or a sun or whatever in the first place the pressure is colossal almost beyond belief especially in a gasgiant the size of nasq but in the end its just engineering hey you guys have had ten billion years to get good at that sort of stuff anything that isnt impossible you learned to do easily when the galaxy was a quarter of the age it is now so you dont need to position portals in space where anybody could see them or use them or attack them you dont even need to leave your own planet to access them you just head for some wellhidden shaft that leads you down to the very centre of the world maybe at the poles that would be an obvious kind of place and if youve got somebody aboard your ship who might be keeping track of where youre going somehow you just throw in all these crazy spirals and flash some screenage of space into wherever youre keeping them so they never can tell theyve gone down not up and have sunk into the core not flown out into space ah here we are setstyin said and pulled out a large handgun suddenly perfectly steady he aimed and fired before the little gascraft could react the beams tore the arrowhead apart slamming through it and sending it whirling back against a stack of library crystals and then somersaulting over and over as setstyin kept firing the gun spreading fire and scattering wreckage all over the library floor wildly spinning pieces of debris were sent shrapnelling across the glittering stacks cracking spines and smashing crystal pages to powder what was left of the little craft crashed into the windows by the balcony shattering the diamond as though it was sugar glass setstyin stopped firing debris pattered down smoke drifted gradually sucked towards the shattered window the big dweller roted carefully over to the broken window keeping the gun trained on the smoking remains of the little craft as he approached sir his servant called over the house intercom sir are you all right i thought i heard fine setstyin called not shifting his attention from the wreckage as he drew closer im fine be some cleaning up to do in due course but im fine leave me now sir a warm breeze ruffled his robes as setstyin floated out of the window and drew up almost on top of the guttering wreck he prodded the ruined gascraft with the muzzle of the gun he prised part of the crafts upper shell away he peered inside fucker he screamed and whirled back into the library tearing through the gas to the desk desk seccomms now aun liss watched the man as his little craft his second skin was destroyed fassin winced just the once twitching as though pained aun thought he did not look well his body was thin inside the borrowed fatigues and he was trembling slightly but continually his face looked much older than it had pinched and drawn eyes sunken and surrounded with darkness his hair looking crinkled and thin had grown a little while hed been inside the gascraft his eyes and the edges of his ears and nostrils plus the corners of his mouth were red from the effects of coming out of the shockgel and having the gillfluid come out of him after all this time he turned to look at her she was glad to see there was a twinkle in his eye despite it all so still think im crazy he asked she smiled pretty much they sat in the bright if cramped command space of the ecophobian a beyonder shockcraft a mediumweight warship half a light second out from nasqueron linked to the nowdefunct gascraft via a twin of the eyeballsized microsat which had been exactly where it was supposed to be a day earlier when fassin had pinged it from the high platform in quaibrai they were amazingly still receiving basic telemetry from the shattered gascraft though no sensory content the machine had been very thoroughly blasted on a sidescreen they had a freeze of the last visual that the little gascraft had sent setstyin levelling a sizeable handgun straight at the camera a tiny sparkle of light just starting in the very centre of the weapons dark barrel fassin nodded at the image i hasten to add that that does not constitute standard dweller hospitality id guessed sure it wasnt because you just wouldnt shut up im serious youre serious what do you call the guy with the big fuckoff gun aun fassin said sounding tired now do you believe me she hesitated shrugged im with your belligerent friend i believe you believe the gascraft telemetry cut off the chief remotes officer leaned in manipulating holos above one of the displays that wasnt the gascraft totalling she told them that was the microsat getting fried fast work suggest hightail promptly hold on to your hats the captain said sit well back they were thrown pressed then rammed back into their seats as the ship accelerated the command officers shifting to control by induction rather than physical manipulation the whole gimballed command sphere swung to keep the geeforces pressing on their chests were you serious mr taak the captain asked her voice strained against the clamping power of the acceleration yuh was the best fassin could manage so theres a secret network of ancient dweller wormholes linking what every dweller gasgiant fassin took the deepest breath he could and forced out thats the idea another breath you send all we got from the gascraft to your high command the captain managed to laugh such as they are yes shit said the defence officer his voice strained lock on they heard him breathing hard its fast cant outrun in fourteen fire everything the captain said crisply ready detach command well risk adrifting hope the impavids local need to yaw before the detach or well be hit by the debris spray the tactics officer said copy the captain said shame always liked this ship the ship wheeled wildly fassin blacked out and never felt the explosive detach the joltship impavid picked the command sphere up three days later taince saluus kehar said he grinned hey so so good to see you again he came up to her and put his arms round her taince yarabokin had succeeded in producing a smile shed chosen an oldfashioned formal cap as part of her uniform and so had the unspoken excuse that she needed to keep this clamped between her elbow and her side for not being able to hug him back with any great enthusiasm sal didnt seem to notice anyway he pulled away looked at her been a while taince glad you made it back good to be back taince said they were in a hangar in the guard security holding facility axle a triplewheeled habitat orbiting glantine saluus had been held there for the past couple of months while the authorities had decided whether they really believed him about having been kidnapped rather than having run away or even turned traitor hed consented to and undergone dozens of brain scans more than enough to put the matter beyond any doubt in an ordinary case and of course he had connections and friends in high places who would normally have been only too happy to have discreet words in probably quite receptive ears but there had been a feeling that this was an exceptional matter that sal was rich enough to have afforded technologies or techniques that would fool the brain scans that the starvelings themselves might have been able to implant convincing false memories and anyway such a fuss had been made at the time when saluus had seemingly gone over to the invading forces that to let him meekly out just because it looked like he was blameless somehow didnt seem right when saluus had disappeared apparently turning traitor there had been strikes and attacks on kehar family and commercial property and hed been denounced by every part of the ulubine mercatoria in terms that owed as much to finally having something understandable to hit out at as to any moral indignation people who had called sal a friend and been regular guests at many of his family homes had decided that they owed it to the popular mood and their intense personal sense of betrayal not to mention their future social standing and careers to compete in outvituperating each other in their condemnation of his odious perfidy the calumnies heaped upon sals absent head had amounted to a thesaurus of despite an entire dictionary of bile in the end he was kept incarcerated as much for his own safety as for anything else when the starveling forces left and the summed fleet arrived the general feeling of relief and euphoria pervading the ulubis system meant that news of sals shocking innocence traded rather better on the floor of the publics perception and it could be announced that he was to be released in due course most people chose to recant their earlier expressions of hatred and condemnation though it was still felt best for all concerned if sals return to public life and rehabilitation was gradual rather than abrupt taince had volunteered pulled rank indeed to pilot sal from the holding facility back to the original kehar family home on glantine a guardmajor got taince to sign sal out of custody sal watched her signature on the pad thats my freedom youre writing there vice admiral he told her he was wearing his own clothes looking slim and casual and bright glad to be of service she told him then looked at the guards officer is that us guardmajor yes maam he turned to saluus you are free to go mr kehar saluus reached out and shook the guardmajors hand med thanks for everything been a pleasure sir no clothes or anything taince asked looking at his empty hands sal shook his head came with nothing taking nothing away no baggage he flashed a smile she tipped her head pretty good at our age they walked to the small cutter squatting on the shallow curve of hangar floor i really appreciate this taince he told her i mean i really do you didnt have to do this she smiled his gaze flicked over her insignia it is okay to call you taince isnt it i mean ill call you vice admiral if you like taince is fine sal after you she showed him up into the little cutters tandem cockpit settling him into the seat in front of and below hers she fitted herself into the pilots seat clipping on a light flight collar and waking the small crafts systems the facilitys flight control cleared them to leave so youre what system liaison chief sal asked over his shoulder as they were trundled under a door into a sizeable airlock yes well its pretty much all ceremonial she told him the door behind them closed the lights in the lock dimmed receptions dinners tours addresses you know the sort of thing sounds like youre just loving every minute i suppose somebody has to do it serves me right for being ulubine pumps thrummed a rush of air and a deep hum at first then after a while just the hum sounding through the fabric of the cutter no real fighting to do anyway just cleanup stuff im not missing much any news on fassin sal asked last i heard they thought he might be alive again if you know what i mean the outer door opened silently to the stars and a great silveryfawn slice of glantine just give me a minute or two here will you taince asked been a little while since i did this hey take as long as you need the cutter edged its way out of the lock stowed its gear rolled very slowly and drifted away on little whisper bursts of gas heading towards the atmosphere yes fassin taince said well theyre still looking for him i heard hed been lost in nasqueron and then reappeared there have been rumours there were always rumours if you believed them hes been all over nasqueron for the last halfyear never left or been in the oort cloud for the last few months and just returned or even wilder stuff plus hes been declared definitely dead at least three times whatever the truth is hes still not here to tell it himself taince rotated the cutter lining it up for entry you think he is dead sal asked lets just say its odd that he hasnt made himself known by now if he is still around they met the atmosphere a little later pressed against the seat restraints a pink glow building then fading around the canopy the small ship whistling in across a sequence of thin clouds deserts and shallow seas hills scarps lakes and low mountains taking the scenic route taince she gave a small laugh suppose im just a sentimentalist at heart sal good to see the old place again sal said she watched him lean to one side looking down is that pirri down there she looked checked the nav yes thats pirrintipiti looks like it always did thought it might have grown a bit more while since youve been home sal oh too long too long kept meaning to but you know must be ten or twelve years maybe more feels more they were high over the edges of the thin polarplateau ice cap crossing into darkness falling all the time they could see stars again she saw him looking up and around you forget how beautiful it is eh sal asked sometimes taince said easy enough thing to do the glow in the sky faded around them she watched the canopy up the brightness exaggerating the incoming light until they could see the starlight on the north waste land the great long streaks of coloured sands and outcrop rocks silvery ghosts coming closer all the time ah right sal said quietly she tapped a few display icons dimming the screens thought wed take a pass she said hope you dont mind old times sake he sounded thoughtful even resigned well why not taince checked the nav again lined the craft up and cut its speed a little a light was blinking urgently on one of the displays she turned that one off too i certainly havent been back here since that night sal said she thought he sounded sad now perhaps regretful perhaps not the ruined ship showed up ahead a little off to the right taince started the cutter on a long starboard curve levelling out as she did so sal looked sidedown at the desert rushing past seventymetres below as they banked wow he said quicker than that flier i borrowed from dad one of your own ships sal she told him this little thing he laughed didnt realise we made anything this small its old ah one of dads more money in the big stuff they zapped past the great dark hulk its exposed ribs clawed at the sky woohoo sal shouted as the black wall of hull slid past twenty metres away taince zoomed looped and rolled levelling out again approaching the wrecked alien ship once more for an even nearer approach whohohhoh sal said seeing how low and close taince was taking the cutter this time taince rolled the craft so that they were upside down sheeit wow taince yeeha right to the end she hadnt known if shed actually do it or not she didnt really know the truth of what had happened after all she only had her suspicions she could despite everything just be plain wrong it wouldnt be the first time somebody had taken the law into their own hands and been proved to be hopelessly wrong once all the facts were known fuck that was what justice was supposed to be all about that was why you had laws and everything that went with them that was one of the things that made a society a society but still she did know she was quite sure it was his time and if she was wrong well sal had had his share it wasnt like killing a child or a young woman with her life before her it was still killing still wrong but there were gradations in all things even circles in hell and frankly right or wrong at least shed never know it was her time she knew that shed really thought there would be tears but they stayed away how strange not to know oneself after so long at such an extremity and so close to the end what else well shed thought of telling him of confronting him of bringing it all back up again of listening to him rage at or plead with or scream at her that had been something shed rehearsed a lot that had been something shed thought through time after time after time as shed played and replayed this scene in her head over the years and decades and centuries taking both her part and his trying to imagine what hed say how hed try to explain it how hed imply she was mad or mistaken ultimately taince had just got bored with it shed heard it all before there was nothing more to say she was taking a mans life on circumstantial evidence on a hunch she ought to give him the chance to appeal she ought at least to allow him to know it was about to happen but then why the cold sheen of desert and the vast impenetrability of the dark ruined ship rushed up to meet them shit tain sal might have tried to use the eject it was one system she couldnt disable from her controls but then that was why shed flown the last bit upside down in the end all it took was a single quick flick of the wrists the cutter slammed into the side of the ship just ten metres off the desert floor at about half the speed of sound epilogue there is along the higher latitudes of the northern tropical uplands of the planetmoon glantine in the system of ulubis a bird which thanks to its call people call a heyfellahey the bird is a migrant a passer that is a bird that does not dwell in the given region but only ever passes through the heyfellahey passes through these latitudes in the early spring heading north it was a cool day midmorning nasqueron half full cast a ruddybrown light over the soft shadows of the day once one might have seen sky mirrors away to one side or the other bringing sunlight to us even when nasqueron filled most of the sky above however many of these devices were destroyed in the war and so our little planetmoon is a literally gloomier place now than it once was returned until new mirrors are emplaced to its primitive state i was working in the old formal pasture wading deep in an exasperation of chuvle weed choking a by now almost hidden pond and trying to work out what to do with the weed and the feature for both are pretty in their own ways when i heard the distinctive call of said bird i stopped and listened heyfellaheyfellaheyfellahey the bird sang i turned slowly looking for it in the higher branches of the nearby trees while i was looking i never did locate the bird i saw a figure walking along the high path towards the stream and the perimeter wall which gives out onto the slope holding a little further up the ruins of the old rehlide temple i looked carefully zooming in and trying to filter out the effects of the intervening bushes and shrubs because the figure walked very like seer taak who had been a long time gone from us us always the same hurtful mistake there was no us any more just a few sad remnants left behind at a house abandoned the figure disappeared behind a clump of thicker shrubbery though they would reappear shortly if they continued to follow the path i thought in retrospect perhaps the person walking on the path had been somewhat older than the gentleman i had been pleased to think of as the young master he was slightly stooped which seer taak never had been and he was perhaps too thin plus he walked like somebody who had been injured in some way so it seemed to me at any rate i would not claim to be an expert in such matters i am but a humble gardener after all well a head gardener but all the same still humble i hope the figure did indeed reappear though not exactly where i had been expecting whoever it was had taken a side path and was now walking almost straight towards me they raised a hand i raised a trowel waved back it was seer taak or by all reason it was somebody doing their damnedest to look like a rather more aged version of him i clambered out of the pond shook some chuvle weed from a couple of legs and lumbered up the path bank to meet him young master i said dropping trowel rake and spade and brushing soil and weedstems from my arms the man smiled broadly hg it is you he was dressed in long loose casual clothes nothing like those of a seer it is you seer taak we thought the worst oh for you at least to be alive i confess i folded going down on all eights staring at the gravel of the path overcome he squatted in front of me we never see whats in front of us do we hg sir hg tell me youre not an ai i looked up at him emotion was that it i should have known that would give me away one day he smiled your secrets safe well perhaps for now patience hg you imply that things may change or that i should just wait for death we do not die easily we have not been allowed to he smiled a slow painful smile change hg you think oh yes all sorts of things are happening i have heard something they say there is a wormhole mouth in nasqueron i looked up at the great planet which seemed to hang over us its vast circlet rivers of gas cream and brown yellow white purple and red forever sliding in contrary directions fassin taak nodded slowly thoughtfully it turns out we were all connected all the time he picked up a pebble from the path looked at it the dwellers may even let us use their wormhole network if we ask them nicely sometimes there is a furious debate going on in dweller society even as we speak and probably for some time to come dwellers being well dwellers regarding to what extent the undying admiration of every even vaguely sentient species in the rest of the galaxy and possibly beyond could possibly constitute a general increase in the background kudos level for all dwellers and therefore a valid reason for throwing open their galactic transport system to all that would indeed be a great change and not one that the mercatoria would be allowed to control it would still be the mercatoria it can change too it wont have any choice patience hg well we shall see but thank you i looked at him fassin taak did indeed look older his face was more careworn the lines around his eyes deeper has all been well here hg all is well in the garden the house well that is not my province now he looked down i took a look around he said his voice was quiet it was all very quiet very strange and quiet with nobody there i try not to look at it i confessed except sometimes at dawn and during the very early morning when it looks much as it always did bright light upon it but no sign of life that i can bear i saw the image even as i spoke of it i am lucky that i have the garden to tend by looking after it it looks after me yes he said we all need something to do dont we i hesitated still there is not a day goes by when i do not curse my luck to have been stuck here rather than with them somehow when the end came i envy the head gardener of the winter house where they all died together i pulled myself up a fraction but enough and you sir what do you do these days please dont call me sir hg im fassin oh thank you well what are you doing and where if i may ask oh ive gone off with the beyonders hg im already a citizen of the galaxy albeit slowly without using wormholes but a start and the sept fassin there is no sept hg its gone he threw the pebble back along the path maybe theyll start another sept who knows he looked away in the direction of the distant house they might fill this house one day you wont come back he looked around too many people would still want to ask me too many questions probably until i died he looked at me no i just came back here for one last look around and to look you up really me really really i cannot tell you how gratified no honoured that makes me feel he smiled at me and started to rise to his feet this humility is a great cover hg i hope you can set it aside when the time comes i meant what i said fassin and i mean this hg he said as he brushed down his clothes nasqueron forever behind him one day well all be free the end
