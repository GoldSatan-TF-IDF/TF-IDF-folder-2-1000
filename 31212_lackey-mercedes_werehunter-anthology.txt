werehunter mercedes lackey two out of three aint bad something very large occluded the light for a moment in the next room then the lights went out and diana tregarde distinctly heard the sound of the chandelier being torn from the ceiling and thrown against the wall she winced there go my romance writers of the world dues up again she thought i got a glimpse andre said it was very large perhaps ten feet tall andcherie looked like nothing so much as a rubber creature from a very bad movie except that i do not think it was rubber what shambled in through the door was nothing that diana had ever heard of it was indeed about ten feet tall it was covered with luxuriant brown hairall over it was built along the lines of a powerful bodybuilder taken to exaggerated lengths and it drooled it also stank a combination of sulfur and musk so strong it would have brought tears to the eyes of a skunk di groaned putting two and two together and coming up withvalentine vervain cast a spell for a tall dark and handsome soulmate but she forgot to specify human are you thinking what im thinking the other writer nodded tall check dark check long hair check handsomewell i suppose in some circles harrison stared at the thing in fascination the thing saw valentine and lunged for her reflexively di and harrison both shot he emptied his cylinder and one speed loader di gave up after four shots no effect the thing backhanded andre into a wall hard enough to put him through plasterboard andre was out for the count there are some things even a vampire has a little trouble recovering from harrison distract it make a noise anything diana pulled the atheme from her boot sheath and began cutting sigils in the air with it getting the words of dismissal out as fast as she could without slurring the syllables the thing lunged toward harrison missing him by inches just as di concluded the ritual of dismissal to no effect from satanic versus introduction those of you who are more interested in the stories than in some chatty author stuff should just skip this part since it will be mostly about the things people used to ask us about at science fiction conventions for those of you who have never heard of sf conventions or cons as they are usually called these are gatherings of people who are quite fanatical about their interest in one or more of the various fantasy and science fiction media there are talks and panel discussions on such wildly disparate topics as costuming propmaking themes in sff literature star wars star trek babylon xfiles sff art medieval fighting horsetraining dancing and the world of fans in general there are workshops on writing and performance arts guests featured in panels and question and answer sessions are often featured performers from television and movies along with various authors and the occasional professional propmaker larry and i no longer attend conventions for a number of reasons not the least of which is that we have a great many responsibilities that require us to be home some of those responsibilities are that we are volunteers for our local fire department larry is a driver and outside man i am learning to do dispatch and hopefully will be able to take over the night shift since we are awake long after most of the rest of the county has gone to sleep our local department is strictly volunteer and works on a very tight budget our equipment is old and needs frequent repair we get what we can afford and what we can afford is generally third or fourthhand having passed through a large metropolitan department or the military to a small municipal department to the forestry service and finally to us in summer i am a watercarrier at grassfires meaning that i bring drinkingwater to the overheated firefighters so they dont collapse in the plus degree heat another duty is with the eoc formerly called the civil defense office when we are under severe weather conditions the firefighters are called in to wait at the station in case of emergency so larry is there i go in to the eoc office to read weatherradar for the stormwatchers in the field eventually i hope to get my radio license so i can also join the ranks of the stormwatchers we dont chase as such although there are so few of the stormwatchers that they may move to active areas rather than staying put doppler radar can only give an indication of where there is rotation in the clouds rotation may not produce a tornado you have to have people on the ground in the area to know if there is a funnel or a tornado technically it isnt a tornado until it touches the ground until then it is a funnelcloud our area of oklahoma is not quite as active as the area of the panhandle or around oklahoma city and norman which is why the national severe storms laboratory is located there but we get plenty of severe tornadoproducing storms in addition we have our raptor rehabilitation duties larry and i are raptor rehabilitators this means that we are licensed by both the state and the federal government to collect care for and release birds of prey that are injured or ill occasionally we are asked to bring one of our patients for a talk to a group of adults or children often under the auspices of our local game wardens im sure this sounds very exciting and glamorous and it certainly impresses the heck out of people when we bring in a big hawk riding on a gloved hand but there are times when i wonder how we managed to get ourselves into this we have three main seasonsbaby season stupid fledgling season and inexpert hunter season now injuriesand victims of idiots with gunscan come at any time we havent had too many shooting victims in our area thank heavens in part because the cattlefarmers around our area know that shooting a raptor only adds field rats and mice to their property but another rehabber gave up entirely a few years ago completely burned out because she got the same redtail hawk back three times shot out of the sky injuries that we see in our area are most often the case of collisionliterallywith mans environmental changes birds hit windows that seem to them to be sky great blue herons collide with powerlines raptors get electrocuted by those same lines but most often we get birds hit by cars owls will chase prey across the road oblivious to the fact that something is approaching and get hit raptors are creatures of opportunity and will quite readily come down to feed on roadkill and get hit great horned owls often called the tigers of the sky are top predators known to chase even eagles off nests to claim the nest for themselvesif a great horned is eating roadkill and sees a car approaching it will stand its ground certain that it will get the better of anything daring to try to snatch its dinner after all they have been developing and evolving for millions of years and swiftly moving vehicles have only been around for about seventyfive years they havent had nearly enough time to adapt to the situation as a species individuals do learn though often to take advantage of the situation kestrels and redtails are known to hang around fields being harvested to snatch the fieldrats running from the machinery or suddenly exposed after the harvesters have passed redtails are also known to hang about railway rightofways waiting for trains to spook out rabbits our current education bird a big female redtail we call cinnamon is one such victim struck in the head by a cb whipantenna she has only one working eye and just enough brain damage to render her partially paralyzed on one side and make her accepting and calm in our presence this makes her a great educationbird as nothing alarms her and children can safely touch her giving them a new connection with wild things that they had never experienced before but back to the three seasons of a raptor rehabber and the different kinds of work they involve first is baby season which actually extends from late february through to july beginning with great horned owl babies and ending when the second round of american kestrels sparrowhawks or spawks as falconers affectionately call them begins to push their siblings out of nests the first rule of baby season istry to get the baby back into the nest or something like the nest mother birds are infinitely better at taking care of their youngsters than any human so when wind or weather send babies eyases is the correct term tumbling that is our first priority this almost always involves climbing which means that poor larry puts on his climbing gear and dangles from trees when nest and all have come down we supply a substitute in as close to the same place as possible raptor mothers are far more fixated on the kids than the house and a box filled with branches will do nicely thank you sometimes though its not possible to put the eyases back youngsters are found with no nest in sight or the nest is literally unreachable a barn owl roost in the roof of an institution for the criminally insane for instance or worst of all the parents are known to be dead young raptors eat a lot kestrels need feeding every hour or so bigger birds every two to three and thats from dawn to dusk weve taken eyases with us to doctors appointments on vacation on shopping expeditions and even to racing school and were not talking gerbers here mom us gets to take the mousie dissect the mousie and feed the mousie parts to baby by hand yummy barred owl eyases are the easiest of the lot theyll take minnows which are of a size to slip down their little throats easily but not the rest theres no use thinking you can get by with a little chicken eithergrowing babies need a lot of calcium for those wonderful hollow bones that theyre growing so fast so they need the whole animal fortunately babies do grow up and eventually theyll feed themselves then its just a matter of helping them learn to fly which involves a little game we call hawk tossing and teaching them to hunt the instincts are there they just need to connect instinct with practice but this is not for the squeamish or the tenderhearted for the youngsters to grow up and have the skills to make them successful they have to learn to kill the second season can stretch from late april to august and we call it silly fledgling season thats when the eyases having learned to fly at last get lost raptor motherswith the exception of barn owlscontinue to feed the youngsters and teach them to hunt after theyve fledged but sometimes wind and weather again carry the kids off beyond finding their way back to mom being inexperienced flyers and not hunters at all yet they usually end up helpless on the ground which is where we come in these guys are actually the easiest and most rewarding they know the basics of flying and hunting and all we have to do is put some meat back on their bones and give them a bit more experience we usually have anywhere from six to two dozen kestrels at this stage every year which is when we get a fair amount of exercise catching grasshoppers for them to hunt then comes the inexpert hunter season and im not referring to the ones with guns some raptors are the victims of a bad winter or the fact that they concentrated on those easytokill grasshoppers while their siblings had graduated to more difficult prey along about december we start to get the ones that nothing much is wrong with except starvation sometimes starvation has gone too far for them to make it frustrating and disappointing for us weve gotten all sorts of birds over the years our wonderful vet dr paul welch on whom may blessings be heaped treats wildlife for free and knows that were always suckers for a challenge so he has gotten some of the odder things to us weve had two great blue herons for instance one was an adult that had collided with a powerline it had a dreadful fracture and we werent certain if it would be able to fly again it did but since we have a pond we figured we could support a landbound heron in our ignorance we had no idea that great blues are terrible challenges to keep alive because they are so shy we just waded right in forcefeeding it minnows when it refused to eat and stuffing the minnows right back down when it tossed them up this may not sound so difficult but remember that a great blue has a twofoot sword on the end of its head a springloaded neck to put some force behind the stab and the beakeye coordination to impale a minnow in a foot of water it has no trouble targeting your eye we fed it wearing weldingmasks we believe very strongly in forcefeeding our experience has been that if you forcefeed a bird for two to three days it gives up trying to die of starvation and begins eating on its own once again mind you this is not always an easy proposition were usually dealing with fully adult birds who want nothing whatsoever to do with us and have the equipment to enforce their preferences we very seldom get a bird that is so injured that it gives us no resistance great horned owls can exert pressure of ftlbs per talon which can easily penetrate a kevlarlined welding glove as i know personally and painfully that is yet another aspect of rehabbing that most people dont think aboutinjury yours not the birds weve been footed stabbed with talons bitten pooped on okay so thats not an injury but its not pleasant gouged and beakslashed and we have to stand there and continue doing whatever it was that earned us those injuries because it certainly isnt the birds fault that he doesnt recognize the fact that youre trying to help him we also have to know when were out of our depth or when the injury is so bad that the bird isnt releasable and do the kind and responsible thing unless a bird is so endangered that it can go into a captive breeding project or is the rare calm quiet case like cinnamon who will be a perfect education bird there is no point in keeping one that cant fly or hunt again you learn how to let go and move on very quickly and just put your energy into the next one on the other hand we have personal experience that raptors are a great deal tougher than it might appear weve successfully released oneeyed hawks who learn to compensate for their lack of binocular vision very well birds with one bad leg learn to strike only with the good one oneeyed owls are routine for us now owls mostly hunt by sound anyway and dont actually need both eyes but the most amazing is that another rehabber in our area has routinely gotten successful releases with owls that are minus a wingtip evidently owls are such strong fliers that they dont need their entire wingspan to prosper and that is quite amazing and heartening weve learned other things too one of the oddest is that owls byandlarge dont show gradual recovery from headinjuries they will go on day after day with nothing changingthen suddenly one morning you have an owl fighting to get out of the box youve put him in to keep him quiet and contained weve learned that once birds learn to hunt they prefer freshcaught dinner to the frozen stuff we offer we havent had a single freeloader keep coming back long after he should be independent weve learned that our birds learn quickly not to generalize about humans feeding themonce they are freeflying but still supplementing their hunting with handouts they dont bother begging for food from anyone but those who give them the proper comenget it signal and even then they are unlikely to get close to anyone they dont actually recognize we already knew that eyases in the downy stage when their juvenile plumage hasnt come in and they look like little white puffballs will imprint very easily so we quickly turn potentially dangerous babies like great horned owls over to rehabbers who have foster momsnonreleasable birds of the right species who will at least provide the right rolemodel for the youngsters tempting as the little things are so fuzzy and bigeyed none of us wants an imprinted great horned coming back in four or five years when sexual maturity hits looking for love in all the wrong places remember those talons for us though all the work is worth the moment of release when we take the bird that couldnt fly or the nowgrownup and selfsufficient baby and turn him loose for some we just open the cage door and step back for others theres a slow process called hacking out where the adolescent comes back for food until hes hunting completely on his own in either case weve performed a little surgery on the fragile ecosystem and its a good feeling to see the patient thriving those who have caught the raptorbug seem like family we associate with both rehabber and falconers if you are interested in falconryand bear in mind it is an extremely laborintensive hobbycontact your local fish and wildlife department for a list of local falconers and see if you can find one willing to take you as an apprentice if you want to get into rehab contact fish and wildlife for other rehabbers who are generally quite happy to help you get started here are some basic facts about birds of prey faloners call the young in the nest an eyas rehabbers and falconers call the very small ones covered only in fluff downies in the downy stage they are very susceptible to imprinting if we have to see babies we would rather they were at least in the second stage when the bodyfeathers start to come in that is the only time that the feathers are not molted the down feathers are actually attached to the juvenile feathers and have to be picked off either by the parent or the youngster bodyfeathers come in first and when they are about halfgrown the adults can stop brooding the babies for they can retain their bodyheat on their own and more importantly the juvenile feathers have a limited ability to shed water which the down will not do if a rainstorm starts for instance the downies will be wet through quickly before a parent can return to the nest to cover them theyll be hypothermic in seconds and might die babies in juvenile plumage are safe until a parent gets back to cover them when eyases never fight in the nest over food this means both that their environmeent provides a wealth of prey and that their parents are excellent hunters if they are hungry the youngest of the eyases often dies or is pushed out of the nest to die redtails can have up to four offspring two is usual although it is rare they have been known to doubleclutch if a summer is exceptionally long and warm they may also doubleclutch if the first batch is infertile redtails in captivity can live up to twentyfive years half that is usual in the wild they can breed at four years old though they have been known to breed as young as two in their first year they do not have red tails and their bodyplumage is more mottled than in older birds this is called juvenile plumage and is a signal to older birds that these youngsters are no threat to them kestrels do not have juvenile plumage nor do most owls and eagles hold their juvenile plumage for four years kestrels live about five years in the wild up to fifteen in captivity eagles live fifty years in captivity and up to twentyfive in the wild should you find an injured bird of prey you need three things for a rescue a heavy blanket or jacket cohesive bandage the kind of athletic wrap that sticks to itself and a heavy darkcolored sock throw the blanket over the victim locate and free the head and pull the sock over it locate the feet and wrap the feet together with the bandage keep hold of the feet remove the blanket get the wings folded in the resting position and wrap the body in cohesive bandage to hold the wings in place make a ring of a towel in the bottom of a cardboard box just big enough to hold the bird and put the bird in the box as if it was sitting in a nest take the sock off and quickly close up the box and get the victim to a rehabber a local game warden or fish and wildlife official or a vet that treats injured wildlife diurnal raptors are very dependent on their sight take it away and they shut downwhich is the reason behind the traditional falconhood by putting the sock over the head you take away the chief source of stress the sight of enormous twolegged predators bearing down on it andre norton who as by now you must be aware i have admired for ages was doing a friends of the witch world anthology and asked me if i would mind doing a story for her would i mind i flashed back to when i was thirteen or fourteen years old and i read witch world and fell completely and totally into this wonderful new cosmos i had already been a fan of andres since i was nine or ten and my father who was a science fiction reader loaned me beast master because it had a horse in it and i was horsemad but this was something different science fiction that didnt involve thud and blunder and ironthewed barbarians i was in love ohback in the old days it was all called science fiction there was no category for fantasy and as for hard sf sword and sorcery urban fantasy high fantasy cyberpunk horror spaceoperanone of those categories existed youd find clark ashton smith right next to e e doc smith and andre norton and fritz leiber wrote gothic horror high fantasy and science fiction all without anyone wondering what to call it readers of imaginative literature read everything and neither readers nor writers were compelled by marketing considerations to read or write in only a single category at any rate many years later my idol andre norton asked me for a story set in one of my favorite sciencefiction worlds somehow i managed to tell andre that i would be very happy to write a story this is it in fact this is the longer version she asked me to cut some not because she didnt like it the way it was but because she was only allowed stories of words or less here it is as i originally wrote it werehunter it had been raining all day a cold dismal rain that penetrated through clothing and chilled the heart to numbness glenda trudged through it sneakers soaked beneath her cheap plastic raincoat her jeans were soggy to the knees it was several hours past sunset now and still raining and the city streets were deserted by all but the most hardy the most desperate and the faded few with nothing to lose glenda was numbered among those last this morning shed spent her last change getting a bus to the welfare office only to be told that she hadnt been a resident long enough to qualify for aid that wasnt truebut she couldnt have known that the supercilious clerk had taken in her age and inexperience at a glance and assumed student if he had begun processing her hed have been late for lunch he guessed she wouldnt know enough to contradict him and hed been right and years of her aunts browbeating isnt one no good enough for you had drummed into her the lesson that there were no second chances hed gone off to his lunch date shed trudged back home in the rain this afternoon shed eaten the last packet of cheese and crackers and had made soup from the stolen packages of fastfood ketchupthere was nothing left in her larder that even resembled food hunger had been with her for so long now that the ache in her stomach had become as much a part of her as her hands or feet there were three days left in the month three days of shelter then shed be kicked out of her shoddy efficiency and into the street when her social security orphans benefits had run out when shed turned eighteen her aunt had suggested she find a job and support herselfelsewhere the suggestion had come in the form of finding her belongings in boxes on the front porch with a letter to that effect on top of them so shed tried moving across town to this place near the university a marginal neighborhood surrounded by bad blocks on three sides but there were no jobs if you had no experiencebut how did you get experience without a job the only experience shed ever had was at shoveling snow raking leaves mowing and gardening the only ways she could earn money for college since her aunt had never let her apply for a job that would have been beyond walking distance of her house besides that there were at least forty university students competing with her for every job that opened up anywhere around here her meager savings meant at one time to pay for college tuition were soon gone she rubbed the ring on her left hand a gesture she was completely unaware of that ring was all she had of the mother her aunt would never discussthe woman her brother had married over her own strong disapproval it was silver and heavy made in the shape of a crouching cat with tiny glints of topaz for eyes much as she treasured it she would gladly have sold itbut she couldnt get it off her finger shed worn it for so long she splashed through the puddles peering listlessly out from under the hood of her raincoat her lank mousebrown hair straggled into her eyes as she squinted against the glare of headlights on rainglazed pavement despair had driven her into the street despair kept her here it was easier to keep the tears and hysterics at bay out here where the cold numbed mind as well as body and the rain washed all her thoughts until they were thin and lifeless she could see no way out of this trapexcept maybe by killing herself but her body had other ideas it wanted to survive even if glenda wasnt sure she did a chill of fear trickled down her backbone like a drop of icy rain driving all thoughts of suicide from her as behind her she recognized the sounds of footsteps she didnt have to turn around to know she was being followed and by more than one on a night like tonight there was no one on the street but the fools and the hunters she knew which she was it wasnt much of an alleya crack between buildings scarcely wide enough for her to pass they might not know it was thereeven if they did they couldnt know what lay at the end of it she did she dodged inside feeling her way along the narrow defile until one of the two buildings gave way to a sevenfoot privacy fence she came to the apparent deadend building on the right a high board fence on the left building in front she listened stretching her ears for sounds behind her taut with fear nothing they had either passed this place by or hadnt yet reached it quickly before they could find the entrance she ran her hand along the boards of the fence counting them from the deadend four fivewhen she touched the sixth one she gave it a shove sideways getting a handful of splinters for her pains but the board moved pivoting on the one nail that held it and she squeezed through the gap into the yard beyond pulling the board back in place behind her just in time echoing off the stone and brick of the alley were harsh young male voices she leaned against the fence and shook from head to toe clenching her teeth to keep them from chattering as they searched the alley found nothing and finally after hours it seemed went away well youve got yourself in a fine mess she said dully now what you dont dare leave not yetthey might have left someone in the street watching idiot home may not be much but its dry and theres a bed fool fool fool so now you get to spend the rest of the night in the back yard of a spookhouse youd just better hope the spook isnt home she peered through the dark at the shapeless bulk of the tristory townhouse relic of a previous century hoping not to see any signs of life the place had an uncanny reputation even the gangs left it alone people had vanished heresome of them important people with good reasons to want to disappear some who had been uninvited visitors but the police had been over the house and grounds more than once and never found anything no bodies were buried in the back yardthe ground was as hard as cement under the inchdeep layer of soft sand that covered it there was nothing at all in the yard but the sand and the rocks the crazy woman that lived here told the police it was a zen garden but when glenda had first peeked through the boards at the back yard it didnt look like any zen garden she had ever read about the sand wasnt groomed into wavepatterns and the rocks looked more like something out of a ministonehenge than islands or mountainpeaks there were four of those rocksone like a garden bench that stood before three that formed a primitive arch glenda felt her way towards them in the dark trusting to the memory of how the place had looked by daylight to find them she barked her shin painfully on the bench rock and her legs gave out so that she sprawled ungracefully over it tears of pain mingled with the rain and she swore under her breath she sat huddled on the top of it in the dark trying to remember what time it was the last time shed seen a clock dawn couldnt be too far off when dawn came and there were more people in the street she could probably get safely back to her apartment for all the good it would do her her stomach cramped with hunger and despair clamped down on her again she shouldnt have runshe was only delaying the inevitable in two days shed be out on the street and this time with nowhere to hide easy prey for them or those like them so wouldnt you like to escape altogether the soft voice out of the darkness nearly caused glendas heart to stop she jumped and clenched the side of the benchrock as the voice laughed oddly enough the laughter seemed to make her fright wash out of her there was nothing malicious about itit was kindsounding gentle not crazy oh i like to make people think im crazy they leave me alone that way the speaker was a dim shape against the lighter background of the fence who i am the keeper of this houseand this place not the first certainly not the last so there is nothing in this cityin this worldto hold you here anymore howdid you know that glenda tried to see the speaker in the dim light reflected off the clouds to see if it really was the woman that lived in the house but there were no details to be seen just a humanshaped outline her eyes blurred reaction to her narrow escape the cold hunger all three were conspiring to make her lightheaded the only ones who come to me are those who have no will to live here yet who still have the will to live tell me if another world opened before you would you walk into it not knowing what it held this whole conversation was so surreal glenda began to think she was hallucinating the whole thing well if it was a hallucination why not go along with it sure why not it couldnt be any worse than here it might be better then turn and look behind youand choose glenda hesitated then swung her legs over the benchstone the sky was lighter in that directiondawn was breaking before her loomed the stone arch now she knew she was hallucinatingfor framed within the arch was no shadowy glimpse of board fence and rainsoaked sand but a patch of reddening sky and another dawn a dawn that broke over rolling hills covered with waving grass grass stirred by a breeze that carried the scent of flowers not the exhausttainted air of the city glenda stood unaware that she had done so she reached forward with one hand yearningly the place seemed to call to something buried deep in her heartand she wanted to answer hereor there choose now child with an inarticulate cry she stumbled toward the stones and found herself standing alone on a grassy hill after several hours of walking in wet soggy tennis shoes growing more spacey by the minute from hunger she was beginning to think shed made a mistake somewhere back behind her shed lost her raincoat she couldnt remember when shed taken it off there was no sign of people anywherethere were animals even sheep once but nothing like civilization it was frustrating maddening there was food all around her on four feet on wingssurely even some of the plants were ediblebut it was totally inaccessible to a citybred girl whod never gotten food from anywhere but a grocery or restaurant she might just as well be on the moon just as she thought that she topped another rise to find herself looking at a strange weatherbeaten man standing beside a rough poundeddirt road she blinked in dumb amazement he looked like something out of a movie a peasant from a king arthur epic he was stocky blondhaired he wore a shabby brown tunic and patched shapeless trousers tucked into equally patched boots he was also holding a strung bow with an arrow nocked to it and frowninga most unfriendly expression he gabbled something at her she blinked again she knew a little spanish you had to in her neighborhood shed taken german and french in high school this didnt sound like any of those he repeated himself a distinct edge to his voice to emphasize his words he jerked the point of the arrow off back the way she had come it was pretty obvious he was telling her to be on her way no waitplease she stepped toward him her hands outstretched pleadingly the only reaction she got was that he raised the arrow to point at her chest and drew it back looki havent got any weapons im lost im hungry he drew the arrow a bit farther suddenly it was all too much shed spent all her life being pushed and pushedfirst her aunt then at school then out on the streets this was the last time anybody was going to back her into a cornerthis time she was going to fight a whitehot rage like nothing shed ever experienced before in her life took over damn you she was so angry she could hardly think you stupid clod i need help she screamed at him as red flashes interfered with her vision her ears began to buzz and her hands crooked into involuntary claws damn you and everybody that looks like you he backed up a pace his blue eyes wide with surprise at her rage she was so filled with fury that grew past controllingshe couldnt see couldnt think it was like being possessed suddenly she gasped as pain lanced from the top of her head to her toes pain like a bolt of lightning her vision blacked out she fell to her hands and knees on the grass her legs unable to hold her convulsing with surges of pain in her arms and legs her feet her hands felt like shed shoved them in a fireher face felt as if someone were stretching it out of shape and the ring finger of her left handit burned with more agony than both hands and feet put together she shook her head trying to clear it but it spun around in dizzying circles her ears rang hard to hear over the ringing but there was a sound of cloth tearing her sight cleared and returned but distorted she looked up at the man who had dropped his bow and was backing away from her slowly his face white with terror she started to say something to him and it came out a snarl with that the man screeched turned his back on her and ran and she caught sight of her hand it wasnt a hand anymore it was a paw judging by the spotted pelt of the leg a leopards paw scattered around her were the ragged scraps of cloth that had once been her clothing glenda lay in the sun on top of a rock warm and drowsy with fullbellied content idly she washed one paw with her tongue cleaning the last taint of blood from it before shed had a chance to panic or go crazy back there when shed realized what had happened to her a rabbitlike creature had broken cover practically beneath her nose semistarvation and confusion had kept her dazed long enough for leopardinstincts to take over shed caught and killed the thing and had half eaten it before the reality of what shed done and become broke through her shock raw rabbitthing tasted fine to leopardglenda when she realized that she finished it nose to tail now for the first time in weeks she was warm and content and for the first time in years she was something to be afraid of she gazed about her from her vantagepoint on the warm boulder taking in the grassy hills and breathing in the warm hayscented air with a growing contentment becoming a leopard might not be a bad transformation ears keener than a humans picked up the sound of dogs in the distance she became aware that the man shed frightened might have gone back home for help they just might be hunting her time to go she leapt down from her rock setting off at a right angle to the direction the sound of the baying was coming from her sense of smell so heightened now that it might have been a new sense altogether had picked up the coolth of running water off this way dimmed by the green odor of the grass and running water was a good way to break a trail she knew that from reading reveling in the power of the muscles beneath her sleek coat she ran lightly over the slopes moving through the grass that had been such a waisthigh tangle to girlglenda with no impediment whatsoever in almost no time at all it seemed she was pacing the side of the stream that she had scented it was quite wide twenty feet or so and seemed fairly deep in the middle sunlight danced on the surface giving her a hint that the current might be stiffish beneath the surface she waded into it up to her stomach hissing a little at the cold and the feel of the water on her fur she trotted upstream a bit until she found a place where the course had narrowed a little it was still over her head but she found she could swim it with nothing other than discomfort the stream wound between the grassy hills the banks never getting very high but there rarely being any more cover along them than a few scattered bushes something told her that she would be no match for the endurance of the hunting pack if she tried to escape across the grasslands she stayed in the watercourse until she came to a wider valley than anything she had yet encountered there were trees here she waded onward until she found one leaning well over the streambed gathering herself and eying the broad branch that arced at least six feet above the watercourse she leaped for it landing awkwardly and having to scrabble with her claws fully extended to keep her balance she sprawled over it for a moment panting hearing the dogs nearingbelling in triumph as they caught her trail then yelping in confusion when they lost it at the stream time to move again she climbed the tree up into the higher branches finding a wide perch at least fifty or sixty feet off the ground it was high enough that it was unlikely that anyone would spot her dappled hide among the dappled leafshadows wide enough that she could recline balanced at her ease yet it afforded to leopardeyes a good view of the ground and the stream as shed expected the humans with the dogs had figured out her scentbreaking ploy and had split the pack taking half along each side of the stream to try and pick up where shed exited she spotted the man who had stopped her easily and filed his scent away in her memory for the future the others with him were dressed much the same as he and carried nothing more sophisticated than bows they looked angry confused their voices held notes of fear they looked into and under the trees with noticeable apprehension evidently fearing what might dwell under their shade finally they gave up and pulled the hounds off the fruitless quest leaving her smiling catwise invisible above them in her tree purring several weeks later glenda had found a place to lair up a cave amid a tumble of boulders in the heart of the forest at the streamside she had also discovered why the hunters hadnt wanted to pursue her into the forest itself there was athingan evil presence malicious but invisible that lurked in a circle of standing stones that glowed at night with a sickly yellow color fortunately it seemed unable to go beyond the bounds of the stones themselves glenda had been chasing a halfgrown deerbeast that had run straight into the middle of the circle forgetting the danger before it because of the danger pursuing it she had nearly been caught there herself and only the things preoccupation with the first prey had saved her she had hidden in her lair nearly paralyzed with fear for a day and a night until hunger and thirst had driven her out again other than that peril easily avoided the forest seemed safe enough shed found the village the man had come from by following the dirt road shed spent long hours when she wasnt hunting lurking within range of sight and hearing of the place aided by some new sense she wasnt sure that she understoodthe one that had alerted her to the danger of the stone circle as shed blundered inshe was beginning to make some sense of their language she understood at least twothirds of what was being said now and could usually guess the rest these people seemed to be stuck at some kind of feudal levelhad been overrun by some highertech invaders the generation before and were only now recovering from that the hereditary rulers had mostly been killed in that war and the population decimated the memories of that time were still strong the man whod stopped her had been on guardduty and had mistrusted her appearance out of what they called the waste and her strange clothing when shed transformed in front of his eyes he must have decided she was some kind of witch glenda had soon hunted the more easilycaught game out now when hunger drove her she supplemented her diet with raids on the villagers livestock she was getting better at hunting but she still was far from being an expert and letting leopardinstincts take over involved surrendering herself to those instincts she was beginning to have the uneasy feeling that every time she did that she lost a little more of her humanity life as leopardglenda was much easier than as girlglenda but it might be getting to be time to think about trying to regain her former shapebefore she was lost to the leopard entirely shed never been one for horror or fantasy stories so her only guide was vague recollections of fairytales and latenight werewolf movies she didnt think the latter would be much help hereafter all shed transformed into a leopard not a wolf and by the light of day not the full moon butmaybe the light of the full moon would help she waited until full dark before setting off for her goal a still pond in the far edge of the forest well away from the stone circle in a clearing that never seemed to become overgrown it held a stone too a single pillar of some kind of blueish rock that pillar had never glowed at night before at least not while glenda had been there but the pond and the clearing seemed to form a little pocket of peace whatever evil might lurk in the rest of the forest she was somehow sure it would find no place there the moon was well up by the time she reached it white flowers had opened to the light of it and a faint crisp scent came from them glenda paced to the poolside and looked down into the dark still water she could see her leopard form reflected clearly and over her right shoulder the full moon well anger had gotten her into this shape maybe anger would get her out she closed her eyes for a moment then began summoning all the force of that emotion she couldwilling herself back into the form shed always worn she stared at her reflection in the water forcing it angrily to be her whatever power was playing games with her was not going to find her clay to be molded at will as nothing happened her frustration mounted soon she was at the boiling point damn everything shewouldnotbeplayedwith the same incoherent fury that had seized her when she first changed washed over her a second timeand the same agonizing pain sent blackness in front of her eyes and flung her to lie twitching helplessly beside the pool her left forepaw felt like it was afire in moments it was over and she found herself sprawling beside the pond shivering with cold and reaction and totally naked naked that is except for the silver catring whose topaz eyes glowed hotly at her for a long moment before the light left them the second time she transformed to leopard was much easier the pain was less the amount of time less she decided against being humanafter finding herself without a stitch on in a perilously vulnerable and helpless form leopardglenda seemed a much more viable alternative but the ability to switch back and forth proved to be very handy the villagers had taken note of her raids on their stock they began mounting a series of systematic hunts for her even penetrating into the forest so long as it was by daylight she learned or remembered from reading countless tricks to throw the hunters off and being able to change from human to leopard and back again made more than one of those possible there were places girlglenda could climb and hide that leopardglenda couldnt and the switch in scents when she changed confused and frightened the dogpack she began feeling an amused sort of contempt for the villagers often leading individual hunters on wildgoose chases for the fun of it when she became bored but on the whole it was better to be leopard leopardglenda was comfortable and content sleeping on rocks or on the dried leaves of her lairgirlglenda shivered and ached and wished for her roachinfested efficiency leopardglenda was perfectly happy on a diet of raw fish flesh and fowlgirlglenda wanted to throw up when she thought about it leopardglenda was content with nothing to do but tease the villagers and sleep in the sun when she wasnt huntinggirlglenda fretted and longed for a book and wondered if what she was doing was right so matters stood until midsummer glenda woke shivering with a mouth gone dry with panic the dream it wasnt just a nightmare this dream had been so real shed expected to wake with an arrow in her ribs she was still panting with fright even now there had been a manhe hadnt looked much like any of the villagers they were mostly blond or brownhaired and of the kind of hefty build her aunt used to call peasantstock in a tone of contempt no he had resembled her in a wayas if she were a kind of washedout copy of the template from which his kind had been cut where her hair was a dark mousybrown his was just as dark but the color was more intense they had the same general build thin tall with prominent cheekbones his eyes her aunt had called her cateyed for she didnt have eyes of a normal brown but more of a vague yellow as washedout as her hair but his had been truly and intensely gold with a greenish backreflection like the eyes of a wild animal at night and those eyes had been filled with hunterawareness the eyes of a predator and she had been his quarry the dream came back to her with extraordinary vividness it had begun as shed reached the edge of the forest with him hot on her trail she had a vague recollection of having begun the chase in human form and having switched to leopard as she reached the trees he had no dogs no aid but his own sensesyet nothing shed done had confused him for more than a second shed even laid a false trail into the stone circle something shed never done to another hunter but she was beginning to paniched avoided the trap neatly the hunt had begun near midmorning by false dawn hed brought her to bay and trapped her and that was when shed awakened she spent the early hours of the morning pacing beside the pond feeling almost impelled to go into the village yet afraid to do so finally the need to see grew too great she crept to the edge of the village past the guards and slipped into the maze of whole and halfruined buildings that was the villageproper there was a larger than usual marketcrowd today the usual market stalls had been augmented by strangers with more luxurious goods foodstuffs and even a couple of ragged entertainers evidently this was some sort of fair with so many strangers about glenda was able to remain unseen her courage came back as she skirted the edge of the marketplace keeping to shadows and sheltering within halftumbled walls and the terror of the night seemed to become just one more shadow finally she found an ideal perchhiding in the shadow just under the eaves of a halfruined building that had evidently once belonged to the local lordling and in whose courtyard the market was usually held from here she could see the entire court and yet remain unseen by humans and unscented by any of the livestock she had begun to think her fears were entirely groundlesswhen she caught sight of a stranger coming out of the door of what passed for an inn here speaking earnestly with the village headman her blood chilled for the man was tall darkhaired and lean and dressed entirely in dark leathers just like the man in her dream he was too far away for her to see his face clearly and she froze in place following him intently without moving a muscle the headman left him with a satisfied air and the man gazed about him as if looking for something he finally turned in her direction and glenda nearly died of frightfor the face was that of the man in her dream and he was staring directly at her hiding place as though he knew exactly where and what she was she broke every rule shed ever made for herselfbroke cover in full sight of the entire village in the panicked screaming mob the hunter could only cursefor the milling terrorstruck villagers were only interested in fleeing in the opposite direction from where glenda stood tail lashing and snarling with fear she took advantage of the confusion to leap the wall of the courtyard and sprint for the safety of the forest halfway there she changed into human for a short runthere was no one to see her and it might throw him off the track then at forest edge once on the springy moss that would hold no tracks she changed back to leopard she paused in the shade for a moment to get a quick drink from the stream and to rest for the fullout run from the village had tired her badlyonly to look up to see him standing directly across the stream from her he was shading his eyes with one hand against the sun that beat down on him and it seemed to her that he was smiling in triumph she choked on the water and fled she called upon every trick shed ever learned laying false trails by the dozen fording the stream as it threaded through the forest not once but several times breaking her trail entirely by taking to the treetops on an area where she could cross several hundred feet without once having to set foot to the ground she even drove a chancemet herd of deercreatures across her backtrail muddling the tracks past following she didnt remember doing any of this in her dreamin her dream she had only run too fearful to do much that was complicatedor so she remembered at last panting with weariness she doubled back to lairup in the crotch of a huge tree looking back down the way she had passed certain that she would see him give up in frustration he walked so softly that even her keen ears couldnt detect his tread she was only aware that he was there when she saw him she froze in placeshe hadnt really expected hed get this far but surely surely when he came to the place shed taken to the branches he would be baffled for shed first climbed as girlglenda and there wasnt any place where the clawmarks of the leopard scored the trunks within sight of the ground he came to the place where her tracks endedand closed his eyes a frownline between his brows late afternoon sun filtered through the branches and touched his face glenda thought with growing confidence that he had been totally fooled by her trick he carried a strung bow black as his clothing and highly polished and wore a sword and dagger which none of the villagers ever did as her fear ebbed she had time to think with a tiny twinge that he couldnt have been much older than sheand was very very attractive as if that thought had touched something that signaled him his eyes snapped openand he looked straight through the branches that concealed her to rivet his own gaze on her eyes with a mew of terror she leapt out of the tree and ran in mindless panic as fast as she could set paw to ground the sun was reddening everything she cringed and thought of blood then she thought of her dream and the dwellerinthecircle if instead of a false trail she laid a true onewaiting for him at the end of it if she rushed him suddenly she could probably startle him into the power of the thing that lived within the shelter of those stones once in the throes of its mental grip she doubted hed be able to escape it seemed a heavensent plan relief made her lightheaded as she ran leaving a clear trail behind her to the place of the circle by the time she reached its vicinity it was full darkand she knew the power of the dweller was at its height in darkness yet the closer she drew to those glowing stones the slower her paws moved and a building reluctance to do this thing weighed heavily on her soon she could see the stones shining ahead of her in her mind she pictured the mans capturehis terrorhis inevitable end leopardglenda urgedkill girlglenda wailed in fear of him but stubbornly refused to put him in the power of that the two sides of her struggled nearly tearing her physically in two as she halfshifted from one to the other her outward form paralleling the struggle within at last with a pathetic cry the leopard turned in her tracks and ran from the circle the will of girlglenda had won whenever she paused to rest she could hear him coming long before shed even caught her breath the stamina of a leopard is no match for that of a human they are built for the short chase not the long and the stamina of girlglenda was no match for that of he who hunted her in either form now she was exhausted he had driven her through the moonlit clearings of the forest she knew out beyond the territory she had ranged before this forest must extend deep into the waste and this was the direction he had driven her now she stumbled as she ran no longer capable of clever tricks just fearprodded running her eyes were glazed with weariness her mind numb with terror her sides heaved as she panted and her mouth was dry her thirst a raging fire inside her she fled from bush to tangled stand of undergrowth at all times avoiding the patches of moonlight but it seemed as if her foe knew this section of the wilderness as well or better than she knew her own territory she could not rid herself of the feeling that she was being driven to some goal only he knew suddenly as rockcliff loomed before her she realized that her worst fears were correct he had herded her into a deadend ravine and there was no escape for her at least not in leopardform the rock before her was sheer to either side it slanted inward the stone itself was brittle shale almost impassableyet she began shifting into her human form to make that attempt then a sound from behind her told her that she had misjudged his nearnessand it was too late she whirled at bay halfhuman halfleopard flanks heaving as she sucked in painfilled gasps of air he blocked the way out dark and grim on the path nocked bow in hand she thought she saw his eyes shine with fierce joy even in the darkness of the ravine she had no doubts that he could see her as easily as she saw him there was nowhere to hide on either side of her again leopardinstinct urgedkill her claws extended and she growled deep in her throat half in fear half in warning he paced one step closer she couldshe could fight him she could dodge the arrowat this range he could never get off the second if she closed with him she could kill him his blood would run hot between her teeth kill no never never had she harmed another human being not even the man who had denied her succor no kill she fought the leopard within knowing that if it won there would never be a girlglenda again only the predator the beast and that would be the death of hera death as real as that which any arrow could bring her and he watched from the shadows terrible dark and menacing his bow halfdrawn and yethe did not move not so much as a single muscle if he had perhaps the leopard would have won fear triumphing over will but he stirred not and it was the human side of her that conquered and she waited eyes fixed on his for death gentle lady she started as the voice spoke in her headthen shook it wildly certain that she had been driven mad at last be easydo not fear me again that voice she stared at him wildeyedwas he some kind of magician to speak in her very thoughts and as if that were not startlement enough she watched dumbfounded as he knelt slowlyslowly eased the arrow off the string of his bowand just as slowly laid them to one side he held out hands now empty his face fully in the moonlightand smiled and roseand at first she thought it was the moonlight that made him seem to writhe and blur then she thought that certainly her senses were deceiving her as her mind hadfor his body was blurring shifting changing before her eyes like a figure made of clay softening and blurring and becoming another shape altogether until where the hunter had stood was a black leopard halfagain her size glenda stared into the flames of the campfire sipping at the warm wine wrapped in a fur cloak and held by a drowsy contentment the wine the cloak and the campfire were all harwins for that was the name of the hunterharwin he had coaxed her into her following him then once his camp had been reached coaxed her into human form again he had given her no time to be shamed by her nakedness for he had shrouded her in the cloak almost before the transformation was complete then he had built this warming fire from the banked coals of the old and fed her the first cooked meal shed had in months then pressed the wine on her and all with slow reassuring movements as if he was quite well aware how readily she could be startled into transforming back again and fleeing into the forest and all without speaking much besides telling her his name his silence not unfriendly not in the least but as if he were waiting with patient courtesy for her to speak first she cleared her throat and tentatively spoke her first words in this alien tongue her own voice sounding strange in her ears whoare you what are you he cocked his head to one side his eyes narrowing in concentration as he listened to her halting words you speak the speech of the dales as one who knows it only indifferently lady he replied his words measured slow and pronounced with care as if he guessed she needed slow speech to understand clearly yet you do not have the accent of arvonand i do not think you are one of the old ones if i tell you who and what i am will you do me like courtesy imy name is glenda i couldnt dothisat home wherever home is iim not sure what i am then your home is not of this world there was it all seemed so vague like a dream now a city ilived there but not well i was huntedi found a placea woman i thought she was crazy butshe said something and i saw this placeand i had to come a gate i think and a gatekeeper he nodded as if to himself that explains much so you found yourself here in the waste though i didnt know that was what it was i met a mani was tired starving and he tried to drive me away i got mad the rest i know he said for elvath himself told me of how you went were before his eyes poor ladyhow bewildered you must have been with no one to tell you what was happening to you and then haltingly with much encouragement she told him of her life in the forest her learning to control her changesand her side of the nights hunt and the woman won over the beast he finished and well for you that it did his gold eyes were very somber and he spoke with emphasis heavy in his words had you turned on me i doubt that you would ever have been able to find your human self again she shuddered what am i she asked at last her eyes fixed pleadingly on his and where am i and why has all this been happening to me i cannot answer the last for you save only that i think you are here because your spirit never fit truly in that strange world from which you came as for whereyou are in the dale lands of high halleck on the edge of the wastewhich tells you nothing i know and what you arelike me you are plainly of some faroff strain of wereblood well perhaps not quite like me among my kind the females are not known for being able to shapechange and i myself am of halfblood only my mother is kildas of the dales my father harl of the wereriders and ii am harwin he smiled ruefully of no place in particular whywhy did you hunt me she asked why did they want you to hunt me because they had no notion of my wereblood he replied frankly they only know of my reputation as a huntershall i begin at the beginning perhaps it will give you some understanding of this world you have fallen into she nodded eagerly wellyou may have learned that in my fathers time the dales were overrun by the hounds of alizon at her nod he continued they had strange weapons at their disposal and came very close to destroying all who opposed them at that time my father and his brotherkin lived in the waste in exile for certain actions in the past from the land of arvon which lies to the north of the waste theyas i as youhave the power of shapechange and other powers as well it came to the defenders of the dales that one must battle strangeness with strangeness and power with power they made a pact with the wereriders in exchange for aid they would send to them at the end of the war in the year of the unicorn twelve brides and one you see if all went well the wereriders exile was to end thenbut if all was not well they would have remained in exile and they did not wish their kind to die away the war ended the brides camethe exile ended but one of the bridegrooms waslike meof halfblood and one of the brides was a maiden of power there was much trouble for them when the trouble was at an end they left arvon together and i know nothing more of their tale now we come to my part of the tale my mother kildas has gifted my father with three children of which two are a pleasure to his heart and of like mind with him i am the third the misfit the rebel she guessed shrewdly if by that you mean the one who seems destined always to anger his kin with all he says and doesaye we cannot agree my father and i one day in his anger he swore that i was another such as herrel well that was the first that i had ever heard of one of wereblood who was likeminded with mei plagued my mother and father both until they gave me the tale of herrel halfblood and his witchbride and from that moment i had no peace until i set out to find them for surely i thought i would find true kinfeeling with them the which i lacked with those truly of my blood and did you find them not yet he admitted at my mothers request i came here first to give word to her kin that she was well and happy and greatly honored by her lord which is the entire truth my fatherloves her dearly grants her every wish before she has a chance to voice it i could wish to find a lady with whomwell that was one of the reasons that i sought herrel and his lady he was silent for so long staring broodingly into the flames that glenda ventured to prompt him soyou came here eh oh aye and understandably enough earned no small reputation among my motherkin for hunting though they little guessed in what form i did my tracking he grinned at her and she found herself grinning back so when there were rumors of another were here at the edge of the wasteand a were that thoughtlessly preyed on the beasts of these people as well as its rightful gameunderstandably enough i came to hear of it i thought at first that it must be herrel or a son imagine my surprise on coming here to learn that the were was female my reputation preceded methe headman begged me to rid the village of their monster he spread his hands wide the rest you know whatwhat will you do with me now she asked in a small fearful voice do with you he seemed surprised nothingnothing not of your own will lady i am not going to harm youand i am not like my father and brother to force a one in my hand into anything against her wishes ii go forward as i had intendedto find herrel you now that you know what your actions should not be lest you arouse the anger of ordinary folk against you may remain here and and i shall tell them i have killed the monster you shall be safe enoughonly remember that you must never let the leopard control you or you are lost truly you should have someone to guide and teach you though iknow that now she replied very much aware of how attractive he was gold eyes fixed on the fire a lock of dark hair falling over his forehead but no man had ever found her to be company to be soughtafter there was no reason to think that he might be hinting no reason that is until he looked full into her eyes and she saw the wistful loneliness there and a touch of pleading i would be glad to teach you lady he said softly forgive me if i am overforward and clumsy in my speech buti think you and i could companion well together on this quest of mineandi he dropped his eyes to the flames again and blushed hotly i think you very fair me she squeaked more startled than she had been since he transformed before her can you doubt it he replied softly looking up eagerly he held out one hand to her can i hopeyou will come with me she touched his fingers with the hesitation of one who fears to break something you mean you really want me with you since i touched your mindlady more than you could dream not only are you kinkind butmindkin i think she smiled suddenly feeling almost lightheaded with the revelations of the past few hoursthen giggled as an irrelevant though came to her harwinwhat happens to your clothes my what he stared at her for a moment as if she had broken into a foreign tonguethen looked at her and back at himselfand blushed then grinned well i mean i left bits of jeans and tshirt all over the waste when i changed what happens to your ring lady it her forehead furrowed in thought i dont know really its gone when i change its back when i change back she regarded the tiny beast thoughtfully and it seemed as if one of its topaz eyes closed in a slow wink butno that could only have been a trick of the firelight weremagic lady and magic i think i shall let you avail yourself of seeing as i can hardly let you take a chill if you are to accompany me he rummaged briefly in his pack and came up with a shirt and breeches both far too large for her but that was soon remedied with a belt and much rolling of sleeves and cuffs she changed quickly under the shelter of his cloak theyll really change with me she looked down at herself doubtfully why not try them he stood and held out his handthen blurred in that disconcerting way the black leopard looked across the fire at her with eyes that glowed with warmth and approval the night still has time to run glendamylady will you not run with it and me the eyes of the catring glowed with equal warmth and glenda found herself filled with a feeling of joy and freedomand of belongingthat she tossed back her head and laughed aloud as she had never in her life done before she stretched her own arms to the stars and called on the power within her for the first time with joy instead of anger and there was no painonly peaceas she transformed into a slim lithe sheleopard whose eyes met that of the he with a happiness that was heartfilling oh yes harwinmylord let us run the night to dawn skitty the four skitty stories appeared in cat fantastic anthologies edited by andre norton im very very fond of skitty it might seem odd for a bird person to be fond of cats but i am so there it is i was actually a catperson before i was a birdmother and i do have two cats both siamesemix both rather old and very slow just if the other local cats poach too often at my bird feeders they can expect to get a surprise from the gardenhose nasty skitty complained in dicks head she wrapped herself a little closer around his shoulders and licked drops of oily fog from her fur with a faint mew of distaste smelly dick white had to agree the portside district of lacuun was pretty unsavory the dismal foggy weather made it look even worse shabby cheap and illused every building hereall twenty of themwas offworld design shoddy prefab mostly painted in shades of peeling grey and industrial green with garish neonbright holosigns that were thank the spirits of space mostly tuned down to faintly colored ghosts in the daytime there were six bars two gamblingjoints one chapel run by the neojesuits one flophouse run by the reformed salvation army five government buildings four stores and once place better left unnamed they had all sprung up like diseased fungus in the year since the planet and people of lacuun had been declared open for trade there was nothing native here for that you had to go outside the fence and to go outside the fence dick reminded himself you have to get permits signed by everybody and his dog cat corrected skitty okay okay he thought back with wry amusement everybody and his cat except they dont have cats here except on the ships skitty sniffed disdainfully fools she replied smoothing down an errant bit of damp fur with her tongue thus dismissing an entire culture that currently had most of the companies on their collective knees begging for trading concessions well weve seen about everything there is to see dick thought back at skitty reaching up to scratch her ears as she purred in contentment are you quite satisfied hunt now she countered hopefully no you cant hunt you know that very well this is a class four world you have to have permission from the local sapients to hunt and they havent given us permission to even sneeze outside the fence and inside the fence you are valuable merchandise subject to catnapping as you very well know i played shining knight for you once furball and i dont want to repeat the experience skitty sniffed again not love me love you too much pest dont want you ending up in the hold of some tramp freighter skitty turned up the volume on her purr and rearranged her coil on dicks shoulders until she resembled a lumpy black fur collar on his gray shipsuit when she left the shipand often when she was in the shipthat was skittys perch of choice dick had finally prevailed on the purser to put shoulderpads on all his shipsuitssometimes skitty got a little careless with her claws when man had gone to space cats had followed they were quickly proven to be a necessity for not only did mans old pests rats and mice accompany his tradethere seemed to be equivalent pests on every new world but the shipscats were considerably different from their earthbound ancestors the cold reality was that a spacer couldnt afford a pet that had to be cared forhe needed something closer to a partner hence skitty and her kind genetailored into something more than animals skitty was biotech type f forepaws like that of a raccoon more like stubby little hands than paws smooth short hair with no undercoat to shed and clog up airfilters hunter second to none middleear tuning so that she not only was not bothered by hyperspace shifts and freefall she actually enjoyed them and last but by no means least the enlarged head showing the boosting of her intelligence biotech released the shipscats for adoption when they reached about six months old when theyd not only been weaned but trained training included maneuvering in freefall use of the same sanitary facilities as the crew and emergency procedures skitty had her vacuum suit just like any other crew member a transparent hard plex ball rather like a tiny lifeslip with a simple panel of controls inside to seal and pressurize it she was positively paranoid about having it with her shed haul it along on its tether if need be so that it was always in the same compartment that she was dick respected her paranoia any good spacer would officially she was lady sundancer of greenfields greenfields being biotech station na in actuality she was skitty to the entire crew and only dick remembered her real name dick had signed on to the catseye company ship brightwing just after theyd retired their last shipscat to spend his final days with other creaky retirees from the spacetrade in the tau epsilon old spacers station as junior officer dick had been sent off to pick up the replacement sop was for a biotech technician to give you two or three candidates to choose amongin actuality dick hadnt had any choice lady sundancer had taken one look at him and launched herself like a little black rocket from the arms of the tech straight for him shed landed on his shoulders purring at the top of her lungs when they couldnt pry her off not without injuring her the choice became moot and dick was elevated to the position of designated handler for the first few days she was dick whites kittythe rest of his fellow crewmembers being vastly amused that she had so thoroughly attached herself to him after a time that was shortened first to dicks kitty and then to skitty which name finally stuck since telepathy was not one of the traits biotech was supposedly breeding and genesplicing for dick had been more than a little startled when shed started speaking to him and since none of the others ever mentioned hearing her he had long ago come to the conclusion that he was the only one who could he kept that a secret at the least should biotech come to hear of it it would mean losing her biotech would want to know where that particular mutation came from for fair pretty gamy he told erica makumba legal and security officer who was the current onwatch at the airlock the dusky woman lounged in her jumpseat with deceptive casualness both hands behind her curly headbut there was a stunbracelet on one wrist and erica just happened to be the brightwings current karate champ eyeah she replied with a grimace had a look out there last night talk about your lowclass dives im not real surprised the lacuun threw the fence up around it damn if id want that for neighbors hey we may be getting a break though invitations gone out to about three capns to come make tradetalk seems the lacuun got themselves a lawyer so much for the unsophisticated primitives dick laughed i thought tristar was riding for a fall taking that line erica grinned a former tristar employee she had no great love for her previous employer eyeah so lawyer goes and calls up the records on every company making bids goes over em with a finetooth seems only three of us came up clean us solarquest and uvn we got invites rest got byebyes be hearing a buncha ships clearing for space in the next few hours my heart bleeds dick replied any chance they can fight it ha didnt tell you who they got for their mouthpiece lan ventris dick whistled somebodys been looking out for them terran consul she was the scout that made first contact they wouldnt have anybody else adopted her into the ruling sept keep her at the palace nice lady shared a beer or three with her she likes these people obviously takes their welfare real personal nowyou want the quick lowdown on the invites dick leaned up against the bulkhead arms folded taking care not to disturb skitty say on one she held up a solemn finger venathats the consulsays that these folk have a long martial tradition theyre warriors and admire warriorsbut they admire honor and honesty even more the trappings of primitivism are there but its a veneer for considerable sophistication so whoever goes needs to walk a line between pride and honorable behavior that will be a lot like the old japanese courts of terra two they are very serious about religionthey give us a certain amount of leeway for being ignorant outlanders but if you transgress too far venas not sure what the penalties may be so you want to watch for signals bodylanguage from the priestcaste that could warn you that youre on dangerous ground threeand this is what may give us an edge over the other twothey are very big on their totem animals the sept totems are actually an important part of sept pride and the religion so the capn intends to make you and her highness there part of the delegation vena says that the lacuun intend to issue three contracts so were all gonna get one but the folks that impress them the most will be getting first choice if dick hadnt been leaning against the metal of the bulkhead he might well have staggered as most junior on the crew the likelihood that he was going to even go beyond the fence had been staggeringly lowbut that he would be included in the first trade delegation was mindmelting skitty caroled her own excitement all the way back to his cabin launching herself from his shoulder to land in her own little shockbunk bolted to the wall above his dick began digging through his catchall bin for his dressinsignia the halflidded topaz eye for catseye company the gold wings of the ships insignia that went beneath it the three tiny stars signifying the three missions hed been on so far he caught flickers of skittys private thoughts then thoughts of pleasure thoughts of nesting nesting oh no he spun around to meet her wide yellow eyes to see her treading out her shockbunk skitty he pled please dont tell me youre pregnant kittens she affirmed very pleased with herself you swore to me that you werent in heat when i let you out to hunt she gave the equivalent of a mental shrug i lie he sat heavily down on his own bunk all his earlier excitement evaporated biotech shipscats were supposed to be sterileabout one in a hundred werent and you had to sign an agreement with biotech that you wouldnt neuter yours if it proved out fertile they wanted the kittens wanted the results that came from outbreeding or you could sell the kittens to other ships yourself or keep them provided a biotech station wasnt within your ships current itinerary but of course only biotech would take them before they were six months old and trained that was the rub dick sighed skitty had already had one litter on himonly two but it had seemed like twentytwo there was this problem with kittens in a spaceship there was a period of time between when they were mobile and when they were about four months old that they had exactly two neurons in those cute fluffy little heads one neuron to keep the body moving at warp speed and one neuron to pick out the situation guaranteed to cause the most trouble everyone in the crew was willing to play with thembut no one was willing to keep them out of trouble and since skitty was dicks responsibility it was dick who got to clean up the messes and dick who got to fish the little fluffbrains out of the bridge console and dick who got to have the anachronistic litter pan in his cabin until skitty got her babies properly toilet trained securing a litter pan for freefall was not something he had wanted to have to do again ever how could you do this to me he asked skitty reproachfully she just curled her head over the edge of her bunk and trilled prettily he sighed too late to do anything about it now and you can see the carvings adorn every flat surface vena ferducci the small darkhaired woman who was the terran consul said waving her hand gracefully at the walls dick wanted to stand and gawk this was incredible the fence was actually an opaque forcefield and only one of the reasons the companies wanted to trade with the lacuunthough they did not have spaceflight there were certain applications of forcefield technologies they did have that seemed to be beyond the terrans abilities on the other side of the fence was literally another world these people built to last in limestone alabaster and marble in the wealthy district and in cast stone in the outer city the streets were carefully poured sections of concrete cleverly given stressjoints to avoid temperaturecracking and kept clean enough to eat from by a small army of streetsweepers no animals were allowed on the streets themselves except for housetrained pets the only vehicles permitted were single or doublebeing electric carts that could move no faster than a man could walk the lacuun dressed either in filmy silken robes or in more practical shorter versions of the same garments they were a handsome race upright bipeds skin tones in varying shades of browns and dark golds faces vaguely avian with a frill like an iguanas running from the base of the neck to a point between and just above the eyes as vena had pointed out every wall within sight was heavily carved the carvings all having to do with the lacuun religion most of the carvings were depictions of various processions or ceremonies and no two were exactly alike thats the harvestgladness vena said pointing as they walked to one elaborate wall that ran for yards its particularly appropriate for kladera he made all his money in agriculture most lacuun try to have something carved that reflects on their gratitude for favors granted i think i can guess that one the captain reginald singh said with a smile that showed startlingly white teeth in his dark face the carving he nodded to was a series of panels first a celebration involving a veritable kindergarten full of children then those childrennow sexdifferentiated and seen to be all femaleworshiping at the alter of a very fecundlooking lacuun female and finally the nowmaidens looking sweet and demure each holding various religious objects vena laughed her brown eyes sparkling with amusement no that one isnt hard theres a saying as fertile as gelvaderas wife every child was a female too that made it even better between the brideprices he got for the ones that wanted to wed and the officers price he got for the ones that went into the armed services gelvadera was a rich man his first daughter owns the house now ahthat brings up a question captain singh replied would you explain exactly who and what well be meeting i read the briefing but i still dont quite understand who fits in where with the government it will help if you think of it as a kind of unholy mating of the british parliamentary system and the medieval japanese shogunates vena replied youll be meeting with the kingthats the lacuarahis consort who has equal powers and represents the priesthoodthats the lacuteverasand his three advisors who are elected the advisors represent the military the bureaucracy and the economic sector the military advisor is always female all officers in the military are female because the lacuun believe that females will not seek glory for themselves and so will not issue reckless orders the other two can be either sex advisor is not altogether an accurate term to use for them the lacuara and lacuteveras rarely act counter to their advice dick was paying scant attention to this monologue hed already picked all this up from the faxes hed called out of the local library after hed read the briefing he was more interested in the carvings for there was something about them that puzzled him all of them featured strange little sixlegged creatures scampering about under the feet of the carved lacuun they were about the size of a large mouse and seemed to dick to be wearing very smug expressions though of course he was surely misinterpreting excuse me consul he said when vena had finished explaining the intricacies of lacuun government to captain singhs satisfaction i cant help wondering what those little lizardlike things are kreshta she said i would call them pests you dont see them out on the streets much but they are the reason the streets are kept so clean youll see them soon enough once we get inside theyre like mice only worse fast as lightningtheyll steal food right off your plate the lacuun either cant or wont get rid of them i cant tell you which when i asked about them once my host just rolled his eyes heavenward and said what translates to its the will of the gods inshallah captain singh asked very like that yes i cant tell if they tolerate the pests because it is the gods will that they must or if they tolerate them because the gods favor the little monsters inside the fence we have to close the government buildings down once a month seal them up and fumigate were just lucky they dont breed very fast hunt skitty asked hopefully from her perch on dicks shoulders no dick replied hastily just look dont hunt the cat was gaining startledand dick thought appreciativelooks from passersby just what is the status value of a totemic animal erica asked curiously its the fact that the animal can be tamed at all aside from a handful of domestic herbivores most animal life on lacuun has never been tamed to be able to take a carnivore and train it to the hand implies that the gods are with you in a very powerful way vena dimpled ill let you in on a big secret frankly lan and i preferred the record of the brightwing over the other two ships you seemed to be more sympathetic to the lacuun thats why we told you about the totemic animals and why we left you until last it wouldnt have worked without dick captain singh told her skitty has really bonded to him in a remarkable way i dont think this presentation would come off half so impressively if he had to keep her on a lead it wouldnt vena replied directing them around a corner at the end of a short street was a fifteen foot wallcarved of coursepierced by an arching entranceway the palace she said rather needlessly vena had been right the kreshta were everywhere dick could feel skitty trembling with the eagerness to hunt but she was managing to keep herself under control only the lashing of her tail betrayed her agitation he waited at parade rest trying not to give in to the temptation to stare as the captain and the negotiator grace vixen were presented to the five rulers of the lacuun in an elaborate ceremony that resembled a stately dance behind the low platform holding the five dignitaries in their iridescent robes were five soberly clad retainers each with one of the totemic animals dick could see now what vena had meant the handlers had their creatures under control but only barely there was something like a bird something resembling a small crocodile something like a snake but with six very tiny legs a creature vaguely catlike but with a feathery coat and a beast resembling a teddybear with scales none of the handlers was actually holding his beast except the birdhandler all of the animals were on short chains and all of them punctuated the ceremony with soft growls and hisses so skitty perched freely on dicks shoulders had drawn no few murmurs of awe from the crowd of lacuun in the audience hall the presentation glided to a conclusion and the lacuteveras whispered something to vena behind her fan with your permission captain the lacuteveras would like to know if your totemic beast is actually as tame as she appears she is the captain replied speaking directly to the consort and bowing exhibiting a charm that had crossed species barriers many times before this it worked its magic again the lacuteveras fluttered her fan and trilled something else at vena the audience of courtiers gasped would it be possible she asks for her to touch it skitty dick asked quickly knowing that she was getting the sense of what was going on from his thoughts nice the cat replied her attention momentarily distracted from the scurrying hints of movement that were all that could be seen of the kreshta nice lady feels good in head like dick feels good in head he thought startled i dont think that there will be any problem captain dirk murmured to singh deciding that he could worry about it later skitty seems to like the lacuun maybe they smell right skitty flowed down off his shoulder and into his arms as he stepped forward to present the cat to the lacuteveras he showed the lacuun the cats favorite spot to be scratched under the chin the long talons sported by all lacuun were admirably suited to the job of catscratching the lacuteveras reached forward with one lilactipped finger and hesitantly followed dicks example the audience hall was utterly silent as she did so as if the entire assemblage was holding its breath waiting for disaster to strike the courtiers gasped at her temerity when the cat stretched out her neckthen gasped again this time with delight as skittys rumbling purr became audible skittys eyes were almost completely closed in sensual delight dick glanced up to see that the lacuteveras amber slitpupiled eyes were widened with what he judged was an equal delight she let her other six fingers join the first tentative one beneath the cats chin such soft she said shyly in musicallyaccented standard such nice thank you high lady dick replied with a smile we think so verrry nice skitty seconded not headtalk like dick but feel good in head like dick nice lady have kitten soon too the lacuteveras took her hand away with some reluctance and signed that dick should return to his place skitty slid back up onto his shoulders and started to settle herself it was then that everything fell apart the next stage in the ceremony called for the rulers to take their seats in their five thrones and the captain vena and grace to assume theirs on stools before the thrones so that each party could present what it wanted out of a possible relationship but the lacuteveras her eyes still wistfully on skitty was not looking where she placed her hand and on the armrest of the throne was a kreshta frozen into an atypical immobility the lacuteveras put her handwith all of her weight on itright on top of the kreshta the evillooking thing squealed squirmed and bit her as hard as it could the lacuteveras cried out in painthe courtiers gasped the advisors made warding gesturesand skitty roused to sudden and protective rage at this attack by vermin on the nice lady who was with kittenleapt the kreshta saw her coming and blurred with speedbut it was not fast enough to evade skitty genetailored product of one of biotechs finest labs before it could cover even half of the distance between it and safety skitty had it there was a crunch audible all over the audience chamber and the ugly little thing was hanging limp from skittys jaws tail high in a silence that could have been cut up into bricks and used to build a wall she carried her prize to the feet of the injured one lacuun and laid it there fix him dick heard in his mind not hurt niceonewithkitten the lacuara stepped forward face rigid every muscle tense spirits of space dick thought steeling himself for the worst thats bloody well torn it but the lacuara instead of ordering the guards to seize the terrans went to one knee and picked up the brokenbacked kreshta as if it were a fine jewel then he brandished it over his head while the entire assemblage of lacuun burst into cheersand the terrans looked at one another in bewilderment skitty preened accepting the caresses of every lacuun that could reach her with the air of one to whom adulation is long due whenever an unfortunate kreshta happened to attempt to skitter by she would turn into a bolt of black lightning reenacting her kill to the redoubled applause of the lacuun vena was translating as fast as she could with the three advisors all speaking at once the lacuara was tenderly bandaging the hand of his consort but occasionally one or the other of them would put in a word too apparently theyve never been able to exterminate the kreshta the natural predators on them cant be domesticated and generally take pieces out of anyone trying traps and poisoned baits dont work because the kreshta wont take them the only thing theyve ever been able to do is what we were doing behind the fence close up the building and fumigate periodically and even that has problemsthe lacuteveras for instance is violently allergic to the residue left when the fumigation is done vena paused for breath i take it theyd like to have skitty around on a permanent basis the captain said with heavy irony spirits of space captainthey think skitty is a sign from the gods incarnate im not sure theyll let her leave dick heard that with alarmin a lot of ways skitty was the best friend he had to leave herthe thought wasnt bearable skitty whipped about with alarm when she picked up what he was thinking with an anguished yowl she scampered across the slippery stone floor and flung herself through the air to land on dicks shoulders there she clung howling her objections at the idea of being separated at top of her lungs what in captain singh exclaimed turning to see what could be screaming like a damned soul she doesnt want to leave me captain dick said defiantly and i dont think youre going to be able to get her off my shoulder without breaking her legs or tranking her captain singh looked stormy damn it then get a trank im afraid ill have to veto that one captain erica interrupted apologetically the contract with biotech clearly states that only the designated handlerand thats dickor a biotech representative can treat a shipscat and furthermore she continued halting the captain before he could interrupt it also states that to leave a shipscat without its designated handler will force biotech to refuse anymore shipscats to brightwing for as long as you are the captain now i dont want to sound like a troublemaker captain but i for one will flatly refuse to serve on a ship with no cat periodic vacuum purges to kill the vermin do not appeal to me well then ill order the boy to sir i am the brightwings legal advisori hate to say this but to order dick to ground is a clear violation of his contract he hasnt got enough hours spacing yet to qualify him for a ground position the lacuteveras had taken vena aside dick saw and was chattering at her at top speed waving her bandaged hand in the air captain singh she said turning away from the lacuun and tugging at his sleeve the lacuteveras has figured out that something you said or did is upsetting the cat and shes not very happy with that captain singh looked just about ready to swallow a bucket of heated nails spacer will you get that feline calmed down before they throw me in the local brig illtry sir come on old girlthey wont take you away erica and the nice lady wont let them he coaxed youre making the nice lady unhappy and that might hurt her kitten skitty subsided slowly but continued to cling to dicks shoulder as if he was the only rock in a flood not take dick erica wont let them nice erica a sudden thought occurred to him skittylove how long would it take before you had your new kittens trained to hunt she pondered the question from wean three heats she said finally about a year then from birth to full hunter captain i may have a solution for you i would be overjoyed to hear one the captain replied dryly skittys pregnant againim sorry sir i just found out today and i didnt have time to report itbut sir this is going to be to our advantage if the lacuun insisted we could handle the whole trade deal couldnt we erica and it should take something like a year to get everything negotiated and set up shouldnt it up to a year and a half standard yes she confirmed and basically whatever the lacuun want they get so far as the company is concerned once the kittens are a year old theyll be hunters just as good as skitty isso if you could see your way clear to doing all the set upand sortof wait around for us to get done rearing the kittens captain singh burst into laughter boy do you have any notion just how many credits handling the entire trade negotiations would put in brightwings account do you have any idea what that would do for my status no sir he admitted suffice it to say i could retire if i chose andspirits of spacekittens kittens we could legally sell to the lacuun i dont suppose you have any notion of how many kittens we can expect this time he sent an inquiring tendril of thought to skitty uhi think four sir four and they were offering us what for just her the captain asked vena a morethanconsiderable amount she said dryly exclusive contract on the forcefield applications how would they feel about bargaining for four to be turned over in about a year vena turned to the rulers and translated the excited answer she got left no doubts in anyones mind that the lacuun were overjoyed at the prospect basically captain youve just convinced the lacuun that you hung the moon wellwhy dont we settle down to a little serious negotiation hmm the captain said nobly refraining from rubbing his hands together with glee i think that all our problems for the future are about to be solved in one fell swoop get over here spacer you and that cat have just received a promotion to junior negotiator okay skitty asked anxiously yes love dick replied taking ericas place on a negotiators stool very okay a tail of two skittys the howls coming from inside the special animal shipping crate sounded impatient and had been enough to seriously alarm the cargo handlers dick white spaceman first class supercargo on the catseye company ship brightwing put his hand on the outside of the plastile crate just above the word property from within the crate the muffled voice continued to yowl general unhappiness with the world tell her that its all right skitty he thought at the black form that lay over his shoulders like a living fur collar tell her ill have her out in a minute i dont want her to come bolting out of there and hide the minute i crack the crate skitty raised her head yellow eyes blinked once sleepily abruptly the yowling stopped she fine skitty said and yawned showing a full mouth of needlepointed teeth only young scared i think she make good mate for furrball dick shook his head the kittens were not even a year old and already their mother was matchmaking then again that was the tendency of mothers the universe over at least now hed be able to uncrate this wouldbe mate with a minimum of fuss the full legend imprinted on the crate read female shipscat astra stardancer of englewood property of biotech interstellar leased to catseye company do not open under penalty of law theoretically astra was like skitty a bioengineered shipscat fully capable of handling freefall alien vermin conditions that would poison paralyze or terrify her remote terran ancestors and all without turning a hair in actuality astra like the nineteen other shipscats dick had uncrated was a failure the genetic engineering of her middleear and other balancing organs had failed she could not tolerate freefall and while most ships operated under gravgenerators there were always equipment malfunctions and accidents that made her and her fellows failures by biotech standards a shipscat that could not handle freefall was not a shipscat normally kittens that washed out in training were adopted out to carefully selected planet or stationbound families of biotech employees however this was not a normal circumstance by any stretch of the imagination the world of the lacuun graceful bipedal humanoids with a remarkably sophisticated if planetbound civilization was infested with a pest called a kreshta erica makumba the legal advisor and security chief of dicks ship described them as sixlegged crosses between cockroaches and mice skitty described them only as nasty but she hunted them gleefully anyway the lacuun opened their world to trade just over a year ago and some of their artifacts and technologies made them a desirable tradeally indeed the brightwing had been one of the three ships invited to negotiate in part because of skitty for the lacuun valued totemic animals highly and that was what had led to captain singh of the brightwing conducting the entire trade negotiations with the lacuunand had kept brightwing groundbound for the past year skitty had done theto the lacuunimpossible she had killed kreshta she had already been assumed to be brightwings totemic animal that act elevated her to the status of godtouched miracle and had given the captain and crew of her ship unprecedented control and access to the rulers here skitty had been newlypregnant at the time part of the price for the power captain singh now wielded had been her kittens but dick had gotten another idea and had used his own share of the profits brightwing was taking in to purchase the leases of twenty more failed cats to supplement skittys four kittens biotech cats released for leases were generally sterile skitty being a rare exception if these twenty worked out the lacuun would be very grateful and more importantly so would vena ferducci the attractive petite terran consul assigned to the new embassy here in the past few months dick had gotten to know vena very welland he hoped to get to know her better vena had originally been a survey scout and she was getting rather restless in her groundbased position as consul and in truth the lacuun lawyer lan ventris was much better suited to such a job than vena she had hinted that as soon as the lacuun felt they could trust ventris she would like to resign and go back to space dick rather hoped she might be persuaded to take a position with the brightwing it was too soon to call this little dance a romance but he had hopes hopes which could be solidified by this experiment if the twenty young cats he had imported worked out as well as skittys four halfgrown kittens the lacuun would be able to import their intelligent pestkillers at a fraction of what the lease on a shipscat would be this would make vena happy anything that benefited her lacuun made her happy and if dick was the cause of that happiness dick go courting skitty asked innocently salting her query with decidedly notinnocent images of her own courting dick blushed no courting he thought firmly not yet anyway silly skitty replied scornfully the overtones of her thoughts werewhy waste such a golden opportunity dick did not answer her instead he thumbed the lock on the crate a lock keyed to his dna only a tiny prickle was the only indication that the lock had taken a sample of his skin for comparison but a moment later a hairlinethin crack appeared around the front end of the crate and dick carefully opened the door and looked inside a pair of big green eyes in a pointed gray face looked out at him from the shadows meowrrrr said a tentative voice tell her its all right skitty he thought extending a hand for astra to sniff it was too bad that his telepathic connection with skitty did not extend to these other cats but she seemed to be able to relay everything he needed to tell them astra sniffed his fingers daintily and oozed out of the crate belly to the floor after a moment though a moment during which skitty stared at her so hard that dick was fairly certain his little friend was communicating any number of things to the newcomer astra stood up and looked around her ears coming up and her muscles relaxing finally she looked up at dick and blinked prrow she said he didnt need skittys translation to read that he held out his arms and the young cat leapt into them to be carried in regal dignity out of the quarantine area as he turned away from the crate he thought he caught a hint of movement in the shadows at the back but when he turned to look there was nothing there and he dismissed it as nothing more than his imagination if there had been anything else in astras crate the manifest would have listed itand astra was definitely sterile so it could not have been an unlicensed kitten erica makumba and vena were waiting for him in the corridor outside vena offered her fingers to the newcomer much more secure now astra sniffed them and purred shes lovely vena said in admiration dick had to agree astra was a velvety bluegray from head to tail and her slim clean lines clearly showed her descent from russian blue ancestors she for furrball skitty insisted gently nipping at his neck is this your idea or hers dick retorted sees furrball in head likes furrball that seemed to finish it as far as skitty was concerned good hunter too dick gave in to the inevitable didnt we promise one of these new cats to the lacuteveras dick asked this one seems very gentle shed probably do very well as a companion for furrball skittys kittens all had names as fancy as astrasor as skittys official name for that matter furrball was andreas widefarer of lacuun nuisance was misty snowspirit of lacuun rags was lady flamebringer of lacuun and trey was garrison starshadow of lacuun but they had as cats always do acquired their own nicknames that had nothing to do with the registered names astra would without a doubt do the same each of the most prominent families of the lacuun had been granted one cat but the royal family had three two of skittys original kittens and one of the newcomers astra would bring that number up to four a sacred number to the lacuun and very propitious we did vena replied absently scratching a pleased astra beneath her chin and i agree with you i think this one would please the lacuteveras very much she laughed a little im beginning to think youre psychic or something dick you havent been wrong with your selections yet me he said ingenuously psychic spirits of space vena the way these people are treating the cats it doesnt matter anyway any match i made would be a good one so far as the cat is concerned they couldnt be pampered more if they were lacuun girlbabies true she agreed and reluctantly took her hand away well four cats should be just about right to keep the palace verminfree its really kind of funny how theyve divided the place up among them with no bickering they almost act as if they were humans dividing up patrols erica shot him an unreadable glance did she remember how he had sat down with the original three and skittyand a floorplan of the placewhen he first brought them all to the palace they are bred for high intelligence he reminded both of them hastily no one really knows how bright they are theyre bright enough to use their lifesupport pods in an emergency and bright enough to learn how to use the human facilities in the ships they seem to have ways of communicating with each other or so the people at biotech tell me so maybe they did establish patrols well maybe they did erica said after a long moment he heaved a mental sigh of relief the last thing he needed was to have someone suspect skittys telepathic link with him biotech was not breeding for telepathy but if such a useful trait ever showed up in a fertile female they would surely cancel brightwings lease and haul skitty back to their nearest cattery to become a breeding queen skitty was his best friend to lose her like that would be terrible no breeding skitty said firmly love dick love ship no breeding breeding dull kittens a pain not leave ship ever well at least skitty agreed for now anyway now that her kittens were weaned whenever she came into season she seemed to change her mind at least about the part that resulted in breeding if not the breeding itself the lacuteveras the ruling consort of her people accepted astra into the household with soft cries of welcome and gladness erica was right the lacuun could not possibly have pampered their cats more whenever a cat wanted a lap or a scratch one was immediately provided whether or not the object of feline affection was in the middle of negotiations or a session of council or not whenever one wished to playalthough with the number of kreshta about there was very little energy left over for playingeverything else was set aside for that moment and when one brought in a trophy kreshta tail and ears held high with pride the entire court applauded astra was introduced to furrball at skittys insistence noses were sniffed and the two rubbed cheeks it appeared that mamas matchmaking was going to work the three humans and the pleased feline headed back across the city to the spaceport and the fence around it the city of the lacuun was incredibly attractive much more so than any other similar city dick had ever visited because of the rapidity with which the kreshta multiplied given any food and shelter the streets were kept absolutely spotless and the buildings clean and in repair most had walls about them giving the inhabitants little islands of privacy the walls of the wealthy were of carved stone those of the poor of cast concrete in all cases ornamentation was the rule not the exception the lacuun themselves walked the streets of their city garbed in delicate flowing robes or shorter more practical versions of the same garments graceful and handsome they resembled avians rather than reptiles their skin varied in shade from a dark brown to a golden tan and their heads bore a kind of frill like an iguanas that ran from the base of the neck to a point just above and between the eyes their faces were capable of something like a smile and the expression meant the same for them as it did for humans most of them smiled when they saw dick and skitty although the kreshtadestroying abilities of the cat were not something any of them would personally feel the impact of for many years perhaps generations they still appreciated what the cats dick had introduced could do the kreshta had been a plague upon them for as long as their history recorded even being so bold as to steal the food from plates and injure unguarded infants for as long as that history it had seemed that there would never be a solution to the depredations of the little beasts but nowthe most pious claimed the advent of the cats was a sign of the gods direct intervention and blessing and even the skeptics were thrilled at the thought that an end to the plague was in sight it was unlikely that even with a cat in every household the kreshta would ever be destroyedbut such things as setting a guard on sleeping babies and locking meals in metal containers set into the tables could probably be eliminated when they crossed the fence into terran territory however the surroundings dropped in quality by a magnitude or two dick felt obscurely ashamed of his world whenever he looked at the shabby garish spaceport facilities that comprised most of the terran spaceport area at least the headquarters that captain singh and catseye had established were handsome adaptations of the natives own architecture in cast concrete with walls decorated with stylized stars spaceships and suggestions of slitpupiled eyes solarquest and uvn the other two companies that had been given trade permits were following catseyes lead and had hired the same local architects and contractors to build their own headquarters it looked from the halffinished buildings as if solarquest was going with a motif taken from their own logo of a stylized sunburst uvn was going for geometrics in their walldecor there were four ships here at the moment rather than the authorized three for some reason the independent freighter that had brought in the twenty shipscats was still here on the landing field dick wondered about that for a moment then shrugged mentally independents often ran on shoestring budgets probably they had only loaded enough fuel to get them here and refueling was taking more time than they had thought it would suddenly just as they passed through the doors of the building skitty howled hissed and leapt from dicks shoulders vanishing through the rapidlyclosing door he uttered a muffled curse and turned to run after her what had gotten into her anyway he found himself looking into the muzzle of a weapon held by a large man in the nondescript coveralls favored by the crew of that independent freighter the man was as nondescript as his clothing with ashblond hair cut short and his very ordinary facewith the exception of that weapon and the cold calculating look in his irongray eyes dick put up his hands slowly he had the feeling this was a very bad time to play hero wheres the damn cat snapped the one dick was coming to think of as the gray man one of his underlings shrugged gone the man replied shortly she got away when we rounded up these three and she just vanished somewhere forget the cat how much damage could a cat do the gray man shrugged the natives might get suspicious if they dont see her with our man she probably wouldnt have cooperated with our man the underling pointed out not like she did with this one it doesnt matterwhite got the new cats installed and we dont need an animal that was likely to be a handful anyway the gray man nodded after a while and went back to securing the latest of his prisoners the offices in the new catseye building had been turned into impromptu cells dick had gotten a glimpse of captain singh in one of them as he had been frogmarched past he didnt know what these people had done with the rest of the crew or with vena and erica since vena had been taken off somewhere separately and erica had been stunned and dragged away without waiting for her surrender the gray man watched him with his weapon trained on him as two more underlings installed a tanglefield generator across the doorway with no windows these little offices made perfect holdingpens most of them didnt have furniture yet those that did didnt really contain anything that could be used as a weapon the desks were simple slabs of native wood on metal supports the chairs molded plastile and both were bolted to the floor there was nothing in dicks little cubicle that could even be thrown dick was still trying to figure out who and what these people were when something finally clicked he looked up at the gray man youre from tristar arent you he asked if the gray man was startled by this he didnt show it yes the man replied gunmuzzle never wavering how did you figure that out biotech never ships with anyone other than tristar if they can help it dick said flatly i wondered why they had hired a trampfreighter to bring out their cats it didnt seem like them but then i thought maybe that was all they could get youre clever white the gray man replied expressionlessly too clever for your own good maybe we might just have to make you disappear you and the makumba woman shell probably know some of us as soon as she wakes up and we dont have the time or the equipment to brainwipe you dick felt a chill going down his back as the men at the door finished installing the field and left quickly biotech is going to wonder if one of their designated handlers just vanishes and without me youre never going to get skitty back biotech isnt going to care for that either they might start asking questions that you cant answer the gray man stared at him for a long moment his expression did not vary in the least but at least he didnt make any move to shoot ill think about it he said finally he might have said more but there was a shout from the corridor outside the cat someone yelled and the gray man was out of the door before dick could blink unfortunately he paused long enough to trigger the tanglefield before he ran off in pursuit of what could only have been skitty dick slumped down into the chair and buried his face in his hands but not in despair he was thinking furiously tristar didnt like getting cut out of the negotiations what they cant get legally theyll get any way they can probably they intend to use us as hostages against venas good behavior getting her to put them up as the new negotiators i solved the problem of getting the cats for them now theres no reason they couldnt just step in but that cant go on forever sooner or later vena is going to get to a com unit or send some kind of message offworld so what would these people do then tristar had a reputation as being ruthless and hed heard from erica that it was justified so how do you get rid of an entire crew of a spaceship and the terran consul and maybe the crews of the other two ships into the bargain well there was always one answer to that especially on a newlyopened world plague the chill threaded his backbone again as he realized just what a good answer that was these tristar goons could use sickness as the excuse for why the catseye people werent in evidence a rumor of plague might well drive the other two ships offworld before they came down with it the tristar people could even claim to be taking care of the brightwings crew then after a couple of weeks they all succumb to the disease the terran consul with them it was a story that would work not only with the terran authorities but with the lacuun the fence was a very effective barrier to help from the natives the lacuun would not cross it to find out the truth even if they were suspicious i have to get to a com set he thought desperately his own usefulness would last only so long as it took them to trap skitty and find some way of caging her no one else so far as he knew could hear her thoughts all they needed to do would be to catch her and ship her back to biotech with the message that the designated handler was dead of plague and the cat had become unmanageable it wouldnt have been the first time a soft hiss made him look up and he strangled a cry of mingled joy and apprehension it was skitty she was right outside the door and she seemed to be trying to do something with the tanglefield generator skitty he thought at her as hard as he could skitty you have to get away from here theyre trying to catch you there was no way skitty was going to be able to deal with those controls they were deliberately made difficult to handle just precisely because shipscats were known to be curious and how could she know what complicated series of things to do to take down the field anyway but skitty ignored him using her stubby raccoonlike hands on the controls of the generator and hissing in frustration when the controls would not cooperate finally with a muffled yowl of triumph she managed to twist the dial into the off position and the field went down dick was out the door in a moment but skitty was uncharacteristically running off ahead of him instead of waiting for him not that he minded she was safer on the ground in case someone spotted him and stunned him she was small and quick and if they caught him again she would still have a chance to hide and get away but there was something odd about her bounding run as if her body was a little longer than usual and her tail seemed to be a lot longer than he remembered never mind that get moving he scolded himself trying to recall where theyd set up all the coms and if any of them were translight skitty whisked ahead of him around a corner when he caught up with her she was already at work on the tanglefield generator in front of another door practice must have made perfect she got the field down just before he reached the doorway and shot down the hall like a streak of black lightning dick stopped inside was someone lying down on a cot arm over her dark mahogany head erica erica he hissed at her she sat bolt upright wincing as she did so and he felt a twinge of sympathy a stunmigraine was no picnic she saw who was at the door saw at the same moment that there was no tanglefield shimmer between them and was on her feet and out in a fraction of a second how she demanded scanning the corridor and finding it as curiously empty as dick had skitty took the generator offline he said she got yours too and she headed off that way he pointed towards the heart of the building do you remember where the translight coms are eyeah she said in the basement if we can get there thats the emergency unit and i dont think they know weve got it she cocked her head to one side as if she had suddenly heard something he strained his earsand there was a clamor off in the distance beyond the walls of the building it sounded as if several people were chasing something but it couldnt have been skitty she was still in the building it sounds like theyre busy erica said and grinned lets go while we have the chance but before they reached the basement com room they were joined by most of the crew of the brightwing some of whom had armed themselves with whatever might serve as a weapon all of them told the same story about how the shipscat had taken down their tanglefields and fled once in the basement of the buildingafter scattering the multiple nests of kreshta that had moved right inthe com officer took over while the rest of them found whatever they could to make a barricade and dick related what he had learned and what his surmises were power controls were all down here there would be no way short of blowing the building up for the tristar goons to cut power to the com now all they needed was timetime to get their message out and wait for the patrol to answer but time just might be in very short supply dick told himself as he grabbed a sheet of reflective insulation to use as a crude stunshield and as if in answer to that just as the com officer got the link warmed up and began to send erica called out from the staircase front and centerhere they come dick slumped down so that the tiny medic could reach his head to bandage it he knew he looked like hed been through a war but either the feeling of elated triumph or the medics drugs or both prevented him from really feeling any of his injuries in the end it had come down to the crudest of handtohand combat on the staircase as the com officer resent the message as many times as he could and the rest of them held off the tristar bullies he could only thank the spirits of space that they had no weapons stronger than stunnersor at least they hadnt wanted to use them down in the basement where so many circuits lay bare eventually of course they had been overwhelmed but by then it was too late the com officer had gotten a reply from the patrol help was on the way faced with the collapse of their plan the tristar people had done the only wise thing they had retreated with them they had taken all evidence that they were from tristar there was no way of proving who and what they were unless the patrol corvette now on the way in could intercept them and capture them contrary to what the gray man had thought erica had recognized none of her captors but right now none of that mattered what did matter was that they had come through thisand that skitty had finally reappeared as soon as the tristar ship blasted out to take her accustomed place on dicks shoulders purring for all she was worth and interfering with the medics work dick vena called from the door to the medics office i found your dick looked up vena was cradling skitty in her arms but skitty was already on his shoulders she must have looked just as stunned as he did but he recovered first doing a doubletake his skitty was the one on her usual perchvenas skitty was a little thinner a little taller and most definitely had a lot longer tail is prrreet skitty said with satisfaction handsome no is bred for being patrolcat warcat vena whats the tattoo inside that cats ear he asked urgently she checked fx she said and a serial number but the x designation is for experimental isnt it uhyeah he got up ignoring the medic and came to look at the new cat venas stranger also had much more humanlike hands than his skitty suddenly the mystery of how the cat had managed to manipulate the tanglefield controls was solved shoot he might even have been trained to do that yes skitty said simply i go play catchmestupid he open humancages he hear of me on station come to see me be mate i think i keep him dick closed his eyes for a moment somewhere there was a frantic biotech station trying to figure out where one of their experimentals had gone he should turn the cat over to them no skitty said positively no look is deaf one ear is pet run away find me he uhmust have come in as an extra with that shipment dick improvised quickly i found an extra invoice i just thought theyd made a mistake hes deaf in one ear thats why they washed him out i uhi suppose brightwing could keep him i was kind of hoping i could vena began and flushed lowering her eyes i suppose i still could after this the embassy is going to have to have a full staff with patrol guards and a real consul they wont need me anymore dick began to grin as he realized what vena was saying well he will need a handler and i have all i can do to take care of this skitty courting skitty asked slyly reaching out to lick one of prrreets ears this time dick did not bother to deny it scat noooooowowowow the metal walls of dicks tiny cabin vibrated with the howl dick white ignored it as he injected the last of the four contraceptionbeads into skittys left hind leg the blackcoated shipscat did not move but she did continue her vocal and mental protest mean she complained as dick held the scanner over the right spot to make certain that he had gotten the bead placed where it was supposed to go mean mean dick indignation showing in every line of her she sat up on his folddown desk and licked the injection site it hadnt hurt he knew it hadnt hurt for hed tried it on himself with a neutral bead before he injected her nice nice dick you should be saying he chided her one more unauthorized litter and biotech would be coming to take you away for their breeding program youre too fertile for your own good skittys token whine turned into a real yowl of protest and her mate now dubbed scat joined her in the wail from his seat on dicks bunk not leave dick skitty shrilled in his head not leave ship then no more kittensat least not for a while he responded no more kittens means skitty and scat stay with dick skitty leapt to join her mate on the bunk where both of them began washing each other to demonstrate their distress over the idea of leaving dick skittys real name was lady sundancer of greenfields and she was the proud product of biotechs masterful genesplicing shipscats those sturdy valiant hunters of vermin of every species betrayed their differences from terran felines in a number of ways biotech had given them the hands of a raccoon the speed of a mongoose the ability to adjust to rapid changes in gravity or no gravity at all and greatly enhanced mental capacity what they did not know was that lady sundanceraka dick whites kitty or skitty for shorthad another invisible enhancement she was telepathicat least with dick thanks to skitty and to her last litter the catseye company trading ship brightwing was one of the most prosperous in this end of the galaxy that was due entirely to skittys hunting ability she had taken swift vengeance when a persistent pest native to the newlyopened world of lacuun had bitten the consort of the ruler killing with a single blow a creature the natives had never been able to exterminate that and her own charming personality had made her kittenstobe most desirable acquisitions so precious that not even the leaders of lacuun owned them they were held in trust for the world thanks to the existence of that litter and the need to get them appropriately pedigreed biotech mates skittys own matecalled prrreet by skitty and unsurprisingly dubbed scat by the crew for his ability to vanishhad made his own way to skitty stowing aboard with the crates containing more biotech kittens for lacuun where he came from only he knew although he was definitely a shipscat his tattoo didnt match anything in the biotech register too dignified to be called a kitty this handsome male was dick whites cat and thanks to scats timely arrival and intervention an attempt to kill the entire crew of the brightwing and the terran consul to lacuun in order to take over the trading concession had been unsuccessful scat had disabled critical equipment holding them all imprisoned so that they were able to get to a com station to call for help from the patrol while skitty had distracted the guards scat had never demonstrated telepathic powers with dick for which dick was grateful but he certainly possessed something of the sort with skitty and he was odd in other ways dick would have been willing to take an oath that scats forepaws were even more handlike than skittys and that his tail showed some signs of being prehensile there were other secrets locked in that wide blackfurred skull and dick only wished he had access to them dick was worried for the brightwing was in space again and heading towards one of the major stations with the results of their yearlong trading endeavor with the beings of lacuun in their hold shipscats simply did not come out of nowhere biotech kept very tight control over them denying them to ships or captains with a record of even the slightest abuse or neglect and keeping track of where every one of them was from birth to death they were expensivetraders running on the edge could not afford them and had to rid themselves of vermin with periodic vacuumpurges skitty claimed that her mate had heard about her and had come specifically to find herbut she would not say from where scat had to come from somewhere and wherever that was someone from there was probably looking for him they would very likely take a dim view of their fourlegged romeo heading off on his own in search of his juliet any attempt to question the tom through skitty was useless scat would simply stare at him with those luminous yellow eyes then yawn and skitty would soon grow bored with the proceedings after all to her the important thing was that scat was here not where he had come from behind dick in the open door of the cabin someone coughed he turned to find captain singh regarding dick and cats with a jaundiced eye dick saluted hastily sircontraceptive devices in place and verified sir he affirmed holding up the injector to prove it the captain a darkly handsome gentleman as popular with the females of his own species as scat undoubtably was with felines merely nodded we have a problem white he pointed out the brightwings manifest shows one shipscat not two and we still dont know where number two came from i know what will happen if we try to take skittys mate away from her but i also know what will happen if anyone finds out we have a second cat origin unknown biotech will take a dim view of this dick had been thinking at least part of this through we can hide him sir he offered at least until i can find out where he came from oh captain singhs eyebrows rose just how do you propose to hide him and where dick grinned in plain sight sir look at themunless you have them sidebyside you wouldnt be able to tell which one you had in front of you theyre both black with yellow eyes and its only when you can see the size difference and the longer tail on scat that you can tell them apart so we simply make sure theyre never in the same compartment while strangers are aboard the captain hazarded that actually has some merit the spirits of space know that people are always claiming shipscats can teleport no one will even notice the difference if we dont say anything and theyll just think shes getting around by way of the access tubes how do you intend to find out where this one came from without making people wonder why youre asking about a stray cat dick was rather pleased with himself for he had actually thought of this solution first skitty is fertileunlike ninetenths of the shipscats that is why we had kittens to offer the lacuun in the first place and was why we have the profit we do even after buying the contracts of the other young cats for groundside duty as the kittens mates the captain made a faint grimace youre stating the obvious humor me sir did you know that biotech routinely offers their breeding cats free choice in mates that otherwise they dont breed well as the captain shook his head dick pulled out his trump card i amostensiblygoing to do the same for skitty as long as we find her a biotech mate that she approves of biotech will be happy and we need more kittens for the lacuun we have no reason to buy them when we have a potential breeder of our own but we got mates for her kittens the captain protested wont biotech think theres something odd going on dick shook his head youre thinking of housecats shipscats arent fertile until theyre four or five at that rate the kittens wont be old enough to breed for four years and the lacuun are going to want more cats before then so ill be searching the biotech breeding records for a tom of the right age and appearance solid black is recessivethere cant be that many black toms of the right age and once youve found your group of candidates singh asked both eyebrows arching you look for the one thats missing he did not ask how dick was supposed to have found out that skitty preferred a black tom shipscats were more than intelligent enough to choose a color from a set of holos dick shrugged the information may be in the records once i know where scats from we can open negotiations to add him to our manifest with biotechs backing they wont pass up a chance to make skitty half of a breeding pair and i dont think theres a captain willing to go on biotechs record as opposing a shipscats choice of mate i wont ask how you intend to make that particular project work singh said hastily just remember no more kittens in freefall dick held up the nowempty injector as a silent promise ill brief the crew to refer to both cats as skittymost of the time they do anyway the captain said carry on white you seem to have the situation well in hand dick was nowhere near that certain but he put on a confident expression for the captain he saluted singhs retreating back then sat down on the bunk beside the pair of purring cats as usual they were wound around each other in a knot of happiness i wish my lovelife was going that well hed hit it off with the terran consul well enough but she had elected to remain in her groundbound position and his life was with the ship once again romance took a second place to careers which in his case meant no romance there wasnt a single female in this crew that had shown anything other than strictly platonic interest in him if he wanted a career in space he had to be very careful about what he did and said as most junior officer on the brightwing he was the one usually chosen for whatever unpleasant duty no one else wanted to handle and although he could actually retire thanks to the prosperity that the lacuun contract had brought the whole crew he didnt want to that would mean leaving space leaving the shipand leaving skitty and scat he could also transfer within the company but why change from a crew full of people he liked and respected with a good captain like singh to one about which he knew nothing that would be stupid and he couldnt leave skitty no matter what she was his best friend even if she did get him into trouble sometimes he also didnt have the experience to be anything other than the most junior officer in any ship so transferring wouldnt have any benefits unless of course he parlayed his profitshare into a small fortune and bought his own ship then he could be captain and he might even be able to buy skittys contractbut he lacked the experience that made the difference between prosperity and bankruptcy in the shaky world of the free traders he was wise enough to know this as for the breeding projecthe had some ideas the brightwing would be visiting lacuun for a minimum of three weeks on every round of their tradingroute surely something could be worked out things didnt get chancy until after the kittens were mobile and before skitty pottytrained them to use crew facilities before they were able to leave the nestbox skitty took care of the unpleasant details if they could arrange things so that the period of mobilitytoweaning took place while they were on lacuun well hed make that jump when the coordinates came up right now he had to keep outsiders from discovering that there was feline contraband on board and find out where that contraband came from dick smart skitty purred proudly dick fix everything well he thought wryly at least i have her confidence if noone elses it had been a long time since the brightwing had been docked at a major port and predictably everyone wanted shore leave everyone except dick that is he had no intentions of leaving the console in cargo where he was doing his matehunting unless and until he found his match the fact that there was nothing but a skeleton crew aboard once the inspectors left only made it easier for dick to run his searches through the biotech database available through the station this database was part of the public records kept on every station and updated weekly by biotech dick had a notion that hed get his hit within a few hours of initiating his search he was pleasantly surprised to discover that there were portraits available for every entry it might even be possible to identify scat just from the portraits once he had all of the black males of the appropriate age sorted out that would give him even more rationale for the claim that skitty had chosen her mate herself with an interested feline perching on each arm of the chair he logged into the stations databases identified himself and gave the station his billing information then began his run there was nothing to do at that point but sit back and wait i hope you realize all of the difficulties im going through for you he told the tom who was grooming his face thoughtfully im doing without shoreleave to help you here i wouldnt do this for a fellow human scat paused in his grooming long enough to rasp dicks hand with his dampsandpaper tongue the computer beeped just at that moment to let him know it was done he was running all this through the cargo dumbset he could have used the brightwings expertsystem ai but he didnt want the ai to get curious and he didnt want someone wondering why he was using a megabrain to access feline familytrees what he did want was the appearance that this was a brainstorm of his own an attempt to boost his standing with his captain by providing further negotiable items for the lacuun contract there was something odd about all of this something that he couldnt put his finger on but something that just felt wrong and made him want to be extracautious why he didnt know he only knew that he didnt want to set off any telltales by acting as if this matesearch was a priority item the computer asked if he wanted to use the holotable a tiny square platform built into the upper right hand corner of the desk he cleared off a stack of hardcopy manifests and told it yes then the first of his feline biographies came in hed made a guess that scat was between five and ten years old shipscats lived to be fifty or more but their useful lifespan was about twenty or thirty years all too often their job was hazardous alien vermin had poisonous fangs or stings sharp claws and teeth cats suffered disabling injuries more often than their human crewmates and would be retired with honors to the homes of retired spacers or to the big assisted living stations holding the very aged and those with disabling injuries of their own shipscats were always welcome anywhere in space and i can think of worse fates than spending my old age watching the stars with skitty on my lap he gazed down fondly at his furred friend and rubbed her ears skitty purred and butted her head into his hand she paid very little attention to the holos as they passed slowly in review scat was right up on the desk however not only staring intently at the holos but splitting his attention between the holos and the screen you dont suppose he can read suddenly scat let out a yowl and swatted the holoplate dick froze the image and the screenbiography that accompanied it he looked first at the holoand it certainly looked more like scat than any of the others had but scats attention was on the screen not the holo and he stared fixedly at the modest insignia in the bottom right corner patrol he looked down at scat dumbfounded you were with the patrol he whispered it you did not invoke the patrols name aloud unless you wanted a visit from them yellow eyes met his for a moment then the paw tapped the screen he read further type mf designation lightfoot of sun meadow patrol id fx standard military genotype standard military training well that explained how he had known how to shut down the pirate equipment now dick wondered how much else the cat had done outside of his sight and a military genotype he hadnt even known there was such a thing assigned to patrol ship dia out of oklahoma station designated handler major logan greene oklahoma stationthat was this station drug interdiction he whistled softly then a date followed by the ominous words ship missing all aboard presumed dead all aboardexcept the shipscat the cat himself gave a mournful yowl and skitty jumped up on the desk to press herself against him comfortingly he looked back down at scat did you jump ship before they went missing he wasnt certain he would get an answer but he had lived with skitty for too long to underestimate shipscat intelligence the cat shook his head slowly and deliberatelyin the negative his mouth went dry are you sayingyou got away a definite nod your ship was boarded and you got away he was astonished but how for an answer the cat jumped down off the desk and walked over to the little escape pod that neither he nor skitty ever forgot to drag with them he seized the tether in his teeth and dragged it over to an access tube it barely fit he wedged it down out of sight then pawed open the door and dropped down hidden and now completely protected from what must have happened he popped back out again and walked to dicks feet dick was thinking furiously there had been rumors that drugsmugglers were using captured patrol ships this moreorless confirmed those rumors disable the ship take the exterior airlock and blow it whoever wasnt suited up would die then they board and finish off whoever was suited up they patch the lock restore the air and weld enough junk to the outside of the ship to disguise it completely then they can bring it in to any port they care toeven the ships home port this station which is where scat escaped can you identify the attackers he asked scat the cat slowly nodded they know he gone he run they chase he try get home they stop he hear of me on dock go hide in ship bringing mates they kill he get chance skitty put in helpfully he could picture it easily enough scat being pursued cut off from the patrol section of the stationhiding out on the dockscatching the scent of the mates being shipped for skittys kittens and deciding to seek safety offworld cats even shipscats did not tend to grasp the concept of duty he knew from dealing with skitty that she took her bonds of personal affection seriously but little else so once his people were dead scats personal allegiance to the patrol was nonexistent and his primary drive would be selfpreservation wonderful i wonder if theywhoever they arefigured out he got away on another ship another more alarming thought occurred to him i wonder if my fishing about in the biotech database touched off any telltales no matter there was only one place to go nowstraight to erica makumba the legal and security officer he dumped a copy of the pertinent datafile to a memory cube then scooped up both cats and pried their lifesupport ball out of its hiding place then he ran for ericas cabin praying that she had not gone off on shoreleave the spirits of space were with him the indicator outside her cabin door indicated that she was in there but did not want to be disturbed he pounded on the door anyway erica might kill himbut there were people after scat who had murdered an entire patrol dia squad after a moment the door cracked open a centimeter white ericas flat expressionless voice boded extreme violence this had better be an emergency he said the one word that would guarantee her attention hijackers the door snapped open she grabbed him and pulled him inside cats supportball and all and slammed the door shut behind him she was wearing a short robe tying it hastily around herself and she wasnt alone but the man watching them both alertly from the disheveled bed wasnt one of the brightwings crew so dick flushed but tried to ignore him i found out where scats from he babbled dropping one cat to hand the memorycube to her read thatquick she punched up the console at her elbow and dropped the cube in the receiver the biotech file minus the holo scrolled up on the screen the man in the bed leaned forward to read it too and whistled erica swiveled to glare at him you keep this to yourself jay she snapped then she turned back to dick spill it she ordered scats ship was hijacked probably by smugglers he said quickly he hid his supportball in an access tube and he was in it when they blew the lock they missed him in the sweep and when they brought their prize in here he got away but they know hes gone and they know he can id them and theyll be giving the hairy eyeball to every ship with a black cat on it she bit her knuckleand jay added his own two credits worth i hate to say this but theyve probably got a telltale on the biotech data files so they know whenever anyone accesses them its not restricted data so anyone could leave a telltale the mans face was pale beneath his normally dusky skintone if they dont know youve gone looking by now they will shortly they all looked at each other whos still on board dick asked and gulped ericas mouth formed a tight thin line you me jay and the cats the cargos offloaded and regs say you dont need more than two crew on board instation theoretically no one can get past the security at the lock jay barked a laugh and tossed long dark hair out of his eyes honey im a comptech trust me you can get past the security you just hack into the system tell it the ship in the bay is bigger than it really is and upload whoever you want as additional personnel erica sworebut jay stood up wrapping the sheet around himself like a toga and pushed her gently aside what can be hacked can be unhackedor at least i can make it a lot more difficult for them to get in and make those alterations stick give me your code to the ai erica hesitated he turned to stare into her eyes i need the ais help you two and the cats are going to get out of hereget over to the patrol side of the station im going to hold them off as long as i can and play stupid when they do get in but i need the speed of the ai to help me lay traps youve known me for three years you trusted me enough to bring me here didnt you she swore again then reached past him to key in her code he sat down ignoring them and plunging straight into a trance of concentration come on erica grabbed dicks arm and put the supportball on the floor skitty and scat must have been reading her mind for they both squirmed into the ball which was big enough for more than one cat theyd upgraded the ball after skitty had proved to be sofertile erica shoved the ball at dick and kept hold of his arm pulling him out into the corridor where are we going he asked to get our suits then to the emergency lock she replied crisply if we try to go out the main lock into the station theyll get us for certain so were going outside for a little walk a little walk all the way around the station outside he could only hope that they hadnt thought of that as well they reached the suitingup room in seconds flat he averted his eyes and climbed into his own suit as erica shed her robe and squirmed into hers how far is it to the patrol section he asked not as far as you think she told him and theres a maintenance lock just this side of it what i want to know is how you got all this detailed information about the hijacking he turned and saw that she was suited up with her faceplate still open staring at him with a calculating expression this is probably not the time to hold out on her he swallowed and sealed his suit up leaving his own faceplate open inside the ball the cats were watching both of them heads swiveling to look from one face to the other as if they were watching a tennismatch skittys telepathic with me he admitted i think scats telepathic with her she seems to be able to talk with him anyway he waited for erica to react either with disbelief or with revulsion telepaths of any species were not always popular among humankind but erica just pursed her lips and nodded eyeah i thought she might be and telepathys one of the traits biotech doesnt talk about but security people have know for a while that the mf type cats are bred for it maybe skittys momma did a little wandering over on the miltech side of the cattery hmm skitty made a silent meow and he just shrugged relieved that erica wasnt phobic about it and equally relieved to learn that telepathy was already a trait that biotech had established in their shipscat lines so they wont be coming to take skitty away from me when they find out that shes a path but right now hed better be worrying about making a successful escape he pulled his faceplate down and sealed it fastening the tetherline of the ball to a snaplink on his waistband he warmed up his suitradio and she did the same i hope you know what youre getting us into he said as erica sealed her own plate shut and led the way to the emergency lock she looked back over her shoulder at him so do i she replied soberly the trip was a nightmare dick had never done a spacewalk on the exterior of a station before it wasnt at all like going out on the hull of a ship there were hundreds of obstacles to avoidwindows antenna instrumentpackages maintenance robots any time an inspection drone came along they had to hide to avoid being picked up on camera it was work hard work to inch their way along the station in this way and dick was sweating freely before a half an hour was up it seemed like longer every time he glanced up at the chronometer in his faceplate hud he was shocked to see how little time had passed the suitfans whined in his ears as the lifesupport system alternately fought to warm him up when they hid in the shade or cool him down when they paused in full sunlight stars burned down on them silent points of light in a depth of darkness that made him dizzy whenever he glanced out at it the knowledge that he could be lost forever out there if he just made one small mistake chilled his heart finally erica pointed and he saw the outline of a maintenance lock just ahead the two of them pulled themselves handoverhand toward it reaching it at the same instant but it was erica who opened it while dick reeled the cats in on their tether with all four of them inside erica sealed the lock from the inside and initiated pressurization within moments they were both able to pop their faceplates and breathe stationair again something prompted dick to release the cats from their ball before erica unsealed the inner hatch he unsnapped the tether and was actually straightening up empty ball in both hands when erica opened the door to a hallway and dropped to the floor as the shrill squeal of a stungun pierced the quiet of the lock erica without thinking he ran forward and found himself facing the businessend of a powerful stunner held by a nondescript man who held it as if he was quite used to employing it he was not wearing a stationuniform the man looked startled to see him and dick did the only thing he could think of he threw the supportball at the man as hard as he could it hit cleanly knocking the man to the floor as it impacted with his chest he clearly was not aware that the supportballs were as massy as they were the two cats flashed past him heading for freedom and dick tried to follow their example but the man was quick to recover and as dick tried to jump over his prone body the fellow grabbed his ankle and tripped him up then it turned into a brawl with dick the definite underdog even in the suit the stranger still outweighed him within a few seconds dick was on his back on the floor and the stranger held him down easily the stungun was no longer in his hands but it didnt look to dick as if he really needed it in fact as the mans heavy fist pounded into dicks face he was quickly convinced that he didnt need it pain lanced through his jaw as the mans fist smashed into it his vision filled with stars and red and white flashes of light more agony burst into his skull as the blows continued he flailed his arms and legs but there was nothing he could dohe was trapped in the suit and he couldnt even get enough leverage to defend himself he tasted blood in his mouthhe couldnt see bad man there was a terrible battlescreech from somewhere out in the corridor and the blows stopped then the weight lifted from his body as the man howled in pain dick managed to roll to one side and stagger blindly to his feet with the aid of the corridor bulkheadhe still couldnt see he dashed blood out of his eyes with one hand and shook his head to clear it staring blindly in the direction of the unholy row get it off get it off me human screams mixed with feline battlecries telling him that whichever of the cats had attacked they were giving a good accounting of themselves but there were other soundsthe sounds of running feet approaching and dick tried frantically to get his vision to clear a heavy body crashed into him knocking him into the bulkhead with enough force to drive all the breath from his body as the zing of an illegal neurogun went off somewhere near him skitty but whoever was firing swore and the catwail faded into the distance it got away said one voice over the sobbing of another a third swore as dick fought for air you go after it the third man said and there was the sound of running feet meanwhile footsteps neared where dick lay curled in a fetal bundle on the floor what about this the second voice asked the third voice cold and unemotional wrote dicks death warrant get rid of it and the woman too and dick could not even move he heard someone breathing heavily just above him sensed the man taking aim then patrol freeze drop your weapons now something clattered to the deck beside him as more running feet approached and with a sob of relief dick finally drew a full breath there was a scuffle just beside him then someone helped him to stand and he heard the hiss of a hypospray and felt the telltale sting against the side of his neck a moment later his eyes clearedjust in time for him to catch skitty as she launched herself from the arms of a uniformed dia officer into his embrace so the bottom line is youll let us take scats contract captain singh sat back in his chair while dick rubbed skittys ears she and scat both burdened dicks lap as they had since scat the captain the dia negotiator and erica had all walked into the sickbay where dick was still recovering erica was clearly nursing a stunheadache the captain looked a little frazzled the dia man as most of his ilk looked as unemotional as an android the dia had spent many hours with a humanfeline telepathic specialist debriefing scat apparently scat was naturally only a receptive telepath it took a human who was also a telepath to talk to him theres no reason why not the dia agent said you civilians have helped materially in this case both you and he are entitled to certain compensation and if thats what you all want then hes yours with our blessingthe fact that he is only a receptive telepath makes him less than optimal for further patrol duties the agent shrugged we can always get other shipscats with full abilities according to the records the only reason we kept him was because major logan selected him skitty bristled and dick sent soothing thoughts at her then the agent smiled making his face look more human major logan was a good agent but he didnt particularly care for having a cat talking to him i gather that lightfoot and he got along all right but there wasnt the strong bond between them that we would have preferred it would have been just a matter of time before that squad and ship got a new catagent team besides we arent completely inhuman if your skitty and this boy here are happily mated who and what in the patrol can possibly want to separate them judging by the furrows skitty left in that jackers face and scalp it isnt a good idea to get between her and someone she loves captain singh said dryly hes lucky she left him one eye the agents gaze dropped briefly to the swath of black fur draped over dicks lap believe me he said fervently that is a consideration we had taken into account your little lady there is a warrior for fair and we have no intention of denying her anything her heart is set on if she wants lightfoot and he wants her then shes got him well see his contract is transferred over to brightwing within the hour his eyes rose to meet dicks youre a lucky man to have a friend like her young man she put herself between you and certain death dont you ever forget it skittys purr deepened and scats joined with hers as dicks hands dropped protectively on their backs i know that sir he replied through swollen lips i knew it before any of this happened skitty turned her head and he gazed into amused yellow eyes smart dick she purred then lowered her head to her paws smart man mate happy here mate stay everything good love you and that as far as skitty was concerned was the end of it the rest were simply minor human matters he chuckled and turned his own attention to dealing with those minor human matters while his best friend and her mate drifted into wellearned sleep a better mousetrap if there was one thing that dick white had learned in all his time as supercargo of the catseye company free trader brightwing it was that having a cat purring in your ear practically forced you to relax the extremely comfortable formmolding chair he sat in made it impossible to feel anything but comfortable and warm black fur muffled both of dick whites ears a steady vibration massaging his neck build a better mousetrap and the world will beat a path to your door dick said idly as scat poured himself like a second fluid black rug over the bluegrey of his lap it was skitty who was curled up around his shoulders vibrating contentedly in what dick called her subsonic purrmode while her mate took it as his responsibility to make sure there was plenty of shed hair on the legs of his grey shipsuit uniform what asked terran ambassador vena ferducci looking up from the list of lacuun nobles petitioning for one of skittys latest litter the petite darkhaired woman sat in a less comfortable metal chair behind a stone desk which stood next to a metal rack stuffed with archaic rolled paper documents the lacuun had not yet devised the science of filing paperwork in multiples yet which made them ultracivilised in venas opinion this her office in the palace of the lacuara and lacuteveras was not often used for that very reason when she dealt with terran bureaucracy she needed every electronic helper she could get the list she perused was very long and made rather cumbersome due to the lacuun custom of presenting all official courtdocuments in the form of a massively ornamented yellowparchment scroll with case and end caps of engraved bronze and illuminated capitalinitials dick had a notion that somewhere in the universe there probably was a collector of handwritten documents who would pay a small fortune for it but when every petitioner on the list had been satisfied it would probably be sent to the underclerks scraped clean and reused its an old terran folksaying dick elaborated and gestured to the list by way of explanation one which certainly seems to be borne out by our present situation yes well given the length of this list were doubly fortunate that skitty and scat are soahfertile and that biotech is willing to send us their shipscat washouts vena stretched out her hand towards scats head and the huge black tom cooperated by craning his neck towards her even before her fingers contacted his fur scat was purring loudly giving dick an uncannily similar sensation to being strapped in while the ship he served was under full power dick white could well be one of the wealthiest supercargoes in the history of spacetradehis share of the profits from catseye companys lucrative trade with the lacuun amounted to quite a tidy sum it wasnt enough to buy and outfit his own shipyetbut if trade progressed as it had begun there was the promise that one day it would be not that i want my own ship yet he told himself not until i know as much as captain singh there are easier ways to commit suicide than pretending i know enough to command a starship when all i really know is how to run the cargo hold not that captain singh would let him take his profitshare and do something so stupid dick grinned to himself imagining the captains face if he showed up in the office with that kind of harebrained proposal captain singhs expression would be one to beholdfollowing which dick would probably find himself stunned unconscious and wake under the solicitous attentions of a concerned headshrinker the captain had been willing even more than willing to let dick stay onplanet for few terranmonths though after skitty and scat announced the advent of a littertobe one of her last litter was coopted to serve as shipscat pro tem while dick and his two charges waited out the delivery maturation and weaning of eight little black furballs who were if that was possible even cuter than the last batch it was a good thing that they all were onplanet too because the octet managed to get themselves into a hundred times more mischief than the previous lot the trouble is they have a lot of energy absolutely no sense and no fear at all at this age brainless kitten antics rapidly begin to pall when youve fished a wailing fuzzmote out of the comconsole for the fifteenth time in a single shift but every lacuun in the palace from the lacuteveras down to the lowliest scullerylad was thrilled to the toesor rather clawsto play with rescue and cuddle the bratlings if skitty and scat had not taken their duties as parents palaceguardians and rolemodels so seriously they wouldnt have had to do anything but lie about and wait for the kittens to be carried in to them for feeding fortunately for all concerned their parents had powerful senses of responsibility towards their offspring both cats were born and bredliterallyfor duty yes they were cats with a cats sense of independence and contrariness but they took duty very very seriously and their duty was vermin control this was a duty that went back centuries to the very beginnings of the association of man and cat but until biotech developed shipscats never had a feline been better suited to or more cooperative in the execution of that duty furthermore dick now knew what few others didthat the shipscats so necessary to the safety of traders and their ships were actually a highly profitable byproduct of other research secret research designed to give the men and women of the patrol uniquely clever comradesinarms these genetically altered cats were not just clever it was not just that they had forepaws modeled after the forepaws of raccoonsoh no that was not enough patrol cats were telepaths scat had been a patrol catbut although he could understand the thoughts of humans he couldnt speak to them this was a flaw so far as the patrol was concerned though not an insurmountable flaw however when criminals took over the ship he served on and killed all of those aboard scat was the only survivor and the only witnessunable to call for help or relate what he had witnessed he had sought for help from his own kind and found it in skitty when the same criminals learned scat was still alive and tried to eliminate him and the crew of the free trader ship brightwing for good measure it had been dicks research and deductive reasoning that had learned the truth in time and with scats and skittys help he had foiled the plot as for skitty she was something of an aberration herselfordinary shipscats were not supposed to be telepathic or fertile she was both as far as dick could tell she was telepathic only with himthough given that she was all cat with a cats puckish sense of humor she might well choose not to let him know she could speak to others everyone on the ship knew she was fertile thoughwhen they had first come to the world of the lacuun shed already had one litter and was pregnant with another that first litterborn and raised in the shiphad shown just what kind of a nightmare two loose kittens could be within the close confines of a spaceship dick had not been looking forward to telling captain singh of the second litter when skitty had solved the problem for them the lacuun a race of goldenskinned vaguely reptilian anthropoids suffered from the depredations of a particularly voracious fast and apparently indestructible pest called kreshta the only way to keep them from taking over completely was to lock anything edible and the creature could eat practically anything in airtight containers of metal glass ceramic or stone and build only in materials the pest couldnt eat the pests did keep the streets so clean that they sparkled and there was no such thing as a trash problem but those were the only benefits to the plague the lacuun had just opened their planet to trade from outside and the brightwing was one of several ships that had arrived to represent either themselves or one of the large companies only captain singh had the foresight to include skitty in their delegation however for only he had bothered to research the lacuun thoroughly enough to learn that they placed great value on totemic animals and had virtually nothing in the way of domesticated predators themselves he reckoned that a tame predator would be very impressive to them and he was right skitty had been on her best behavior charming them all and taking to this alien race immediately the lacuteveras the female coruler had been particularly charmed so much so that she had missed the presence of one of the little pests which had bitten her enraged at this attack on someone she favored skitty had killed the creature for the lacuun this was nothing short of a miracle the end of a scourge that had been with them since the beginning of their civilization after that moment there was no question of anyone else getting mostfavored trading status with the lacuun ever catseye got the plum contract skittys kittenstobe got immediate homes and dick whites life became incredibly complicated since then he was no longer just an apprentice supercargo and designated shipscat handler on a small free trader ship hed been imprisoned by company goons stalked and beaten within an inch of his life by coldblooded murderous hijackers and had to face the patrol itself to bargain for scats freedom hed had enough adventure in two short standardyears to last most people for the rest of their lives but all that was in the past or so he hoped for a while anyway it would be nice if the most difficult decision i had to make would be which of the lacuun nobles get skittybabies and which have to make do with shipscat washouts those washouts were mature cats that for one reason or another couldnt adapt to ship life gengineering wasnt perfect even now there were cats that couldnt handle freefall cats that were claustrophobes cats that were shy or antisocial those had the opportunity to come here to join the verminhunting crew thus far thirty had made the trip some to become mates for the first litter others to take up solitary residence with a noble family there were other washouts who didnt pass the intelligence tests but those were never offered to the lacuunthey already filled a steady need for companions in childrens hospitals and retirement homes where the high shipscat intelligence wasnt needed just a loving friend smart enough to understand what not to do around someone sick or in pain there were still far more lacuun who urgently craved the boon of a cat than there were cats to fill the need thus far none of skittys female offspring had carried that rare gene for fertilitywhen one did that one would go back to biotech to be treated like the precious object she was pampered and amused asked to breed only so often as she chose there was always a tradeoff in any gengineering effort lack of fertility was a small price to pay in a species as notoriously prolific as cats meanwhile the proud parents were in the last stages of educating their current offspring there was a pile of the dead vermin just in front of venas desk every so often one of the halfgrown kittens would bring another to add to the pile then sit politely and wait for his parents to approve sometimes when the pest was particularly large scat would descend from dicks lap with immense dignity inspect the kill and bestow a rough lick by way of special reward dick couldnt keep track of how many pests each of the kittens had destroyed but from the size of the pile so far the parents had reason to be proud of their offspring the kittens certainly inherited their parents telepathic skills as well as their hunting skills for just as it occurred to dick that it was about time for them to be fed they scampered in from all available doorways in a moment they were neatly lined up eight identical pairs of yellow eyes staring avidly from eight little black faces beneath sixteen enormous ears at this age they seemed to consist mainly of eyes ears paws and tails the lacuun servant whose proud duty it was to feed the weanlings arrived with a bowl heaping with their imported food she was clothed in the simple silky draped tunic in the deep gold of the royal household the frilled crest running from the back of her neck to just above her eyeridge stood totally erect and was flushed to a deep salmoncolor with pleasure and pride she started to put the bowl on the floor and the kittens leapt to their feet and ran for the food but suddenly scat sprang from dicks lap every hair on end spitting and yowling he landed at the startled servants feet and did a complete flip over so that he faced his kittens as they skidded on the slick stone he growled and batted at them sending them flying scat vena shouted as she jumped to her feet horrified and angry what are you doing bad cat no hes not dick replied making a leap of his own for the food bowl and jerking it from the frightened servants hands he had already heard skittys frantic mental screech of bad food as she followed her mate off dicks shoulders to keep the kittens from the deadly bowl the foods poisoned dick added sniffing the puffy brown nodules suspiciously as the servant backed away the slits in her goldenbrown eyes so wide he could scarcely see the iris scat must have scented itthats probably one of the things patrol cats are trained in i cant tell the difference but as skitty held the kittens at bay he held the bowl down to scat who took a delicate sniff and backed away growling see venas expression darkened and she turned to the servant the food has been poisoned she said flatly who had access to it they both knew that shivari the servant was trustworthy she would sooner have thrown herself between the kittens and a ravening monster than see any hurt come to them she proved that now by her behavior her crestfrill flattened she turned bright yellowthe lacuun equivalent of turning paleand replied instantly i do not knowi got the bowl from the kitchen she grabbed venas hand and the two of them ran off with dick closely behind still carrying the bowl when they arrived at the kitchen vena and shivari cornered all the staff while dick blocked the exit he had a fair grasp of lacuun by now but vena and shivari were talking much too fast for him to get more than two words in four soon enough though vena turned away with anger and dissatisfaction on her face while shivari began a blistering harangue worthy of captain singh there was a new servant that no one recognized on staff this morning vena said in disgust obviously they were smart enough to keep him away from the food meant for people but no one thought anything of letting him open up the cat food into a bowl well they know better now dick replied grimly ill put the embassy on alertand give me that vena took the bowl from him ill have the marines run it through an analyzer embassy guards by long tradition were called marines although they were merely another branch of the patrol dick readily surrendered the poisoned food to vena knowing that if scat could smell a poison the forensic analyzer every embassy possessedjust in casewould easily be able to find it relations with the lacuun were important enough that vena had gone from being merely a trade advisor and titular consul to a fullscale ambassador with the attendant staff and amenities it was that promotion that had persuaded her to remain here instead of returning to her former position in the scouts dick himself went to the storage vault that held the imported catfood got a highlycompressed cube out and opened it over a freshly washed bowl the stuff puffed up to ten times its compressed size once it came into contact with air and humidity it would be impossible to tamper with the packages without a resulting explosion of food the entire feline family flowed into the kitchen as soon as his fingers touched the package the kittens swarmed around his legs mewling piteously but he offered the bowl for scats inspection before allowing them to engulf it his mind buzzed with questions but two were uppermostwho would have tried to poison the kittens and why scat and skitty herded their kittens along like a pair of attentive sheepdogs when theyd finished eating following behind dick as he left the palace heading for the embassy the marine at the entrance gave him a brisk nod of recognition saving her grin for the moving blackfurred flock behind him a second marine at a desk just inside skilled in the lacuun tongue served doubleduty as a receptionist the ambassador is expecting you sir he said she left orders for you to go straight in dick led his parade past the deska desk of cast marble reinforced with plastile which would serve very nicely as a blastandprojectileproof bunker at need the door to venas office a cleverly concealed blastdoor was slightly ajar it sensed his approach and opened fully for him after a retinal scan have you ever wondered why our peaceful hosts happen to field a battleready army vena asked him without even a preliminary greeting ah no i hadntbut now that you mention it it does seem odd dick took a seat cats pooling around his ankles as vena tossed her compuslate aside our hosts arent the sole representatives of their race on this dirtball vena replied with no expression that dick could see and now they finally get around to telling me this it seems that there is another nation entirely on this continentwe thought that it was just another fief of the lacuara and they never disabused us of that impression let me guessthe other side doesnt like terrans dick hazarded i wish it was that simple unfortunately the other side worships the kreshta as children of their prime deity vena couldnt quite repress a snarl kill one and youve got a holy war on your handsweve been slaughtering hundreds for better than two years the attempt on the octet was just the opening salvo for us heretics the chief minister has been here telling me all about it and falling all over himself in apology here she pulled a micro reader out of a drawer in her desk and tossed it to him my head of security advises that you commit this to memory what is it dick asked thumbing it on and seeing with some puzzlement the line drawing of a nude lacuun appear on the plate how to kill or disable a lacuun in five easy lessons as written by the patrol marines her face had gone back to that deadpan expression again lieutenant reynard thinks you might need it the prickling of claws set carefully into his clothing alerted him that one of the cats was swarming up to drape itself over his shoulders but somewhat to his surprise it wasnt skitty it was scat the tom peered at the screen in his hand with every evidence of fascinated concentration too he was patrol after all was his second thought after the initial surprise and on the heels of that thought he decided to hold the reader up so that scat could use the touch screen too it was easier to disable a lacuun than to kill one at least in hand to hand combat their throats were armored with bone plates their heads with amazingly thick skulls but there were vulnerable major nervepoints at all joints concentrated pinpoint pressure would paralyze everything from the joint down when applied there when dick figured he had the scanty contents by heart he tossed the reader back to vena though what he was supposed to do with the information was beyond him at the moment he wasnt exactly trained in anything but the most basic of selfdefensethat was more in erica makumbas line and she was several lightyears away at the moment the lacuun army has been alerted the palace has been put under tight security and the caretakers of the other cats have been warned about the poisoning attempt however the mysterious kitchenhelper got clean away so we can assume hell make another attempt my advisors and i would like to take him alive if we canweve got some plans that may abort this mess before it gets worse than it already is scats deepvoiced growl showed what he thought of that idea and vena lowered her smoldering dark eyes from dicks to the toms and smiled grimly id like to put a marine guard on the catsbut i know thats hardly possible vena continued as scat and skitty voiced identical snorts of disdain but lets walk back over to the palace and talk about what we can do on the way scat looked up at him and made an odd noise easy enough to interpret scat thinks he and skitty can guard the kittens well enough dick replied as vena waved him through the door a torrent of cats washing around his ankles im sure he does vena retorted but lets remember that hes only a cat however much his genes have been tweaked i hardly think hes capable of understanding the danger of the current situation he isnt just a cat he was a patrol cat dick pointed out but vena just shook her head at that dick we dont even know exactly what were intoall we know is that there was an attempt to poison the cats by an assassin that got away we dont know if it was a lone fanatic someone sent by our hosts enemies if theres only one or more than one she sighed as they reached the street were doing all the intelligence gathering we can but its difficult to manage when you dont look anything like the dominant species on the planet the street was empty which was fairly normal at this time of day when most lacuun were inside at their evening meal the sky of this world seemed a bit greenish to him but hed gotten used to ittoday there were some clouds that might mean rain or might not he didnt know very much about planetside weather scats squall was all the warning dick got to throw himself out of the way as something dark and fast whizzed through the place where hed been standing skitty and the kittens fairly flew back to the safety of the embassy scat whisked out of sight altogether a larger cloaked shape sprang from the shadows of a doorway and before dick managed to get halfway to his feet the greycloaked paleskinned lacuun seized vena and enveloped her holding a knife to her throat be still blasphemous shedemon it grated holding both venas arms pinned behind her back in a way that had to be excruciatingly painful she grimaced but said nothing and you father of demons be still also it snapped at dick i am the righteous hand of kreshkali the alldevouring the purifier i am the bringer of cleansing the anointed of god in his name and by his mercy i give you this choiceremove yourselves from our soil take yourselves back into the sky forever or you will die first you and your shedemon and your god killing pests then all of those who brought you its voice rose taking on the tones of a hellfireandbrimstone preacher kreshkali is the one the true god whose word is the only law and whose minions cleanse the world in his image his will shall not be flouted and his servants not denied it sounded like a wellrehearsed speech and probably would have gone on for some time had it not been interrupted by the speakers own scream of agony and small wonder for scat had crept up unseen even by dick until the instant he leapt for the assassins knifewielding wrist and fastened his teeth unerringly into those sensitive nerves at the joining of hand and wrist the knife clattered to the street vena twisted away and dick charged all at the same moment his shoulder hit the assassin and they both went down on the hard stone paving but not in a disorderly heap no by the time the marines came piling out of the embassy alerted by the frantic herd of cats dick had the miscreant facedown on the ground with both arms paralyzed from the shoulders down and miracle of miracles this time he wasnt the one battered and bruisedin fact he was intact beyond a few scrapes he wasnt taking any chances though he waited until the marines had all four limbs of the assassin in stasiscuffs before he got off his captive and surrendered him do we turn him over to the locals one of the marines asked vena diffidently not a chance she growled hustle him into the embassy before anyone asks any questions what are you going to do dick asked sotto voce following the marines and their cursing burden i told you weve got some ideasand a couple of experiments id rather try on this dirtbag rather than any lacuun volunteers was all she said leaving him singularly unsatisfied all he could be certain of was that she didnt plan to execute the assassin outofhand we caught him and weve got a chance to try those ideas out he continued to follow and was not prevented as vena led the way up the stairs to the embassy medlab the entire entourage of cats followed and vena not only let them she waved them all inside before shutting and locking the door the prisoner was strapped into a dental chair and gagged which at least put an end to the curses though not to the glares he cast at them but vena dropped down onto one knee and looked into skittys eyes i know youre a telepath skitty she said in terran can you project to anyone but dick could you project into our prisoners mind put your voice in his head skitty turned her head to look up at dick walls she complained dick has no walls for skitty she says hes got barriers dick interpreted i understand that most nontelepathic people have and its just an accident that the two of us are compatible i may be able to change that vena replied with a tight smile as she got to her feet skitty im going to do some things to this prisoner and i want you to tell me when the barriers are gone she turned to a cabinet and unlocked it inside were hypospray vials and she selected one weve been cooperating with the lacuun healers putting together drugs weve been developing for the lacuun she continued there are hypnotics that are proven to lower telepathic barriers in humans and i have a few that may do the same for the lacuun if they dont kill him that is she raised an eyebrow at dick you can see why we didnt want to test them even on volunteers but if the drugs kill him dick gulped then we save the lacuara the cost of an execution and we apologize that the prisoner expired from fear she replied smoothly dick gulped again this was a ruthless side of vena hed had no notion existed she placed the first hypo against the side of the prisoners neck the device hissed as it discharged its contents and the prisoners eyes widened with fear an hour later there were only two vials left in the cabinet vena had administered all the rest and their antidotes with sublime disregard for the strain this was probably putting on the prisoners body the effects of each had been duly noted but none of them produced the desired effect of lowering the barriers nontelepaths had against telepathic intrusion vena picked up the first of the last two and sighed if one of these doesnt work ill have to make a decision about giving him to the locals she said with what sounded like disappointment id really rather not do that dick didnt ask why but one of the two marines in the room with them must have seen the question in his eyes if the ambassador turns this fellow over to them theyll execute him and that might be enough to send cold war hostilities into a real blaze the young lieutenant muttered as vena administered the hypo and the word from the palace is that the other side is as advanced in atomic physics as our lot is in other words these are religious fanatics with a nuclear arsenal dick winced the terrans would be safe enough in a nuclear exchange and so would the bulk of citydwellers for the lacuun had mastered forceshield technology but in a nuclear exchange there were always accidents and as yet it wasnt possible to encase anything bigger than a city in a shield hed seen enough blasted lands never to wish a nucwar on anyone and certainly not on the decent folk here skitty watched the prisoner as she would a mouse his eyes unfocused when the drug took hold and this time she meowed with pleasure it didnt take dicks translation for vena to know that the prisoners telepathic barriers to skittys probing thoughts were gone excellent she exclaimed with relief all right little onewere going to leave the room until you send one of the kittens to come get us let him think weve lost interest in him for the moment then get into his head and convince him that he is a very very bad kitten and you are his mother and youre going to punish him unless he says hes sorry and he wont do it again make him think that you are so angry that you might kill him if he cant understand how bad hes been in fact any of you cats that can get into his head should do that then make him promise that hell always obey everything you tell him to and dont let up the pressure until he does skitty looked at vena as if she thought the human had gone crazy then sighed stupid she told dick privately but okay i do dick was as baffled as skitty was as he followed vena out into the hall leaving the cats with the prisoner just what is that going to accomplish he demanded she chuckled i rather doubt hes ever heard anyone speak in his mind before she pointed out not even his god now dick saw exactly what shed had in mindand stifled his bark of laughter hes going to be certain skittys more powerful than his god if she can do thatand if she treats him like a naughty child rather than an enemy to be destroyed exactly vena said with satisfaction this is what lieutenant reynard wanted me to try though we thought wed have to add halucinogens and a vr headset rather than getting right directly into his head my problem was finding a way to tell her to act like an allpowerful rebuking god in a way shed understand in the drugged state hes in now hell accept whatever happens as the truth so he wont threaten the cats anymorebut then what dick asked according to reynard the worst that will happen is that hell be convinced that this new god of his enemies is a lot more powerful and real than his own and thats the story hell take back home and the best dick inquired she shrugged he converts just what will that accomplish she paused and licked her lips unconsciously we ran some simulations based on what weve learned about lacuun psychology and projecting the rest from history historically the most fanatic followers of a new religion are the converts who were just as fanatical in their former religion in either case imagine the reaction when he returns home which he will and miraculously because well take a stealthed flitter and drop him over the border while hes drugged and unconscious hell probably figure out that we brought him but there wont be any sign of how imagine what his superiors will think the marine lieutenant standing diffidently at her elbow cleared his throat actually you dont have to guess he said respectfully as the ambassador mentioned weve been running a psychprofiles for possible contingencies and they agree with her educated assessment no matter what the fanatics will be too frightened of the power of this new god to hazard either a war or another assassination attempt and if we send back a converttheres a seventyfour point three percent chance hell end up starting his own crusade or even a holy war within their culture no matter what they cease to be a problem now that dick replied with feeling is really a better mousetrap the last of the season this is a very old story dating back at least ten years published in a shortlived magazine called american fantasy i doubt that many people had a chance to see it it was old enough that i felt it needed a bit of rewriting so although the general plot is the same its undergone a pretty extensive change they said on tv that her name was molly but jim already knew that they also said that she was eight years old but she didnt look eight more like six didnt look old enough to be in school even she didnt look anything like the picture theyd put up on the screen either the picture was at least a year old and done by some cutrate outfit for her school her hair was shorter her face rounder her expression so stiff she looked like a kiddummy there was nothing like the lively spark in her eyes or the naughty smile shed worn this afternoon the kid in the picture was so clean she squeaked where was the sticky popsicle residue on her face and hands the dirtsmudges on her knees jim lost interest as soon as the station cut away to the national news and turned the set off the remotecontrolled tv was the one luxury in his beige box of an apartment his carpet was the cheapest possible brown industrial crap the curtains on the picturewindow a drab stiff cheap polyester stuff backed with even cheaper vinyl that was seamed with cracks after less than a year he had one chair salvation army brown corduroy one lamp imitation brass from kmart one vinyl sofa bright orange st vincent de paul that was hard and uncomfortable and one coffeetable imitation spanish goodwill where the fancy color tv sat like a king on a peasants crude bench in the bedroom just beyond the closed door was his bedroom no better furnished than the livingroom he stored his clothing in odd chests of folded cardboard with a clamplamp attached to the cardboard table by the kingsized bed like the tv the bed was topoftheline with a satin bedspread on that bed sprawled over the royal blue satin was molly jim rose slowly and silently and tiptoed across the carpet to the bedroom door cracking it open just an inch or so peering inside she looked like a norman rockwell picture lying on her side so pale against the dark vivid fabric her red corduroy jumper rumpled across her stomach where she clutched her teddy bear with one arm she was still out of it sleeping off the little knock on the skull hed given her either that or she was still under the whiff of ether that had followed when he was close to her he could still smell the bananascent of her popsicle and see a sticky trace of syrup around her lips the light from the door caught in the eyes of her teddy bear and made them shine with a feral red gleam shed been easy easyso trusting especially after all the contact hed had with her for the past three weeks hed had his eye on two or three of the kids at kennedy grade school but shed been the one hed really wanted like the big tv she was topoftheline and any of the others would have been a disappointment she was perfect prime material best of the season those big chocolatebrown eyes the goldenbrown hair cut in a sweet pageboy the round dollyfaceshe couldnt have been any better he savored the moment watching her at a distance greedily studying her at his leisure knowing that he had her all to himself and no one could interfere shed been one of the last kids to leave the school on this warm golden afternoonthe rest had scattered on down the streets chasing the fallen leaves by the time she came out hed been loitering waiting to see if hed missed her if someone had picked her up after school or if shed had a dentist appointment or somethingbut no one would ever give a second look at the icecream man loitering outside a grade school he looked like what everybody expected a man obviously trying to squeeze every last dime out of the rugrats that he could the pattern while hed had this area staked out was that molly only had icecream money about a third of the time hed set her up so carefullyif she came out of the school alone and started to pass the truck with a wistful look in her eyes hed made a big production out of looking around for other kids then signalling her to come over the first couple of times shed shaken her head and run off but after shed bought cones from him a time or two he wasnt a stranger and to her mind was no longer in the catagory of people she shouldnt talk to then she responded and he had given her a broken popsicle in her favorite flavor of banana do me a favor and eat this all right hed said in his kindest voice i cant sell a broken popsicle and id hate for it to go to waste then hed lowered his voice to a whisper and bent over her but dont tell the other kids okay lets just keep it a secret she nodded gleefully and ran off after that he had no trouble getting her to come over to the truck after all why should she be afraid of the friend who gave her ice cream for free and only asked that she keep it a secret today shed had money though and from the sly gleam in her eyes he would bet shed filched it from her mommas purse this morning hed laid out choices for her like a servant laying out feastchoices for a princess and shed sparkled at him loving the attention as much as the treat shed dawdled over her choice her teddy bear clutched under one arm a toy so much a part of her that it could have been another limb that indecision bought time for the other kids to clear out of the way and all the teachers to get to their cars and putt out of the parkinglot his playacting paid off handsomely especially after hed nodded at the truck and winked shed wolfed down her cone and he gave her another broken popsicle she lingered on sucking on the yellow ice in a way that made his groin tighten with anticipation hed asked her ingenuous questions about her school and her teacher and she chattered amiably with him between slurps then shed turned to go at the perfect moment with not a child a car or a teacher in sight he reached for the sock full of sand inside the freezerdoor and in one smooth move gave her a little tap in just the right place he caught her before she hit the ground then it was into the special side of the icecream truck with her the side not hooked up to the freezerunit with ventilation holes bored through the walls in places where no one would find them he gave her a whiff of ether on a rag just in case to make sure she stayed under then he slid her limp body into the cardboard carton he kept on that side just in case somebody wanted to look inside he closed and latched the door and was back in the drivers seat before two minutes were up with still no sign of man nor beast luck luck all the way luck or pure genius he couldnt lose he was invulnerable funny how shed kept a grip on that toy though but that was luck too if shed left it there well he might have forgotten shed had it then somebody would have found it and someone might have remembered her standing at the icecream truck with it beside her but it had all gone smoothly perfectly planned perfectly executed ending with a drive through the warm september afternoon bells tinkling slightly outoftune no different from any other icecream man out for the last scores of the season hed felt supremely calm and in control of everything the moment he was in his seat no one would ever suspect him hed been a fixture since the beginning of school who ever sees the icecream man he was as much a part of the landscape as the firehydrant he generally stopped beside theyd ask the kids of course now that molly was officially missingand theyd say the same stupid thing they always did did you see any strangers theyd ask any strange cars hanging around anyone you didnt recognize stupid they were just stupid he was the smart one the kids would answer just like they always did theyd say no they hadnt seen any strangers no he wasnt a stranger he was the icecream man the kids saw him today and theyd see him tomorrow hed make sure of that hed be on his route for the next week at least unless there was a cold snap he knew how cops thought and if he disappeared they might look for him no way was he going to break his pattern eventually the cops would question himnot tomorrow but probably the day after that hed tell them he had seen the little girl that shed bought a cone from him hed cover his tracks there since the other kids would probably remember that shed been at the truck but hed shrug helplessly and say that she hadnt been on the street when he drove off hed keep strictly to the truth just not all the truth now molly was all his and no one would take her away from him until he was done with her he drove home stopping to sell cones when kids flagged him down taking his time it wouldnt do to break his pattern he took out the box that held molly and brought it upstairs then made two more trips for the leftover frozen treats all in boxes just like the one that held molly the neighbors were used to this it was another part of his routine he was the invisible man old jim always brings in the leftovers and puts em in his freezer overnight its cheaper than running the truckfreezer overnight he knew what they said about him that jim was a good guykept to himself mostly but when it was really hot or he had too much left over to fit in his freezer hed pass out freebies a free icecream bar was appreciated in this neighborhood where there wasnt a lot of money to spare for treats yeah jim was real quiet but okay never gave any trouble to anybody if the cops went so far as to look into his background they wouldnt find anything he ran a freelance icecream route in the summer and took odd jobs in the winter there was no record of his ever getting into trouble of course there was no record he was smart nobody had ever caught him not when he set fires as a kid not when he prowled the back alleys looking for stray dogs and cats and not later when he went on to the targets he really wanted he was careful when he first started on kids he picked the ones nobody would miss and he kept up with the literature he knew everything the cops would look for jims apartment was a cornerunit under the roof there was nobody above him the old man under him was stonedeaf the guy on one side was a stoner on the nightshift and the couple on the other side kept their music blasting so loud it was a wonder that they werent deaf nobody would ever hear a thing meanwhile jim waited as darkness fell outside for molly to sleep off her ether and her bump it wasnt any fun for him when his trophies were out of it jim liked them awake he liked to see their eyes when they realized that no one was coming to rescue them he changed into a pair of old jeans and a teeshirt in the livingroom hanging his white uniform in the closet then looked in on her again she still had a hold on that teddy bear it was a really unusual toy it was one of the many things that had marked her when hed first looked for targets jim was really glad shed kept such a tight grip on it it was so different that there was little doubt it would have been spotted as hers if shed dropped it the plush was a thick black fur extremely realistic in fact he wasnt entirely certain that it was fake fur there was no sign of the wear that kids usually put on that kind of beloved plaything the mouth was halfopen lined with red felt with white felt teeth and a red felt tongue instead of a ribbon bow this bear had a real leather collar with an odd tag hanging from it pottery or glass maybe or enameled metal it certainly wasnt plastic there was a faint raised pattern on the back and the word tedi on the front in a childishly printed scrawl the eyes were oddest of allwhoever had made this toy must have used the same eyes that taxidermists used they looked real alive it was going to prove a little bit of problem dealing with that bear after he was so careful not to leave any fiber or hair evidence he always washed them when he was through with them dressing them in fancy party clothing he took straight out of the packages then wrapping them in plastic once they were dressed to keep from contaminating them once he was through with her and dressed her in that frilly blue partydress hed bought hed cut up her old clothing into tiny pieces and flush them down the john a few at a time to keep from clogging the line that could be fatal hed do the part with the knife in the bathtub of course so there wouldnt be any bloodstains he knew exactly how to get bloodevidence scrubbed out of the bathroom what chemicals to use and everything theyd have to swab out the pipes to find anything but the bear was a problem hed have to figure out a smart way to get rid of it because it was bound to collect all kinds of evidence maybe give it to a kid maybe not there was a chance the kid would remember him by now it had probably collected fibers he had it the salvation army box the one on colby all the way across town theyd let that thing get stuffed full before they ever emptied it and by then the bear would have collected so much fiber and hair theyd never get it all sorted out then he could take her to macarthur park it was far enough away from the collection box hed leave her there like he always did propped up on a bench like an oversized doll a bench off in an outoftheway spot hed used macarthur park before but not recently and at this time of year it might be days before anyone found her but the bearbetter get it away from her now before it collected something more than hair for one thing it would be harder to handle her if she kept clinging to it something about those eyes bothered him too and he wasnt in a mood to be bothered he cracked the door open slipped inside pried the bear out of her loose grip he threw it into the bathroom but molly didnt stir he was vaguely disappointed hed hoped she show some sign of coming around when he took the toy well he had all night all weekend as long as she lasted hed have to make the most of this one she was the last of the season might as well get the stuff out he went into the kitchenette and dragged out the plastic stepstool standing it in the closet in the livingroom he opened up the hatch into the crawlspace it wasnt tall enough for him to see what was up there but what he wanted was right by the hatch anyway he felt across the fiberglass battings the paper over the insulation crackled under his fingers he groped until his hand encountered the cardboard box hed stored up there getting both hands around it straining on tiptoe to do so he lowered it carfully down through the hatch he had to bring it through the opening cattycornered to make it fit it wasnt heavy but it was an awkward shape he carried it to the center of the livingroom and placed it on the carpet kneeling beside it with his stomach tight with anticipation slowly with movements ritualized over time he undid the twine holding it closed just so he coiled up the twine and laid it to the side exactly five inches from the side of the box he reached for the lid but as he started to open it he thought he heard a faint sound as if something moved in the bedroom was molly finally awake he got to his feet and moved softly to the door but when he applied his eye to the crack he was disappointed to see that she hadnt moved at all she lay exactly as hed left her head pillowed on one arm hair scattered across his pillow lips pursed breathing softly but regularly her red corduroy jumper was still in the same folds it had been when hed put her down on the bed rucked up over her hip so that her little pink panties showed the tiniest bit then he saw the bear it was back right where it had been before sitting up in the curve of her stomach looking at him he shook his head frowning of course it wasnt looking at him it was his imagination it was just a toy he must have been so wrapped up in anticipation that hed flakedand hadnt thrown it in the bathroom as hed intended or else hed absentmindedly put it back on the bed easily fixed he took the few steps into the room grabbed the bear by one ear and threw it into the bedroom closet closing the door on it molly didnt stir and he retired to the living room and his treasure chest on the top layer of the box lay a tangle of leather and rubber he sorted out the straps carefully laying out all the restraints in their proper order with the rubber ball for her mouth and the gag to hold it in there first in line that was one of the most important parts whatever sound got past the gag wouldnt get past the neighbors various deficiencies something was definitely moving in the next room he heard the closet door opening then the sounds of shuffling he sprinted to the door only to see that molly was lying in exactly the same position and the bear was with her he shook his head damn he couldnt be going crazy then he chuckled at a sudden memory the third kid hed done had pulled something like thisthe kid was a sleepwalker with a knack for lying back down in precisely the same position as before and it wasnt until hed stayed in the bedroom instead of going through his collection that hed proved it to himself molly had obviously missed her bear gotten up searched blindly for her toy found it then lay back down again yeah come to think of it her jumper was a bit higher on her hip and she was more on her back than her side now but that bear had to go he marched in grabbed the bear again and looked around now where the bathroom the cabinet under the sink there was nothing in there but a pair of dead roaches and it had a childproof latch on it the eyes flashed at him as he flipped on the bathroom light and whipped the cabinet open for one moment he almost thought the eyes glared at him with a red light of their own before he closed the door on the thing and turned the lock with a satisfying click back to the box the next layer was his pictures they werent of any of his kids he wasnt that stupid nothing in this box would ever connect him with the guy they were calling the sundayschool killer because he left them dressed in sunday best clean and shining in places like parks and beaches looking as if theyd just come from church but the pictures were the best the internet had to offer and a lot of these kids looked like the ones hed had pretty kids real pretty he took them out in the proper order starting with the simple ones letting the excitement build in his groin as he savored each one first the nudesten of them he knew them all by heart then the nudes with the kids playing together culled from the my little fishie newsletter of a nutcase religious cult that believed in kidsex then the good ones halfway through he slipped his hand into his pants without taking his eyes off the pictures this was going to be a good one molly looked just like the kid in the best of his pictures she was going to be perfect the last of the season the best of the season he was pretty well occuppied as he got to the last set though he noted absently that it sounded as if molly was up and moving around again this was the bondageandsnuff set very hard to get and the only reason he had them at all was because hed stolen them from a storagelocker he wouldnt have taken the risk of getting them personally but theyd given him some of his best ideas molly must be awake by now but this wasnt to be hurriedthere wouldnt be any mollys or jeffreys until next year next spring summer and fall he had to make this one last he savored the emotions in the pictured eyes as he would savor mollys fear savored their pleading expressions their helplessness such pretty little things like her like all his kids they wanted it anybody knew that freud said sothat had been in that psychology course he took by correspondence when he was trying to figure himself out look at the way kids played doctor the minute you turned your back on them that religious cult had it right kids wanted it needed it and the only thing getting in the way was the way a bunch of repressed old men felt about it hed show her what it was she wanted show her good hed make it last take it slow then once she was all his and would do anything he said hed make sure nobody else would ever have her again hed keep her his forever not even her parents would have her the way he did under the last layer of pictures was the knife the beautiful shining filleting knife the best made absolutely stainless rustproof with a pristine black handle he laid it reverently beside the leather straps then zipped up his pants and rose to his feet no doubt she was shuffling around on the other side of the door moving uncertainly back and forth she should be just dazed enough that hed get her gagged before she knew enough to scream he paused a moment to order his thoughts and his face before putting his hand on the doorknob next to the moment when the kid lay trussedup under him this was the best moment he flung the door wide open hello mo that was as far as he got the screams brought the neighbors to break down the door there were two sets of screams his and those of a terrified little girl pounding on the closet door a dozen of them gathered in the hall before they got up the courage to break in and by then jim wasnt screaming anymore what they found in the livingroom made the first inside run back out the way they had come one managed to get as far as the bedroom to release the child a pale young woman who lived at the other end of the floor whose maternal instincts overrode her stomach long enough to rescue the weeping child molly fell out of the closet into her arms sobbing with terror the young woman recognized her from news how could she not her picture had been everywhere meanwhile one of the others who had fled the whimpering thing on the livingroom floor got to a phone and called the cops the young woman closed the bedroom door on the horror in the next room took the hysterical shivering child into her arms and waited for help to arrive absently wondering at her own hitherto unsuspected courage while they were waiting the thing on the floor mewled gasped and died although the young woman hadnt known what to make of the tangle of leather shed briefly glimpsed on the carpet the homicide detective knew exactly what it meant he owed a candle to saint jude for the solving of his most hopeless case and another to the virgin for saving this child before anything had happened to her and a third to whatever saint had seen to it that there would be no need for a trial you say there was no sign of anything or anyone else he asked the young woman shed already told him that she was a librarianthat was shortly after shed taken advantage of their arrival to close herself into the bathroom and throw up he almost took her to task for possibly destroying evidence but what was the point this was one murder he didnt really want to solve she was sitting in the only chair in the livingroom carefully not looking at the outline on the carpet or the bloodspattered mess of pictures and leather straps a little distance from her feet hed asked the same question at least a dozen times already nothing no one she shook her head theres no back door just the hatches to the crawlspace in each closet he looked where she pointed at the open closet door with the kitchen stool still inside it he walked over to the closet and craned his head around sideways peering upward not too big but a skinny guy could get up there he said half to himself is that attic divided at all no it runs all along the top floor i never put anything up there because anybody could get into it from any other apartment she shivered and i put locks on all my hatches now im glad i did once a year they fumigate so they need the hatches to get exhaust fans up there a skinny guy one real good with a knifemaybe a nam vet a seal a green beret he was talking mostly to himself it might not have been a knife maybe claws like in the karate rags ninja claws that could be what he used he paced back to the center of the living room the librarian rubbed her hands along her arms watching him out of sick blue eyes okay he knows what this sicko is up tomaybe he just now found out doesnt want to call the cops for whatever reason he comes down into the bedroom locks the kid in the closet to keep her safe she told me that a bear locked her into the closet the woman interrupted the detective laughed lady that kid has a knot the size of a baseball on her skull she could have seen luke skywalker lock her in that closet he went back to his deductions okay he locks the kid in then makes enough noise so joyboy thinks she finally woke up then when the door opensyeah itll fly he nodded then he gets back out by this hatch he sighed regretful that he wouldnt ever get a chance to thank this guy wont be any fingerprints guy like this would be too smart to leave any he stared at the outline on the bloodsoaked carpet pensively the librarian shuddered look officer she said asserting herself if you dont need me anymore hey pete the detectives partner poked his head in through the door the kids parents are here the kid wants her teddyshes raising a real howl about it and the docs at the hospital dont want to sedate her if they dont have to shit the kid misses being a statistic by a couple of minutes and all she can think about is her toy he shook his head and refocused on the librarian go ahead miss i dont think you can tell us anything more you might want to check into the hospital yourself get checked over for shock either that or pour yourself a stiff one call in sick tomorrow he smiled suddenly realizing that she was pretty in a wilted sort of wayand after what shed just been through no wonder she was wilted that was what i had in mind already detective she replied and made good her escape before he changed his mind pete her folks say she wont be able to sleep without it his partner persisted yeah yeah go ahead and take it he responded absently if things had gone differentlytheyd be shaking out that toy for hair and fiber samples if they found it at all he handed the bear to his partner ohbefore you give it back what theres blood on the paws he replied already looking for trace evidence that would support his theories wouldnt want to shake her up any further so make sure you wash it off first satanic versus okay so i dont always take diana tregarde very seriously when this story appeared in marion zimmer bradleys fantasy magazine however there was a reader a selfproclaimed romance writer who took it seriously and was quite irate at the rather unflattering picture i painted of romance writers she wrote a long and angry letter about it to the editor the editor who like me has seen romance writers at a romance convention declined to comment a note the character of robert harrison and the concept of whoopie witches was taken from the excellent supernatural roleplaying game stalking the night fantastic by richard tucholka and used with the creators permission there is also a computer game version bureau thirteen both are highly recommended mrs peel intoned a suave urbane tenor voice from the hotel doorway behind di tregarde were needed the accent was faintly french rather than english but the inflection was deadon di didnt bother to look in the mirror although she knew there would be a reflection there andre lebrel might be a yearold vampire but he cast a perfectly good reflection she was too busy trying to get her false eyelashes to stick in a minute lover the glue wont hold i cant understand iti bought the stuff last year for that unicorn costume and it was fine then allow me a thin graceful hand appeared over her shoulder holding a tiny tube of surgical adhesive i had the sinking feeling that you would forget this glue cherie it does not age well piffle figure a backstage haunt would know that she took the white plastic tube from andre and proceeded to attach the pesky lashes properly this time they obliged by staying put she finished her preparations with a quick application of liner and spun around to face her partner here she said posing feeling more than a little smug about how well the black leather jumpsuit fit how do i look andre cocked his bowler to the side and leaned on his umbrella ravishing and i his dark eyes twinkled merrily although he looked a great deal more like timothy dalton than patrick macnee anyone seeing the two of them together would have no doubt who he was supposed to be costumed as di was very glad they had a pair costume and blessed andres infatuation with old tv shows and theyre damned well going to see us together all the time di told herself firmly why i ever agreed to this fiasco you look altogether too good to make me feel comfortable she told him snapping off the light over the mirror i hope you realize what youre letting yourself in for youre going to think youre a drumstick in a pool of piranha andre made a face as he followed her into the hotel room from the dressing alcove cherie these are only romance writers they are for the most part overimaginative middleaged hausfraus married to guys that are going thin on top and thick on the bottom and youre likely going to be one of a handful of males in the room and the rest are going to be middleaged copies of their husbands agents or gay she raised an eyebrow at him so where do you think that leaves you like old man kangaroo very much run after he had the audacity to laugh at her have no fear cherie i shall evade the sharp little piranha teeth i just hope i can she muttered under her breath under most circumstances she avoided the romance writers of the world functions like the plague chucked the newsletter in the garbage without reading it and paid her dues only because morrie pointed out that it would look really strange if she didnt belong the rww she had found was a hotbed of infighting and jealousy and my advances are bigger than your advances so i am writing deathless prose and you are writing tripe the general attitude seemed to be the publishers are out to get you the agents are out to get you and your fellow writers are out to get you since di got along perfectly well with agent and publishers and really didnt care how well or poorly other writers were doing she didnt see the point but somehow morrie had talked her into attending the rww halloween party and for the life of her she couldnt remember why or how why am i doing this she asked andre as she snatched up her purse from the beigedraped bed transferred everything really necessary into a blackleather beltpouch and slung the latter around her hips making very sure the belt didnt interfere with the holster on her other hip you were the one who talked to morrie on the phone because msieur morrie wishes you to give his client robert harrison someone to talk to the vampire reminded her msieur harrison agreed to escort valentine vervain to the party in a moment of weakness equal to yours why in hades did he agree to that she exclaimed giving the sablehaired vampire a look of profound astonishment because miss vervaincherie that is not her real name is itis one of morries best clients is newly divorced and alone and morrie claims most insecure and msieur harrison was kind to her andre replied di took a quick look around the hotel room to make sure she hadnt forgotten anything one thing about combining her annual make nice with the publishers trip with halloween she had a chance to get together with all her old new york buddies for a real samhain celebration and avoid the christmas and thanksgiving crowds and bad weather i remember that was when she did that crossover thing and the scifi people took her apart for trying to claim it was the best thing since tolkien she chuckled heartlessly the less said about that the better her magic system had holes i could drive a mack truck through but harrison was a gentleman and kept the bloodshed to a minimum but morrie doesnt know valentineand no sexy her name used to be edith bowman until she changed it legallyif he thinks shes as insecure as shes acting three quarters of what la valentine does is an act and everything is in technicolor and dolby enhanced sound so whats harrison doing in town she snatched up the key from the desk and stuffed it into the pouch as andre held the door open for her i do not know he replied twirling the umbrella once and waving her past you should ask him i hope valentine doesnt eat him alive she said striding down the beige hall and frankly enjoying the appreciative look a hotel roomservice clerk gave her as she sauntered by i wonder if shes going to wear the outfit from the cover of her last bookif she does harrison may decide he wants to spend the rest of the party in the mens room she reached the end of the hall a fraction of a second before andre and punched the button for the elevator i gather that is what we are to save him from cherie andre pointed out wryly as the elevator arrived oh well she sighed stepping into the mirrorwalled cubicle its only five hours and it cant be that bad how much trouble can a bunch of romance writers get into anyway there was enough lace chiffon and satin to outfit an entire busby berkeley musical di counted fifteen harem girls nine vampire victims three southern belles the south was out this year a round dozen ravished maidens of various time periods none of them peasants and assorted frills and furbelows and one witch in a black chiffon outfit clearly purchased from the fredericks catalog aside from the witch she and andre were the only ones dressed in blackand they were the only ones covered from neck to toesthough in dis case that was problematical the tight black leather jumpsuit really didnt leave anything to the imagination the avengers outfits had been andres idea when she realized she really had agreed to go to this party she had suggested dracula for him and a witch for herbut he had pointed out logically that there was no point in coming as what they really were besides ive always wanted a black leather jumpsuit and this made a good excuse to get it and since im doing this as a favor to morrie i might be able to deduct it and even if i cant the looks im getting are worth twice the price most of the women hereand as shed warned andre the suite at the henley palace that rww had rented for this bash contained about eighty percent womenwere in their forties at best most of them demonstrated amply the problems with having a sedentary job and most of them were wearing outfits that might have been worn by their favorite heroines though few of them went to the extent that valentine vervain did and copied the exact dress from the front of the latest book the problem was their heroines were all no older than twentytwo and as described weighed maybe ninetyfive pounds since a great many of the ladies in question weighed at least half again that the results were not what the wearers intended the sour looks di was getting were just as flattering as the wolfwhistle the bellboy had sent her way a quick sail through the five rooms of the suite with andre at her side ascertained that valentine and her escort had not yet arrived a quick glance at andres face proved that he was having a very difficult time restraining his mirth she decided then that discretion was definitely the better part of valor and retired to the balcony with andre in tow and a couple of glasses of perrier it was a beautiful night one of those rare lateoctober nights that made di regretbrieflymoving to connecticut clear cool and crisp with just enough wind to sweep the effluvium of city life from the streets below them hundreds of lights created a jewelbox effect if you looked hard you could even see a few stars beyond the lighthaze the sliding glass door to the balcony had been opened to vent some of the heat and overwhelming perfume dis nose said nothing under a hundred dollars a bottle and di left it that way she parked her elbows on the balcony railing and looked down andre at her side and sighed he chuckled you warned me and i did not believe i apologize cherie it ismost remarkable hmm exercise that vampiric hearing of yours and youll get an earfull she said watching the carlights crawl by twenty stories below when they arent slaughtering each other and playing little powertrip games theyre picking apart their agents and their editors if youve ever wondered why ive never bothered going after the big money its because to get it id have to play by those rules then i devoutly urge you to remain with modest ambitions cherie he said fervently i excuse me said a masculine voice from the balcony door it had a distinct note of desperation in it are you diana tregarde di turned behind her peering around the edge of the doorway was a harriedlooking fellow in a baggy tweedy sweater and slacksnot a costumewith a shock of prematurely graying sandybrown hair glasses and a moustache and a look of absolute misery robert harrison i presume she said archly come join us in the sanctuary its too cold out here for chiffon thank god harrison ducked onto the balcony with the agility of a man evading iraqi borderguards and threw himself down in an aluminum patio chair out of sight of the windows i think the password is morrie sent me recognized pass friend give the man credit he gave you an ally and an escaperoute di chuckled dont tell me she showed up as the sacred priestess askenazy in a ninefoot chiffon train and seethrough harem pants yes harrison groaned and let me know i was out of the royal favor for not dressing as whatshisname watirion di said helpfully do you realize you can pronounce that as whattireiron i encourage the notion but that wasnt the worst of it harrison shook his head distractedly as if he was somewhat in a daze the worst was the monologue in the cab on the way over here every other word was crystal this and vibration that past life regression and mystic rituals the womans a whoopie witch di blinked that was a new one on her a what harrison looked up and for the first time seemed to see her uh he hesitated uh some of what morrie saiduh he seemed to think youwell youve seen thingsuh he said you know things she fished the pentagram out from under the neck of her jumpsuit and flashed it briefly my religion is nontraditional yes and there are more things in heaven and earth etcetera now what in tophet is a whoopie witch itsuha term some friends of mine use its kind of hard to explain harrisons brow furrowed look let me give you examples real witches have grimorie sometimes handed down through their families for centuries whoopie witches have books they picked up at the supermarket usually right at the checkout counter real witches have carefully researched spells di prompted whoopie witches draw a baseball diamond in chalk on the living room floor and recite random passages from the satanic bible when real witches make substitutions they do so knowing the exact difference the substitute will make whoopie witches slop taco sauce in their pentagram because it looks like blood real witches gather their ingredients by hand di was beginning to enjoy this game whoopie witches have a credit card and lots of catalogues harrison was grinning and so was andre real witches spend hours in meditation whoopie witches sit under a pyramid they ordered from a catalogue and watch knots landing real witches cast spells knowing that any change they make in someones life will come back at them threefold for good or ill whoopie witches call up the hideous slime from yosotha to eat their neighbors poodle because the bitch got the last carton of haagendaaz doublechocolate at the seveneleven i think ive got the picture so dear val decided to take the socalled research she did for the great fantasy novel seriously di leaned back into the railing and laughed oh robert i pity you did she try to tell you that the two of you just must have been priestly lovers in a past life in atlantis lemuria harrison said gloomily my god she must be supporting half the crystal miners in arkansas dont feel too sorry for her robert di warned him with her advances she can afford it and i know some perfectly nice people in arkansas who should only soak her for every penny they can get change the subject youre safe with usand if she decides to hit the punchbowl hard enough you can send her back to her hotel in a cab and shell never know the difference what brings you to new york morrie wants me to meet the new editors at berkley he thinks ive got a shot at selling them that nearspace series ive been dying to do and i had some people here in the city i really needed to see he sighed and ill admit it id been thinking about writing bodicerippers under a pseudonym when you know theyre getting ten times what i am di shrugged i dont think youd be happy doing it unless youve written strictly to spec before theres a lot of things you have to conform to that you might not feel comfortable doing listen harrison you seem to know quite a bit about hotandcoldrunning esotericahow did you someone in one of the other rooms screamed not the angry scream of a woman who has been insulted but the soulchilling shriek of pure terror that brands itself on the air and stops all conversation dead what in harrison was on his feet staring in the direction of the scream di ignored him and launched herself at the patio door pulling the glock from the holster on her hip and thankful shed loaded the silvertipped bullets in the first clip funny how everybody thought it couldnt be real because it was plastic andrethe next balcony she called over her shoulder knowing the vampire could easily scramble over the concrete divider and come in through the next patio door giving them a twopronged angle of attack the scream hadnt been what alerted hersimultaneous with the scream had been the wrenching feeling in her gut that was the signal that someone had breached the fabric of the otherworld in her presence she didnt know who or whatbut from the stream of panicked chiffon billowing towards the door at supersonic speed it probably wasnt nice and it probably had a great deal to do with one of the partygoers three amplyendowed females one belle one ravished and one harem had reached the door to the next room at the same moment and jammed it and rather than one of them pulling free they all three kept shoving harder shrieking at the tops of their lungs in tones their agents surely recognized youd think their advances failed to pay out di kept the glock in her hand but sprinted for the door she grabbed the nearest flailing arm harem planted her foot in the midsection of her neighbor belle and shoved and pulled at the same time the clot of feminine hysteria came loose with a sound of ripping cloth a crinoline parted company with its wearer the three women tumbled through the door giving di a clear launching path into the next room she took it diving for the shelter of a huge wooden coffee table rolling and aiming for the door of the last room with the glock and her elbow hit someone what are you doing here asked harrison and di simultaneously harrison coweredno had taken cover there was a distinct differencebehind the sofa beside the coffee table his own huge magnum aimed at the same doorway my job they saidalso simultaneously what again in chorus this is all a very amusing study in synchronicity said andre crouching just behind harrison bowler tipped and sword from his umbrella out and ready but i suggest you both pay attention to that most boorish partycrasher over there something very large occluded the light for a moment in the next room then the lights went out and di distinctly heard the sound of the chandelier being torn from the ceiling and thrown against the wall she winced there go my dues up again i got a glimpse andre continued it was very large perhaps ten feet tall andcherie looked like nothing so much as a rubber creature from a very bad movie except that i do not think it was rubber at just that moment there was a thrashing from the other room and valentine vervain long red hair liberally beslimed minus ninefoot train and one of her sleeves scrambled through the door and plastered herself against the wall where she promptly passed out valentine di murmuredand snapped her head towards harrison when he moanedoh no in a way that made her sure he knew something harrison she snapped cough it up there was a sound of things breaking in the other room as if something was fumbling around in the dark picking up whatever it encountered and smashing it in frustration valentineshe said something about getting some of her friends together tonight and calling up her soulmate so she could show that ex of hers i gather he appeared at the divorce hearing with a twentyoneyearold blonde harrison gulped i figured she was just blowing it offi never thought she had any power youd be amazed what anger will do di replied grimly keeping her eyes on the darkened doorway sometimes it even transcends a total lack of talent put that together with the time of yearall hallows eensamhainis tomorrow the wall between the worlds is especially thin and power flows are heavy right now thats a recipe for disaster if i ever heard one and here comes msieur soulmate said andre warningly what shambled in through the door was nothing that di had ever heard of it was indeed about ten feet tall it was a very dark brown it was covered with luxuriant brown hairall over otherwise it was nude if there were any eyes the hair hid them completely it was built something along the lines of a powerful bodybuilder taken to exaggerated lengths and it drooled it also stank a combination of sulfur and musk so strong it would have brought tears to the eyes of a skunk wahwenine it bawled waving its arms around as if it were blind wahwenine oh goddess di groaned putting two and two together and coming up withshe called a soulmate and specified parameters but she forgot to specify human are you thinking what im thinking the other writer nodded tall check dark check long hair check handsomewell i suppose in some circles harrison stared at the thing in fascination somethingthat will accept her completely as she is and love her completely young sure he cant be more than five minutes old di watched the thing fumble for the doorframe and cling to it look at that he cant see so love is blind strong and as masculine as you can get and not too bright which i bet she also specified oh my ears and whiskers valentine came to saw the thing and screamed wahwenine it howled and lunged for her reflexively di and harrison both shot he emptied his cylinder and one speedloader di gave up after four shots when it was obvious they were hitting the thing to no effect valentine scrambled on hands and knees over the carpet still screamingbut crawling in the wrong direction towards the balcony not the door merde andre flung himself between the creatures clutching hands and its summoner before di could do anything and before di could react to that the thing backhanded andre into a wall hard enough to put him through the plasterboard valentine passed out again andre was already out for the count there are some things even a vampire has a little trouble recovering from jesus harrison was on his feet fumbling for something in his pocket di joined him holstering the glock and grabbed his arm harrison distract it make a noise anything she pulled the atheme from her boot sheath and began cutting sigils in the air with it getting the words of dismissal out as fast as she could without slurring the syllables harrison didnt even hesitate he grabbed a couple of tin serving trays from the coffee table shook off their contents and banged them together the thing turned its head toward him its hands just inches away from its goal wahwenine it said harrison banged the trays again it lunged toward the sound it was a lot faster than di had thought it was evidently harrison made the same error in judgment it missed him by inches and he scrambled out of the way by the width of a hair just as di concluded the ritual of dismissal to no effect hurry up will you harrison yelped as the thing threw the couch into the wall and lunged again im trying she replied through clenched teeththough not loud enough to distract the thing which had concluded either a harrison was valentine or b harrison was keeping it from valentine whichever it had gone from wailing valentines name to simply wailing and lunging after harrison who was dodging with commendable agility in a man of middle age of course he has a lot of incentive she tried three more dismissals still with no effect the room was trashed and harrison was getting winded and running out of heavy expensive things to throw and the only thing she could think of was the incantation she usedas a joketo make the stoplights change in her favor oh hella cockamamie incantation pulled it up by the seven rings of zsa zsa gabor and the rock of elizabeth taylor i command thee she shouted stepping between the thing and harrison who was beginning to stumble by the six wives of eddie fisher and the words of karnak the great i compel thee freeze buddy power rose through her crested over herand hit the thing and the thingstopped it whimpered and struggled a little against invisible bonds but seemed unable to move harrison dropped to the carpet right on top of a spill of guacamole and groundin tortilla chips whimpering a little himself i have to get rid of this thing quick before it breaks the compulsion she closed her eyes and trusted to instinct and shouted the first thing that came into her mind the parking ritual with one change great squat send him to a spot and ill send you three nuns mageenergies raged through the room whirling about her invisible intangible to eyes and ears but she felt them she was the heart of the whirlwind she and the other there was a pop of displaced air she opened her eyes to see that the creature was gonebut the mageenergies continued to whirlfaster jesus said harrison how did you she waved him frantically to silence as the energies sensed his presence and began to circle in on him great squat thanks for the spot she yelled desperately trying to complete the incantation before harrison could be pulled in your nuns are in the mail the energies swirled up and away satisfied andre groaned stirred and began extracting himself from the powdered sheetrock wall harrison stumbled over to give him a hand just as someone pounded on the outer door of the suite police came a muffled voice open the door its open di yelled back unzipping her beltpouch and pulling out her wallet three people two uniformed nypd and one fellow in a suit with an impressive magnum in his hand peered cautiously around the doorframe jeezus christ one said in awe who the dazed valentine murmured hand hanging limply over her forehead wha hap andre appeared beside di bowler in hand umbrella spotless and innocentlooking again di fished her hartford pd special ops id out of her wallet and handed it to the man in the suit this lady she said angrily pointing to valentine played a little halloween joke that got out of hand her accomplices went out the back door then down the fire escape if you hurry you might be able to catch them the two nycpd officers looked around at the destruction and didnt seem any too inclined to chase after whoever was responsible di checked out of the corner of her eye harrisons own had vanished as mysteriously as it had appeared are you certain this woman is responsible asked the hardfaced suited individual with a frown as he holstered his he wasnt paying much attention to the plastic handgrip in the holster at dis hip for which she was grateful house detective i bet with any luck hes never seen a glock di nodded these two gentlemen will back me up as witnesses she said i suspect some of the ladies from the party will be able to do so as well once you explain that ms vervain was playing a notverynice joke on them personally i think she ought to be held accountable for the damages and keep my rww dues from going through the roof well i think so too miss the detective hauled valentine ungently to her feet the writer was still confused and it wasnt an act this time maam he said sternly to the dazed redhead i think youd better come with me i think we have a few questions to ask you di projected outraged innocence and harmlessness at them as hard as she could the camouflage trick worked which after this evening was more than she expected the two uniformed officers didnt even look at her weapon they just followed the detective out without a single backwards glance harrison cleared his throat audibly she turned and raised an eyebrow at him youi thought you were just a writer and i thought you were just a writer she countered so were even but he took a good look at her face and evidently thought better of prying what did you do with thatthing that was the strangest incantation ive ever heard she shrugged and began picking her way through the mess of smashed furniture spilled drinks and crushed and groundin refreshments i have no idea valentine brought it in with something screwy i got rid of it the same way and that critter has no idea how lucky he was why asked harrison as she and andre reached the door why she turned and smiled sweetly do you have any idea how hard it is to get a parking place in manhattan at this time of night nightside this is the very first attempted professional appearance of diana tregarde my occult detective ive always enjoyed occult detectives but there is a major problem with themwhat are they supposed to do for a living ghosts dont pay very well so di writes romances for a living and saves the world on the side this story was originally rejected by the anthology i submitted it to it became the basis for children of the night by another company and was then published in this form by marion zimmer bradleys fantasy magazine it was early spring but the wind held no hint of verdancy not even the promise of itit was chill and odorless and there were ghosts of dead leaves skittering before it a few of them jittered into the pool of weak yellow light cast by the aging streetlampa converted gaslight that was a relic of the previous century it was old and tired its peagreen paint flaking away as weary as this neighborhood which was older still across the street loomed an ancient church its congregation dwindled over the years to a handful of little old women and men who appeared like scrawny blackbirds every sunday and then scattered back to the shabby houses that stood to either side of it until sunday should come again on the side of the street that the lamp tried and failed to illuminate was the cemetery like the neighborhood it was very oldin this case fifty years shy of being classified as colonial there were few empty gravesites now and most of those belonged to the same little old ladies and men that had lived and would die here it was protected from vandals by a thorny hedge as well as a tenfoot wroughtiron fence within its confines as seen through the leafless branches of the hedge granite cenotaphs and enormous victorian monuments bulked shapelessly against the bare sliver of a waning moon the church across the street was dark and silent the houses up and down the block showed few lights if any there was no reason for anyone of this neighborhood to be out in the night so the young woman waiting beneath the lamppost seemed that much more outofplace nor could she be considered a typical resident of this neighborhood by any stretch of the imaginationfor one thing she was young perhaps in her midtwenties but no more her clothing was neat but casual too casual for someone visiting an elderly relative she wore dark kneehigh boots old soft jeans tucked into their tops and a thin windbreaker open at the front to show a leotard beneath her attire was far too light to be any real protection against the bite of the wind yet she seemed unaware of the cold her hair was long down to her waist and straightin the uncertain light of the lamp it was an indeterminate shadow and it fell down her back like a waterfall her eyes were large and oddly slanted but not oriental catlike rather even the way she held herself was feline poised expectanta graceful tension like a dancers or a hunting predators she was not watching for somethingno her eyes were unfocused with concentration she was listening a soft whistle barely audible carried down the street on the chill wind the tune was of a piece with the neighborhoodold and timeworn many of the residents would have smiled in recollection to hear lili marlene again the tension left the girl as she swung around the lamppost by one hand to face the direction of the whistle she waved and a welcoming smile warmed her eyes the whistler stepped into the edge of the circle of light he too was dusky of eye and hairand heartbreakingly handsome he wore only dark jeans and a black turtleneck no coat at allbut like the young woman he didnt seem to notice the cold there was an impish glint in his eyes as he finished the tune with a flourish a flair for the dramatic diana mon cherie he said mockingly would that you were here for the same purpose as the lovely lili alas i fear my luck cannot be so good she laughed his eyes warmed at the throaty chuckle andre she chided dont you ever think of anything else am i not a son of the city of light i must uphold her reputation mais non the young woman raised an ironic brow he shrugged ah wellsince it is you who seek me i fear i must be all business a pity well what lures you to my side this unseasonable night what horror has mademoiselle tregarde unearthed this time diana tregarde sobered instantly the laughter fleeing her eyes im afraid you picked the right word this time andre it is a horror the trouble is i dont know what kind say on i wait in breathless anticipation his expression was mocking as he leaned against the lamppost and he feigned a yawn diana scowled at him and her eyes darkened with anger he raised an eyebrow of his own if this werent so serious she threatened id be tempted to pop you oneandre people are dying out there theres a ripper loose in new york he shrugged and shifted restlessly from one foot to the other so this is new tell me when there is not that sort of criminal is as common to the city as a rat let your police earn their salaries and capture him her expression hardened she folded her arms tightly across the thin nylon of her windbreaker her lips tightened a little use your head andre if this was an ordinary slasherkiller would i be involved he examined his fingernails with care and what is it that makes it extraordinaire eh the victims had no souls i was not aware he replied wryly that the dead possessed such things anymore she growled under her breath and tossed her head impatiently and the wind caught her hair and whipped it around her throat you are deliberately being difficult i have half a mind it finally seemed to penetrate the young mans mind that she was truly angryand truly frightened though she was doing her best to conceal the fact his expression became contrite forgive me cherie i am being recalcitrant youre being a pain in the ass she replied acidly would i have come to you if i wasnt already out of my depth well he admitted no butthis business of souls cherie how can you determine such a thing i find it most difficult to believe she shivered and her eyes went brooding so did i trust me my friend i know what im talking about there isnt a shred of doubt in my mind there are at least six victims who no longer exist in any fashion anymore the young man finally evidenced alarm buthow he said bewildered how is such a thing possible she shook her head violently clenching her hands on the arms of her jacket as if by doing so she could protect herself from an unseenbut not unfeltdanger i dont know i dont know it seems incredible even nowi keep thinking its a nightmare butandre its real its not my imagination her voice rose a little with each word and andres sharp eyes rested for a moment on her trembling hands eh bien he sighed i believe you so there is something about that devours soulsand mutilates bodies as well since you mentioned a ripper persona she nodded was the devouring before or after the mutilation before i thinkits not easy to judge she shivered in a way that had nothing to do with the cold and you came into this how whatever it is it took the friend of a friend ihappened to be there to see the body afterwards and i knew immediately there was something wrong when i unshielded and used the sight bad he made it a statement worse ii cant describe what it felt like there were still residual emotions things left behind when her jaw clenched then when i started checking further i found out about the other five victimsthat what i had discovered was no fluke andre whatever it is it has to be stopped she laughed again but this time there was no humor in it after all you could say stopping it is in my job description he nodded soberly and so you become involved well enough if you must hunt this thing so must i he became all business tell me of the history when and where and who does it take she bit her lip wheretheres no pattern who seems to be mostly a matter of opportunity the only clue is that the victims were always out on the street and entirely alone there were no witnesses whatsoever so the thing needs total privacy and apparently cant strike where it will and whenis moondark bad he shook his head i have no clue at the moment the loupgarou i know and others but i know nothing that hunts beneath the dark moon she grimaced you think i do thats why i need your help youre sensitive enough to feel something out of the ordinary and you can watch and hunt undetected i cant and im not sure i want to go trolling for this thing alonewithout knowing what it is i could end up as a latenight snack for it but if thats what i have to do i will anger blazed up in his face like a cold fire you go hunting alone for this creature over my dead body thats a little redundant isnt it her smile was weak but genuine again pah he dismissed her attempt at humor with a wave of his hand tomorrow is the first night of moondark i shall go ahunting do you remain at home else i shall be most wroth with you i know where to find you should i learn anything of note you ought to diana began but she spoke to the empty air the next night was warmer and diana had gone to bed with her windows open to drive out some of the stale odors the long winter had left in her apartment not that the air of new york city was exactly freshbut it was better than what the heating system kept recycling through the building she didnt particularly like leaving her defenses open while she slept but the lingering memory of katy rourks fish wafting through the halls as she came in from shopping had decided her better exhaust fumes than burned haddock she hadnt had an easy time falling asleep and when she finally managed to do so tossed restlessly her dreams uneasy and readily broken as by the sound of someone in the room before the intruder crossed even half the distance between the window and her bed she was wide awake and moving she threw herself out of bed somersaulted across her bedroom and wound up crouched beside the door one hand on the lightswitch the other holding a polished dagger shed taken from beneath her pillow as the lights came on she saw andre standing in the center of the bedroom blinking in surprise wearing a sheepish grin relief made her knees go weak andre you idiot she tried to control her tone but her voice was shrill and cracked a little you could have been killed he spread his hands wide in a placating gesture now diana now diana my eye she growled even you would have a hard time getting around a severed spine she stood up slowly shaking from head to toe with released tension i didnt wish to wake you he said crestfallen she closed her eyes and took several long deep calming breaths focusing on a mantra moving herself back into stillness until she knew she would be able to reply without screaming at him dont she said carefully ever do that again she punctuated the last word by driving the dagger she held into the doorframe certainement mon petite he replied his eyes widening a little as he began to calculate how fast shed moved the next time i come in your window when you sleep i shall blow a trumpet first youd be a lot safer id be a lot happier she said crossly pulling the dagger loose with a snap of her wrist she palmed the lightswitch and dimmed the lamps down to where they would be comfortable to his lightsensitive eyes then crossed the room the plush brown carpet warm and soft under her bare feet she bent slightly and put the silverplated dagger back under her pillow then with a sigh she folded her long legs beneath her to sit on her rumpled bed this was the first time andre had ever caught her asleep and she was irritated far beyond what her disturbed dreams warranted she was somewhat obsessed with her privacy and with keeping her nightboundaries unbreachedshe and andre were offandon lovers but shed never let him stay any length of time he approached the antique wooden bed slowly cherie this was no idle visit i should bloody well hope not she interrupted trying to soothe her jangled nerves by combing the tangles out of her hair with her fingers i have seen your killer she froze it is nothing i have ever seen or heard of before she clenched her hands on the strand of hair they held ignoring the pull go on itno hei could not detect until he made his first kill tonight i found him then found him just before he took his huntingshape or i never would have discovered him at all for when he is in that shape there is nothing about him that i could sense that marked him as different so ordinarya man an oriental japanese i think and like many othersnot young not old not fat not thin so unremarkable as to be invisible i followed himhe was so normal i found it difficult to believe what my own eyes had seen a moment before then not ten minutes later he found yet another victim andfed again he closed his eyes his face thoughtful as i said i have never seen or heard of his like yetyet there was something familiar about him i cannot even tell you what it was and yet it was familiar you said you saw him attackhow andre she leaned forward her face tight with urgency as the bed creaked a little beneath her the second quarry wastheis it bag lady you say at her nod he continued he smiled at herjust smiled that was all she froze like the frightened rabbit then hechangedinto dark dark smoke only smoke nothing more the smoke enveloped the old woman until i could see her no longer thenhe fed ii can understand your feelings now cherie it wasnothing to the eye butwhat i felt within now you see she said gravely mais oui and you have no more argument from me this thing is abomination and must be ended the question is she grimaced how i have given some thought to this one cannot fight smoke but in his hunting formi think perhaps he is vulnerable to physical measures as you say even i would have difficulty in dealing with a severed spine or crushed brain i think maybe it would be the same for him have you the courage to play the wounded bird mon petite he sat beside her on the edge of the bed and regarded her with solemn and worried eyes she considered that for a moment play bait while you wait for him to move in it sounds like the best plan to meit wouldnt be the first time ive done that and im not exactly helpless you know she replied twisting a strand of hair around her fingers i think you have finally proved that to me tonight there was a hint of laughter in his eyes again as well as chagrin i shall never again make the mistake of thinking you to be a fragile flower bien is tomorrow night too soon for you tonight wouldnt be too soon she stated flatly except that he has already gone to lair having fed twice he took one of her hands freeing it from the lock of hair she had twisted about it no we resti know where he is to be found and tomorrow night we face him at full strength abruptly he grinned cherie i have read one of your books she winced and closed her eyes in a grimace oh lordi was afraid youd ferret out one of my pseudonyms youre as bad as the elephants child when it comes to satiable curiosity it was hardly difficult to guess the author when she used one of my favorite expressions for the titleand then described me so very intimately not three pages from the beginning her expression was woeful oh no not that one he shook an admonishing finger at her i do not think it kind to make me the villain and all because i told you i spent a good deal of the regency in london butbutandre these things follow formulas i didnt really have a choiceanybody french in a regency romance has to be either an expatriate aristocrat or a villain she bit her lip and looked pleadingly at him i needed a villain and i didnt have a cluei was in the middle of that phony medium thing and i had a deadlineand her words thinned down to a whisper to tell you the truth i didnt think youd ever find out youyou arent angry are you he lifted the hair away from her shoulder cupped his hand beneath her chin and moved close beside her i think i may possibly be induced to forgive you the nearchuckle in his voice told her she hadnt offended him reassured by that she looked up at him slyly oh you could he slid her gown off her shoulder a little and ran an inquisitive finger from the tip of her shoulderblade to just behind her ear write another and let me play the hero have you anysuggestions she replied finding it difficult to reply when his mouth followed where his finger had been in that burning passions series perhaps she pushed him away laughing the softcore porn for housewives andre you cant be serious never more he pulled her back think of how much enjoyable the research would be she grabbed his hand again before it could resume its explorations arent we supposed to be resting he stopped for a moment and his face and eyes were deadly serious cherie we must face this thing at strength you need sleepand to relax can you think of any better way to relax body and spirit than no she admitted i always sleep like a rock when you get done with me well then and ii have needs i have not tended to those needs for too long if i am to have full strength and i should not care to meet this creature at less than that excuses excuses she briefly contemplated getting up long enough to take care of the lightsthen decided a little waste of energy was worth it and extinguished them with a thought cmere youlets do some research he laughed deep in his throat as they reached for one another with the same eager hunger she woke late the next morningso late that in a half hour it would have been afternoonand lay quietly for a long contented moment before wriggling out of the tumble of bedclothes and andre no fear of waking himhe wouldnt rouse until the sun went down she arranged him a bit more comfortably and tucked him in thinking that he looked absurdly young with his hair all rumpled and those long dark lashes of his lying against his cheekhe looked much better this morning now that she was in a position to pay attention last night hed been pretty pale and hungrythin she shook her head over him someday his gallantry was going to get him into trouble idiot she whispered touching his forehead all you ever have to do is ask but there were other things to take care ofand to think of a fight to get ready for and she had a premonition it wasnt going to be an easy one so she showered and changed into a leotard and took herself into her barren studio at the back of the apartment to run through her katas three timesonce slow twice at full speedand then into some tai chi exercises to rebalance everything she followed that with a half hour of meditation then cast a circle and charged herself with all of the power she thought she could safely carry without knowing what it was she was to face that was all she could do reallythat and have a really good dinner she showered and changed again into a bright red sweatsuit and was just finishing that dinner when the sun set and andre strolled into the whitepainted kitchen shirtless and blinking sleepily she gulped the last bite of her liver and waggled her fingers at him if you want a shower youd better get a fast onei want to get in place before he comes out for the night he sighed happily over the prospect of a hot shower the perfect way to start onesday petite you may have difficulty in dislodging me now that you have let me stay overnight she showed her teeth dont count your chickens kiddo i can be very nasty mon petitei he suddenly sobered and looked at her with haunted eyes she saw his expression and abruptly stopped teasing andreplease dont say iti cant give you any better answer now than i could when you first askedif icared for you as more than a friend he sighed again less happily then i will say no more because you wish itbutwhat of this notionwould you permit me to stay with you no more than that i could be of some use to you i think and i would take nothing from you that you did not offer first i do not like it that you are so much alone it did not matter when we first met but you are collecting powerful enemies cherie i she wouldnt look at him but only at her hands clenched whiteknuckled on the table unless there are others he prompted hesitantly nono there isnt anyone but you she sat in silence for a moment then glanced back up at him with one eyebrow lifted sardonically you do rather spoil a girl for anyone elses attentions he was genuinely startled mille pardons cherie he stuttered ii did not know she managed a feeble chuckle oh andre you idioti like being spoiled i dont get many things that are just for me she sighed then gave in to his pleading eyes all right then move in if you want it is what you want that concerns me i want she said very softly justthe commitmentdont ask for it ive got responsibilities as well as power you know that icant see how to balance them with what you offered before enough he silenced her with a wave of his hand the words are unsaid we will speak of this no more unless you wish it i seek the embrace of warm water she turned her mind to the dangers ahead resolutely pushing the dangers he represented into the back of her mind and i will go bail the car out of the garage he waited until he was belted in on the passengers side of the car to comment on her outfit i did not know you planned to race him diana he said with a quirk of one corner of his mouth urban camouflage she replied dodging two taxis and a kamikaze panel truck joggers are everywhere and they run at night a lot in deserted neighborhoods cops wont wonder about me or try to stop me and our boy wont be surprised to see me alone one of his other victims was out running his boyfriend thought hed had a heart attack poor thing he wasnt one of us so i didnt enlighten him there are some things its better the survivors dont know oui left here cherie the traffic thinned down to a trickle then to nothing there are odd little islands in new york at night places as deserted as the loneliest country road the area where andre directed her was one such by day it was small warehouses one floor factories an odd store or two none of them had enough business to warrant running second or third shifts and the neighborhood had not been gentrified yet so no one actually lived here there were a handful of nightwatchmen perhaps but most of these places depended on locks burglaralarms and dogs that were released at night to keep out intruders there andre pointed at a building that appeared to be home to several small manufactories he took the smokeform and went to roost in the elevator control house at the top that is why i did not advise going against him by day is he there now diana peered up through the glare of sodiumvapor lights but couldnt make out the top of the building andre closed his eyes a frown of concentration creasing his forehead no he said after a moment i think he has gone hunting she repressed a shiver then its time to play bait diana found a parking space marked dimly with the legend presidentshe thought it unlikely it would be wanted within the next few hours it was deep in the shadow of the building andre had pointed out and her car was deadblack with any luck cops coming by wouldnt even notice it was there and start to wonder she hopped out locking her door behind her looking now exactly like the lone jogger she was pretending to be and set off at an easy pace she did not look back if absolutely necessary she knew shed be able to keep this up for hours she decided to take all the northsouth streets first then weave back along the eastwest before the first hour was up she was wishing shed dared bring a walkthingevery street was like every other street blank brick walls broken by dusty barred windows and metal doors alleys with only the occasional dumpster visible refuse blowing along the gutters she was bored her nervousness had worn off and she was lonely she ran from light to darkness from darkness to light and saw and heard nothing but the occasional rat then he struck just when she was beginning to get a little careless careless enough not to see him arrive one moment there was nothing the next he was before her waiting halfway down the block she knew it was himhe was exactly as andre had described him a nondescript oriental man in a dark windbreaker and slacks he was tall for an orientaltaller than she by several inches his appearance nearly startled her into stoppingthen she remembered that she was supposed to be an innocent jogger and resumed her steady trot she knew he meant her to see him he was standing directly beneath the streetlight and right in the middle of the sidewalk she would have to swerve out of her path to avoid him she started to do just that ignoring him as any real jogger would havewhen he raised his head and smiled at her she was stopped dead in her tracks by the purest terror she had ever felt in her life she froze as all of his other victims must haveunable to think unable to cry out unable to run her legs had gone numb and nothing existed for her but that terrible smile and those hard black eyes that had no bottom then the smile vanished and the eyes flinched away diana could move again and staggered back against the brick wall of the building behind her her breath coming in harsh pants the brick rough and comforting in its reality beneath her hands diana it was andres voice behind her imall right she said not at all sure that she really was andre strode silently past her face grim and purposeful the man seemed to sense his purpose and smiled again but andre never faltered for even the barest moment the smile wavered and faded the man fell back a step or two surprised that his weapon had failed him then he scowled and pulled something out of the sleeve of his windbreaker and to dianas surprise charged straight for andre his sneakered feet scuffing on the cement and something suddenly blurring about his right hand as it connected with andres upraised left arm diana realized what it wasalmost too late andrehe has nunchukstheyre wood she cried out urgently as andre grunted in unexpected pain he can kill you with them get the hell out of here andre needed no second warning in the blink of an eye he was gone leaving diana to face the creature alone she dropped into guardstance as he regarded her thoughtfully still making no sound not even of heavy breathing in a moment he seemed to make up his mind and came for her at least he didnt smile again in that terrible wayperhaps the weapon was only effective once she hoped fervently he wouldnt try againas an empath she was doublyvulnerable to a weapon forged of fear they circled each other warily like two cats preparing to fightthen diana thought she saw an openingand took it and quickly came to the conclusion that she was overmatched as he sent her tumbling with a badly bruised shin the next few moments reinforced that conclusionas he continued scatheless while she picked up injury after painful injury she was a brownbelt in karatebut he was a blackbelt in kungfu and the contest was a pathetically uneven match she knew before very long that he was toying with herand while he still swung the wooden nunchuks andre did not dare move in close enough to help she realized as fear dried her mouth she grew more and more winded and she searched frantically for a means of escape that she was as good as dead if only she could get those damn chucks away from him and as she ducked and stumbled against the curb narrowly avoiding the strike he made at her an idea came to her he knew from her movesas she knew from histhat she was no amateur he would never expect an amateurs move from hersomething truly stupid and suicidal so the next time he swung at her she stood her ground as the chuk came at her she took one step forward smashing his nose with the heel of her right hand and lifting her left to intercept the flying baton as it connected with her left hand with a sickening crunch she whirled and folded her entire body around hand and weapon and went limp carrying it away from him she collapsed in a heap at his feet hand afire with pain eyes blurring with it and waited for either death or salvation and salvation in the form of andre rose behind her attacker with one savate kick he broke the mans back diana could hear it cracking like green woodand before her assailant could collapse a second doublehanded blow sent him crashing into the brick wall head crushed like an eggshell diana struggled to her feet and waited for some arcane transformation nothing she staggered to the corpse face flat and expressionlessa sign she was suppressing pain and shock with utterly implacable iron will andre began to move forward as if to stop her then backed off again at the look in her eyes she bent slightly just enough to touch the shoulder of the body with her good handand released the power andre pulled her back to safety as the corpse exploded into flame burning as if it had been soaked in oil she watched the flames for one moment woodenfaced then abruptly collapsed andre caught her easily before she could hurt herself further lifting her in his arms as if she weighed no more than a kitten mon pauvre petite he murmured heading back towards the car at a swift but silent run it is the hospital for you i think saintfrancis she gasped every step jarring her hand and bringing tears of pain to her eyes one of usis on the nightstaffdr crane bien he replied now be silent buthow are you in your car foolish one i have the keys you left in it but i can drive but and i have a license will you be silent how she said disobeying him night school he replied succinctly reaching the car putting her briefly on her feet to unlock the passengerside door then lifting her into it you are not the only one who knows of urban camouflage this time she did not replymostly because she had fainted from pain the emergency room was emptyfor which andre was very grateful his invocation of dr crane brought a thin bearded young man around to the tiny examining cubicle in record time good godalmighty what did you tangle with a bus he exclaimed when stripping the sweatsuit jacket and pants revealed that there was little of diana that was not battered and blackandblue andre wrinkled his nose at the acrid antiseptic odors around them and replied shortly no your ripper the startled gaze the doctor fastened on him revealed that andre had scored whowon he asked at last we did i do not think he will prey upon anyone again the doctors eyes closed briefly andre read prayerful thankfulness on his face as he sighed with relief then he returned to business you must be andre right anything i can supply andre laughed at the hesitation in his voice fear not your blood supply is quite safe and i am unharmed it is diana who needs you the relief on the doctors face made andre laugh again dr crane ignored him right he said turning to the work he knew best she was lightheaded and groggy with the demerol dr crane had given her as andre deftly stripped her and tucked her into her bed shed dozed all the way home in the car i just wish i knew what that thing was she said inconsequentially as he arranged her arm in its light fiberglas cast a little more comfortably i wont be happy until i know then you are about to be happy cherie for i have had the brainstorm andre ducked into the livingroom and emerged with a dusty leatherbound book remember i said there was something familiar about it now i think i know what it was he consulted the index and turned pages rapidlyfound the place he sought and read for a few moments as i thoughtlisten the gakialso known as the japanese vampirealso takes its nourishment only from the living there are many kinds of gaki extracting their sustenance from a wide variety of sources the most harmless are the perfume and music gakiand they are by far the most common far deadlier are those that require blood fleshor souls souls just so to feed or when at rest they take their normal form of a dense cloud of dark smoke at other times like the kitsune they take on the form of a human being unlike the kitsune however there is no way to distinguish them in this form from any other human in the smoke form they are invulnerablein the human form however they can be killed but to permanently destroy them the body must be burnedpreferably in conjunction with or solely by power i said there was something familiar about itit seems to have been a kind of distant cousin andres mouth smiled but his eyes reflected only a longabiding bitterness there is no way you have any relationship with thatthing she said forcefully it had no more honor heart or soul than a rabid beast ii thank you cherie he said slowly the warmth returning to his eyes there are not many who would think as you do their own closedminded stupidity to change the subjectwhat was it made you burn it as you did i would have abandoned it it seemed dead enough i dont knowit just seemed the thing to do she yawned sometimes my instincts just work right suddenly her eyes seemed too leaden to keep open like they did with you she fought against exhaustion and the drug trying to keep both at bay but without success sleep claimed her for its own he watched her for the rest of the night until the leaden lethargy of his own limbs told him dawn was near he had already decided not to share her bed lest any movement on his part cause her paininstead he made up a pallet on the floor beside her he stood over her broodingly while he in his turn fought slumber and touched her face gently well he whispered holding off torpor far deeper and heavier than hers could ever bewhile she was mortal you are not aware to hear so i may say what i will and you cannot forbid dream sleep and dreami shall see you safemy only love and he took his place beside her to lie motionless until night should come again wet wings this was originally for a susan shwartz anthology sisters of fantasy katherine watched avidly chin cradled in her old arthritic hands as the chrysalis heaved and writhed and finally split up the back the crinkled sodden wings of the butterfly emerged first followed by the bloated body she breathed a sigh of wonder as she always did and the butterfly tried to flap its useless wings in alarm as it caught her movement silly thing she chided it affectionately you know you cant fly with wet wings then she exerted a little of her magic just a little brushing the butterfly with a spark of calm that jumped from her trembling index finger to its quivering antenna the butterfly soothed went back to its real job pumping the fluid from its body into the veins of its wings unfurling them into their full glory it was not a particularly rare butterfly certainly not an endangered one nothing but a common buckeye a butterfly so ordinary that no one even commented on seeing them when she was a child but katherine had always found the markings exquisite and she had used this species and the sulfurs more often than any other to carry her magic magic that was a word hard to find written anymore no one approved of magic these days strange that in a country that gave the church of gaia equal rights with the catholic church that no one believed in magic but magic was not correct it was not given equally to all nor could it be given equally to all and that which could not be made equal must be destroyed we always knew that there would be repression and a burning time again she told the butterfly as its wings unfolded a little more but we never thought that the ones behind the repression would come from our own ranks perhaps she should have realized it would happen so many people had come to her over the years drawn by the magic in her books demanding to be taught some had the talent and the will most had only delusions how they had cursed her when she told them the truth they had wanted to be like the heroes and heroines of her stories special powerful she remembered them all the boy she had told regretfully that his telepathy was only observation and the ability to read bodylanguage the girl whose psychic attacks had been caused by potassium imbalances the wouldbe bardic mage who had nothing other than a facility to delude himself and the many who could not tell a tale because they would not let themselves see the tales all around them they were neither powerful nor special at least not in terms either of the power of magic nor the magic of storytelling more often than not they would go to someone else demanding to be taught unwilling to hear the truth eventually they found someone in one of the many movements that sprouted on the fringes like parasitic mushrooms she like the other mages of her time had simply shaken her head and sighed for them but what she had not reckoned on nor had anyone else was that these movements had gained strength and a life of their ownand had gone political somehow although the process had been so gradual she had never noticed when it had become unstoppable those who cherished their delusions began to legislate some of those delusions politically correct they called itand some of the things they had done she had welcomed seeing them as the harbingers of more freedom not less but they had gone from the reasonable to the unreasoning from demanding and getting a removal of sexism to a denial of sexuality and the differences that should have been celebrated from legislating the humane treatment of animals to making the possession of any animal or animal product without licenses and yearly inspections a crime fewer people bothered with owning a pet these daysno not a pet an animal companion and one did not own it one nurtured it not when inspectors had the right to come into your home day or night make certain that you were giving your animal companion all the rights to which it was entitled and the rarer the animal the more onerous the conditions that wouldnt suit you would it horace she asked the young crow perched over the window horace was completely illegal there was no way she could have gotten a license for him she lived in an apartment not on a farm she could never give him the fouracre hunting preserve he required never mind that he had come to her lured by her magic and that he was free to come and go through her window hunting and exercising at will he also came and went with her little spellpackets providing her with eyes on the world where she could not go and bringing back the cocoons and chrysalises that she used for her butterflymagics she shook her head and sighed they had sucked all the juice of life out of the world that was what they had done outside the gray overcast day mirrored the gray sameness of the world they had created there were no bright colors anymore to draw the eye only pastels no passion no fire nothing to arouse any kind of emotions they had decreed that everyone must be equal and no one must be offended ever and they had begun the burning and the banning she had become alarmed when the burning and banning started she knew that her own world was doomed when it reached things like hansel and gretelbanned not because there was a witch in it but because the witch was evil and that might offend witches she had known that her own work was doomed when a book that had been lauded for its portrayal of a young gay hero was banned because the young gay hero was unhappy and suicidal she had not even bothered to argue she simply announced her retirement and went into seclusion pouring all her energies into the magic of her butterflies from the first moment of spring to the last of autumn horace brought her caterpillars and cocoons when the young butterflies emerged she gave them each a special burden and sent them out into the world again wonder imagination joy diversity some she sent out to wake the gifts of magic in others some she sent to wake simple stubborn will discontent rebellion she sowed her seeds here in this tiny apartment of what she hoped would be the next revolution she would not be here to see itbut the day would come she hoped when those who were different and special would no longer be willing or content with sameness and equality at the expense of diversity her doorbuzzer sounded jarring her out of her reverie she got up stiffly and went to the intercom but the face there was that of her old friend piet the environmental engineer of the apartment building and he wore an expression of despair kathy the psicops are coming for you he said quickly casting a look over his shoulder to see if there was anyone listening they made me let them in the screen darkened abruptly oh gods she had been so careful butin a way she had expected it she had been a worldrenowned fantasy writer she had made no secret of her knowledge of realworld magics the psicops had not made any spectacular arrests lately possibly they were running out of victims she should have known they would start looking at peoples pasts she glanced around at the apartment reflexively no there was no hope there were too many thing she had that were contraband the shelves full of books the feathers and bones she used in her magics the freezer full of meat that she shared with horace and his predecessors the wool blankets for that matter they could arrest her on the basis of her jewelry alone the fetishnecklaces she carved and made the medicinewheels and shields and the prayerfeathers she was not native american she had no right to make these things even for private use and she knew what would happen to her the psicops would take her away confiscate all her property and reeducate her drugged brainwashed wired and probed there would be nothing left of her when they finished they had reeducated jim three years ago and when he came out everything even his magic and his ability to tell a story was gone he had not even had the opportunity to gift it to someone else they had simply crushed it he had committed suicide less than a week after his release she had a few more minutes at most before they zapped the lock on her door and broke in she had to save something anything then her eyes lighted on the butterfly his wings fully unfurled and waving gently and she knew what she would do first she freed horace he flew off squawking indignantly at being sent out into the overcast but there was no other choice if they found him they would probably cage him up and send him to a forest preserve somewhere he did not know how to find food in a wildernesslet him at least stay here in the city where he knew how to steal food from birdfeeders and where the best dumpsters were then she cupped her hands around the butterfly and gathered all of her magic all of it this time a great burden for one tiny insect but there was no choice songs and tales magic and wonder power vision will strength she breathed them into the butterflys wings and he trembled as the magic swirled around him in a vortex of sparkling mist pride poetry determination love hope she heard them at the door banging on it ordering her to open in the name of the equal state she ignored them there was at least a minute or so left the gift of words the gift of difference finally she took her hands away spent and exhausted and feeling as empty as an old paper sack the butterfly waved his wings and though she could no longer see it she knew that a drift of sparkling power followed the movements there was a whine behind her as the psicops zapped the lock she opened the window coaxed the butterfly onto her hand and put him outside an errant ray of sunshine broke through the overcast gilding him with a glory that mirrored the magic he carried go she breathed find someone worthy he spread his wings tested the breeze and lifted off her hand to be carried away and she turned full of dignity and empty of all else to face her enemies stolen silver here is the only valdemar short story i have ever done largely because i hate to waste a good story idea on something as small as a short story this first appeared in the anthology horse fantastic silver stamped restively as another horse on the picketline shifted and blundered into his hindquarters alberich clucked to quiet him and patted the stallions neck the beast swung his head about to blow softly into the young captains hair alberich smiled a little thinking wistfully that the stallion was perhaps the only creature in the entire camp that felt anything like friendship for him and possibly the only creature that isnt waiting for me to fail amazingly gentle for a stallion silver had caused no problems either in combat or here on the picketline which was just as well for if he had alberich would have had him gelded or traded off for a more tractable mount gift of the voice of vkandis sunlord or no alberich had enough troubles without worrying about the behavior of his beast he wasnt sure where the graceful creature had come from shinainbred theyd told him chosen for him out of a string of animals liberated from the enemy which meant warbooty from one of the constant conflicts along the borders silver hadnt come from one of the banditnests that was surethe only beasts the bandits owned were as disreputable as their owners horses liberated from the bandits usually werent worth keeping silver probably came from menmellith via rethwellan the king was rumored to have some kind of connection with the horsebreeding bloodthirsty shinain nomads whatever when alberich lost his faithful old smoke a few weeks ago he hadnt expected to get anything better than the obstinate intractable gelding hed taken from its banditowner but fate ruled otherwise the voice chose to honor him with a superior replacement along with his commission the letter that accompanied the paper pointing out that silver was the perfect mount for a captain of light cavalry it was also another evidence of favoritism from above with the implication that he had earned that favoritism outside of performance in the field not a gift that was likely to increase his popularity with some of the men under his command and a beast that was going to make him pretty damned conspicuous in any encounter with the enemy plus one thats an unlucky color those witchyheralds of valdemar ride white horses and the blueeyed beasts may be witches too for all i know the horse nuzzled him again showing as sweet a temper as any ladys mare he scratched its nose and it sighed with content he wished he could be as contented things had been bad enough before getting this commission now there was an uneasy prickly sensation between his shoulderblades as he went back to brushing his new mount down he glanced over his shoulder to intercept the glare of leftenant herdahl the man dropped his gaze and brushed his horses flank vigorously but not quickly enough to prevent alberich from seeing the hate and anger in the hot blue eyes the voice had done alberich no favors in rewarding him with the captaincy and this prize mount passing over herdahl and klaus both his seniors in years of service if not in experience neither of them had expected that he would be promoted over their heads during the weeks wait for word to come from headquarters they had saved their rivalry for each other too bad they didnt murder each other he thought resentfully then suppressed the rest of the thought it was said that some of the priests of vkandis could pluck the thoughts from a mans head it could have been thoughts like that one that had led to herdahls being passed over for promotion but it could also be that this was a test a way of flinging the ambitious young leftenant alberich into deep water to see if he would survive the experience if he did well and good he was of suitable material to continue to advance perhaps even to the rank of commander if he did notwell that was too bad if his ambition undid him then he wasnt fit enough for the post that was the way of things in the armies of karse you rose by watching your back and if the occasion arose sticking careful knives into the backs of your lesscautious fellows and insuring other enemies took the punishment all the while the priests of the sunlord who were the ones who were truly in charge watched and smiled and dispensed favors and punishments with the same dispassionate aloofness displayed by the one god but alberich had given a good account of himself along the border at the corner where karse met menmellith and the witchnation valdemar in the campaign against the bandits there hed earned his rank he told himself once again as silver stamped and shifted his weight beneath the strokes of alberichs brush the spring sun burned down on his head hotter than he expected without the breeze to cool him there was no reason to feel as if hed cheated to get where he was hed led more successful sorties against the bandits in his first year in the field than the other two had achieved in their entire careers together hed cleared more territory than anyone of leftenant rank ever had in that space of timeand when captain anberg had met with one too many arrows the men had seemed willing that the voice chose him over the other two candidates it had been the policy of late to permit the brigands to flourish provided they confined their attentions to valdemar and the menmellith peasantry and left the inhabitants of karse unmolested a stupid policy in alberichs opinion you couldnt trust bandits that was the whole reason why they became bandits in the first place if they could be trusted theyd be in the army themselves or in the temple guard or even have turned mercenary hed seen the danger back when he was a youngster in the academy in his first tactics classes hed even said as much to one of his teachersphrased as a question of courseand had been ignored but as alberich had predicted there had been trouble from the brigands once they began to multiply problems that escalated past the point where they were useful with complete disregard for the unwritten agreements between them and karse they struck everyone and when they finally began attacking villages the authorities deemed it time they were disposed of alberich had just finished cavalry training as an officer when the troubles broke out hed spent most of his young life in the karsite military schools the ultimate authority was in the hands of the voices of course the highest anyone not of the priesthood could expect to rise was to commander but officers were never taken from the ranks many of the rankandfile were conscripts and although it was never openly stated the voices did not trust their continued loyalty if they were given power alberich and many others like him had been selected at the age of thirteen by a voice sent every year to search out young malechildren strong of body and quick of mind to school into officers alberich had both those qualities developing expertise in many weapons with an ease that was the envy of his classmates picking up his lessons in academic subjects with what seemed to be equal ease it wasnt ease it was the fact that alberich studied long and hard knowing that there was no way for the bastard son of a tavern whore to advance in karse except in the army there was no place for him to go no way to get into a trade no hope for any but the most menial of jobs the voices didnt care about a mans parentage once he was chosen as an officer they cared only about his abilities and whether or not he would use them in service to his god and country it was a lonely life thoughhis mother had loved and cared for him to the best of her abilities and hed had friends among the other children of similar circumstances when he came to the academy he had no friends and his mother was not permitted to contact him lest she distract him or contaminate his purity of purpose alberich had never seen her again but both of them had known this was the only way for him to live a better life than she had alberich had no illusions about the purity of the one gods priesthood there were as many corrupt and venal priests as there were upright and more fanatic than there were forgiving he had seen plenty of the venal kind in the tavern had hidden from one or two that had come seeking pleasures strictly forbidden by the one gods edicts he had known they were coming looking for him and had managed to make himself scarce long before they arrived just as somehow he had known when the voice was coming to look for young male children for the academy and had made certain he was noticed and questioned and that he had known which customers it was safe to cadge for a penny in return for running errands or that he had known that drunk was going to try to set the stable afire somehow that was alberichs secret he knew things were going to happen that was a witchpower and forbidden by the voices of the one god if anyone knew he had it but he had also known as surely as he had known all the rest that he had to conceal the fact that he had this power even before he knew the law against it hed succeeded fairly well over the years though it was getting harder and harder all the time the power struggled inside him wanting to break free once or twice overwhelming him with visions so intense that for a moment he was blind and deaf to everything else it was getting harder to concoct reasons for knowing things he had no business knowing like the hiding places of the bandits they were chasing the boltholes and escape routes but it was harder still to ignore them especially when subsequent visions showed him innocent people suffering because he didnt act on what he knew he brushed silvers neck vigorously the dust tickling his nose and making him want to sneeze and between one brushstroke and the next he lost his sense of balance went lightheaded and the dazzle that heralded a visiontocome sparkled between his eyes and silvers neck not here he thought desperately clinging to silvers mane and trying to pretend there was nothing wrong not now not with herdahl watching but the witchpower would not obey him not this time a flash of blue light blinding him the bandits hed thought were south had slipped behind him into the north joining with two more packs of the curs becoming a group large enough to take on his troops and give them an even fight but first they wanted a secure base they were going to make alberich meet them on ground of their choosing fortified ground that this ground was already occupied was only a minor inconvenience one that would soon be dealt with he fought free of the vision for a moment clinging to silvers shoulder like a drowning man both hands full of the beasts silky mane while the horse curved his head back and looked at him curiously the big brown eyes flickered blue briefly like a halfhidden flash of lightning reflecting another burst of sapphire the bandits target was a fortified village a small one built on the top of a hill above the farmfields ordinarily these people would have no difficulty in holding off a score of bandits but there were three times that number ranged against them and a recent edict from the high temple decreed that no one but the temple guard and the army could possess anything but the simplest of weapons not three weeks ago a detachment of priests and a voice had come through here divesting them of everything but knives farmimplements and such simple bows and arrows as were suitable for waterfowl and small game and while they were at it a third of the ablebodied men had been conscripted for the regular army these people didnt have a chance the bandits drew closer under the cover of a brushfilled ravine alberich found himself on silvers back without knowing how hed gotten there without remembering that hed flung saddle and bridle back on the beast no not bridle silver still wore the hackamore hed had on the picketline alberichs bugle was in his hand presumably hed blown the muster for his men were running towards him buckling on swords and slinging quivers over their shoulders blinding flash of cerulean the bandits attacked the village walls overpowering the poor man who was trying to bar the gate against them and swarming inside it hadnt happened yet he knew that with the surety with which he knew his own name it wasnt even going to happen in the next few moments but it was going to happen soon they poured inside cutting down anyone who resisted them then throwing off what little restraint they had shown and launching into an orgy of looting and rapine alberich gagged as one of them grabbed a pregnant woman and with a single slash of his sword murdered the child that ran to try and protect her followed through to her the vision released him and he found himself surrounded by dust and thunder still on silvers back but leaning over the stallions neck as now he led his troops up the road to the village of sunsdale at full gallop hooves pounded the packedearth of the road making it impossible to hear or speak the vibration thrummed into his bones as he shifted his weight with the stallions turns silver ran easily with no sign of distress though all around him and behind him the other horses streamed saliva from the corners of their mouths and their flanks ran with sweat and foam as they strained to keep up the lack of a bit didnt seem to make any difference to the stallion he answered to neckrein and knee so readily he might have been anticipating alberichs thoughts alberich dismissed the uneasy feelings that prompted better not to think that he might have a second witchpower along with the first hed never shown any ability to control beasts by thought before there was no reason to think he could now the stallion was just superbly trained that was all and he had more important things to worry about they topped the crest of a hill sunsdale lay atop the next one just as he had seen in his vision and the brushfilled ravine beyond it there was no sign of trouble this time its been a wild hare he thought disgusted at himself for allowing blind panic to overcome him and for what a daytimenightmare next time ill probably see trolls under my bed he thought just about to pull silver up and bring the rest of his men to a halt when a flash of sunlight on metal betrayed the bandits location he grabbed for the bugle dangling from his left wrist instead and pulled his blade with the right sounded the charge and led the entire troop down the hill an unstoppable torrent of hooves and steel hitting the brigands hidden line like an avalanche sword in hand alberich limped wearily to another body sprawled amid the rocks and trampled weeds of the ravine and thrust it through to make death certain his sword felt heavy and unwieldy his stomach churned and there was a sour taste in his mouth he didnt think he was going to lose control of himself but he was glad he was almost at the end of the battleline he hated this part of the fightingwhich wasnt fighting at all it was nothing more than butchery but it was necessary this scum was just as likely to be feigning death as to actually be dead other officers hadnt been that thoroughand hadnt lived long enough to regret it silver was being fed and watered along with the rest of the mounts by the youngsters of sunsdale the finest fodder and clearest spring water and a round dozen young boys to brush and curry them clean and the men were being fed and made much of by the older villagers gratitude had made them forgetful of the loss of their weapons and many of their men suddenly the army that had conscripted their relatives was no longer their adversary or else since the troops had arrived out of nowhere like vengeance of the sunlord himself they assumed the one god had a hand in it and it would be prudent to resign themselves to the sacrifice and meanwhile the instrument of their rescue probably ought to be well treated except for the captain who was doing a dirty job he refused to assign to anyone else alberich made certain of two more corpses and looked dully around for more there werent any and he saw to his surprise that the sun was hardly more than a fingerbreadth from the horizon shadows already filled the ravine the evening breeze had picked up and it was getting chilly last years weeds tossed in the freshening wind as he gazed around at the long shadows cast by the scrubby trees more time had passed than he thoughtand if he didnt hurry he was going to be late for sundescending he scrambled over the slippery rocks of the ravine cursing under his breath as his boots meant for riding skidded on the smooth rounded boulders the last thing he needed now was to be late for a holy service especially this one the priest here was bound to ask him for a thanksprayer for the victory if he was late it would look as if he was arrogantly attributing the victory to his own abilities and not the hand of the sunlord and with an accusation like that hanging over his head hed be in danger not only of being deprived of his current rank but of being demoted into the ranks with no chance of promotion a step up from stablehand but not a big one he fought his way over the edge and halfran halflimped to the village gates reaching them just as the sun touched the horizon he put a little more speed into his weary aching legs and got to the edge of the crowd in the village square a scant breath before the priest began the first chant he bowed his head with the others and not until he raised his head at the end of it did he realize that the robes the priest wore were not black but red this was no mere village priestthis was a voice he suppressed his start of surprise and the shiver of fear that followed it he didnt know what this village meant or what had happened to require posting a voice here but there was little wonder now why they had submitted so tamely to the taking of their men and the confiscation of their weapons no one sane would contradict a voice the voice held up his hand and got instant silence a silence so profound that the sounds of the horses on the picketline came clearly over the walls horses stamped and whickered a little and in the distance a few lonely birds called and the breeze rustled through the new leaves of the trees in the ravine alberich longed suddenly to be able to mount silver and ride away from here far away from the machinations of voices and the omnipresent smell of death and blood he yearned for somewhere clean somewhere that he wouldnt have to guard his back from those he should be able to trust today this village was saved from certain destruction the voice said his words ringing out but without passion without any inflection whatsoever and for that we offer thanksgiving to vkandis sunlord most high one god to whom all things are known the instrument of that salvation was captain alberich who mustered his men in time to catch our attackers in the very act it seems a miracle during the speech some of the men had been moving closer to alberich grouping themselves around him to bask in the admiration of the villagers or so he thought until the voices tone hardened and his next words proved their real intent it seems a miraclebut it was not he thundered you were saved by the power of the one god whose wrath destroyed the bandits but alberich betrayed the sunlord by using the unholy powers of witchcraft seize him the men grabbed him as he turned to run throwing him to the ground and pinning him with superior numbers he fought them anyway struggling furiously until someone brought the hilt of a knife down on the back of his head he didnt black out altogether but he couldnt move or see his eyes wouldnt focus and a gray film obscured everything he felt himself being dragged off by the armsheaved into darknessfelt himself hitting a hard surfaceheard the slamming of a door then heard only confused murmurs as he lay in shadows trying to regain his senses and his strength gradually his sight cleared and he made out walls on all sides of him close enough to touch he raised his aching head cautiously and made out the dim outline of an illfitting door the floor clearly was dirt and smelled unmistakably of birds they must have thrown him into some kind of shed something that had once held chickens or pigeons he was under no illusions that this meant his prison would be easy to escape out here the chickensheds were frequently built better than the houses for chickens were more valuable than children still once darkness descended it might be possible to get away if he could overpower whatever guards that the voice had placed around him if he could find a way out of the shed if he could get past the voice himself there were stories that the voices had other powers than plucking the thoughts from a mans headstories that they commanded the services of demons tamed by the sunlord while he lay there gathering his wits another smell invaded the shed overpowering even the stench of old birddroppings a sharp thick smell it took a moment for him to recognize it but when he did he clawed his way up the wall hed been thrown against to stand wideeyed in the darkness nails digging into the wood behind him heart pounding with stark terror oil they had poured oil around the foundations splashed it up against the sides of the shed and now he heard them out there bringing piles of dry brush and wood to stack against the walls the punishment for witchery was burning and they were taking no chances they were going to burn him now the noises outside stopped the murmur of voices faded as his captors moved away then the voice called out oncea set of three sharp angry words and every crack and crevice in the building was outlined in yellow and red as the entire shed was engulfed in flames from outside alberich cried out and staggered away from the wall hed been leaning against the shed was bigger than hed thoughtbut not big enough to protect him the oil theyd spread so profligately made the flames burn hotter and the wood of the shed was old weathered probably dry within moments the very air scorched him he hid his mouth in a fold of his shirt but his lungs burned with every breath his eyes streamed tears of pain as he turned staggering searching for an escape that didnt exist one of the walls burned through showing the flames leaping from the wood and brush piled beyond it he couldnt hear anything but the roar of the flames at any moment now the roof would cave in burying him in burning debris look out how he heard the warningor how he knew to stagger back as far as he could without being incinerated on the spothe did not know but a heartbeat after that warning shout in his mind a huge silverwhite shadow lofted through the hole in the burning wall and landed beside him it was still wearing his saddle and hackamore and it turned huge impossibly blue eyes on him as he stood there gaping at it it no him on the stallion snapped at him the roofs about to go whatever fear he had of the beast he was more afraid of a death by burning with hands that screamed with pain he grabbed the saddlebow and threw himself onto it he hadnt even found the stirrups when the stallion turned on his hind feet there was a crack of collapsing wood as fire engulfed them burning thatch fell before and behind them sparks showering as the air was sucked into the blaze hotter but amazingly no fire licked at his flesh once he had mounted alberich sobbed with relief as the cool air surged into his lungsthe stallions hooves hit the ground beyond the flames and he gasped with pain as he was flung forward against the saddlebow then the real pain began the torture of halfscorched skin and the broken bones of his capture jarred into agony by the stallions headlong gallop into the night the beast thundered towards the villagers and they screamed and parted before it soldiers and voice alike were caught unawares and not one of them raised a weapon in time to stop the flight stay on the stallion said grimly into his mind as the darkness was shattered by the red lightning of his own pain stay on stay with me we have a long way to go before were safe stay with me safe where he wanted to askbut there was no way to ask around the pain all he could do was to hang on and hope he could do what the horse wanted an eternity lateras dawn rose as red as the flames that had nearly killed himthe stallion had slowed to a walk dawn was on their right which meant that the stallion was heading north across the border into the witchkingdom of valdemar which only made sense since what hed thought was a horse had turned out to be one of the blueeyed witchbeasts none of it mattered now that the stallion had slowed to a walk his pain had dulled but he was exhausted and out of any energy to think or even feel with what could the witches do to him after all kill him at the moment that would be a kindness the stallion stopped and he looked up trying to see through the film that had come over his vision at first he thought he was seeing double two white witchbeasts and two whiteclad riders blocked the road but then he realized that there were two of them hastily dismounting reaching for him he let himself slide down into their hands hearing nothing he could understand only a babble of strange syllables then in his mind can you hear me iwhat he replied without thinking taver says his names alberich came a second voice in his head alberich can you stay with us a little longer we need to get you to a healer youre going into shock fight it for us your companion will help you if you let him his what he shook his head not in negation in puzzlement where was he all his life hed heard that the witches of valdemar were evilbut and all our lives weve heard that nothing comes out of karse but brigands and bad weather said the first voice full of concern but with an edge of humor to it he shook his head again and peered up at the person supporting him on his right a woman with many laughlines etched around her generous mouth she seemed to fit that first voice in his head somehow so which are you alberich she asked as he fought to stay awake feeling the presence of the stallion his companion like a steady shoulder to lean against deep inside his soul brigand or bad weather neither i hope he replied absently as he clung to consciousness as shed asked good id hate to think of a companion choosing a brigand to be a herald she said with her mouth twitching a little as if she was holding back a grin and a thunderstorm in human guise would make uncomfortable company choosing he asked whatwhat do you mean i mean that youre a herald my friend she told him somehow your companion managed to insinuate himself across the border to get you too thats how heralds of valdemar are made companions choose them she looked up and away from him and relief and satisfaction spread over her face at whatever it was she saw and the rest of it can wait arens brought the healer go ahead and let go well take over from here he took her at her word and let the darkness take him but her last words followed him down into the shadows and instead of bringing the fear they should have given him they brought him comfort and a peace he never expected its a hell of a greeting herald alberich and a hell of a way to get herebut welcome to valdemar brother welcome roadkill this odd little story was first published in marion zimmer bradleys fantasy magazine its the one i always use as an example when people ask me where i get my ideas this one literally came as i was driving to work saw a piece of cardboard skitter across the road in front of me as if it was alive and thought now what if it was alive a gust of wind hit the side of george randals van and nearly tore the steering wheel out of his hands he cursed as the vehicle lurched sideways and wrestled it back into his own lane it was a good thing there werent too many people on the road it was just a damned good thing that mingo road was a fourlane at this point or hed have been in the ditch a mile away it wasnt but all the shift traffic from the airline maintenance base the rockwell plant and the mcdonalddouglas plant where he worked would have put an intolerable strain on a twolane road the stoplight at mingo and rd turned yellow and rather than push his luck he obeyed it instead of doing an okie caution step on the gas fred shes fixin to turn red this was going to be another typical late spring oklahoma day wind gusting up to per and rain off and on used to be when he was a kid itd be dry as old bones by this late in the season but not anymore all the floodcontrol projects and watermanagement dams had changed the microclimate and it was unlikely this part of oklahoma would ever see another dustbowl although with winds like this he could certainly extrapolate what it had been like back then during the thirties the habit of working a mental simulation was so ingrained it was close to a reflex once the thought occurred his mind took over calculating windspeed type of dust carrying capacity of the air he was so intent on the internal calculations that he hardly noticed when the light turned green and only the impatient honk of the car behind him jolted him out of his reverie he pulled the van out into the intersection and the red sportscar behind him roared around him driver giving him the finger as he passed you son of a he noted with satisfaction the macdac parking permit in the corner of the rear window the vanity plate was an easy one to remember hotone hed tell a little fib to the guard at the guard shack and have the jerk cited for reckless driving in the parkinglot that would go on his workrecord and serve him right too if it hadnt been for the combination of the wind gust and the fool in the red iroc he would never have noticed the strange behavior of that piece of cardboard in the median strip but because of the gust he knew which direction the wind was coming from when the iroc screamed right over the centerline heading straight toward a piece of flattened box and the box skittered just barely out of the way as if the wind had picked it up and moved it in time something went off in his brain as he came up even to where the box had been he saw what the thing had been covering roadkill a dead possum at that exact moment he knew what had been wrong with the scene a second before when the box had moved because it had moved against the wind he cast a startled glance in his rearview mirror just in time to see the box skitter back with the wind this time and stop just covering the dead animal that brought all the little calculations going on in his head to a screeching halt george was an orderly man a career engineer whose one fervent belief was that everything could be explained in terms of physics if you had enough data except that this little incident was completely outside his ordered universe he was so preoccupied with trying to think of an explanation for the boxs anomalous behavior that he didnt remember to report the kid in the sportscar at the guardshack he couldnt even get his mind on the new canard specs hed been so excited about yesterday instead he sat at his desk playing with the cadcam computer trying to find some way for that box to have done what it did and coming up dry it should not could not have moved that way and the odds against it moving back to exactly the same place where it had left were unbelievable he finally grabbed his gymbag left his cubicle and headed for the tiny lockerroom macdac kept for those employees who had taken up running or jogging on their lunchbreaks obviously he was not going to get anything done until he checked the site out and he might just as well combine that with his lunchtime exercise today hed run out on mingo instead of around the base a couple of air national guard as cruised by overhead momentarily distracting him hed forgotten exactly where the roadkill had been and before he was quite ready for it he was practically on top of it suddenly he was no longer quite sure that he wanted to do this it seemed silly a fantasy born of too many latenight movies but as long as he was out here the box was nowhere in sight feeling slightly foolish he crossed to the median and took a good look at the body it was halfeaten which wasnt particularly amazing any roadkill that was relatively fresh was bound to get chewed on except that the last time hed seen roadkill on the median it had stayed there until it bloated untouched animals didnt like the traffic they wouldnt go after carrion in the middle of the road if they could help it and there was something wrong with the way the bitemarks looked too old boy scout memories came back tracking and identifying animals by signs the flesh hadnt been bitten off so much as carved offas if the carcass had been chewed by something with enormous buck teeth like some kind of carnivorous horse or beaver nothing in his limited experience made marks like that as a cold trickle ran down his spine a rustle in the weeds at the side of the road made him jump he looked up the box was there in the weeds he hadnt seen it halfhidden there until it had moved it almost seemed as if the thing was watching him the way it had a corner poked out of the weeds like a head his reaction was stupid and irrational and he didnt care he bolted ran all the way back to the guardshack with a chill in his stomach that all his running couldnt warm he didnt stop until he reached the guardshack and the safety of the fencedin macdac compound the sanity and rational universe of steel and measurement where nothing existed that could not be simulated on a computer screen he slowed to a gentle jog as he passed the shack hed have liked to stop because his heart was pounding so hard he couldnt hear anything but if he did the guards would ask him what was wrong he waited until he was just out of sight and then dropped to a walk he remembered from somewhere maybe one of his jogging tapes that it was a bad idea just to stop that his muscles would stiffen actually he had the feeling if he went to his knees on the verge like he wanted to hed never get up again he reached the sanctuary of his airconditioned office and slumped down into his chair still panting he waited with his eyes closed for his heart to stop pounding while the sweat cooled and dried in the gust of metallicflavored air from the vent over his chair he tried to summon up laughter at himself a grown man for finding a flattened piece of cardboard so frightening but the laughter wouldnt come instead other memories of those days as a boy scout returned of the year hed spent at camp where hed learned those meager tracking skills one of the counselors had a grandfather who wasor so the boy claimeda full cherokee medicine man hed persuaded the old man to make a visit to the camp george had found himself impressed against his will as had the rest of the scouts the old man still wore his hair in two long irongray braids and a bone necklace under his plain workshirt he had a dignity and selfpossession that kept all of the rowdy adolescents in awe of him and silent when he spoke hed condescended to tell stories at their campfire several times most of them were tales of what his life had been like as a boy on the reservation at the turn of the centurybut once or twice hed told them bits of odd indian lore not all of it cherokee like the shapechangers george didnt remember what hed called them but he did recall what had started the story one of the boys had seen i was a teenage werewolf before hed come to camp and he was regaling all of them with a vivid description of michael landons transformation into the monster the old man had listened and scoffed that was no kind of shapechanger hed told them scornfully then he had launched into a new story george no longer recalled the words but he remembered the gist of it how the shapechangers would prey upon the indians in a peculiar fashion stealing what they wanted by deception if one wanted meat for instance he would transform himself into a hunters gamebag and wait for the indian to stuff the bag full then shift back and carry the game off while the hunters back was turned if one wanted a new buffalorobe he would transform himself into a stretchingframeor if very ambitious into a tipi and make off with all of the inhabitants worldly goods why didnt they just turn into horses and carry everything off hed wanted to know the old man had shaken his head because they cannot take a living form hed said only a dead one and you do not want to catch them either better for you to pretend it never happened but he wouldnt say what would happen if someone did catch the thief at work he only looked for a brief instant very frightened as if he had not intended to say that much george felt suddenly sick what if these things these shapechangers werent just legend what could they be living on now they wouldnt be able to sneak into someones house and counterfeit a refrigerator but there was all that roadkill enough dead animals along mingo alone each year to keep someone going if that someone wasnt too fastidious and what would be easier to mimic than an old flattened box he wanted to laugh at himself but the laughter wouldnt come this was such a stupid fantasy built out of nothing but a boys imagination and a box that didnt behave the way it ought to instead he only felt sicker and more frightened now he could recall the one thing the old man had said about the creatures and their fear of discovery they do not permit it hed said as his eyes widened in that strange flicker of fear they do not permit it finally he just couldnt sit there anymore he picked up the phone and mumbled something to his manager about feeling sick grabbed his car keys and headed for the parking lot several of the others on the engineering staff looked at him oddly as he passed their desks the secretary even stopped him and asked him if he felt all right he mumbled something at her that didnt change her look of concern and assured her that he was going straight home he told himself that he was going to do just that he even had his turnsignal on for a righthand turn fully intending to take the onramp at pine and take the freeway home but instead he found himself turning left where the roadkill was still lying he saw it as he came up over the rise and the box was lying on top of it once again suddenly desperate to prove to himself that this entire fantasy hed created around a dead possum and a piece of cardboard was nothing more than that he jerked the wheel over and straddled the median gunning the engine and heading straight for the dingy brown splotch of the flattened box there was no wind now if the thing moved it would have to do so under its own power he floored the accelerator determined that the thing wasnt going to escape his tires it didnt move he felt a sudden surge of joy then the thing struck it leapt up at the last possible second landing with a splat splayed across his windshield he had a brief horrifying impression of some kind of face flattened and distorted red eyes and huge beaverlike teeth as long as his hand then it was gone and the car was out of control tires screaming wheel wrenching under his hands he pumped his brakesonce twicethen the pedal went flat to the floor and as the car heeled over on two wheels beginning a highspeed roll that could have only one ending that analytical part of his mind that was not screaming in terror was calculating just how easy it would be for a pair of huge chisellike teeth to shear through a brakeline operation desert fox mercedes lackey and larry dixon larry and i wrote this for the keith laumer bolo anthology but it stands pretty well alone all you have to know is that bolos are fairly unstoppable selfaware intelligent tanks mercedes lackey and larry dixon siegfried oharrigans name had sometimes caused confusion although the service tended to be colorblind he was black slight of build and descended from a woman whose african tribal name had been long since lost to her descendants he wore both caucasian namessiegfried and oharriganas badges of high honor however as had all of that ladys descendants many times although it might have been politically correct to do so siegfrieds ancestors had resisted changing their name to something more ethnic their name was a giftand not a badge of servitude to anyone one did not return a gift especially not one steeped in the love of ancestors siegfried had heard the story many times as a child and had never tired of it the tale was the modern equivalent of a fairytale it had been so very unlikely oharrigan had been the name of an irishborn engineer fresh off the boat himself who had seen siegfrieds manytimesgreat grandmother and her infant son being herded down the gangplank and straight to the richmond virginia slave market she had been perhaps thirteen years old when the arab slavetraders had stolen her that she had survived the journey at all was a miracle and she was the very first thing that oharrigan set eyes on as he stepped onto the dock in this new land of freedom the irony had not been lost on him sick and frightened the woman had locked eyes with sean oharrigan for a single instant but that instant had been enough they had shared neither language nor race but perhaps sean had seen in her eyes the antithesis of everything he had come to america to find his people had suffered virtual slavery at the hands of the english landlords he knew what slavery felt like he was outraged and felt that he had to do something he could not save all the slaves offloaded this daybut he could help these two he had followed the traders to the market and bought the woman and her child off the coffle paying for them before they could be put up on the auctionblock before they could even be warehoused he fed them cared for them until they were strong and then put them on another boat this time as passengers before the woman could learn much more than his name the rest the oharrigans learned later from seans letters long after the boat was headed back to africa to the newlyfounded nation of liberia a place of hope for freed slaves whose very name meant land of liberty life there would not be easy for them but it would not be a life spent in chains suffering at the whims of men who called themselves master thereafter the woman and her children wore the name of oharrigan proudly in memory of the strangers kindnessas many other citizens of the newlyformed nation would wear the names of those who had freed them no the oharrigans would not change their name for any turn of politics respect earned was infinitely more powerful than any messages beaten into someone by whips or media and as for the name siegfriedthat was also in memory of a strangers kindness this time a member of rommels afrika korps another random act of kindness this time from a first lieutenant who had seen to it that a captured black man with the name oharrigan was correctly identified as liberian and not as american he had then seen to it that john oharrigan was treated well and released john had named his firstborn son for that german because the young lieutenant had no children of his own the tradition and the story that went with it had continued down the generations joining that of sean oharrigan siegfrieds people remembered their debts of honor siegfried oharrigans name was at violent odds with his appearance he was neither blond and tall nor short and redhairedand in fact he was not caucasian at all in this much he matched the colonists of bachmans world most of whom were of east indian and pakistani descent in every other way he was totally unlike them he had been in the military for most of his life and had planned to stay in he was happy in uniform and for many of the colonists here that was a totally foreign concept both of those stories of his ancestors were in his mind as he stood travelweary and yet excited before a massive piece of the machinery of war a glorious hulk of purposebuilt design it was larger than a good many of the buildings of this faroff colony at the edges of human space bachmans world a poor colony known only for its single export of a medicinal desert plant it was not a place likely to attract a tourist trade those who came here left because life was even harder in the slums of calcutta or the perpetually typhoonswept mudflats of bangladesh they were farmers who grew vast acreages of the saje for export and irrigated just enough land to feed themselves a hot dry wind blew sand into the tight curls of his hair and stirred the short sleeves of his desertkhaki uniform it occurred to him that he could not have chosen a more appropriate setting for what was likely to prove a lifelong exile considering his hobbyhis obsession and yet it was an exile he had chosen willingly even eagerly this behemoth this juggernaut this mountain of gleaming metal was a bolo now it was his bolo his partner a partner whose workings he knew intimately and whose thought processes suited his so uniquely that there might not be a similar match in all the galaxy rml outmoded now and facing retirementwhich for a bolo meant deactivation extinction in other words bolos were more than supertanks more than war machines for they were inhabited by some of the finest ais in human space when a bolo was retired so was the ai permanently there were those even now who were lobbying for ai rights who equated deactivation with murder they were opposed by any number of specialinterest groups beginning with religionists who objected to the notion than anything housed in a body of electronic circuitry could be considered human enough to murder no matter which side won nothing would occur soon enough to save this particular bolo siegfried had also faced retirement for the same reason outmoded he had specialized in weaponssystems repair the specific delicate tracking and targeting systems which were now outmoded outofdate he had been deemed too old to retrain he had been facing an uncertain future relegated to some deadend job with no chance for promotion or more likely given an earlyout option he had applied for a transfer listing in desperation everything that might give him an edge somewhere on the advice of his superiors he had included his background and his hobby of military strategy of the preatomic period and to his utter amazement it had been that background and hobby that had attracted the attention of someone in the reserves someone who had been looking to make a most particular match the wind died no one with any sense moved outside during the heat of midday the port might have been deserted but for a lone motor running somewhere in the distance the bolo was utterly silent but siegfried knew that hehe not itwas watching him examining him with a myriad of sophisticated instruments by now he probably even knew how many fillings were in his mouth how many grommets in his desertboots he had already passed judgment on siegfrieds service record but there was this final confrontation to face before the partnership could be declared a reality he cleared his throat delicately now came the moment of truth it was time to find out if what one administrator in the reservesand one human facing earlyout and a future of desperate scrabbling for employmentthought was the perfect match really would prove to be the salvation of that human and this huge marvel of machinery and circuits siegfrieds hobby was the keydesert warfare tactics and most of all the history and thought of one particular desert commander erwin rommel the desert fox the man his greatest rival had termed the last chivalrous knight siegfried knew everything there was to know about the great tankcommander he had fought and refought every campaign rommel had ever commanded and his admiration for the man whose life had briefly touched on that of his own ancestors had never faded nor had his fascination with the man and his genius and there was at least one other being in the universe whose fascination with the desert fox matched siegfrieds this being the intelligence resident in this particular bolo the bolo that called himself rommel most if not all bolos acquired a name or nickname based on their designationslne became lenny or kkr became kicker whether this bolo had been fascinated by the desert fox because of his designation or had noticed the resemblance of rml to rommel because of his fascination it didnt much matter rommel was as much an expert on his namesake as siegfried was like siegfried rml was scheduled for earlyout but like siegfried the reserves offered him a reprieve the reserves didnt usually take or need bolos for one thing they were dreadfully expensive a reserve unit could requisition a great deal of equipment for the cost of one bolo for another the close partnership required between bolo and operator precluded use of bolos in situations where the partnerships would not last past the exercise of the moment nor were bolo partners often retired to the reserves and not too many bolos were available to the reserves retirement for both bolo and operator was usually permanent and as often as not was in the front lines but luck good or ill it remained to be seen was with rommel he had lost his partner to a deadly virus he had not seen much in the way of combat and he was in nearnew condition and bachmans world wanted a reserve battalion they could not field their ownevery ablebodied human here was a farmer or engaged in the export trade a substantial percentage of the population was of some form of pacifistic religion that precluded bearing armsjanist buddhist some forms of hindu bachmans world was entitled to a reserve force it was their right under the law to have an onplanet defense force supplied by the regular military just because bachmans world was backofbeyond of nowhere and even the most conservative of military planners thought their insistence on having such a force in place to be paranoid in the extreme that did not negate their right to have it their charter was clear the law was on their side sending them a reserve battalion would be expensive in the extreme in terms of maintaining that battalion the soldiers would be fulltimers on full pay there was no baseit would have to be built there was no equipmentthat would all have to be imported that was when one solitary beancounting accountant at high command came up with the answer that would satisfy the letter of the law yet save the military considerable expense the law had been written stipulating not numbers of personnel and equipment but a monetary amount that unknown accountant had determined that the amount so stipulated meant to be the equivalent value of an infantry battalion exactly equaled the worth of one bolo and its operator the recordssearch was on enter one reserve officer searching for a bolo in good condition about to be retired with no current operatorpartner and someone to match him familiar with at least the rudiments of mechwarfare the insides of a bolo and willing to be exiled for the rest of his life finding rml called rommel and siegfried oharrigan hobbyist military historian the government of bachmans world was less than pleased with the response to their demand but there was little they could do besides protest rommel was shipped to bachmans world first siegfried was given a crashcourse in bolo operation he followed on the first regularlyscheduled freighter as soon as his training was over if for whatever reason the pairing did not work he would leave on the same freighter that brought him now came the moment of truth guten tag herr rommel he said in careful german the antique german he had learned in order to be able to read firsthand chronicles in the original language ich bin siegfried oharrigan a moment of silenceand then surprisingly a sound much like a dry chuckle wie gehts herr oharrigan ive been expecting you arent you a little dark to be a storm trooper the voice was deep pleasant and came from a point somewhere above siegfrieds head and siegfried knew the question was a trap of sorts or a test to see just how much he really did know as opposed to what he claimed to know a good many preatomic historians could be caught by that question themselves hardly a storm trooper he countered fieldmarshall erwin rommel would not have had one of those under his command and no nazis either dont think to trap me that easily the bolo uttered that same dry chuckle good for you siegfried oharrigan willkommen the hatch opened silently a ladder descended just as silently inviting siegfried to come out of the hot desert sun and into rommels controlled interior rommel had replied to siegfrieds response but had done so with nothing unnecessary in the way of words in the tradition of his namesake siegfried had passed the test once again siegfried stood in the blindingly hot sun this time at strict attention watching the departing back of the mayor of port city the interview had not been pleasant although both parties had been strictly polite the mayors back was stiff with anger he had not cared for what siegfried had told him they do not much care for us do they siegfried rommel sounded resigned and siegfried sighed it was impossible to hide anything from the bolo rommel had already proven himself to be an adept reader of human bodylanguage and of course anything that was broadcast over the airwaves scrambled or not rommel could access and read rommel was right he and his partner were not the most popular of residents at the moment what amazed siegfried and continued to amaze him was how human the bolo was he was used to ais of course but rommel was something special rommel cared about what people did and thought most ais really didnt take a great interest in the doings and opinions of mere humans no rommel they dont he replied you really cant blame them they thought they were going to get a battalion of conventional troops not one very expensive piece of equipment and one single human but we are easily the equivalent of a battalion of conventional troops rommel objected logically he lowered his ladder and now that the mayor was well out of sight siegfried felt free to climb back into the cool interior of the bolo he waited until he was settled in his customary seat now worn to the contours of his own figure after a year before he answered the ai he now consciously considered to be his best friend as well as his assigned partner inside the cabin of the bolo everything was clean if a little worncoolthe light dimmed the way siegfried liked it this was in fact the most comfortable quarters siegfried had ever enjoyed granted things were a bit cramped but he had everything he needed in here from shower and cooking facilities to multiple kinds of entertainment and the bolo did not need to worry about wasting energy his powerplant was geared to supply fullcombat needs in any and all climates what siegfried needed to keep cool and comfortable was miniscule outside the everpresent desert sand blew everywhere the heat was enough to drive even the most patient person mad and the sun bleached everything to a bonewhite inside was a compact world of siegfrieds own bachmans world had little to recommend it that was the problem its a complicated issue rommel he said if a battalion of conventional troops had been sent here there would have been more than the initial expenditurethere would have been an ongoing expenditure to support them yesthat support money would come into the community i understand their distress rommel would understand of course field marshal erwin rommel had understood the problems of supply only too well and his namesake could hardly do less could it be they demanded the troops in the first place in order to gain that money siegfried grimaced and toyed with the controls on the panel in front of him thats what high command thinks actually there never was any real reason to think bachmans world was under any sort of threat and after a year theres even less reason than there was when they made the request they expected something to bring in money from outside you and i are hardly bringing in big revenue for them indeed they werent bringing in any income at all rommel of course required no support since he was not expending anything his powerplant would supply all his needs for the next hundred years before it needed refueling if there had been a battalion of men here it would have been less expensive for high command to set up a standard mess hall buying their supplies from the local farmers rather than shipping in food and other supplies further the men would have been spending their pay locally in fact local suppliers would have been found for nearly everything except weaponry but with only one man here it was far less expensive for high command to arrange for his supplies to come in at regular intervals on scheduled freightruns the bolo ate nothing they didnt even use local water the bolo recycled nearly every drop and distilled the rest from occasional rainfall and dew siegfried was not the usual soldieronleave when he spent his pay it was generally offplanet ordering things to be shipped in and not patronizing local merchants he bought books not beer he didnt gamble his interest in food was minimal and satisfied by the rems readytoeatmeals that were standard field issue and shipped to him by the crateful and he was far more interested in that fourletter word for intercourse that began with a t than in intercourse of any other kind he was an ascetic scholar such men were not the sort who brought any amount of money into a community he and his partner parked as they were at the edge of the spaceport were a continual reminder of how bachmans world had been cheated and for that reason the mayor of port city had suggestedstiffly but politelythat his and rommels continuing presence so near the main settlement was somewhat disconcerting he had hinted that the peaceloving citizens found the bolo frightening and never mind that they had requested some sort of defense from the military and if they could not find a way to make themselves useful perhaps they ought to at least earn their pay by pretending to go on maneuvers it didnt matter that siegfried and rommel were perfectly capable of conducting such exercises without moving that was hardly the point you heard him my friend siegfried sighed theyd like us to go away not that they have any authority to order us to do soas i reminded the mayor but i suspect seeing us constantly is something of an embarrassment to whoever it was that promised a battalion of troops to bring in cash and got us instead in that case siegfried rommel said gently we probably should take the mayors suggestion how long do you think we should stay away whens the next ship due in siegfried replied theres no real reason for us to be here until it arrives and then we only need to stay long enough to pick up my supplies true with a barelyaudible rumble rommel started his banks of motive engines have you any destination in mind without prompting rommel projected the map of the immediate area on one of siegfrieds controlroom screens siegfried studied it for a moment trying to work out the possible repercussions of vanishing into the hills altogether ill tell you what old man he said slowly weve just been playing at doing our job really thats hardly honorable when it comes down to it even if they dont need us and never did the fact is that they asked for onplanet protection and we havent even planned how to give it to them how about if we actually go out there in the bush and do that planning there was interest in the ais voice he did not imagine it what do you mean by that rommel asked i mean lets go out there and scout the territory ourselves plan defenses and offenses as if this dustball was likely to be invaded the topographical surveys stink for military purposes lets get a real war plan in place what the hellit cant hurt right and if the locals see us actually doing some work they might not think so badly of us rommel was silent for a moment they will still blame high command siegfried they did not receive what they wanted even though they received what they were entitled to but they wont blame us he put a little coaxing into his voice look rommel were going to be here for the rest of our lives and we really cant afford to have the entire population angry with us forever i know our standing orders are to stay at port city but the mayor just countermanded those orders so lets have some fun and showem we know our duty at the same time lets use erwins strategies around here and see how they work we can run all kinds of scenarioslets assume in the event of a real invasion we could get some of these farmers to pick up a weapon thatll give us additional scenarios to run figure troops against you mechs against you troops and mechs against you plus untrained men against troops men against mechs you against another bolotype ai it would be entertaining rommel sounded very interested and as long as we keep our defensive surveillance up and an eye on port city we would not technically be violating orders then lets do it siegfried said decisively like i said the maps they gave us stink lets go make our own then plot strategy lets find every wadi and overhang big enough to hide you lets act as if there really was going to be an invasion lets give them some options log the plans with the mayors office we can plan for evacuations we can check resources theres a lot of things we can do and lets start right now they mapped every dry streambed every dusty hill every animaltrail for months the two of them rumbled across the arid landscape with siegfried emerging now and again to carry surveying instruments to the tops of hills too fragile to bear rommels weight and when every inch of territory within a week of port city had been surveyed and accurately mapped they began playing a game of hide and seek with the locals it was surprisingly gratifying at first after they had vanished for a while the local newschannel seemed to reflect an attitude of and good riddance but then when no one spotted them there was a certain amount of concernfollowed by a certain amount of annoyance after all rommel was their bolowhat was siegfried doing taking him out for some kind of vacation as if bachmans world offered any kind of amusement that was when rommel and siegfried began stalking farmers they would find a good hiding place and get into it well in advance of a farmers arrival when he would show up rommel would rise up seemingly from out of the ground draped in camouflagenet his weaponry trained on the farmers vehicle then siegfried would pop up out of the hatch wave cheerfully retract the camouflage and he and rommel would rumble away talk of vacations ceased entirely after that they extended their range once they were certain that the locals were no longer assuming the two of them were goldbricking rommel tested all of his abilities to the limit making certain everything was still up to spec and on the few occasions that it wasnt siegfried put in a requisition for parts and spent many long hours making certain that the repairs and replacements were bringing rommel up to likenew condition together they plotted defensive and offensive strategies siegfried studied rommels manuals as if a time would come when he would have to rebuild rommel from spare parts they ran every kind of simulation in the bookand not just on rommels computers but with rommel himself actually running and dryfiring against plotted enemies occasionally one of the newspeople would become curious about their whereabouts and lie in wait for them when the scheduled supplies arrived siegfried would give a formal interview reporting in general what they had been doingand then he would carefully file another set of emergency plans with the mayors office sometimes it even made the evening news once it was even accompanied by a clip someone had shot of rommel roaring at top speed across a ridge nor was that all they did as rommel pointed out the presumptive battalion would have been available in emergenciesthere was no reason why they shouldnt respond when local emergencies came up sowhen a flashflood trapped a young woman and three children on the roof of her vehicle it was rommel and siegfried who not only rescued them but towed the vehicle to safety as well when a snowfall in the mountains stranded a dozen truckers siegfried and rommel got them out when a small child was lost while playing in the hills rommel found her by having all searchers clear out as soon as the sun went down and using his heatsensors to locate every source of approximately her size they put out runaway brushfires by rolling over them they responded to maydays from remote locations when they were nearer than any other agency they even joined in a manhunt for an escaped rapistwho turned himself in practically soiling himself with fear when he learned that rommel was part of the searchparty it didnt hurt they were of no help for men trapped in a mine collapse or rather of no more help than siegfrieds two hands could make them they couldnt rebuild bridges that were washed away nor construct roads but what they could do they did often before anyone thought to ask them for help by the end of their second year on bachmans world they were at least no longer the target of resentment those few citizens they had aided actually looked on them with gratitude the local politicians whose careers had suffered because of their presence had found other causes to espouse other schemes to pursue siegfried and rommel were a dead issue but by then the two of them had established a routine of monitoring emergency channels running their private wargames updating their maps and adding changes in the colony to their defense and offense plans there was no reason to go back to simply sitting beside the spaceport neither of them cared for sitting idle and what they were doing was the nearest either of them would ever get to actually refighting the battles their idol had lost and won when high command got their reports and sent recommendations for further readiness preparations and commendations for their community servicesiegfried now wiser in the ways of manipulating public opinion issued a statement to the press about both after that there were no more rumblings of discontent and things might have gone on as they were until siegfried was too old to climb rommels ladder but the fates had another plan in store for them alarms woke siegfried out of a sound and dreamless sleep not the synthesized pseudoalarms rommel used when surprising him for a drill either but the real thing he launched himself out of his bunk before his eyes were focused grabbing the back of the comchair to steady himself before he flung himself into it and strapped himself down as soon as he moved rommel turned off all the alarms but one the proximity alert from the single defensesatellite in orbit above them interior lighting had gone to fullemergency red he scrubbed at his eyes with the back of his hand impatiently finally they focused on the screens of his console and he could read what was there and he swore fervently and creatively one unknown ship sat in geosynch orbit above port city a big one answering no hails from the port and seeding the skies with what appeared to his sleepfogged eyes as hundreds of smaller dropships the mothership has already neutralized the port airtoground defenses siegfried rommel reported grimly i dont know what kind of stealthing devices they have or if theyve got some new kind of drive but they dont match anything in my records they just appeared out of nowhere and started dumping dropships i think we can assume theyre hostiles they had a match for just this in their hundreds of plans unknown ship unknown attackers dropping a pattern of offensive troops of some kind what are they landing he asked playing the console board youre stealthed right to the max rommel told him i dont detect anything like lifeforms on those incoming vessels but my sensors arent as sophisticated as they could be the vessels themselves arent all that big my guess is that theyre dropping either live troops or clusters of very small mechs mobile armor maybe the size of a panzer landing pattern he asked he brought up all of rommels weaponry ais werent allowed to activate their own weapons and they werent allowed to fire on living troops without permission from a human either that was the only real reason for a bolo needing an operator surrounding port city but starting from about where the first farms are rommel ran swift readinesstests on the systems as siegfried brought them up the screens scrolled too fast for siegfried to read them they had a name for that particular scenario it was one of the first possibilities they had run when they began plotting invasion and counterinvasion plans operation cattle drive right if the invaders followed the same scheme he and rommel had anticipated they planned to drive the populace into port city and either capture the civilians or destroy them at leisure he checked their current location it was out beyond the dropzone is there anything landing close to us not yetbut the odds are that something will soon rommel sounded confident as well he should behis ability to project landingpatterns was far better than any humans id say within the next fifteen minutes siegfried suddenly shivered in a breath of cool air from the ventilators and was painfully aware suddenly that he was dressed in nothing more than a pair of fatigueshorts oh well some of the desert foxs battles had taken place with the men wearing little else what they could put up with he could there certainly wasnt anyone here to complain as soon as you think we can move without detection close on the nearest craft he ordered i want to see what were up against and start scanning the local freqs if theres anything in the way of organized defense from the civvies i want to know about it a pause while the ventilators hummed softly and glowing dots descended on several screens they dont seem to have anything siegfried rommel reported quietly once the groundtospace defenses were fried they just collapsed right now they seem to be in a complete state of panic they dont even seem to remember that were out hereno ones tried to hail us on any of our regular channels either thator they think were out of commission he muttered absently or just maybe they are giving us credit for knowing what were doing and are trying not to give us away i hope so the longer we can go without detection the better chance we have to pull something out of a hat an increase in vibration warned him that rommel was about to move a new screen lit up this one tracking a single vessel got one the bolo said shortly im coming in behind his sensor sweep four more screens lit up enhanced front back top and side views of the terrain only the changing views on the screens showed that rommel was moving other than that there was no way to tell from inside the cabin what was happening it would be different if rommel had to execute evasive maneuvers of course but right now he might have still been parked the control cabin and living quarters were heavily shielded and cushioned against the shocks of ordinary movement only if rommel took a direct hit by something impressive would siegfried feel it and if he takes a direct hit by something more than impressivewere slag bolos are the best but they cant take everything the craft is down he pushed the thought away from his mind this was what rommel had been built to dothis moment justified rommels very existence and he had known from the very beginning that the possibility however remote had existed that he too would be in combat one day that was what being in the military was all about there was no use in pretending otherwise get on with the job thats what theyve sent me here to do wasnt there an ancient royal family whose motto was god and my duty then let that be his have you detected any sensor scans from the mothership he asked his voice a harsh whisper or anything other than a forward scan from the landing craft he didnt know why he was whispering not as yet siegfried rommel replied sounding a little surprised apparently these invaders are confident that there is no one out here at all even that forward scan seemed mainly to be a landingaid nobody here but us chickens siegfried muttered are they offloading yet waityes the ramp is down we will be within visual range ourselves in a momentthere more screens came alive siegfried read them rapidly then read them again incredulously mechs he said astonished remotely controlled mechs so it appears rommel sounded just as mystified this does not match any known configuration there is one limited ai in that ship data indicates it is hardened against any attack conventional forces at the port could mount the ship seems to be digging inlook at the seismic reading on b the limited ai is in control of the mechs it is deploying i believe that we can assume this will be the case for the other invading ships at least the ones coming down at the moment since they all appear to be of the same model siegfried studied the screens as they had assumed the mechs were about the size of preatomic panzers and seemed to be built along similar lines armored mechs good against anything a civilian has is that ship hardened against anything you can throw he asked finally there was a certain amount of glee in rommels voice i think not shall we try siegfrieds mouth dried there was no telling what weaponry that ship packedor the mothership held the mothership might be monitoring the dropships watching for attack god and my duty he thought you may fire when ready herr rommel they had taken the dropship by complete surprise destroying it before it had a chance to transmit distress or tactical data to the mothership the mechs had stopped in their tracks the moment the ais direction ceased but rather than roll on to the next target siegfried had ordered rommel to stealth again while he examined the remains of the mechs and the controlling craft hed had an ideathe question was would it work he knew weapons systems knew computerdriven control there were only a limited number of ways such controls could work and if he recognized any of those here he told himself as he scrambled into clothing and climbed the ladder out of the cabin that he would give himself an hour the situation would not change much in an hour there was very little that he and rommel could accomplish in that time in the way of mounting a campaign as it happened it took him fifteen minutes more than that to learn all he needed to know at the end of that time though he scrambled back into rommels guts with mingled feelings of elation and anger the ship and mechs were clearly of human origin and some of the vanes and protrusions that made them look so unfamiliar had been tacked on purely to make both the dropships and armored mechs look alien in nature someone somewhere had discovered something about bachmans world that suddenly made it valuable from the hardware interlocks and the programming modes he had found in what was left of the controlling ship he suspected that the someone was not a government but a corporation and a multiplanet corporation could afford to mount an invasion force fairly easily the best force for the job would of course be something precisely like thiscompletely mechanized there would be no troops to hush up afterwards no leaks to the interstellar press only a nice clean invasionand in all probability a nice clean extermination at the end of it with no humans to protest the slaughter of helpless civilians and afterwards there would be no evidence anywhere to contradict the claim that the civilians had slaughtered each other in some kind of local conflict the mechs and the ai itself were from systems he had studied when he first started in this specialtyoutmoded even by his standards but reliable and when set against farmers with handweapons perfectly adequate there was one problem with this kind of setup from the enemys standpoint it was a problem they didnt know they had yet he filled rommel in on what he had discovered as he raced up the ladder then slid down the handrails into the command cabin now heres the thingi got the access code to command those mechs with a little fiddling in the ais memory nice of them to leave in so many manual overrides for me i reset the command interface freq to one you have and hardwired it so they shouldnt be able to change it he jumped into the command chair and strapped in his hands danced across the keypad keying in the frequency and the code then he saluted the console jauntily congratulations herr rommel he said unable to keep the glee out of his voice you are now a field marshal siegfried yes there was astonishment in rommels synthesized voice you just gave me command of an armored mobile strike force i certainly did and i freed your command circuits so that you can run them without waiting for my orders to do something siegfried couldnt help grinning after all youre not going against living troops youre going to be attacking ais and mechs the next ai might not be so easy to take over but if youre running in the middle of a swarm of friendlies you might not be suspected and when we knock out that one well take over again ill even put the next bunch on a different command freq so you can command them separately sooner or later theyll figure out what were doing but by then i hope well have at least an equal force under our command this is good siegfried you bet its good mein freund he retorted whats more weve studied the bestthey cant possibly have that advantage all rightlets show these amateurs how one of the old masters handles armor the second and third takeovers were as easy as the first by the fourth however matters had changed it might have dawned on either the ais on the ground or whoever was in command of the overall operation in the mothership above that the triple loss of ais and mechs was not due to simple malfunction but to an unknown and unsuspected enemy in that the hostiles were following in the mental footsteps of another preatomic commander who had once stated once is happenstance twice is circumstance but three times is enemy action so the fourth time their forces advanced on a ship they met with fierce resistance they lost about a dozen mechs and siegfried had suffered a bit of a shakeup and a fair amount of bruising but they managed to destroy the fourth ai without much damage to rommels exterior despite the danger from unexploded shells and some residual radiation siegfried doggedly went out into the wreckage to get that precious access code he returned to bad news they know were here siegfried rommel announced that last barrage gave them a silhouette upstairs they know im a bolo so now they know what theyre up against siegfried swore quietly as he gave rommel his fourth contingent of mechs well have they figured out exactly what were doing yet or can you tell siegfried asked while typing in the fourth units access codes i canticantsiegfried the bolo replied suddenly without any inflection at all siegfried there is a problem another i am stretching myresources this time siegfried swore with a lot less creativity that was something he had not even considered the ais they were eliminating were much less sophisticated than rommel drop the last batch he snapped to his relief rommel sounded like himself again as he released control of the last contingent of mechs that was not a pleasurable experience rommel said mildly what happened he demanded as i needed to devote more resources to controlling the mechs i began losing higher functions the bolo replied simply we should have expected that so far i am doing the work of three lesser ais and all the functions you require and maneuvering of the various groups we have captured as i pick up more groups i will inevitably lose processing functions siegfried thought frantically there were about twenty of these invading ships their plan absolutely required that rommel control at least eight of the groups to successfully hold the invasion off port city there was no way theyd be anything worse than an annoyance with only three the other groups could outflank them what if you shut down things in here he asked run basic lifesupport but nothing fancy and i could driverun your weapons systems you could that would help rommel pondered for a moment my calculations are that we can take the required eight of the groups if you also issue battle orders and i simply carry them out but there is a further problem which is he askedalthough he had the sinking feeling that he knew what the problem was going to be higher functions one of the functions i will lose at about the seventh takeover is what you refer to as my personality a great deal of my ability to maintain a personality is dependent on devoting a substantial percentage of my central processor to that personality and if it disappears the bolo paused siegfrieds hands clenched on the arms of his chair it may not return there is a possibility that the records and algorithms which make up my personality will be written over by comparison files during strategic control calculations again rommel paused siegfried this is our duty i am willing to take that chance siegfried swallowed only to find a lump in his throat and his guts in knots are you sure he asked gently are you very sure what youre talking about isis a kind of deactivation i am sure rommel replied firmly the field marshal would have made the same choice rommels manuals were all on a handheld reader he had studied them from front to backwasnt there something in there hold on a minute he ran through the index frantically keyword searching this was a memory function right or at least it was software the designers didnt encourage operators to go mucking around in the ai functions what would a computer jock call what he was looking for finally he found it a tiny section in programmerese not even listed in the index he scanned it quickly and found the warning that had been the thing that had caught his eye in the first place this system has been simulation proven in expected scenarios but has never been fully fieldtested what the hell did that mean he had a guess this was essentially a fullcopy backup of the ais processor he suspected that they had never tested the backup function on an ai with a full personality there was no way of knowing if the restoration function would actually restore a lost personality but the backup memorymodule in question had its own powersupply and was protected in the most hardened areas of rommels interior nothing was going to destroy it that didnt slag him and rommel together and if personality was largely a matter of memory it might work it might not it was worth trying even if the backup procedure was fiendishly hard to initiate they really didnt want operators mucking around with the ais twenty commandstrings later a single memorymod began its simple task rommel was back in charge of the fourth group of mechs and siegfried had taken over the driving he was not as good as rommel was but he was better than he had thought they took groups five and six and it was horriblelistening to rommel fade away lose the vitality behind the synthesized voice if siegfried hadnt had his hands full already literally it would have been worse but with group seven that was when he just about lost it because in reply to one of his voicecommands instead of a got it siegfried what came over the speakers was the metallic affirmative of a simple voiceactivated computer all of rommels resources were now devoted to selfdefense and control of the armored mechs god and my duty siegfried took a deep breath and began keying in the commands for mass armor deployment the ancient commanders were right from the ground there was no way of knowing when the moment of truth came siegfried only realized they had won when the mothership suddenly vanished from orbit and the remaining ais went dead cutting their losses there was nothing in any of the equipment that would betray where it came from whoever was in charge of the invasion force must have decided that there was no way they would finish the mission before someone a regularly scheduled freighter or a surprise patrol discovered what was going on and reported it by that time he had been awake for fifty hours straight he had put squeezebulbs of electrolytic drink near at hand but he was starving and still thirsty with the airconditioning cut out he must have sweated out every ounce of fluid he drank his hands were shaking and every muscle in his neck and shoulders were cramped from hunching over the boards rommel was battered and had lost several external sensors and one of his guns but the moment that the mothership vanished he had only one thought he manually dropped control of every mech from rommels systems and waited praying for his old friend to come back but nothing happenedother than the obvious things that any ai would do restoring all the comfortsupport and lifesupport functions and beginning damage checks and some selfrepair rommel was gone his throat closed his stomach knotted but it wasnt tested that doesnt mean it wont work once more his hands moved over the keyboard with another twenty commandstrings telling that little memorymodule in the heart of his bolo to initiate full restoration he hadnt thought he had water to spare for tearsyet there they were burning their way down his cheeks two of them he ignored them fiercely shaking his head to clear his eyes and continuing the commandsequence damage checks and selfrepair aborted lifesupport went on automatic and siegfried put his head down on the console to rest his burning eyes for a moment just for a moment just ahem siegfried jolted out of sleep cracking his elbow on the console staring around the cabin with his heart racing wildly i believe we have visitors siegfried said that wonderful familiar voice they seem most impatient screens lit up showing a small army of civilians approaching riding in everything from outmoded sandrails to tractors all of them cheering all of them heading straight for the bolo we seem to have their approval at least rommel continued his heart had stopped racing but he still trembled and once again he seemed to have come up with the moisture for tears he nodded knowing rommel would see it unable for the moment to get any words out siegfriedbefore we become immersed in grateful civilianshow did you bring me back rommel asked im rather curiousi actually seem to remember fading out an unpleasant experience how did i get you back he managed to choke outand then began laughing he held up the manual laughing and cried out the famous quote of george patton rommel you magnificent bastard i read your book grey sometimes we write for odd markets i wrote this piece for a magazine called pet bird report which is bird behaviorist sally blanchards outlet for continuing information on parrot behavior and psychology its a terrific magazine and if you have a bird but havent subscribed i suggest you would find it worth your while with twelve birds i need all the help i can get at any rate sally asked me for some fiction and i came up with this for nine years sarah jane lyonwhite lived happily with her parents in the heart of africa her father was a physician her mother a nurse and they worked at a protestant mission in the congo she was happy there not the least because her mother and father were far more enlightened than many another mission worker in the days when victoria was queen taking the cause of healing as more sacred than that of conversion they undertook to work with the natives and made friends instead of enemies among the shamans and medicinepeople because of this sarah was a cherished and protected child although she was no stranger to the many dangers of life in the congo when she was six and far older in responsibility than most of her peers one of the shaman brought her a parrotchick still in quills he taught her how to feed and care for it and told her that while it was a child she was to protect it but when it was grown it would protect and guide her she called the parrot grey and it became her best friendand indeed although she never told her parents it became her protector as well but when she was nine her parents sent her to live in england for the sake of her health and because her mother feared that the climate of england would not be good for greys health she had to leave her beloved friend behind now this was quite the usual thing in the days when victoria was queen and the great british empire was so vast that there was never an hour when some part of it was not in sunlight it was thought that english children were more delicate than their parents and that the inhospitable humors of hot climes would make them sicken and die not that their parents didnt sicken and die quite as readily as the children who were in fact far sturdier than they were given credit forbut it was thought by anxious mothers that the climate of england would be far kinder to them so off they were shipped some as young as two and three torn away from their anxious mamas and native nurses and sent to live with relatives or even total strangers now as mr kipling and mrs hopehodgson have shown us many of these total strangersand no few of the relativeswere bad wicked people interested only in the round gold sovereigns that the childrens parents sent to them for their care there were many schools where the poor lonely things were neglected or even abused where their health suffered far more than if they had stayed safely at the sides of their mamas but there were good schools too and kindly people and sarah janes mama had been both wise and careful in her selection in fact sarah janes mama had made a choice that was far wiser than even she had guessed nanthat was her only name for no one had told her of any otherlurked anxiously about the back gate of the big house she was new to this neighborhood for her slatternly mother had lost yet another job in a ginmill and they had been forced to move all the way across whitechapel and this part of london was as foreign to nan as the wilds of australia she had been told by more than one of the children hereabouts that if she hung about the back gate after tea a strange man with a towel wrapped about his head would come out with a basket of food and give it out to any child who happened to be there now there were not as many children willing to accept this offering as might have been expected even in this poor neighborhood they were afraid of the man afraid of his piercing black eyes his swarthy skin and his way of walking like a great huntingcat some suspected poison in the food others murmured that he and the woman of the house were foreigners and intended to kill english children with terrible curses on the food they offered but nan was faint with hunger she hadnt eaten in two days and was willing to dare poison curses and anything else for a bit of bread furthermore nan had a secret defense under duress she could often sense the intent and even dimly hear the thoughts of others that was how she avoided her mother when it was most dangerous to approach her as well as avoiding other dangers in the streets themselves nan was certain that if this man had any ill intentions she would know it still as teatime and twilight both approached she hung back a little from the wroughtiron gate beginning to wonder if it wouldnt be better to see what if anything her mother brought home if shed found a jobor a genlmunthere might be a farthing or two to spare for food before aggie spent the rest on gin behind the high grimy wall the big house loomed dark and ominous against the smoky lowering sky and the strange carved creatures sitting atop every pillar in the wall and every corner of the house fair gave nan the shivers whenever she looked at them there were no two alike and most of them were beasts out of a rummys worst deliriums the only one that nan could see that looked at all normal was a big grey bird with a fat body and a hooked beak that sat on top of the righthand gatepost of the back gate nan had no way to tell time but as she waited growing colder and hungrierand more nervouswith each passing moment she began to think for certain that the other children had been having her on teatime was surely long over the tale theyd told her was nothing more than that something to gull the newcomer with it was getting dark there were no other children waiting and after dark it was dangerous even for a child like nan wise in the ways of the evil streets to be abroad disappointed and with her stomach a knot of pain nan began to turn away from the gate i think that there is no one here missy sab said a low deep voice heavily accented sounding disappointed nan hastily turned back and peering through the gloom she barely made out a tall dark form with a smaller one beside it no karamjitlook there replied the voice of a young girl and the smaller form pointed at nan a little girl ran up to the gate and waved through the bars hello im sarahwhats your name would you like some teabread weve plenty the girls voice also strangely accented had none of the imperiousness that nan would have expected coming from the child of a toff she sounded only friendly and helpful and that more than anything was what drew nan back to the wroughtiron gate indeed missy sarah speaks the truth the man said and as nan drew nearer she saw that the other children had not exaggerated when they described him his head was wrapped around in a cloth he wore a long highcollared coat of some bright stuff and white trousers that were tucked into glossy boots he was as fiercely erect as the iron gate itself lean and angular as a hunting tiger with skin so dark she could scarcely make out his features and eyes that glittered at her like beads of black glass but strangest and perhaps most ominous of all nan could sense nothing from the dark man he might not even have been there there was a blank wall where his thoughts should have been the little girl beside him was perfectly ordinary by comparison a bright little wren of a thing not pretty but sweet with a trusting smile that went straight to nans heart nan had a motherly side to her the younger children of whatever neighborhood she lived in tended to flock to her look up to her and follow her lead she in her turn tried to keep them out of trouble and whenever there was extra to go around she fed them out of her own scant stocks but the tall fellow frightened her and made her nervous especially when further moments revealed no more of his intentions than nan had sensed before the girls bright eyes noted that and she whispered something to the dark man as nan withdrew a little he nodded and handed her a basket that looked promisingly heavy then he withdrew out of sight leaving the little girl alone at the gate the child pushed the gate open enough to hand the basket through please wont you come and take this its awfully heavy in spite of the clear and open brightness of the little girls thoughts ten years of hard living had made nan suspicious the child might know nothing of what the dark man wanted woire yer givin food away she asked edging forward a little but not yet quite willing to take the basket the little girl put the basket down on the ground and clasped her hands behind her back well memsab says that she wont tell maya and selim to make less food for tea because she wont have us going hungry while were growing and she says that old stale toast is fit only for starlings so people ought to have the good of it before it goes stale and she says that theres no reason why children outside our gate have to go to bed hungry when we have enough to share and my mum and da say that sharing is charity and charity is one of the cardinal virtues so memsab is being virtuous which is a good thing because shell go to heaven and she would make a good angel most of that came out in a rush that quite bewildered nan especially the last about cardinal virtues and heaven and angels but she did understand that memsab whoever that was must be one of those daft religious creatures that gave away food free for the taking and nans own mum had told her that there was no point in letting other people take what you could get from people like that so nan edged forward and made a snatch at the baskethandle she tried that is it proved a great deal heavier than shed thought and she gave an involuntary grunt at the weight of it be careful the little girl admonished mischievously its heavy yer moighto warned me nan said a bit indignant and more than a bit excited if this wasnt a trickif there wasnt a brick in the basketoh shed eat well tonight and tomorrow too come back tomorrow the little thing called as she shut the gate and turned and skipped towards the house remember me im sarah jane and ill bring the basket tomorrow thenkee sarah jane nan called back belatedly then just in case these strange creatures would think better of their generosity she made the basket and herself vanish into the night she came earlier the next day bringing back the nowempty basket and found sarah jane waiting at the gate to her disappointment there was no basket waiting beside the child and nan almost turned back but sarah saw her and called to her before she could fade back into the shadows of the streets karamjit is bringing the basket in a bit the child said theres things memsab wants you to have andwhat am i to call you its rude to call you girl but i dont know your name nan nan replied feeling as if a cart had run over her this child though younger than nan herself had a way of taking over a situation that was all out of keeping with nans notion of how things were wot kindo place is this anyway its a school a boardingschool sarah said promptly memsab and her husband have it for the children of people who live in india mostly memsab cant have children herself which is very sad but she says that means she can be a mother to us memsab came from india and thats where karamjit and selim and maya and the others are from too they came with her yer mean the black feller nan asked bewildered yer from inju too no sarah said shaking her head africa i wish i was back there her face paled and her eyes misted and nan moved by an impulse she did not understand tried to distract her with questions wots it loik then izit loik lunnun like london oh no it couldnt be less like london nans ploy worked the child giggled at the idea of comparing the congo with a metropolis and she painted a vivid wordpicture of the green jungles teeming with birds and animals of all sorts of the natives who came to her father and mother for medicines mum and da dont do what some of the others dothey went and talked to the magic men and showed them they werent going to interfere in the magic work and now whenever mum and da have a patient who thinks hes cursed they call the magic man in to help and when a magic man has someone that his magic cant help right away he takes the patient to mum and da and they all put on feathers and mum and da give him white medicine while the magic man burns his herbs and feathers and makes his chants and everyone is happy there havent been any uprisings at our station for ever so long and our magic men wont let anyone put black chickens at our door one of them gave me grey and i wanted to bring her with me but mum said i shouldnt now the child sighed and looked woeful again wots a grey nan asked shes a polly a grey parrot with the beautifullest red tail the medicine man gave her to me when she was all prickles he showed me how to feed her with mashedup yams and things shes so smart she follows me about and she can say oh hundreds of things the medicine man said that she was to be my guardian and keep me from harm but mum was afraid the smoke in london would hurt her and i couldnt bring her with me sarah looked up at the fat stone bird on the gatepost above her thats why memsab gave me that gargoyle to be my guardian instead we all have them each child has her own and that ones mine she looked down again at nan and lowered her voice to a whisper sometimes when i get lonesome i come here and talk to her and its like talking to grey nan nodded her head understanding oi useta go an talk t a stachew in onea the yards til we adta move it looked loik me grammum felt loik i was talkin to er i fair did a footstep on the gravel path made nan look up and she jumped to see the tall man with the headwrap standing there as if he had come out of the thin air she had not sensed his presence and once again even though he stood materially before her she could not he took no notice of nan which she was grateful for instead he handed the basket he was carrying to sarah jane and walked off without a word sarah passed the basket to nan it was heavier this time and nan thought she smelled something like roasted meat oh if only theyd given her the drippings from their beef her mouth watered at the thought i hope you like these sarah said shyly as nan passed her the muchlighter empty memsab says that if youll keep coming back im to talk to you and ask you about london she says thats the best way to learn about things she says otherwise when i go out i might get into trouble i dont understand nans eyes widened at the thought that the head of a school had said anything of the sortbut sarah jane hardly seemed like the type of child to lie all roit i spose she said dubiously if youll be ere soll oi the next day faithful as the rising sun sarah was waiting with her basket and nan was invited to come inside the gate she wouldnt venture any farther in than a bench in the garden but as sarah asked questions she answered them as bluntly and plainly as she would any similar question asked by a child in her own neighborhood sarah learned about the dangers of the dark side of london firsthandand oddly although she nodded wisely and with clear understanding they didnt seem to frighten her garn nan said once when sarah absorbed the interesting fact that the opium den a few doors from where nan and her mother had a room had pitched three dead men out into the street the night before yer aint never seen nothin loik that you forget mum and da have a hospital and its very dangerous where they are sarah replied matteroffactly ive seen dead men and dead women and even babies when nkumba came in clawed up by a lion i helped bring water and bandages while mum and da sewed him up when there was a blackwater fever i saw lots of people die it was horrid and sad but i didnt fuss because nkumba and da and mum were worked nearly to bones and needed me to be good nans eyes widened again wot else ysee she whispered impressed in spite of herself after that the two children traded stories of two very different sorts of jungles despite its dangers nan thought that sarahs was the better of the two she learned other things as well that memsab was a completely remarkable woman for she had a sikh a gurkha two moslems two buddhists and assorted hindus working in peace and harmony togetherand mum said in her letter that its easier to get leopards to herd sheep than that memsab was by no means a fool the sikh and the gurkha shared guard duty patrolling the walls by day and night one of the hindu women was the ayah who took care of the smallest children the rest of the motley assortment were servants and even teachers she heard many stories about the remarkable grey who really did act as sarahs guardian if sarah was to be believed sarah described times when she had inadvertently gotten lost she had called frantically for grey who was allowed to fly free and the bird had come to her leading her back to familiar paths grey had kept her from eating some pretty but poisonous berries by flying at her and nipping her fingers until she dropped them grey alerted the servants to the presence of snakes in the nursery always making a patrol before she allowed sarah to enter and once according to sarah when she had encountered a lion on the path grey had flown off and made sounds like a young gazelle in distress attracting the lions attention before it could scent sarah she led it away and didnt come back to me until it was too far away to bother coming back the little girl claimed solemnly grey is very clever nan didnt know whether to gape at her or laugh she couldnt imagine how a mere bird could be intelligent enough to talk much less act with purpose nan had breath to laugh with nowadays thanks to baskets that held more than bread the food she found in there though distinctly odd was always good and she no longer felt out of breath and tired all the time she had stopped wondering and worrying about why memsab took such an interest in her and simply accepted the gifts without question they might stop at any moment she accepted that without question too the only thing she couldnt accept so easily was the manservants eerie mental silence how is your mother sarah asked since yesterday nan had confessed that aggie been on a tear and had consumed or so nan feared something stronger and more dangerous than gin nan shook her head i dunno she replied reluctantly aggie didn wake up when i went out thas not roight she uslly at least waked up tfoind out wha i got she don half loik them baskets cause it means i don go beggin as much and if you dont beg money she cant drink sarah observed shrewdly you hate begging dont you mostly i don like gettin kicked an cursed at nan temporized it aint loik im gettin underfoot but sarahs questions were coming too near the bone tonight and nan didnt want to have to deal with them she got to her feet and picked up her basket i gotter go she said abruptly sarah rose from her seat on the bench and gave nan a penetrating look nan had the peculiar feeling that the child was looking at her thoughts and deciding whether or not to press her further all right sarah said it is getting dark it wasnt but nan wasnt about to pass up the offer of a graceful exit tis that she said promptly and squeezed through the narrow opening karamjit had left in the gate but she had not gone four paces when two roughlooking men in shabby tweed jackets blocked her path you nan killian said one hoarsely then when nan stared at him blankly added aggie killians girl the answer was surprised out of her she hadnt been expecting such a confrontation and she hadnt yet managed to sort herself out yees she said slowly good the first man grunted yer ma sent us shes gone t a new place an she wants us tshow y the way now several thoughts flew through nans mind at that moment the first was that as they were paid up on the rent through the end of the week she could not imagine aggie ever vacating before the time was up the second was that even if aggie had set up somewhere else she would never have sent a pair of strangers to find nan and third was that aggie had turned to a more potent intoxicant than ginwhich meant she would need a deal more money and aggie had only one thing left to sell nan their minds were such a roil that she couldnt hear any distinct thoughts but it was obvious that they meant her no good wait a minnit nan said her voice trembling a little as she backed away from the two men edging around them to get to the street didjer say aggie killians gel me ma aint called killian yer got th wrong gel it was at that moment that one of the men lunged for her with a curse he had his hands nearly on her and would have gotten her too except for one bit of interference sarah came shooting out of the gate like a little bullet she bodyslammed the fellow going into the back of his knees and knocking him right off his feet she danced out of the way as he fell in the nick of time ran to nan and caught her hand tugging her towards the street run she commanded imperiously and nan ran the two of them scrabbled through the dark alleys and twisted streets without any idea where they were only that they had to shake off their pursuers unfortunately the time that nan would have put into learning her new neighborhood like the back of her grimy little hand had been put into talking with sarah and before too long even nan was lost in the maze of dark fetid streets then their luck ran out altogether and they found themselves staring at the blank wall of a building in a deadend culdesac they whirled around hoping to escape before they were trapped but it was already too late the bulky silhouettes of the two men loomed against the fading light at the end of the street oos yer friend ducky the first man purred think shed loik tcome with to nans astonishment sarah stood straight and tall and even stepped forward a pace i think you ought to go away and leave us alone she said clearly youre going to find yourselves in a lot of trouble the talkative man laughed thems big words from such a little gel he mocked we aint leavin wiout we collect whats ours an a bit more fer th trouble yer caused nan was petrified with fear shaking in every limb as sarah stepped back putting her back to the damp wall as the first man touched sarahs arm she shrieked out a single word grey as sarah cried out the name of her pet nan let loose a wordless prayer for something anything to come to their rescue something screamed behind the man startled and distracted for a moment he turned for a moment a fluttering shape obscured his face and he screamed in pain he shook his head violently get it off he screamed at his partner get it off get what off the man said bewildered there aint nothin there the man clawed frantically at the front of his face but whatever had attacked him had vanished without a trace but not before leading more substantial help to the rescue out of the dusk and the first wisps of fog karamjit and another swarthy man ran on noiseless feet in their hands were cudgels which they used to good purpose on the two who opposed them nor did they waste any effort clubbing the two senseless with a remarkable economy of motion then without a single word each of the men scooped up a girl in his arms and bore them back to the school at that point finding herself safe in the arms of an unlookedfor rescuer nan felt secure enough to break down into hysterical tears nor was that the end of it she found herself bundled up into the sacred precincts of the school itself plunged into the first hot bath of her life wrapped in a clean flannel gown and put into a real bed sarah was in a similar bed beside her as she sat there numb a plainlooking woman with beautiful eyes came and sat down on the foot of sarahs bed and looked from one to the other of them well the lady said at last what have you two to say for yourselves nan couldnt manage anything but that was all right since sarah wasnt about to let her get in a word anyway the child jabbered like a monkey a confused speech about nans mother the men shed sold nan to the virtue of charity the timely appearance of grey and a great deal more besides the lady listened and nodded and when sarah ran down at last she turned to nan i believe sarah is right in one thing she said gravely i believe we will have to keep you now both of yousleep and to nans surprise she fell asleep immediately but that was not the end to the story a month later sarahs mother arrived with grey in a cage nan had by then found a place where she could listen to what went on in the best parlor without being found and she glued her ear to the crack in the pantry to listen when sarah was taken into that hallowed room found grey senseless beside her perch sarahs mother was saying i thought it was a fit but the shaman swore that sarah was in trouble and the bird had gone to help grey awoke none the worse and i would have thought nothing more of the incident until your message arrived and so you came very wisely bringing this remarkable bird memsab made chirping noises at the bird and an odd little voice said hello bright eyes memsab chuckled how much of strangeness are you prepared to believe in my dear she asked gently would you believe me if i told you that i have seen this bird once beforefluttering and pecking at my window then leading my men to rescue your child i can only answer with hamlet sarahs mother said after a pause that there are more things in heaven and earth than i suspected good memsab replied decidedly then i take it you are not here to remove sarah from our midst no came the soft reply i came only to see that sarah was well and to ask if you would permit her pet to be with her gladly memsab said though i might question which of the two was the pet clever bird said grey greys ghost i enjoyed the characters in grey so much that i decided to write another novella for this anthology using the same characters you might think of memsab harton as the victorian version of diana tregarde sans vampire boyfriend im toying with the idea of doing an entire book about the harton school nan sarah and grey and id be interested to hear if anyone besides parrotlovers would want to read it when victoria was the queen of england there was a small unprepossessing school for the children of expatriate englishmen that had quite an interesting reputation in the shoddy whitechapel neighborhood on which it bordered a reputation that kept the students safer than all the bobbies in london once a young impoverished beggargirl named nan killian had obtained leftovers at the back gate and most of the other waifs and gutterrats of the neighborhood shunned the place though they gladly shared in nans bounty when she dared the gate and its guardian but now another child picked up food at the back gate of the harton school for boys and girls on the edge of whitechapel in london not nan killian children no longer shunned the back gate of the school although they treated its inhabitants with extreme caution adultsparticularly the criminal disreputable criminals who preyed on childrentreated the place and its inhabitants with a great deal more than mere caution word had gotten around that two childpimps had tried to take one of the pupils and had been found with arms and legs broken beaten senseless word had followed that anyone who threatened another child protected by the school would be found deadif he was found at all the two tall swarthy blackfellas who served as the schools guards were rumored to have strange powers or be members of the thugee cult or worse it was safer just to pretend the school didnt exist and go about ones unsavory business elsewhere nan killian was no longer a child of the streets she was now a pupil at the school herself a transmutation that astonished her every morning when she awoke to find herself in a neat little dormitory room papered with roses curtained in gingham made her often feel as if she was dreaming to then rise with the other girls dress in clean fresh clothing and go off to lessons in the hitherto unreachable realms of reading and writing was more than she had ever dared dream of her best friend was still sarah the little girl from africa who had brought her that first basket of leftovers but now she slept in the next bed over from sarahs and they shared many latenight giggles and confidences instead of leftover teabread nan also had a job she had discovered somewhat to her own bemusement that the littlest children instinctively trusted her and would obey her when they obeyed noone else so nan paid for her tutoring and keep by helping nadra the babies nurse or ayah as they all called her nadra was from india as were most of the servants from the formidable guards the sikh karamjit and the gurkha selim to the cook maya mrs helen hartonor memsab as everyone called herand her husband had once been expatriates in india themselves master hartoncalled with ultimate respect sahib hartonnow worked as an advisor to an import firm his service in india had left him with a small pension and a permanent limp when he and his wife had returned and had learned quite by accident of the terrible conditions children returned to england often lived in they had resolved that the children of their friends back in the punjab at least would not have that terrible knowledge thrust upon them here the children sent away in bewilderment by anxious parents fearing that they would sicken in the hot foreign lands found not a cold and alien place with nothing they recognized but the familiar sounds of hindustani the comfort and coddling of a native nanny and the familiar curries and rice to eat their new home if a little shabby held furniture made familiar from their years in the bungalows but most of all they were not told coldly to be a man or stop being a crybabyfor here they found friendly shoulders to weep out their homesickness on if there were no french masters here there was a great deal of love and care if the furniture was unfashionable and shabby the children were wellfed and rosy it never ceased to amaze nan that more parents didnt send their children to the harton school but some folks mistakenly trusted relatives to take better care of their precious ones than strangers and some thought that a school owned and operated by someone with a lofty reputation or a title was a wiser choice for a boychild who would likely join the civil service when he came of age and as for the girls there would always be those who felt that lessons by french dancingmasters and language teachers lessons on the harp and in watercolor painting were more valuable than a sound education in the same basics given to a boy sometimes these parents learned their lessons the hard way ready for mlesson memsab nan called into the secondbest parlor which was memsabs private domain it was commonly understood that sometimes memsab had to do odd thingsimportant things that we dont need to know about sarah said wiselyand she might have to do them at a moments notice so it was better to announce oneself at the door before venturing over the threshold but today memsab was only reading a book and looked up at nan with a smile that transformed her plain face and made her eyes bright and beautiful by now nan had seen plenty of ladies who dressed in finer stuffs than memsabs simple artistic gown of common stuffs made bright with embroidery courtesy of maya nan had seen ladies who were acknowledged beauties like mrs lillie langtry ladies who obviously spent many hours in the hands of their dressers and hairdressers rather than pulling their hair up into a simple chignon from which little curling strands of browngold were always escaping memsabs jewelry was not of diamonds and gold but odd heavy pieces in silver and semiprecious gems but in nans eyes not one of those ladies was worth wasting a single glance upon then again nan was a little prejudiced come in nan the headmistress said patting the flowered sofa beside her invitingly youre doing much better already you know you have a quick ear thenkee memsab nan replied flushing with pleasure she like any of the servants would gladly have laid down her life for memsab harton they all worshipped her blatantly and a word of praise from their idol was worth more than a pocketful of sovereigns nan sat gingerly down on the chintzcovered sofa and smoothed her clean pinafore with an unconscious gesture of pride memsab took a book of etiquette from the table beside her and opened it looking at nan expectantly go ahead dear good morning maam how do you do i am quite well i trust your family is fine nan began and waited for memsabs response which would be her cue for the next polite phrase the point here was not that nan needed to learn manners and mannerly speech but that she needed to lose the dreadful cadence of the streets which would doom her to poverty forever quite literally nan spoke the commonplace phrases slowly and with great care as much care as sarah took over her french an accurate analogy since the kings english as spoken by the middle and upper classes was nearly as much a foreign language to nan as french and latin were to sarah she had gotten the knack of it by thinking of it exactly as a foreign language once memsab had proven to her how much better others would treat her if she didnt speak like a guttersnipe she was still fluent in the language of the streets and often went out with karamjit as a translator when he went on errands that took him into the slums or chinatown but gradually her tongue became accustomed to the new cadences and her habitual speech marked her less as untouchable beautifully done memsab said warmly when nan finished her recitation your new assignment will be to pick a poem and recite it to me properly spoken and memorized i think id loikeliketo do one uv mr kiplings memsab nan said shyly memsab laughed i hope you arent thinking of gunga din you naughty girl the woman mockchided it had better be one from the jungle book or puck of pooks hill not something written in cockney dialect yes memsab i mean no memsab nan replied quickly ill pick a rightun mebbe the lullaby for the white seal ever since discovering rudyard kiplings stories nan had been completely enthralled memsab often read them to the children as a gotobed treat for the stories often evoked memories of india for the children sent away that will do very well are you ready for the other lesson memsab asked so casually that no one but nan would have known that the other lesson was one not taught in any other school in this part of the world ithink so nan got up and closed the parlor door signaling to all the world that she and memsab were not to be disturbed unless someone was dying or the house was burning down for the next half hour memsab turned over cards and nan called out the next card before she turned it over when the last of the fiftytwo lay in the faceup pile before her nan waited expectantly for the results not at all bad you had almost half of them and all the colors right memsab said with content nan was disappointed she knew that memsab could call out all fiftytwo without an error though sarah could only get the colors correctly sahib brought me some things from the warehouse for you to try your feeling on memsab continued i truly think that is where you true gifts lie dear nan sighed mournfully but knowin the cards would be a lot more useful she complained what so you can grow up to cheat foolish young men out of their inheritances now memsab actually laughed out loud try it dear and the gift will desert you at the time you need it most no be content with what you have and learn to use it wisely to help yourself and others but cardsharpin would help me an i could use takins to help others nan couldnt resist protesting but she held out her hand for the first object anyway it was a carved beetle very interesting nan thought as she waited to feel what it would tell her it felt like pottery or stone and it was of a turquoiseblue shaded with pale brown its old she said finally then really old old asmethusalum it was made for an important man but not a king or anything she tried for more but couldnt sense anything else thats all she said and handed it back to memsab now this the carved beetle that memsab gave her was for all intents and purposes identical to the one shed just held but immediately nan sensed the difference piff that uns new she also felt something else something of intent a sensation she readily identified since it was one of the driving forces behind commerce in whitechapel feller as made it figgers hes put one over on somebody excellent dear memsab nodded they are both scarabs a kind of goodluck carving found with mummieswhich are indeed often as old as methuselah the first one i knew was real as i helped unwrap the mummy myself the second however was from a shipment that sahib suspected were fakes nan nodded interested to learn that this gift of hers had some practical application after all so could be i could tell people when they been gammoned very likely and quite likely that they would pay you for the knowledge as long as they dont think that you are trying to fool them as well here try this the next object placed in nans hand was a bit of jewelry a simple silver brooch with gems of cut iron nan dropped it as soon as it touched her hand overwhelmed by fear and horror lummy she cried without thinking he killed her who they were she had no sense of that would require more contact which she did not want to have but memsab didnt seem at all surprised she just shook her head very sadly and put the brooch back in a little box which she closed without a word she held out a childs locket on a worn ribbon dont be afraid nan she coaxed when nan was reluctant to accept it this one isnt bad i promise you nan took the locket gingerly but broke out into a smile when she got a feeling of warmth contentment and happiness she waited for other images to come and sensed a tired but exceedingly happy woman a proud man and oneno two strong and lively mites with the woman slyly nan glanced up at her mentor shes ad twins asnt she nan asked when was it i just got the letter and the locket today but it was about two months ago memsab replied the lady is my best friends daughter who was given that locket by her mother for luck just before the birth of her children she sent it to me to have it duplicated as she would like to present one to each little girl id ave it taken apart an put half of th old un with half of the new un nan suggested and memsab brightened at the idea an excellent idea and i will do just that now dear are you feeling tired have you a headache weve gone on longer than we did at your last lesson nan nodded quite ready to admit to both memsab gave her stillthin shoulders a little hug and sent her off to her afternoon lessons figuring came harder to nan than reading shed already had some letters before she had arrived enough to spell out the signs on shops and stalls and the like and make out a word here and there on a discarded broadsheet when the full mystery of letters had been disclosed to her mastery had come as naturally as breathing and she was already able to read her beloved kipling stories with minimal prompting but numbers were a mystery arcane and she struggled with the youngest of the children to comprehend what they meant anything past one hundred baffled her for the moment and sarah did her best to help her friend after arithmetic came geography but for a child to whom kensington palace was the end of the universe it was harder to believe in the existence of arabia than of fairyland and heaven was quite as real and solid as south america for she reckoned that she had an equal chance of seeing either as for how all those odd names and shapes fit together well history came easier although she didnt yet grasp that it was as real as yesterday for to nan it was just a chain of linking stories perhaps that was why she loved the kipling stories so much for she often felt as outofplace as mowgli when the humantribe tried to reclaim him at the end of lessons nan usually went to help nadra in the nursery the children there ranging in age from two to five were a handful when it came to getting them bathed and put to bed they tried to put off bedtime as long as possible there were a halfdozen of them which was just enough that when nadra had finally gotten two of them into a bathtub the other four had escaped and were running about the nursery like dripping naked apes screaming joyfully at their escape but tonight karamjit came for nan and sarah as soon as the history lesson was over summoning them with a look and a gesture as always the african parrot grey sat on sarahs shoulder she was so wellbehaved even to the point of being housebroken that he was allowed to be with her from morning to night the handsome grey parrot with the bright red tail had adapted very well to this new sort of jungle when sarahs mother brought her to her daughter sarah was very careful to keep her warm and out of drafts and she ate virtually the same food that she did memsab seemed to understand the kind of diet that let her thrive she allowed her only a little of the chicken and beef and made certain that she filled up on carrots and other vegetables before she got any of the curried rice she loved so much in fact she often pointed to grey as an example to the other children who would rather have had sweets than green stuffs telling them that grey was smarter than they were for she knew what would make her grow big and strong being unfavorably compared to a bird often made the difference with the little boys in particular who were behaving better at table since the parrot came to live at the school so grey came along when karamjit brought them to the door of memsabs parlor cautioning them to wait quietly until memsab called them what do you suppose can be going on sarah asked curiously while grey turned her head to look at nan with her penetrating paleyellow eyes nan shushed her pressing her ear to the keyhole to see what she could hear theres another lady in there with memsab and she sounds sad nan said at last grey cocked her head to one side then turned his head upside down as she sometimes did when something puzzled her hurt she said quietly and made a little sound like someone crying nan had long since gotten used to the fact that grey noticed everything that went on around her and occasionally commented on it like a human person if the wolves in the jungle book could think and talk she reasoned why not a parrot she accepted greys abilities as casually as sarah who had raised her herself and had no doubt of the intelligence of her feathered friend had either of them acquired the wisdom of their elders they might have been surprised that memsab accepted those abilities too nan jumped back as footsteps warned her that the visitor had risen and was coming towards the door she and sarah pressed themselves back against the wall as the strange woman passed them her face hidden behind a veil she took no notice of the children but turned back to memsab katherine i believe going to this woman is a grave mistake on your part memsab told her quietly you and i have been friends since we were in school together you know that i would never advise you against anything you felt so strongly about unless i thought you might be harmed by it this woman does you no good the woman shook her head how could i be harmed by it she replied her voice trembling what possible ill could come of this a very great deal i fear memsab her expression some combination of concern and other emotions that nan couldnt read impulsively the woman reached out for memsabs hand then come with me she cried if this woman cannot convince you that she is genuine and that she provides me with what i need more than breath then i will not see her again memsabs eyes looked keenly into her friends easily defeating the concealment of the veil about her features you are willing to risk her unmasking as a fraud and the pain for you that will follow i am certain enough of her that i know that you will be convinced even against your will the woman replied with certainty memsab nodded very well then you and iand these two girlswill see her together only now did the woman notice sarah and nan and her brief glance dismissed them as unimportant i see no reason why you wish to have children along but if you can guarantee they will behave and that is what it takes you to be convinced to see madame varonsky then so be it i will have an invitation sent to you for the next seance memsab smiled and patted her friends hand sometimes children see things more clearly than we adults do was all she replied i will be waiting for that invitation the woman squeezed memsabs hand then turned and left ushered out by one of the native servants memsab gestured to the two girls to precede her into the parlor and shut the door behind them what did you think of the lady nan asked their teacher as the two children took their places sidebyside on the loveseat they generally shared when they were in the parlor together nan assessed the woman as would any streetchild economics came first shes in mournin an shes gentry nan replied automatically silk gowns fer mournin is somethin only gentry kin afford i spect shes easy t gammon too paid no attention tus an i was near enough t get me hand into er purse an her never knowin till she was home an she didn ask fer a cab t be brung sos i reckon she keeps er carriage thats not jest gentry thas quality right on all counts my dear memsab said a bit grimly katherine has no more sense than one of the babies and never had her parents didnt spoil her but they never saw any reason to educate her in practical matters they counted on her finding a husband who would do all her thinking for her and as a consequence she is pliant to any hand that offers mastery she married into money her husband has a very high position in the colonial government nothing but the best school would do for her boy and a spoiled little lad he was too grey suddenly began coughing most realistically a series of terrible racking coughs and sarah turned her head to look into her eyes then she turned back to memsab hes dead isnt he the child said quite matteroffactly he got sick and died thats who shes in mourning for quite right and as grey showed us he caught pneumonia memsab looked grim poor food icy rooms and barbaric treatment she threw up her hands and shook her head theres no reason to go on at least katherine has decided to trust her twins to us instead of the school her husband wanted shell bring them to nadra tomorrow nan and theyll probably be terrified so im counting on you to help nadra soothe them nan could well imagine that they would be terrified not only were they being left with strangers but they would know at least dimly that their brother had come away to school and died they would be certain that the same was about to happen to them that however is not why i sent for you memsab continued katherine is seeing a medium do either of you know what that is sarah and nan shook their heads but grey made a rude noise sarah looked shocked but nan giggled and memsab laughed i am afraid that grey is correct in her opinions for the most part the woman told them a medium is a person who claims to speak with the dead and help the souls of the dead speak to the living her mouth compressed and nan sensed her carefully controlled anger all this is accomplished for a very fine fee i might add ho like them gypsy palmreaders an the conjuremen nan exclaimed in recognition aye theres a morta gammon there and thats sure you reckon this ladys been gammoned then yes i do and i would like you twothree she amended with a penetrating look at grey to help me prove it nan if there is trickery afoot do you think you could catch it nan had no doubt i bet i could she said cant be hardern keepin a hand out uv yer pocketor grabbin the wrist once its in good girlyou must remember to speak properly and only when youre spoken to though memsab warned her if this socalled medium thinks you are anything but a gentlyreared child she might find an excuse to dismiss the seance she turned to sarah now if by some incredible chance this woman is genuine could you and grey tell sarahs head bobbed so hard her curls tumbled into her eyes yes memsab she said with as much confidence as nan mluko the medicine man that gave me grey said that grey could tell when the spirits were there and someday i might too did he now memsab gave her a curious look how interesting well if grey can tell us if there are spirits or not that will be quite useful enough for our purposes are either of you afraid to go with me i expect the invitation will come quite soon again memsab had that grim look katherine is too choice a fish to be allowed to swim free for long the madame will want to keep her under her control by consulting with her as often as possible sarah looked to nan for guidance and nan thought that her friend might be a little fearful despite her brave words but nan herself only laughed i aint afraid of nobodys sham ghost she said curling her lip scornfully an i aint sure id be afraid uv a real one wisely said nan spirits can only harm us as much as we permit them to nan thought that memsab looked relieved like maybe she hadnt wanted to count on their help until she actually got it thank you both of you she reached out and took their hands giving them a squeeze that said a great deal without words now both of you get back to whatever it was that i took you from i will let you know in plenty of time when our excursion will be it was past the babies bedtime so sarah and nan went together to beg maya for their delayed tea and carried the tray themselves up to the nowdeserted nursery they set out the teathings on one of the little tables feeling a mutual need to discuss memsabs strange proposition grey had her tea too a little bowl of curried rice carrots and beans they set it down on the table and grey climbed carefully down from sarahs shoulder to the tabletop where she selected a bean and ate it neatly holding in on one claw while she took small bites watching them both do you think there might be real ghosts sarah asked immediately shivering a little i mean what if this lady can bring real ghosts up grey and nan made the same rude noise at the same time it was easy to tell where grey had learned it garn nan said scornfully reckon that memsab only ast if you could tell as an outside bet but the livin people might be the ones as is dangerous she ate a bite of breadandbutter thoughtfully i dunno as memsabs thought that far but that missus katherines a right easy mark an a fat un too people as is willin t gammon the gentry might not be real happy about bein found out sarah nodded should we tell karamjit she asked showing a great deal more common sense than she would have before nan came into her life memsabs thinking hard about her friend but she might not think a bit about herself aye an selim an mebbe sahib too nan was a little dubious about that having only seen the lordly sahib from a distance ill ask selim to tell sahib if youll talk to karamjit sarah said knowing the surest route to the master from her knowledge of the school and its inhabitants but tell me what to look for three sets of eyes are better than two fust thing whatever they want you t look at is gonna be what makes a fussnoises or voices or whatever nan said after a moment of thought i dunno how this medium stuff is gonna work but thats what happens when a purse gets nicked you gotta get the marks attention so he wont be thinkin of his pocket so whatever they want us to look at we look away from thats the main thing mebbe memsab can tell us what these things is spposed to be likeif i know whats t happen i kin guess what tricks theyre like t pull she finished her bread and butter and began her own curry shed quickly acquired a taste for the spicy indian dishes that the other children loved if there aint ghosts i bet they got somebody dressed up t look like one she grinned slyly at grey an i betcha a good pinch or a bite would make im yell proper and you couldnt hurt a real ghost with a pinch sarah nodded i suppose were just going to have to watch and wait and see what we can do nan as always ate as a streetchild would although her manners had improved considerably since coming to the school she inhaled her food rapidly so that no one would have a chance to take it from her she was already finished although sarah hadnt eaten more than half of her tea she put her plates aside on the tray and propped her head up on her hands with her elbows on the table we got to talk to karamjit an selim thats the main thing she said thinking out loud they might know what we should do selim will come home with sahib sarah answered but karamjit is probably leaving the basket at the back gate right now and if you run you can catch him alone taking that as her hint for sarah had a way of knowing where most people were at any given time nan jumped to her feet and ran out of the nursery and down the back stairs flying through the kitchen much to the amusement of the cook maya she burst through the kitchen door and ran down the path to the back gate so quickly she hardly felt the cold at all though she had run outside without a coat mustafa swept the garden paths free of snow every day but so soon after boxing day there were mounds of the stuff on either side of the path snow with a faint tinge of gray from the soot that plagued london in almost every weather nan saw the sikh karamjit soon enough to avoid bouncing off his legs the tall dark immensely dignified man was bundled up to the eyes in a heavy quilted coat and two mufflers his head wrapped in a dark brown turban nan no longer feared him though she respected him as only a street child who has seen a superior fighter in action could karamjit she called as she slowed her headlong pace i need t talk wi ye there was an amused glint in the sikhs dark eyes though only much association with him allowed nan to see it and what does missy nan wish to speak of that she comes racing out into the cold like the wind from the mountains memsab ast us t help her with somethintheres this lady as is a meedeeyum that she thinks is gammonin her friend wethas sarah an grey an mewe says acourse but here nan stopped because she wasnt entirely certain how to tell an adult that she thought another adult didnt know what she was getting herself into i just got a bad feelin she ended lamely but karamjit did not belittle her concerns nor did he chide her instead his eyes grew even darker and he nodded come inside where it is warm he said i wish you to tell me more he sat her down at the kitchen table and gravely and respectfully asked maya to serve them both tea he took his with neither sugar nor cream but saw to it that nans was heavily sweetened and at least half milk now he said after she had warmed herself with the first sip tell me all nan related everything that had happened from the time he came to take both of them to the parlor to when she had left sarah to find him he nodded from time to time as he drank tea and unwound himself from his mufflers and coat i believe this he said when she had finished i believe that memsab is a wise good and brave woman i also believe that she does not think that helping her friend will mean any real danger but the wise the good and the brave often do not think as the mean the bad and the cowardly dothe jackals that feed on the pain of others will turn to devour those who threaten their meal and a man can die from the bite of a jackal as easily as that of a tiger so you think my bad feelin was right nans relief was total not that she didnt trust memsab butmemsab didnt know the kind of creatures that nan did indeed i dobut i believe that it would do no good to try to persuade memsab that she should not try to help her friend karamjit smiled slightly the barest lifting of the corners of his mouth nevertheless sahib will know how best to protect her without insulting her great courage he placed one of his long brown hands on nans shoulder you may leave it in our hands missy nanthough we may ask a thing or two of you that we can do our duty with no harm to memsabs own plans for now though you may simply rely upon us thenkee karamjit nan sighed he patted her shoulder then unfolded his long legs and rose from his chair with a slight bow to maya then he left the kitchen allowing nan to finish her tea and run back up to the nursery to give sarah and grey the welcome news that they would not be the only ones concerned with the protection of memsab from the consequences of her own generous nature sahib took both nan and sarah aside just before bedtime after karamjit and selim had been closeted with him for half an hour can i ask you two to come to my study with me for a bit he asked quietly he was often thought to be older than memsab by those who were deceived by the streaks of grey at each temple the stiff way that he walked and the odd expression in his eyes which seemed to nan to be the eyes of a man who had seen so much that nothing surprised him anymore nan had trusted him the moment that she set eyes on him although she couldnt have said why so long as nadra dont fuss nan replied for both of them sahib smiled his eyes crinkling at the corners i have already made it right with nadra he promised karamjit selim and memsab are waiting for us nan felt better immediately for she really hadnt wanted to go sneaking around behind memsabs back from the look that sarah gave her nan reckoned that she felt the same thank you sir sarah said politely we will do just as you say very few of the children had ever been inside the sacred precincts of sahibs office the first thing that struck nan was that it did not smell of tobacco but of sandalwood and cinnamon that surprised her most of the men she knew smoked although their womenfolk disapproved of the habit but evidently sahib did not not even in his own private space there was a tigerskin on the carpet in front of the fire the glass eyes in its head glinting cruelly in a manner unnerving and lifelike nan shuddered and thought of shere khan with his taste for mancub had this been another terrible killer of the jungle did tigers leave vengeful ghosts heavy dark drapes of some indeterminate color shut out the cold night hanging on the walls which had been papered with faded gold arabesque upon a ground of light brown was a jumble of mementos from sahibs life in india crossed spears curious daggers and swords embroidered tapestries of strange characters twined with exotic flowers and birds carved plaques of some heavy dark wood inlaid with brass bizarre masks that resembled nothing less than brightly painted demons on the desk and adorning the shelves between the books were statues of half and fullynaked gods and goddesses more bits of carving in wood stone and ivory bookshelves built floortoceiling held more books than nan had known existed sahib took his place behind his desk while memsab perched boldly on the edge of it selim and karamjit stood beside the fire like a pair of guardian statues themselves and sahib gestured to the children to take their places on the overstuffed chairs on either side of the fireplace nan waited tensely wondering if memsab was going to be angry because they went to others with their concerns although it had not fallen out so here she was far more used to being in trouble over something she had done than in being encouraged for it and the reflexes were still in place karamjit tells me that you four share some concern over my planned excursion to the medium nan memsab said with a smile that told nan she was not in trouble for her meddling as she had feared they went first to sahib but as we never keep secrets from one another he came to me and i commend all four of you for your concern and caution for after some discussion i was forced to agree with it and i would like to commend both of you nan sarah for having the wisdom to go to an adult with your concerns added sahib with a kindly nod to both of them that nan had not expected in the least that shows great good sense and please continue to do so in the future i thoughti was afeared nan began then blurted out all that shed held in check memsab is bout the smartest goodest lady there is but she dont know bad people me i know i seed em an i figgered that they werent gonna lay down an lose their fat mark without a fight and very wise you were to remind us of that sahib said gravely i pointed out to memsab that we have no way of knowing where this medium is from and she is just as likely to be a criminal as a ladymore so in fact just because she speaks acts and dresses like a lady and seeks her clients from among the gentry means nothing she could easily have a crew of thugs as her accomplices as you say sahib karamjit said gravely for as it is said it is a short step from a deception to a lie from a lie to a cheat from a cheat to a theft and from a theft to a murder memsab blushed i will admit that i was very angry with you at first but when my anger cooled it was clear that your reasoning was sound and after all am i some gothic heroine to go wideeyed into the villains lair never suspecting trouble so we are here to plan what we all shall do to free katherine of her dangerous obsession me i needta know what this seeants is gonna be like memsab nan put in sitting on the edge of the chair tensely what sorta things happens generally the participants are brought into a room that has a round table with chairs circling it memsab spoke directly to nan as if to an adult which gave nan a rather pleasant if shivery feeling the table often has objects upon it that the spirits will supposedly move often a bell a tambourine and a megaphone are among them though why spirits would feel the need to play upon a tambourine when they never had that urge in life is quite beyond me she laughed as did sahib the girls giggled nervously at any rate the participants are asked to sit down and hold hands often the medium is tied to the chair her hands are secured to the arms and her feet to the legs nan noticed that memsab used the word legs rather than the mannerly limbs and thought the better of her for that the lights are brought down and the seance begins most often objects are moved including the table the tambourine is played the bell is rung all as a sign that the spirits have arrived the spirits most often speak by means of raps on the table but katherine tells me that the spirit of her little boy spoke directly through the floating megaphone sometimes a spirit will actually appear in this case it was just a glowing face of katherines son nan thought that over for a moment be simple nuff t tilt the chair an get yer legs free by slippin the rope down over the chairfeet she observed an all ye hev t do is have chairarms as isnt glued t their pegs an ye got yer arms free too be easy enough to make all kind uv things dance about when ye got arms free be easy nuff t make th table lift ifs light enough an rap on it too sahib stared at her in astonishment i do believe that you are the most valuable addition to our household in a long time young lady he said with delight that made nan blush i would never have thought of any of that i dunno how yed make summat glow though nan admitted oh i know that sarah said casually theres stuff that grows in rotten wood that makes a glow some of the magicmen use it to frighten people at night it grows in swamps so it probably grows in england too karamjit grinned his teeth very white in his dark face and selim nodded with pride what is it that the black robes book says sahib out of the mouths of babes comes wisdom memsab nodded i should have told you more earlier she said ruefully well thats mended in time now we all know what to look for grey clicked her beak several times then exclaimed ouch grey is going to try to bite whatever comes near her sarah explained i dont want her venturing off your arm memsab cautioned i wont chance her getting hurt she turned to sahib the chances are the room we will be in will have very heavy curtains to prevent light from entering or escaping so if you and our warriors are outside you wont know what room we are in then id like one of you girls to exercise childish curiosity and go immediately to a window and look out sahib told them at least one of us will be where we can see both the front and the back of the house then if there is trouble one of you signal us and well come to the rescue just like the shining knights you are all three of you memsab said warmly laying her hand over the one sahib had on the desk i think that is as much of a plan as we can lay since we really dont know what we will find in that house its enough i suspect sahib replied it allows two of us to break into the house if necessary while one goes for the police he stroked his chin thoughtfully with his free hand or better yet ill take a whistle that will summon help in no time he glanced up at memsab what time did you say the invitation specified seven she replied promptly well after dark although katherine tells me that her sessions are usually later nearer midnight the medium may anticipate some trouble from sleepy children sahib speculated but thats just a guess he stood up still holding his wifes hand and she slid off her perch on the desk and turned to face them ladies gentlemen i think we are as prepared as we can be for trouble so let us get a good nights sleep and hope that we will not find any then sahib did a surprising thing he came around his desk limping stiffly and bent over nan and took her hand perhaps only i of all of us can realize how brave you were to confide your worry to an adult you have only just come to trust nan he said very softly then grinned at her so impishly that she saw the little boy he must have been in the eyes of the mature man aint no doubt uv thet missy yer a cunnin moit an ad more blows then pats oi reckon he continued in street cant shocking the breath out of her i came up the same way you are now dear thanks to a very kind man with no son of his own i want you to remember that to us here at this school there is no such thing as a stupid question nor will we dismiss any worry you have as trivial never fear to bring either to an adult he straightened up as memsab came to his side nodding now both of you try and get some sleep for every warrior knows that sleep is more important than anything else before a battle ha nan thought as she and sarah followed karamjit out of the study theres gonna be trouble i kin feel it an so can he he didn get that tiger by not havin a nose fer trouble buti reckon the troubles gonna have its hands full with him the medium lived in a modest house just off one of the squares in the part of london that housed those clerks and the like with pretensions to a loftier address than their purses would allow an area totally unfamiliar to nan the house itself had seen better days though as had most of the other homes on that deadend street and nan suspected that it was rented the houses had that peculiarly faded look that came when the owners of a house did not actually live there and those who did had no reason to care for the property themselves assuming that was the duty of the landlord memsab had chosen her gown carefully after discarding a walkingsuit a mourninggown and veil and a peculiar draped garment she called a sari a souvenir of her time in india the first she thought made her look untrusting sharp and suspicious the second would not be believed had the medium done any research on the backgrounds of these new sitters and the third smacked of mockery she chose instead one of the plain simple gowns she preferred in the mode called artistic reform not particularly stylish but nan thought it was a good choice for one thing she could move in it it was looser than the highest mode and did not require tight corseting if memsab needed to run kick or dodge she could the girls followed her quietly dressed in their starched pinafores and dark dresses showing the best possible manners with grey tucked under sarahs coat to stay warm until they got within doors it was quite dark as they mounted the steps to the house and rang the bell it was answered by a sourfaced woman in a plain black dress who ushered them into a sitting room and took their coats with a startled glance at grey as he popped her head out of the front of sarahs jacket she said nothing however and neither did grey as she climbed to sarahs shoulder the woman returned a moment later but not before nan had heard the faint sounds of surreptitious steps on the floor above them she knew it had not been the sour woman for she had clearly heard those steps going off to a closet and returning if the seanceroom was on this floor then there was someone else above the sittingroom had been decorated in a very odd style the paintings on the wall were all either religious in nature or extremely morbid at least so far as nan was concerned there were pictures of women weeping over graves of angels lifting away the soul of a dead child of a woman throwing herself to her death over a cliff of the spirits of three children hovering about a man and woman mourning over pictures held in their listless hands there was even a picture of a girl crying over a dead bird lying in her hand crystal globes on stands decorated the tables along with bouquets of funereal lilies whose heavy sweet scent dominated the chill room the tables were all draped in fringed cloths of a deep scarlet the hard severe furniture was either of wood or upholstered in prickly horsehair the two lamps had been lit before they entered the room but their light hampered as it was by heavy brocade lamp shades cast more shadows than illumination they didnt have to wait long in that uncomfortable room for the sour servant departed for a moment then returned and conducted them into the next room this evidently was only an antechamber to the room of mysteries heavy draperies swathed all the walls and there were straightbacked chairs set against them on all four walls the lilyscent pervaded this room as well mixed with another that nan recognized as the hindu incense that nadra often burned in her own devotions there was a single picture in this room on the wall opposite the door with a candle placed on a small table beneath it so as to illuminate it properly this was a portrait in oils of a plump woman swathed in pale draperies her hands clasped melodramatically before her breast her eyes cast upwards smoke presumably that of incense swirled around her with the suggestion of faces in it nan was no judge of art but memsab walked up to it and examined it with a critical eye neither good nor bad she said measuringly i would say it is either the work of an unknown professional or a talented amateur a talented amateur said the lady that memsab had called katherine as she too was ushered into the chamber my dear friend lady harrington painted it it was she who introduced me to madame varonsky memsab turned to meet her and katherine glided across the floor to take her hand in greeting it is said to be a very speaking likeness she continued i certainly find it so nan studied the woman further but saw nothing to change her original estimation katherine wore yet another mourning gown of expensive silk and mohair embellished with jet beadwork and fringes that shivered with the slightest movement a black hat with a full veil perched on her carefully coiffed curls fair hair too dark to be called golden but not precisely brown either her full lips trembled even as they uttered words of polite conversation her eyes threatened to fill at every moment and nan thought that her weak chin reflected an overly sentimental and vapid personality it was an assessment that was confirmed by her conversation with memsab conversation that nan ignored in favor of listening for other sounds over their heads the floor creaked softly as someone moved to and fro trying very hard to be quiet there were also some odd scratching sounds that didnt sound like mice and once a dull thud as of something heavy being set down a little too hard something was going on up there and the person doing it didnt want them to notice at length the incensesmell grew stronger and the drapery on the wall to the right of the portrait parted revealing a door which opened as if by itself taking that as their invitation katherine broke off her small talk to hurry eagerly into the sacred precincts memsab gestured to the girls to precede her and followed on their heels by previous arrangement nan and sarah rather than moving towards the circular table at which madame varonsky waited went to the two walls likeliest to hold windows behind their heavy draperies before anyone could stop them it was nans luck to find a corner window overlooking the street and she made sure that some light from the room within flashed to the watcher on the opposite side before she dropped the drapery come away from the windows children memsab said in a voice that gently chided nan and sarah immediately turned back to the room and nan assessed the foe madame varonskys portraitist had flattered her she was decidedly paler than she had been painted with a complexion unpleasantly like wax she wore similar draperies garments which could have concealed anything the smile on her thin lips did not reach her eyes and she regarded the parrot on sarahs shoulder with distinct unease you did not warn me about the bird katherine the woman said her voice rather reedy the bird will be no trouble madame varonsky memsab soothed it is better behaved than a good many of my pupils your pupilsi am not altogether clear on why they were brought madame varonsky replied turning her sharp black eyes on nan and sarah nan is an orphan and wants to learn what she can of her parents since she never knew them memsab said smoothly and sarah lost a little brother to an african fever ah madame varonskys suspicions diminished and she gestured to the chairs around the table please all of you do take your seats and we can begin at once as with the antechamber this room had walls swathed in draperies which nan decided could conceal an entire army if madame varonsky were so inclined the only furnishings besides the seance table and chairs were a sinuous statue of a female completely enveloped in draperies on a draped table with incense burning before it in a small charcoal brazier of brass and cast iron the table at which nan took her place was very much as memsab had described a surreptitious bump as nan took her seat on memsabs left hand proved that it was quite light and easy to move it would be possible to lift it with one hand with no difficulty at all on the draped surface were some of the objects memsab had described a tambourine a megaphone a little handbell there were three lit candles in a brass candlestick in the middle of the table and some objects nan had not expecteda fiddle and bow a rattle and a pair of handkerchiefs this is where were supposed to look nan realized as sarah took her place on memsabs right next to madame varonsky and katherine on nans left flanking the medium on the other side she wished she could look up as grey was unashamedly doing her head over to one side as one eye peered upwards at the ceiling above them if you would follow dear katherines example child said madame as katherine took one of the handkerchiefs and used it to tie the mediums wrist to the arm of her chair she smiled crookedly this is to assure you that i am not employing any trickery sarah behaving with absolute docility did the same on the other side but cast nan a knowing look as she finished nan knew what that meant sarah had tried the arm of the chair and found it loose now if you all will hold hands we will beseech the spirits to attend on us the medium turned her attention to memsab as katherine and sarah stretched their arms across the table to touch hands and the rest reached for the hands of their partners pray do not be alarmed when the candles are extinguished the spirits are shy of light for they are so delicate that it can destroy them they will put out the candles themselves for several long moments they sat in complete silence as the incense smoke thickened and curled around then although there wasnt a single breath of moving air in the room the candleflames began to dim one by one and go out nan felt the hair on the back of her neck rising for this was a phenomena she could not account forto distract herself she looked up quickly at the ceiling just in time to see a faint line of light in the form of a square vanish she felt better immediately however the medium had extinguished the candles it had to be a trick if she had any real powers she wouldnt need a trapdoor in the ceiling of her seanceroom as she looked back down she realized that the objects on the table were all glowing with a dim greenish light spirits are you with us madame varonsky called nan immediately felt the table begin to lift katherine gasped memsab gave nans hand a squeeze understanding immediately what she wanted nan let go of it now memsab was free to act as she needed the spirits are strong tonight madame murmured as the table settled again perhaps they will give us a further demonstration of their powers exactly on cue the tambourine rose into the air shaking uncertainly first the megaphone joined it then the rattle then the handbell all floating in midair or seeming to but nan was looking up not at the objects and saw a very dim square too dim to be called light above the table a deeper shadow moved back and forth over that area and nans lip curled with contempt she had no difficulty in imagining how the objects were levitating one by one theyd been pulled up by wires or black strings probably hooked by means of a fishingrod from the room above now rapping began on the table to further distract their attention madame began to ask questions is there a spirit here for helen harton she asked one rapthat was a no not surprising since the medium probably wouldnt want to chance making a mistake with an adult is there a spirit here for katherine boughmont two rapsyes is this the spirit of a child two raps and already katherine had begun to weep softly is it the spirit of her son edward two raps plus the bell rang and the rattle and tambourine played and nan found herself feeling very sorry for the poor silly woman are there other spirits here tonight two raps is there a spirit for the child nan two raps is it her father one rap her mother two raps and nan had to control her temper which flared at that moment she knew very well that her mother was still alive though at the rate she was going she probably wouldnt be for long what with the gin and the opium and the rest of her miserable life but if she had been a young orphan her parents dead in some foreign land like one or two of the other pupils what would she not have given for the barest word from them however illusory would she not have been willing to believe anything that sounded warm and kind there appeared to be no spirit for sarah which was just as well madame varonsky was ready to pull out the next of her tricks for the floating objects settled to the table again my spiritguide was known in life as the great paganini the master violinist madame varonsky announced as music is the food of the soul he will employ the same sweet music he made in life to bridge the gap between our world and the next listen and he will play this instrument before us fiddle music appeared to come from the instrument on the table although the bow did not actually move across the strings katherine gasped release the childs hand a moment and touch the violin dear katherine the medium said in a kind but distant voice katherine evidently let go of sarahs hand since she still had hold of nans and the shadow of her fingers rested for a moment on the neck of the fiddle the strings she cried helen the strings are vibrating as they are played if this was supposed to be some great longdead musicmaster nan didnt think much of his ability if she wasnt mistaken the tune he was playing was the childs chant of london bridge is falling down but played very very slowly turning it into a solemn dirge touch the strings helen katherine urged see for yourself nan felt memsab lean forward and another handshadow fell over the strings they are vibrating she said her voice suddenly uncertain the music ground to a halt before she took her hand awayand until this moment grey had been as silent as a stuffed bird on a ladys hat now she did something she began to sing it was a very clever imitation of a fiddle playing a jigtune that a streetmusician often played at the gate of the school for the pennies the pupils would throw to him she quit almost immediately but not before memsab took her hand away from the strings and nan sensed that somehow grey had given her the clue she needed to solve that particular trick but the medium must have thought that her special spirit was responsible for that scrap of jigtune for she didnt say or do anything nan sensed that all of this was building to the main turn and so it was remembering belatedly that she should be keeping an eye on that suspicious square above she glanced up just in time to see it disappear as the medium began to moan and sigh calling on paganini nan kept her eye on the ceiling sure enough the dim line of light appeared again forming a greyish square then the lines of the square thickened and nan guessed that a square platform was being lowered from above pungent incense smoke thickened about them filling nans nose and stinging her eyes so that they watered and she smothered a sneeze it was hard to breathe and there was something strangely disquietingly familiar about the scent the mediums words spoken in a harsh accented voice cut through the smoke i the great paganini am here among you once again katherine gasped harken and be still lo the spirits gather nans eyes burned and for a moment she felt very dizzy she thought that the soft glow in front of her was due to nothing more than eyestrain but the glow strengthened and she blinked in shock as two vague shapes took form amid the writhing smoke for a new brazier belching forth such thick smoke that the coals were invisible had appeared in the center of the table just behind the candlestick it was above this brazier that the glowing shapes hovered and slowly took on an identifiable form nan felt dizzier sick the room seemed to turn slowly around her the faces of a young woman and a little boy looked vaguely out over nans head from the cloud of smoke katherine began to weeppresumably she thought she recognized the child as her own but the fact that the young woman looked nothing like nans mother and in fact looked quite a bit like the sketch in an advertisement for bovril in the times woke nan out of her mental haze and so did grey she heard the flapping of wings as grey plummeted to the floor she sneezed urgently and shouted aloud bad air bad air and that was the moment when she knew what it was that was so familiar in the incense smoke and why she felt as tipsy as a sailor on shore leave hashish she choked trying to shout and not managing very well she knew this scent on the rare occasions when her mother could afford itand before shed turned to opiumshed smoked it in preference to drinking nan could only think of one thing that she must get fresh air in here before they all passed out she shoved her chair back and staggered up and out of it it fell behind her with a clatter that seemed muffled in the smoke she groped for the brazier as the two faces continued to stare unmoved and unmoving from the thick billows her hands felt like a pair of leadfilled mittens she had to fight to stay upright as she swayed like a drunk she didnt find it but her hands closed on the cool smooth surface of the crystal ball that was good enough before the medium could stop her she heaved up the heavy ball with a grunt of effort and staggered to the window she halfspun and flung the ball at the draperies hiding the unseen window it hit the drapes and carried them into the glass crashing through it taking the drapery with it a gush of cold air as fresh as air in london ever got streamed in through the broken panes as bedlam erupted in the room behind nan she dropped to the floor ignoring everything around her for the moment as she breathed in the air tainted only with smog waiting for her head to clear grey ran to her and huddled with her rather than joining her beloved mistress in the poisonous smoke katherine shrieked in hysteria there was a man as well as the medium shouting and memsab cursed all of them in some strange language grey gave a terrible shriek and halfran half flew away nan fought her dizziness and disorientation looked up to see that memsab was struggling in the grip of a stringy fellow she didnt recognize katherine had been backed up into one corner by the medium and sarah and grey were pummeling the medium with small fists and wings memsab kicked at her captors shins and stamped on his feet with great effect as his grunts of pain demonstrated nan struggled to her feet guessing that she must have been the one worst affected by the hashish fumes she wanted to run to memsabs rescue but she couldnt get her legs to work in a moment the sourfaced woman would surely break into the room turning the balance in favor of the enemy the door did crash open behind her just as she thought that and she tried to turn to face the new foe but it was not the foe sahib charged through the broken door pushing past nan to belabor the man holding memsab with his cane within three blows the man was on the floor moaning before nan fell karamjit caught her and steadied her more men flooded into the room and nan let karamjit steer her out of the way concentrating on those steadying breaths of air she thought perhaps that she passed out of consciousness for a while for when she next noticed anything she was sitting bent over in a chair with karamjit hovering over her frowning at some point the brazier had been extinguished and a policeman was collecting the ashes and the remains of the druglaced incense finally her head cleared by then the struggle was over the medium and her fellow tricksters were in the custody of the police who had come with sahib when nan threw the crystal ball through the window sahib was talking to a policeman with a sergeants badge and nan guessed that he was explaining what memsab and katherine were doing here katherine wept in a corner comforted by memsab the police had brought lamps into the seanceroom from the sittingroom showing all too clearly how the medium had achieved her work a hatch in the ceiling to the room above through which things could be lowered a magiclantern behind the drapes which had cast its image of a woman and boy onto the thick brazier smoke that and the disorienting effect of the hashish had made it easy to trick the clients finally the bobbies took their captives away and katherine stopped crying nan and sarah sat on the chairs karamjit had set up watching the adults grey on her usual perch on sarahs shoulder a cushion stuffed in the broken window cut off most of the cold air from outside i cant believe i was so foolish katherine moaned buti wanted to see edward so very much i hardly think that falling for a clever deception backed by drugs makes you foolish maam sahib said gravely but you are to count yourself fortunate in the loyalty of your friends who were willing to place themselves in danger for you i do not think that these people would have been willing to stop at mere fraud and neither do the police his last words made no impression on katherine at least none that nan sawbut she did turn to memsab and clasp her hand fervently i thought so ill of you that you would not believe in madame she said tearfully can you forgive me memsab smiled always my dear she said in the voice she used to soothe a frightened child since your motive was to enlighten me not to harm meand your motive in seeking your poor childs spirit a chill passed over nan at that moment that had nothing to do with the outside air she looked sharply at sarah and saw a very curious thing there was a very vague and shimmery shape standing in front of sarahs chair sarah looked at it with an intense and thoughtful gaze as if she was listening to it more than that grey was doing the same nan got the distinct impression that it was asking her friend for a favor grey and sarah exchanged a glance and the parrot nodded once as grave and sober as a parson then spread her wings as if sheltering sarah like a chick the shimmering form melted into sarah her features took on a mischievous expression that nan had never seen her wear before and she got up and went directly to katherine the woman looked up at her startled at the intrusion of a child into an adult discussion then paled at something she saw in sarahs face oh mummy you dont have to be so sad sarah said in a curiously hollow piping soprano im all right really and it wasnt your fault anyway it was that horrid lord babbington that made you and papa send me to overton but you must stop crying please laurie is already scared of being left and youre scaring her more now nan knew very well that memsab had not said anything about a lord babbington nor did she and sarah know what school the poor little boy had been sent to yet she wasnt frightened in fact the protective but calm look in greys eye made her feel rather good as if something inside her told her that everything was going wonderfully well the effect on katherine was not what nan had expected either she reached out tentatively as if to touch sarahs face but stopped short this is you isnt it darling she asked in a whisper sarah noddedor was it edward who nodded now ive got to go mummy and i cant come back so dont look for me and dont cry anymore the shimmering withdrew forming into a brilliant ball of light at about sarahs heart then shot off so fast that nan couldnt follow it grey pulled in her wings and sarah shook her head a little then regarded katherine with a particularly measuring expression before coming back to her chair and sitting down out of the mouths of babes katherine memsab said quietly then looked up at karamjit i think you and selim should take the girls home now theyve had more than enough excitement for one night karamjit bowed silently and grey added her own vote wan go back she said in a decidedly firm tone when selim brought their coats and helped them to put them on grey climbed right back inside sarahs and didnt even put her head back out again they didnt have to go home in a cab either katherine sent them back to the school in her own carriage which was quite a treat for nan whod had no notion that a private carriage would come equipped with such comforts as heated bricks for the feet and fur robes to bundle in nan didnt say anything to sarah about the aftermath of the seance until they were alone together in their shared dormitory room only then as grey took her accustomed perch on the headboard of sarahs bed did nan look at her friend and ask that lastwas that sarah nodded i could see him clear as clear too she smiled a little he mustve been a horrid brat at times but he really wasnt bad just spoiled enough to be a bit selfish and hes beenlearning better manners since all that nan could think of to say wasah still i think it was a bit rude of him to have been so impatient with his mother she continued a little irritated i spose that magicman friend of yours is right nan replied finally about what you cn do i mean oh youre right sarah exclaimed but you know i dont think i could have done it if grey hadnt been there i thought if i ever saw a spirit id be too scared
