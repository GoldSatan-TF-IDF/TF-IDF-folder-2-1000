don winslow while drowning in the desert prologue i never should have got out of the hot tub i was luxuriating in the steaming water when karen asked me to get her a diet pepsi excuse me i murmured im in postcoital bliss she said and when im in postcoital bliss i need a diet pepsi why dont you get one she shook her head when a womans in postcoital bliss its the guys job to get the diet pepsi she smiled its a rule im in postcoital bliss too too bad i saw i wasnt going to win so i lifted myself out of the tub she looked at me with what i wanted to think was a lascivious expression besides she said its your fault that was very nice of her to say then you dont mind if i get myself one too i asked not at all even though no one could see us on the deck of our house i wrapped a towel around my midriff as i padded into the kitchen i turned to admire karen as she stretched her long neck back onto the edge of the tub and closed her eyes her black hair was wet with steam her wide mouth bent into a smile i loved her to distraction i had just opened the refrigerator and taken out two cold shiny cans of diet pepsi when the phone rang and stopped i stood stockstill and watched the sweep hand on the kitchen clock no no no no i thought let it be a wrong number let it be an obscene caller that chickened out but dont let it ring again in thirty seconds exactly thirty seconds later it rang again i snatched the receiver off the hook and snapped what i knew who it was son grahams mock cheerful voice pierced my eardrum and it had been such a nice evening hello dad i moaned dad was not actually my father in the biological sense we met when i was twelve years old and tried to pick his pocket in a bar he pretty much raised me after that even to the extent of teaching me a trade the trade he taught me included such skills as breaking and entering following people stealing documents from offices searching hotel rooms and finding the lost missing and running in short he taught me how to be a private eye like him you dont sound happy to hear from me i could picture him on the other end of the line sitting in his immaculate murray hill apartment his artificial right arm set at a kitchen table that christian barnaard could operate on i could imagine his cherubic little face his thin sandy hair greased straight back and his aggravating satanic grin not exactly i know i know petulant and rude but a phone call that starts in code is not going to be good news the single ring and thirtysecond gap meant that this wasnt a social call but business and i didnt want to get back to business graham said my feelings are hurt yeah right the giants blowing the point spread with twelve seconds to play that might hurt grahams feelings how are the wedding plans coming he asked politely wedding plans i thought in a moment of alarm what was there to plan i figured that everyone would show up at the milkovsky ranch and karen and i would say the i dos and that would be about it uhh fine i answered have you registered your patterns uhhh yeah registered patterns what about the honeymoon in favor of it great vacations dont just happen you know graham said i had never thought of a honeymoon as precisely a vacation but i let it pass instead i said you didnt call me just to nag me about wedding plans no thats just a bonus we have a little job for you i thought i was on permanent disability i said ed levine our mutual boss at friends of the family had officially declared me mentally ill i knew ed didnt really think that i was actually crazy just that i drove him nuts either way it worked for me by the way my name is neal carey i dont carry a badge actually i never did even in the days when i was working i didnt have a badge or a license or a gun or any of that private eye stuff i just did the stuff that friends asked me to do and if that isnt crazy we decided that youve recovered graham announced no im still crazy dont get your panties all wet graham said its a short job in fact lets not even call it a job lets call it a errand what kind of a errand because this was no time for a job or an errand not only was i getting married in two months i was also heading into the last semester of my masters program at nevada i even had my thesis tobias smollett and the image of the outsider in eighteenthcentury english literature almost finished dr baskin my old professor at columbia thought he could get me an assistantship in the ph d program there and karen was cool about going to new york for a couple of years so this was no time to get involved in some wacko job for friends and friends has some wacko jobs all right friends of the family is a confidential service that the bank in providence rhode island provides for its wealthier depositors i had worked on and off for friends since the day graham found my hand in his back pocket graham said this old guy wandered away from his home and ended up in las vegas his niece has a couple of million in the bank and is worried sick about him thinks maybe he has alzheimers or something shes a friend of the family we were wondering what with you being so close if youd pick him up and take him home if i havent mentioned it karen and i lived in austin nevada a small remote town in the toiyabe mountain range its six hours and a hundred years away from las vegas im supposed to find him in vegas you dont even have to find him graham answered hes in a nice room at the mirage and securitys keeping an eye on him its a nobrainer which is why i thought of you there has to be a catch i thought where does he live tibet palm desert wheres that next to palm springs california no palm springs antarctica graham has a gift for sarcasm a pause then graham repeated alone and confused an old man he also has a gift for bathos bathos is one of those graduateschool words you dont often get a chance to trot out bathos bathos bathos all right all right i said youll do it im a sucker especially for bathos nathan silverstein graham said room hes expecting you but clear it through security first right right now what am i supposed to wear graham asked i hope this isnt going to be one of those bluejeans weddings see you dad byebye son i hung up and grabbed the sodas this wasnt so bad after all id be gone a couple of days and pick up a few extra bucks and not get dragged back into friends yep masters degree soon deliriously happy marriage back to new york for a while i had life pretty much wired and maybe karen had evolved into some precoital bliss in my extended absence when i got back outside she was sobbing honey whats the matt she looked at me with redrimmed eyes and bawled i want a baaaaby i never should have got out of the hot tub don winslow while drowning in the desert chapter a baby i thought the next morning as i drove the jeep down lonely highway toward las vegas a baby i thought replaying the whole argument were not even married yet id said to karen as we sat on the edge of the hot tub we will be in two months she answered wed decided on an earlyoctober wedding out at the ranch of our best friends the milkovskys i trotted out some old cliche id seen on a talk show but i thought wed have some time together just as a couple before we brought a third person into it weve been living together for almost two years she reminded me then she got pissed off and how dare you speak of our baby as a third person it had sounded so good on television too the damn things not even born yet i muttered mistake the damn thing the damn thing you know what i meant she looked at me accusingly you dont want a baby yes i do no you dont i do i answered just not right now when what you want a date yes a date i thought about it for a second then said in two years two years she screeched neal ive been getting weepy over mcdonalds commercials maybe its just one of those hormonal things i said that did it she got up and stomped into the house before i could say and then maybe again it isnt so early the next morning when i said karen honey im leaving she just said good ill be back in a couple of days yippee uhh can i bring you anything sperm sperm i thought as i reached vegass northern burbs ive become sperm sperm leads to babies which leads to diapers and rashes and colic and to a person which was the scariest thing of all because a little person expects things from you daddytype things the problem is i have no experience with this stuff no role model as it were my own father having been your classic anonymous sperm donor who knocked up my prostitute mother no role model unless you count joe graham the onearmed dwarf of a private eye who raised me taught me a trade and set me up with friends of the family a father i dont know i was still thinking this overand developing a wicked headachewhen i gave the jeep to the valets at the mirage and found my way to the security desk in the basement hi i said to the thickly muscled blueblazered man behind the counter i slid my walletopen to show my drivers licenseover the counter im neal carey im here to escort mr silverstein home natty silver the guard said chuckling you know him you dont sorry natty silver the guard prompted one of the great burlesque top bananas when that died he went standup worked this town when it was just the flamingo you probably saw him on ed sullivan that natty silver i vaguely remembered the comics baggy checked pants and deadpan delivery wherever you go there you are natty silver the one and only whatever happened to him ah he did some more standup a few shitty beach movies where the kids made fun of him he faded christ he must be what eightysix eightseven natty silver i repeated ill call up let him know youre coming the guard said natty silver i thought this might be kind of fun uhhuh i rang the doorbell to room who is it a voice asked from behind the door mr silverstein its me neal carey am i expecting you yes you are my head throbbed where are you from neal carey originally new york a long pause city or state the voice asked throb throb throb city i answered pause east or west side west another long pause during which the throbbing turned to pounding mr silverstein i asked are you okay whos buried in grants tomb a trick question grant and mrs grant i said you have to get up pretty early in the afternoon to put one over on neal carey whats on the corner of fiftyeighth and amsterdam he asked there is no corner of fiftyeighth and amsterdam who did he think he was playing with a child i thought with some annoyance of course if i hadnt been so annoyed i might have asked myself the question why is nathan silverstein being so careful and what is he afraid of but i was too concerned with my own state of mind to think of that this is what happens when you tend to be as selfabsorbed as i am the door opened a sliver i saw a tiny face with big blue eyes peek out great i thought my fiancee wants an instachild and i end up babysitting yoda hi i said okay okay i never claimed to be a great wit hello yourself may i come in why not nathan silverstein was a small man with wispy white hair a small beak of a nose and skin as crinkled and tan as an old paper bag he was wearing a white terrycloth robe with mirage stenciled on it and a pair of cloth slippers say didnt i meet you in cleveland once he asked me ive never been to cleveland neither have i silverstein said must have been two other guys yeah thats me straight man to the universe you wouldnt have any aspirin would you i asked chapter so the guy says i dont know i never lit it nat silver gave the old punch line and looked at me expectantly i laughed politely and said mr silverstein im here to escort you home youre an escort service silver asked the last time i called an escort service i got a young honey with big bazookas i mean youre a goodlooking kid but how did you get here mr silverstein everybodys got to be someplace silverstein shrugged then he added wherever you go there you are yeah but to vegas heres your aspirin thanks you want to go see the tigers silverstein asked they got tigers here no thanks white tigers i dont care if theyre plaid i thought we need to get to the airport we have a fouroclock flight to palm springs i said nathan frowned and shuffled over to a chair in the corner of the room he let himself down slowly and stared at the floor he looked pathetic nathan silverstein was in his mideighties at least he was frail of course with his few strands of wispy white hair and the translucent skin of the elderly but he had the eyes of an eightyearold in a candy store now the eyes were staring at the floor trying hard to look pathetic are you okay mr silverstein i asked im old nathan answered what could i say youre only as old as you feel i said it was the best i could think of give me a break i feel old nathan said he took a pack of winstons from the side table slipped a cigarette into his mouth and shook the lighter toward his lips this is a nonsmoking room i observed the room isnt smoking nate snapped im smoking if the room was smoking id leave the room i may be old im not an idiot okay nate inhaled then coughed for about ten seconds inhaled coughed inhaled coughed then he said lets go get a drink im thirsty our flight doesnt leave for three hours i said good nate said im horny too i watched television while nate dressed or i tried to anyway because nate kept up a nonstop monologue from the bathroom eightysixyearold mr birnbaum goes to confession nate said says father last night i had sex with a twentyyearold girl priest says mr birnbaum youre jewish why are you telling me birnbaum says father im telling everybody birnbaum checks into a hotel with the girl desk clerk says birnbaum arent you afraid of a heart attack birnbaum says if she dies she dies mrs birnbaum comes home one day and finds him in bed with a girl she throws him out the window cop comes and asks why did you throw your husband out the window she says i thought if he could schtupp he could fly crowd gathers on the street where birnbaum fell another cop pushes through the crowd and asks birnbaum what happened birnbaum says i dont know i just got here myself i knew just how birnbaum felt i was beginning to look for a window of course the windows in vegas hotels dont actually open which is a pretty good idea when you think about it youd need a threedigit overunder on the daily number of competitors in the meter concrete diving competition and youd still get some guy taking the milliontoone odds that this time this one time some poor suicidal loser is going to step out the window and fall up you give big enough odds youll find a dreamer in this town to take them a thousandtoone that tomorrows washington post will feature a picture of elvis and ronald reagan secretly worshipping a bust of leon trotsky in the laundry room of the white house done twomilliontoone that mother teresa will spend the night in the slammer after a barroom brawl in passaic new jersey done fivetrilliontoone that a rhode island transportation official will issue a highway construction contract without taking a kickback well okay there are some things no one would bet on when nate emerged from the bathroom he was wearing white shoes plaid trousers a canary yellow shirt and a white golf hat funeral i asked why do you think they call me natty nate asked he picked up his cane and asked so are we going or what were going i said it took a while to get to the bar not because the elevator was slow or the floor was particularly crowded but because nate took the time to ogle each cocktail waitress that crossed within a fiftyfoot radius of his immediate gaze actually it wasnt so much an ogle as much it was a long leisurely evaluation that started at the targeted womans feet and slowly progressed to the top of her head nates gaze started with a concentrated frown and ended with an appreciative smile nor was nate the least bit surreptitious about ithe stared at these women with the unselfconscious glare of a judge in the bathingsuit competition at a beauty contest it was the kind of look that would get the average man a subpoena but the objects of nates attention just looked at his cute little avian face and smiled one of those isnt he cute smiles they didnt realize that while the old man was undressing them with his eyes he was undressing himself at the same time i figured that nate had gotten laid in his own mind at least fifty times by the time we finally made it to the lounge nate insisted on sitting at the bar so i helped him get up on a stool and sat in constant readiness to catch him mr silver the bartender said the usual the usual and whatever my friend here is having nate said a gin and tonic please i reached for my wallet but nate hastily said put it on my tab the bartender set the drinks down and looked expectantly at nate nate took a sip of his vodka collins leaned over the bar and asked have you seen jayne mansfields new shoes the bartender grinned like someone left a twentydollar tip and said that he hadnt neither has she nate said the bartender guffawed shook his head and i thought jayne mansfield i was trying to remember how many decades it had been since jayne mansfield died when nate looked at me and said sadly i was with the same woman for fifty years wow i said this was about to get pathetic then my wife found out nate turned on the stool to get a better view of the women playing the slot machines and damn near fell off trying to get a closer view of the wide albeit heartshaped rear end of a peroxide blonde who was bending over to collect her quarters she looked over her shoulder saw him staring and gave him a real hard look this was trouble the woman straightened up and stepped over to the bar she was about fiveten and wore a tight white sequined evening dress with a pushup bra that could only have been designed with atlas in mind her high heels showed off long legs leading to generous hips i figured her to be somewhere between fortyeight and sixtyeight under the makeup she had a sweet pretty face and deep cornflower blue eyes which were staring right at natty i was formulating apologies when the woman squealed natty hope natty asked i thought that was you darling who else has a tush like that i was waiting to see nates head go flying off his skinny neck when hope smiled and said you always knew how to sweettalk a lady natty silver she threw her arms around him and natty disappeared into a cloud of breasts and big hair i was afraid natty would suffocate but natty emerged a few seconds later a bit redfaced but with a rakes smile spread all over his little face hope he said meet my friend he didnt have a clue neal carey i said nice to meet you neal a cocktail hope nate asked let me go freshen my face first hope said nate watched her sashay across the floor then fumbled in his pocket for his wallet he took it out found a twentydollar bill handed it to me and said go take in a movie kid huh or play the slots or something nathan winked huh i asked again what i gotta draw you a picture it took a moment for it to sink in and then i said youre kidding right and i definitely didnt want to see a picture nate looked genuinely offended what he asked you think that because theres snow on the roof theres no fire in the oven mr silverstein we have a ill spell it out for you get lost plane to catch and beat it i have to get you back to palm desert i still have the room nate whispered urgently because hope was hipswitching back to the bar and dont you look lovely nate said as hope slid onto the stool next to him i have to make a quick phone call i said take your time said nate nice to meet you said hope a bloody mary please i found a phone from where i could still keep an eye on nate and hope and dialed home karens probably over this baby thing by now i thought probably just a bad case of hormones karen answered on the third ring hi i said hi her voice was as warm as a january morning in chicago how are you i asked not pregnant and hung up i stood pretending to be listening then hung up and walked back to the bar to rescue hope who did you call natty muttered time and temperature then he turned back to hope well i said its probably about time to check out and head for the airport they werent listening nice lounge nate said very pleasant answered hope a little noisy though nate said oh god hard to conduct a conversation hope agreed nate said i wish there were a quiet place we could have a nice chat that would be lovely i watched as nate feigned deep thought then said i have an idea ill bet you do we could go up to my room nate suggested surprise surprise by the time we check out i said park room service nate said get our boarding passes a little drink a little chat nate said talk over old times nothing youd be interested in neal hope looked over nattys shoulder and gave me a look one of those significant looks a help me look you just cant get to the airport too early these days i said or you can always catch a later flight said nate hope slid off the stool and said could i have a word with you neal alone she took me by the elbow and guided me a few steps away i smiled and whispered look i know why dont you make your excuse ill get him on his plane and she dug into her purse doubtless searching for her car keys neal sweetie she said pressing a twenty into my palm can i treat you to a movie or something i slipped the bill back to her save your money she looked at me with those big blue eyes she must have been something i thought in fact she was not at all unattractive now and there were still a couple of hours before the flight the airport was close and i could still get nathan back to palm desert tonight you know how it is she said yeah i thought i was young once myself chapter las vegas is the weirdest place in the world ive been to some pretty weird places hell i grew upor failed to depending on your perspectivein new york city weird ive worked cases in san francisco weird london weird and hollywood very weird i even spent three months as a prisoner of sorts in a buddhist monastery in the remote mountains of western sichuan in china very very weird but on the general scale of weird las vegas has all these places beat handsdown so to speak i think its what happens when you have a combination of unlimited space and unlimited money unconstrained by common sense or good taste things can get pretty weird i mean here in a state run by mormons you have a town founded by a jewish gangster whose nickname was bugsy he gets the weird ball rolling when he builds the first casino and calls it what the flamingo in a desert a big pink bird that lives in the water in africa i dont know about you but if im standing in the middle of a nevada desert one of the first things i think of is not an african bird that stands around with one leg in the water but then again the guys nickname was bugsy right so bugsy built the flamingo came in way over budget and got a mafia pink slip after the funeral a couple of other boys built casinos with names like the sands not weird the oasis not weird and the sahara confused but not weird but thats where the nonweirdness stopped because people started coming to las vegas to do what lose money it became one of the great american pastimes save your money all year to go on vacation and lose the money people started treating it as if it were some sort of wonderfully guilty pleasure yeah i went to vegas last week and really lost my shirt hehhehheh the gangsters couldnt believe it here theyd spent all those years of effort and planning on crime and it all suddenly seemed like such a waste now all they had to do was build a bunch of hotel rooms tell people they could stay in them for twenty bucks if they promised to lose five hundred at the tables and people actually went for it yeah i went to vegas last week and dropped two grand but guess what my room twenty bucks and the buffets moborganized bank robberies stopped virtually overnight why go to all the trouble and danger of robbing a bank when all you had to do was invite the bank to come to las vegas and the beauty of it it was all perfectly legal anyway the money kept coming in and the casinos kept going up and the weirdness quotient kept rising to the point where you could now walk as i was doing that sunday afternoon from a casino where they have a mock volcanic eruption every two hours to a pirate ship to ancient rome to a paddlewheeled steamboat to a chinese temple to a circus where they have acrobats flying around over your head while youre trying to drop twenty bucks worth of quarters into a slot machine while some waitress dressed like a lion tamer offers you free drinks weird not that i was gambling i wasnt in the first place i dont like gambling and in the second place i was too busy looking for natty silver and dreading the phone call i had to make i finally pulled my sorry ass into a phone booth and made the call so hows palm springs graham asked uhhh i answered its a nice town there was a long pause youre not there are you graham asked uhhh yes i said yes youre there yes im not there i dont have any bananas either another silence hows silverstein graham asked funny i said hes a funny old guy a sigh of resignation then hes not there is he no where is he thats sort of the question of the hour dad i hated saying it hated explaining it to graham hated the sound of the words as they came out of my mouth but it was the truth id given nathan and hope an hour and when i went back to the room no one answered i ran down to the lounge checked it and several other lounges ran through the gaming tables the slot machines the sports room the pool complex and then thought of the white tigers exhibit they werent there either oh the white tigers were there just no sign of nathan or hope how do you lose an eightysixyearold man graham yelled what did he do neal outrun you coldcock you with his cane gum you into unconsciousness he got out of my sight i guess graham screeched why did you let him get out of your sight so he could get laid or whatever i thought but i was too embarrassed to say it so i settled for we bumped into an old friend of his and they took off together for a few minutes who was the old friend mother teresa graham asked she outrun you too some of those nuns are pretty fast graham some of them are too especially with a ruler in their hands graham asked who was the friend a woman sigh name hope last name dunno so can you find him graham asked dad the way hes dressed stevie wonder could find him stevie wonders blind yeah hes not a moron click i went back to the bar in the first bit of good luck id had since i got out of the hot tub the same bartender was on duty the woman who was sitting here with me and natty silver i said yeah do you know her name yes i do my headache started to come back what is her name i asked hope does hope have a last name yes she does do you know what it is yes i do what have i done i thought what have i done to deserve all these little torments i decided that it was some sort of cosmic female conspiracythat was it let a basically decent guy hesitate for the slightest second to instantly impregnate his fiancee on her slightest whim and the whole universe starts messing with him what is her last name i asked her last name is white what do you know about her lots listen i said im just trying to help mr silverstein the bartender chuckled looked like he was doing all right by himself the bartender said besides youre not his buddy you were laughing at him you were laughing at him too i was laughing at him the bartender said you were laughing at him i thought about it for a second then said yeah youre right yes i am i got up from the stool thanks for the name hope white the bartender said used to be a chorus girl worked all the big shows when gravity took its toll she switched to cocktailbar piano shes good enough to work the morning shift in the older casinos you know cole porter tunes to guys with hangovers waiting for a table in the breakfast buffets i think maybe now shes at the nugget she gets off she plays the slots nice lady thats hope white thanks thanks for saying thanks and thanks for reminding me what a total asshole i can be like hope white and natty silver the nugget had seen better days and like hope white and natty silver it wasnt going down without a few laughs the walls were dingy the carpets worn the tables had seen more than their share of winning and lots more than anyones share of losing the clientele were bluecollar workers on an economy vacation or local seniors on a fixed budget or those few sad highrollers for whom a string of sevens was a distant memory of something that never happened the casino smelled of stale smoke old booze and drugstore perfume i found the piano bar a middleaged woman with dyed red hair sat at the keys trying to stretch i get a kick out of you into ten minutes she was doing pretty well at it too i took a seat at the piano and put a five in the glass when she wound up the tune she said youre a little young for this place honey im looking for hope white the redhead smiled youre a little young for her place too im throwing a birthday party for my mother i explained i want to see if i can hire miss white to come play shes eight to noon sweetie and i work i got her number the redhead dug around in her purse and handed me two cards one of hope whites and one of her own if hope cant do it she explained youll be the first i call i said thanks i looked at hopes card it read the great hope white cocktail chanteuse extraordinaire the great hope white pretty funny hi i said when hope answered the door of her old bungalow in vegas declining old section can nathan come out and play hope was wrapped in an unbelted white robe probably designed by omar the tentmaker nathans not here she said would you like to come in hope asked me without waiting for an answer she took my shoulder and guided me past her into the living room her perfume smelled liked gardeniaslots of them going from the hot dry air outside into her house was like stepping from a desert into a jungle it was actually humid in there fetid one might say if one said graduate school words like fetid and bathos if indeed one said words like one when referring to oneself anyway it was hot and humid and chockfull of plants which was a relief to me i was afraid it was going to be cats but it was plants and they were everywhere not cactuses either yes i know its cacti but ive already used fetid bathos and one and even i have a limit on being pretentious no these were leafy green plants of the kind i regularly killed when i had an apartment in new york and they were all dripping with moisture it looked like she watered them maybe fifteen times a day i halfexpected an alligator to come running out from behind one of them my babies she explained you must have a green thumb i answered back to the lack of wit thing she motioned for me to sit and i plopped down on an orange sofa that looked around vintage there was a glass coffee table a television set two other chairs from the johnson administration and two or three hundred framed photographs the photographs occupied virtually every inch of space that wasnt being taken up by organic matter there were photos on the walls on the coffee table on several little side tables that seemed to exist for the purpose and on the television set most of the photos were pictures of hope with people some were celebritiesi recognized sinatra tony bennett and wayne newtonand some of them seemed to be entertainers whose names had never made it above the title judging from their placement it didnt seem to make any difference to hopethe famous and anonymous were comingled in this gallery of show biz friendships i even spotted a couple of pictures of natty he was younger then but had the same sparkling eyes and narrowmouth smile especially as he had his arm draped over the broad shoulder of a younger hope white wearing a chorus girl outfit her long legs and ample bosom were on professional display but her eyes were all her own cornflower blue sparkling and smart my earlier opinion had been dead on hope white had been something then and she was something now would you like a drink dearie she asked do you have any hemlock she thought about it no she said but i have haig amphaig soothing as it might have been to sit in that hothouse and get pleasantly stewed i still had a job to do find nathan silverstein and get him back to palm desert a coke please one coke she said brightly coming up how long have you known nathan i could hear her in the kitchen messing around with an ice cube tray a long time did you date him honey i carbondated him hope said as she came in with the coke which was in one of those old soda fountain glasses she had a martini for herself she sat down on the couch next to me i met him in the bad old days when he was doing the beach movies she continued he hated them but was paying about three alimonies at the time so he needed the money mind you he was no spring chicken even then he used to say id like to be a hasbeen but i dont have the money i think i saw a few minutes of one of those movies on tv one night i said you must have been up late hope said they were awful and they gave poor natty stupid lines to say he hated them the poor little honey was so unhappy and he used to come to town to try and have a few laughs i was still in the line in those daysi think it was at harrahsand natty came backstage after the show and asked me out did you know who he was she sipped her martini and smiled oh sure in this town you make it your business to know whos out front so i knew natty silver was in the house but i never thought id step out with him why did you she seemed to give this question some serious thought then she said he was just so funny she must have seen the quizzical look on my face because she leaned forward patted my hand and said let me tell you a secret honey you make a girl laugh and shell make you smile if you know what i mean and she blushed miss white do you know where he is i dont know she said honest injun i left him at the mirage he checked out she opened her cornflower eyes nice and wide smiled shrugged and finished her drink do you have an idea where he might have gone i asked honey she said natty silver was once a headliner in this town he can go anywhere he wants this isnt new york or hollywood las vegas has a memory thats what i was banking on i thanked her and got up to leave do you have a girl neal she asked me at the door a fiancee actually do you make her laugh oh she thinks im a stitch i dont think she bought it because she said have natty give you some good jokes if i can find him hope if i can find him chapter i left the jeep with the valetparking guys and walked into the lobby of the sands i hung around the highroller blackjack tables and made myself conspicuous until i saw a barrelchested guy who gave me a twiceover i walked over to him id like to see mickey the c i said and you are neal carey does mickey know you neal carey no i said but he knows people who know my boss give me names neal carey joe graham ed levine ethan kitteredge who do they know people in providence i said people in new york all kinds of people in both places but in this case people referred specifically to wise guys mobbedup guys connected guys see friends of the family did all sorts of confidential things for its rich and influential clients and if youre going to do confidential things for anybody in new york and providence youre bound to make some connections with the mob the same might be said of las vegas which is what brought me to the sands hotel to talk with mickey the c id never met mickey the c but id heard about him since i was a kid the guy thought about it for a second and said why dont you sit down and have a drink thanks i found an empty barstool and ordered a beer the bartender waved me off when i tried to pay for it the sands hotel was a big contrast to the nugget it was sleek stylish and looked like serious money it was run by serious people too which is why i had come here after hope said she had no idea where nathan had gone after their matinee romance i sipped my beer and watched the highrollers armaniclad guys escorted by skinny blondes in black sheath dresses win and lose at blackjack mickey the c was probably watching me on a monitor and making the necessary calls a few minutes later the barrelchested guy came back and said neal carey mickey would like to see you i followed him upstairs to the security room where somber men and women sat staring into monitors watching the doors and the tables the watchers could punch a few buttons and zoom in on a dealers hands or a players face or an individual coming through a door the owners of serious casinos liked to know who came in and out of their places they hired people like mickey the c to know these things mickey the c was in his early sixties but looked younger which i attributed to a daily regimen of razor cuts manicures steam baths and massages mickey was wearing a conservative gray suit that cost at least a thousand bucks a monogrammed white shirt and an italian print tie his black oxford shoes were polished to a high shine mickey the c was serious people we shook hands neal he said its a late sunday night on the east coast so i didnt make the phone calls i probably should make so i hope youre not screwing around im on the job mr c i know who you are mickey said youre joe grahams gofer yes sir well it was accurate enough you did a big favor for some people in providence a while ago mickey said i was doing my job and it coincidentally worked out for them i answered ever modest anyway youre good people mickey said why are you reaching out i messed up i told mickey about nathan silverstein mickey laughed and said natty silver gave you the slip thats what it comes down to mickey the c chuckled then said why dont you have another beer and relax ill put a call out everyone in town knows natty well have him in maybe half an hour thats why i came to you mr c it wasnt just shameless brownnosing it was also true mickey said thats one smart thing you did today anyway i knew there was something take it easy kid mickey said nice to meet to you thanks for taking the time sir you have good manners mickey the c said joe graham did you okay yeah he did it took two beers instead of one but i had just drained the second one when the barrelchested guy found me at the bar and said mr silver is at the flamingo in the palm room their guy is watching him till you get there i thanked him and left a tip for the bartender that was more than the beers would have been anything less would have been bad manners as i stepped down into the palm room i heard natty say guy comes home and finds his wife rubbing her breasts with newspaper he asks her what shes doing she says i read in a magazine that if you rub your breasts with newspaper theyll get bigger there was an expectant chuckle from the small crowd in the cocktail bar i was going to say a titter of laughter but i thought better of it natty waited out the laugh then continued the guy says newspaper you should try toilet paper the wife says toilet paper why and the guy says well it worked on your ass the dozen or so people in the room roared didnt laughroared i slipped into a booth at the back and hoped natty didnt see me from the tiny stage i looked around for the plainclothes security made him in about three seconds and nodded the guy gave me a quick wave and strolled out it wasnt too tough to reconstruct what had been happening the piano player a young guy with slickedback black hair was sitting back on his bench relaxing sharing the fun and figuring his tip jar wasnt going to suffer because the customers were getting some free laughs the few drinkers in the place just looked surprised and delighted that this impromptu standup routine had started from this ancient guy they maybe recognized from tv and natty silver was having fun standing on that shitty little stage leaning on his cane eyes sparkling teasing the crowd with his deadpan delivery and killer timing guy and a dog walk into a bar he was saying i checked my watch if i grabbed natty right now we could still make the plane and i could wrap up this errand it would be a simple matter of getting up easing natty off the stage and grabbing a cab to the airport otherwise wed miss the last flight to palm springs and that would mean spending the night in vegas another night away from the old thesis another night away from karen it would mean an extra day of babysitting an old man who had a seemingly endless repertoire of old jokes i started to slide out of the booth shit i thought shit shit shit i signaled the waitress ordered a scotch rocks and sat back in the banquette whats another night i thought i had a lot of them and natty silver probably didnt guy says to the dog you never behaved this way before natty silver looked very much alive as he teased the punch line dog says i never had money before hope was right natty silver was very funny chapter you want what i asked natty as we left the flamingo and headed back to the mirage chocolate cake he said its tenthirty at night what chocolate cake disappears at ten he asked theres a law all chocolate cake has to become angel food cake by tenfifteen were run by chocolatecake nazis now i wasnt sure i even wanted to contemplate the image of a chocolatecake nazi so i just sighed where can we get chocolate cake youre the detective nate snapped find some im not a detective no youre an escort with no bazookas i was about to say given the cantilevered architecture of hope whites build that he had more than filled his bazooka quota for the day but i decided hed have a punch line for that and i didnt want to hear it i decided to take a professional approach look i said heres what were going to do were going to go get your damn chocolate cake then were going back to the mirage and then were going to bed then were going to get up early and catch the first flight back to palm springs no booze no broads no pastry got it he looked at me with those little birdeyes no breakfast it did sound a little harsh we can have breakfast i relented what what what what what what he asked whats for breakfast i dont know i moaned bacon and eggs eggs he snapped what are you trying to kill me i hadnt been but the concept didnt entirely lack appeal at the moment but assuming it was a rhetorical question i didnt answer and bacon he asked indignantly whats wrong with bacon apparently giving up on talking directly to me nate mumbled to no one in particular he wants to feed bacon and eggs to an old jew with a heart condition i didnt know you had a heart condition i said im eightysix years old nate answered that is a heart condition look you can have gefilte fish and matzo balls for breakfast i dont care what about the chocolate cake for breakfast now i knew that i was just giving him back a little you know i have an idea i said excuse me but im skeptical why dont we go back to the mirage and order the chocolate cake from room service what are you crazy he asked roomservice prices i didnt care i had the companys gold card with an american express gold card in vegas you could get a whole cake and someone to jump out of it if you wanted anyway thats what we did no not the jumpingout part just the cake part i could tell he was wearing out so he didnt give me too much of a fight and on a sunday night it was no problem extending his room so nate sat in his underwear eating his cake and watching old movies on tv while i called karen hi i said what are you doing knitting the only thing ive ever seen you knit is your brow i said which was not overly bright on my part but i was starting to get annoyed with the baby thing you can be such a jerk she said i know dont think admitting it is going to get you off the hook she said and ive been thinking maybe i hoped shed been thinking that getting pregnant right away was a tad premature and that we should wait until weve been married two or ten years and that she was knitting me a sweater or a scarf or something what have you been thinking i asked as gently as i could you know to let her ease into backing down ive been thinking she said that youre not okay with parenthood because you never knew your own father and your mother was a heroinaddicted prostitute who didnt nurture you and that you havent really dealt with your suppressed rage sufficiently to surrender your own childhood and adopt adult responsibilities oh so you want me to come in every tuesday doctor i asked see theres that hostility christ i dont know why id be hostile i yelled i think its healthy that youre working out your anger she said casually i am not working out my goddamned anger i screeched you dont have to get mad she said and hung up without taking his eyes off the television nate said i went to a child psychiatrist once kid didnt do me any good at all we said at the same time nate looked at me with renewed respect okay not exactly respect call it affection all right he looked at me with a near absence of total contempt lets put it that way nate looked at me with a renewed near absence of total contempt then he fell asleep i took the plate and fork off his lap lay his head back on his pillow and covered him with a sheet and blanket then i set the alarm and climbed into the other twin bed nurturing i thought suppressed rage surrender my childhood accept adult responsibilities we hadnt even had the kid yet and already i felt exhausted i told myself to forget about it and just go to sleep sleep would be good sleep would be great all i had to do was lie there and not worry about suppressing or surrendering or accepting anything just sleep then nathan started snoring i have heard snoring this might be ungallant but in the interest of honesty karen snores especially in the winter when she pulls the blankets completely over her head and makes a noise that is not so much a snore as it is a presuffocation death rattle i wake up and open an air hole in the blankets for her and the snoring stops but i hadnt ever heard anything like nathans snoring i had never heard a sound like that before in my life it wasnt even a human sound nor a sound that resembled any currently recognized species no it had a sort of unnatural resonance to it kind of like the bellows of hell opening and closing or as if bigfoot had somehow stolen into the body of an old man and fallen blissfully asleep as nathan was he didnt have the blankets pulled up over his head either although i thought about arranging it and maybe forgetting about the airhole i didnt though i just lay there awake thinking about babies and stuff chapter after a refreshing twenty minutes of sleep i got up showered and changed into yesterdays stale sweaty clothes then i woke up nathan you snore he said i hardly slept a wink good morning i said i ordered room service again for breakfast i didnt want to take a chance that nate would meet some other old love while gumming his oatmeal in the coffee shop the dirty rotten old bastard ordered two eggs over easy bacon a cinnamon roll a bloody mary tea and dry toast dry toast i asked cholesterol he mumbled while sucking down a strip of bacon i thought you were jewish i said pointing my fork at the surviving bacon i am nate answered but not a fanatic and order your own bacon he tried to stab me with his fork i chewed on my blueberry muffin and worked on the image of a nice airplane jetting us to the palm springs airport a quick limo ride to palm desert and blessed freedom so nathan asked so what so arent you going to make conversation he asked what were you raised by apes you just stuff your mouth and dont talk youre an escort with no bazookas the least you can do is make conversation more bacon thats conversation nathan asked stuffing his mouth with more bacon conversation conversation id never been very good at conversation it usually required talking to people okay i said after a few moments of intense concentration so where do you live nathan looked at me as if i were an idiot go figure huh then he said youre supposed to take me home you dont know where it is i know where it is i said i meant whats it like its a townhouse he said although why they call it a townhouse i dont know because theres no town its in a resort complex right on the golf course oh thats nice why is that nice so you can just pop out your door and play a nice round of golf i said i hate golf nathan said then why because thats where they built the townhouse he said away from the town and on the golf course what was i supposed to do uhhhh buy a different townhouse away from the golf course yeah then i couldnt watch them watch who the golfers nathan said he lit a cigarette my muffin was turning to sawdust in my mouth but you hate golf i said more than i hate golf nathan said i hate golfers so so the golfers who play golf outside my townhouse yes they stink he said he took a long drag of the cigarette then spent the next thirty seconds coughing i love to watch them play because i hate them and they stink i love to watch them get red in the face say dirty words and bang their clubs into trees this is fun for me im eightysix i hate golf too i said in my opinion the only thing that could improve the game of golf is snipers i feel that this would really speed up the game instead of standing out there forever contemplating the three feet of grass between them and the cup golfers in my version of the game would be sprinting onto the green taking a running whack at the ball and diving for the sand trap as bullets stitched at their heels it would have a sartorial benefit as well i mean you could forget the bright pink shirts and the canaryyellow rayon slacks right nathan looked at me very seriously snipers he said snipers thats funny he said you said a funny thing thank you whod have thought nathan asked then he blew a smoke ring in my face we finished breakfast checked out and took a taxi to the airport i whipped out the old gold card bought two tickets on the next flight and steered nathan toward the concourse we sat at the gate for half an hour while he entertained me with jokes that were doubtless painted on the walls of the lascaux caverns after an eternity or two the flight attendant announced it was time to board then nathan said im afraid to fly its perfectly safe what you never heard of a plane crashing you stand more chance of dying in a car on the way to the airport than you do in the airplane i said id heard this statistic from someone and it sounded right of course id heard it in new york where you were in more danger in even a parked car than you were in an airplane its not the dying im afraid of he said then what is it its the crashing now boarding the stewardess said with that polite urgency they get when youre causing them delays were coming i told her speak for yourself nate said if god had meant man to fly hed have given him airplanes i said id describe myself as having said this through tightly clenched jaws except it might be misinterpreted as hostile im not getting on that thing nate said final call the stewardess warbled well only be in the air for an hour i said to nate hopefully he said the great majority of crashes take place on takeoff or landing i answered which clinched it for nate im not getting on he said yes you are no yes no yes yes or no gentlemen said the stewardess what are you going to do nate asked me make me get on the plane if necessary i said through tightly clenched jaws go ahead nate said give me a beating nate dug in as much as an eightysixyearold man can be said to dig in he stood wobbling on his feet his cane unfirmly planted in the carpet his watery blue eyes staring at me in defiance the old fart had me and he knew it what was i going to do nothing thats what i mean i could hardly grab an old man by the lapels and drag him kicking screaming and kvetching onto the plane and the stewardess was looking at me with one of those im about to call security to come and pound you into a pulp glares i dont really beat him i said to her hes joking some joke she said are you a relative of his no i answered if i were related to him i wouldnt be standing here smiling through my teethid be sawing my own head off what are you to this gentleman she asked in a voice that indicated that she was contemplating a call a friend i said some friend she said hes my grandson nate said god forbid hes my grandson the ungrateful little bastard nate said he wants i should die of fright on the airplane so he can inherit thats ridiculous i well you can forget it because youre out of the will he turned to the stewardess youre my witness the stewardess was down the jetway in a shot after snakeeyes the word witness might be the least popular word in nevada without removing his gaze from the stewardesss rear end nate said see what you did gee i guess well drive i said driving is better nate agreed yeah right i thought five hours there two hours to get nate settled then another ten hours drive back to austin oh yeah driving is much better as we were walking out to get a cab back to the mirage to pick up the car the thought finally occurred to me mr silverstein i asked yeeess he warbled in the stylized tone of a burlesque top banana how did you get to las vegas i flew he said of course then nate said happily this guy with a wooden eye goes to a dance the valet pulled up the jeep and i gave him a five he trotted around and opened the door for nate nate just stood there and stared at the jeep what i asked an army truck he said a jeep you want me to ride all the way to palm springs in an army truck actually i wanted you to fly all the way to palm springs in a civilian aircraft i said but you wanted to drive not in an army truck youre a quaker now bouncing nate said bouncing you think my kidneys are made of steel he hollered my bladder is what a rock my back my spine my neck you want from the bouncing they should snap yes im not riding in that he said how about if we get a rope and i tow you behind funny guy get in i said forget it please no just get in i whined no ill give you money money i got nate said but you can never replace your health so i tried one of the things id seen parents do with fouryearolds i got into the drivers seat turned the key and said okay im leaving so go im leaving now i said in the same singsong tone id heard send the little rugrats sprinting for mommy and daddys departing heels so leave already nate said i put the jeep into drive and started to ease out of the parking circle i could see nate in the rearview mirror leaning on his cane staring resolutely into space his little knees wobbling goodbye i yelled he didnt answer after a pleasant hour in the rentacar line i was rewarded with the keys unlimited mileage and a full tank of gas i grabbed nate from the lounge where he was well lounging and dragged him out to the parking lot so what kind of car did you get he asked blue we walked out to slot a where was parked a lovely blue sedan with big cushioned seats this is a japanese car nate said i guess so what he snapped you never heard of pearl harbor the nice girl behind the counter said back already i nodded dont you like the car she asked i can upgrade you to a bmw for only eighteen extra dollars a day bmw i mulled aloud that stands for bavarian motor works right you want it i dont think so a lexus no japanese cars i said no german cars huh i cannot rent any car made in the former axis powers she looked on her computer screen how about a nice jeep she asked an hour later i walked nate out to a chevy cavalier and said sit in it what did you think i was going to stand no i said sit in it now he sat down do you like the seat i asked are you comfortable its nice made in detroit i said any problems with its city of origin no beef with the general motors corporation the color its red you know no hangups there no unfortunate associations with the bolsheviks are we going to go or what were going to go i said and hustled into the drivers seat before he could change his mind i turned the ignition and shifted into reverse go ahead nate said and back up chapter i love the desert the desert is not boring as some would have you believe although i am as are most private eyes a connosieur of boredom boredom is our business as we spend most of our time waiting for other people to do interesting things boring or poring over paperwork boring or writing postinvestigation reports very boring but i basically like boredom because in this business if something boring isnt happening it usually means that something scary is so boring is good so is the desert even though its not boring normally a long desert drive is a thing of joy and beauty to me i love the colorsthe muted subtle shades of tans browns and lavenders i revel in the enormous expanse of open blue sky i worship the sheer vast emptiness the solitude the quiet but after one hour on this particular drive on interstate through the nevada desert i was ready to reach down my throat with a pair of pliers and pull my own lungs out if id had a gun i would have shot myself so i wouldnt have to live with the memory of an hour trapped in a car with nathan silverstein aka natty silver it started about five minutes into the drive when he said ask me whos on first no thanks ask me whos on first no he started to pout now i know about pouting not for nothing has karen been known to refer to me as the incredible sulk i am a marathon pouter a deep celtic brooder of the darkest sort but i was a piker compared to natty silver natty silvers unhappiness hung in the confined air of the car like a thick gray cloud nonot a cloud something more solid it filled the car like some sort of toxic jello that hardened around my feet then jiggled up to my neck until i was choking in misery natty could pout i broke whos on first i asked hating myself for the craven bellyup dog that i was right he answered happily rights on first no whos on first he said triumphantly i chuckled appreciatively and stopped he said so whats the matter nothings the matter so so nothing what you dont know the bit i know the bit i said its an old abbott and costello routine abbott and costello didnt invent that sketch nathan said contemptuously phil gold and i were doing whos on first when lou costello was shitting his diapers okay i taught lou costello whos on first when he was in diapers i asked when he was so wet behind the ears he needed a towel natty said it was at minskys minskys now there was a burlesque house those minskys knew burlesque they knew naughty from dirty until the decency league shut them down minskys was the cleanest burlesque house in the world a classy place and the girls were not hookers but speaking of hookers you heard the one about the hooker who says to eightysixyearold mr birnbaum im here to give you super sex birnbaum says ill take the soup i was doing about seventy if i opened my door and rolled out now how badly could it hurt now arthur minsky loved good pastrami nathan said and he knew deli you could not put inferior delicatessen in front of arthur minsky who by the way was a gentleman a refined man arthur minsky would not allow filth in his theaters and he knew the difference between naughty and dirty i remember one time eileen the irish dream wanted to respond to an unkind review which intimated that she was not a natural redhead with a visual display that she was and arthur put his foot down of course eileen was a nasty piece of work a tramp kept company with a nogoodnik mobster from the schultz gang named benny the blade wore spats trash so one day arthur sends out the new kid an irish kid stupid like you arthur sends the kid to wolffs to get him a pastrami on rye with russian mustard wolffs had great pastrami wonderful pastrami wolff knew delicatessen in those days you could go to a deli and get a sandwich would choke a horse for twentyfive cents and it was good deli not this trash they serve you today they just opened a deli in palm desert two jews from los angeles open a deli and charge seven bucks for a sandwich which is trash stringy fat it got caught between my teeth right here i was with murray koppelman do you know murray had a forshit comedy show on cbs murray murray murray they used to sing murray would come out surrounded by shiksas with legs to their chins and roll his eyes audience would scream i dont know why i do know why free tickets thats why and some boob holding up a card says laugh we didnt have these cards in burlesque our audience was waiting to see girls take off their clothes we had to be funny if you held up a card that says laugh in a burlesque house they would throw garbage at you and they would be right i saw that happen one afternoon to a magician the great bandolini magicians always had to give themselves italian names i dont know why you never saw a magician named the great lefkowitz anyway bandolini had an act where he would pull doves from his coat youve seen the act first he opens his coat no doves he says some words in italian opens the coat again and bingodoves except this one afternoon he is coming in from philadelphia on the train and the porters lose the case that has bandolinis doves in it whats bandolini going to do he goes to talk to myra delovely who had a striptease act called myra delovely and her doves of love in which myra stripped and the doves landed in strategic spots to prevent the decency league from shutting her down bandolini asks can he borrow the doves to make them appear out of his coat myra is reluctant but a good sport and she says okay what nobody thinks about is that these doves are not trained to sit quietly hiding in the secret pockets of the coat bandolini gets onstage opens the coat and says no dovesexcept that there are doves there are doves rustling around cooing flapping their wings the audience boos the doves get spooked and fly into the house the doves are flying around the ceiling very upset and you know what a nervous dove does so now youve got bandolini yelling the audience booing and the doves are shitting all over them myra comes out screaming at bandolini hitting him audience starts throwing garbage tomatoes hardboiled eggs even liverwurst they threw bonbons they threw myra slips on a bonbon throws her hip out of joint a very bad injury for a burlesque girl nowadays shed sue of course but people didnt sue in those days myra goes to a doctor in gramercy park dr laframboise a frenchman this laframboise puts her hip back into joint and his own joint you get the idea myra gets in a family way and the doctor acts like a mensch and marries her they have a daughter who grows up to be a singer except this girl cannot carry a tune in a bucket the girl cannot sing myra and laframboise dont know what to do what to do with a daughter who is a singer who cant sing fortunately she marries the son of laframboises accountant a kid named koppelman koppelman and this girl who cant sing produce a son who cant get a laugh except when they hold up a card that says laugh and that turns out to be the forshit comic my good friend murray koppelman murray murray murray so murray says nate you have a string of fat stuck between your teeth i think its one of murrays stupid jokes because without his writers lets face it murray koppelman is not funny so i say murray what this is funny foodinyourteeth jokes he says hes serious so i turn to this lady at the next table and ask do i have a string of fat stuck between my teeth and she says yes you do you do have a string of fat stuck between your teeth right here and she shows me on her teeth the woman had a beautiful mouth i said do you go to dr kaufman she says no i go to dr millman millman i say millman is a crook she says millman is my nephew i say sol millman she says no sam millman and i say thats good i was thinking of sol millman who is the crookso i covered myself there but that sam millman is a crook who will take the gold right out of your mouth now kaufman theres a dentist kaufman is the dentist who fixes my teeth after i crack one with a fork trying to get the string of fat out which is what comes from cheap pastrami now at wolffs they would never give you stringy fatty pastrami wolff knew delicatessen he knew good delicatessen from drech arthur minsky always sent out to wolffs nothing else would do for arthur minsky who was a man of refinement a gentleman arthur minsky so the irish kid comes back with the sandwich and puts the bag on arthurs desk arthur is in the middle of telling eileen the irish dream that never again will she remove her gstring on the runway of minskys no matter what any critic writes and benny the blade starts yelling that eileen has to redeem her honor because she has been slandered and arthur says that any man who wears spats should perhaps not open his mouth on matters concerning taste they are having this discussion when the irish kid who was stupid like you sets the sandwich down on arthurs desk and arthur is arguing with benny as he bites into the sandwich and hes saying benny excuse me i dont tell you how to run numbers please do not tell me how to runthis is salami arthur cant believe it eileen cant believe it benny cant believe it even i cant believe it because i am sitting there waiting to talk to arthur about what were going to do with phil gold who is out again on a bender and who am i supposed to do whos on first with arthur starts to laugh eileen starts to laugh benny the blade starts to laugh and then i start to laugh and this irish kid says what and arthur says this is the last time i send a goy to get deli he tousles the kids hair and tells him i said pastrami not salami this kid didnt know the difference between dont you ever shut up okay im not proud of it but thats what i yelled no excuses i just lost it i know i know how could i be so mean to a sweet old man like nathan silverstein who was merely indulging in some old memories to kill a little time on a long car trip all i can say in my own defense is that you werent in the car with him well he shut up all right after i screamed he turned those watery little eyes to me looked very hurt then slowly turned face forward and maintained a total dignified silence which was worse than the monologue not at first at first it was wonderful sweet silence blessed solitude with a slight underlay of guilt but i was willing to live with that at first then it grew heavier and heavier as the miles between nevada and california peeled away the weight of the guilt pressed down on my shoulders like two anvils how could i be so mean to a sweet old man like nathan silverstein who was merely indulging in some old memories to kill a little time on a long car trip so after half an hour of total silence i asked whos on first silence whos on first i repeated he just stared straight ahead please i wheedled please i whined but after almost twentyfour hours of almost unceasing irritation i finally got my wish nathan silverstein wouldnt talk to me after about one hour of silence torture later i pulled over into one of those gas stationcumjunk food places do you have to use the bathroom i asked no answer do you i repeated same response well i do i said so i tell you what ill go in and use the bathroom then ill come back out and if you want to go in you can hows that nathan just stared ahead for a second i thought he was dead except that i could see his frail little chest breathing okay here i go i said i went in and stood at the urinal wondering if and when nathan was ever going to forgive me i really did feel awful i felt like hell until i came back out and saw nathan driving away the rotten old bastard had taken the car chapter the state trooper was not amused was the vehicle locked asked trooper darius we were standing in the gasstation parking lot where the temperature was only about no i said the car was not locked even through his reflective sunglasses i could see the disdainful stare yeah all right i could imagine it anyway may i see the keys he asked i dont have the keys a long disgusted pause you left the keys in the vehicle he said i left the keys in the vehicle your insurance company isnt going to like that its a rented car then your insurance company really isnt going to like that he said have you reported the loss to the rentalcar agency not yet you should i will licenseplate number i dont know because its a rental car thats right the rental agreement will have it trooper darius said dont tell me its in the vehicle with the keys i said he sighed a longsuffering sigh then asked what kind of car is it i thought about it for a few seconds red i answered his hand twitched in unconscious yearning around his nightstick what make he clarified now i sighed i know its not japanese or german i said this time he took the glasses off to stare at me more of a squint really in the sun i dont suppose its much use asking you the year right he said i dont know a lot about cars i said no fooling im from new york i explained dont they have cars in new york subway cars i joked i should have had one of those cards that said laugh you want us to look for a red car trooper darius said i can identify the driver how he asked because he was in the car when when i was driving it i said before he took it another long pause while the sun beat down on his smokey the bear hat and my bare sweating head the passenger stole the vehicle he asked im not sure id say stole i answered but yes the passenger took the car you know the suspect im afraid i do describe him an older gentleman i began how old eightysix i had never before seen a state trooper struggling not to laugh an eightysixyearold man stole your car he said well again i wouldnt necessarily say did he beat you up he asked no i threaten you in any way no you see was he armed no i said i went to use the bathroom and when i came out i saw him driving away i thought he would turn around and come back but didnt the old man need to use the bathroom he asked because usually thats what i thought but he said he didnt now we know why i guess so name neal carey his name i thought you meant my name no his name said trooper darius i already know your name your name is neal carey right right we stood for a few seconds enjoying the sunshine so what is it the trooper asked whats what whats his name the trooper asked take it slow now his name not yours nathan silverstein i said or natty silver which both how many eightysixyearold men stole your car he asked just one i said so were on the lookout for a red car driven by an eightysixyearold man named nathaniel silverstein aka natty silver the trooper said that about sums it up which way was he headed he went thataway i said pointing west he could be a long way thataway said the trooper i dont think so why dont you think so because he was driving about twenty miles an hour trooper darius thought for what seemed like a long time then he said get in the car the cars gone my car oh we were cruising west on interstate when the trooper said i thought if we can catch up to the old man and if everything checks out then you can just get back in the drivers seat and you wont have to call the rentalcar people or your insurance company and i wont have to file a stolenvehicle report i really appreciate that i said thank you we were doing eighty miles an hour so it wasnt long before we found the car in a ditch at the side of the road we pulled over and i jumped out of the cruiser my heart pounding i was scared to death id find natty slumped over the wheel hurt or worse i jumped into the ditch and looked into the car nathan wasnt in it chapter graham answered the phone id been hoping he wasnt home so that i could leave a brief message after the beep something like hi its neal ill call back but graham was home watching an exhibition game between the new orleans saints and the san diego chargers and they call me mentally ill hi dad i said hows palm springs he asked after a couple of seconds he added you lost him again didnt you yes how do you keep misplacing an entire person graham asked i can understand a watch a wallet a glove but an entire human being twice in the space of less than twentyfour hours who is this guy harry houdini sort of because he had simply disappeared when trooper darius and i got to the car there was no sign at all of nathan he was just gone without a trace we even looked for blood on the steering wheel and windshield thinking that maybe hed hit his head there was none thank god nathan was just gone what do you mean blood on the dashboard graham asked i thought you were supposed to fly back i thought so too i told him about the scene at the airport i told him about the jeep and bouncing i told him about japanese cars german cars so what kind of car did you get he asked red all right i hollered just asking i told him about whos on first about lou costello arthur minsky pastrami murray koppelman irene the irish dream myra and her doves of love graham asked how did she train the doves to land i dont know about benny the blade salami instead of pastrami how i screamed at nathan that was hostile graham said i stopped since when did you start using words like hostile since i talked to karen earlier he said you talked to karen i called to ask her if shes registered for her patterns graham said and she told me you were hostile im starting to get hostile see i swallowed hard and told him about pulling over at the gas station about going into the mens room about you left the keys in the car and he took it graham said but you found the car again i told him about trooper darius thats where the blood on the dashboard thing comes in graham said there wasnt any which is good graham said graham im scared out of my wits we checked at the trooper station the sheriffs office i called the hospitals the morgue what if neal graham said somebody else probably saw him standing by the road and picked him up silversteins probably halfway home by now you think sure graham said listen leave the cops my number then you drive to palm desert check the rest stops as you go in case someone dropped him off and hes trying to call check in with me every two hours okay youll probably get to his house and find him in his living room watching wheel of fortune i started to feel better silverstein was probably sitting at home watching wheel of fortune he was fine bored but fine thank god unless graham said unless unless graham said theres a reason silverstein doesnt want to go home a reason not wanting to go home what would make graham think that nathan doesnt want to go home just because he disappeared yesterday wouldnt get on the airplane wouldnt get in the jeep wouldnt get in a toyota a mazda a nissan a bmw or a mercedes then took the car drove off dumped the car and disappeared you think he was stalling i asked maybe why wouldnt he want to go home i asked i asked karen this question when i called her up before you say anything about sperm or hostility or knitting or anything i said when she answered i need to talk to you im listening i told her the entire odyssey so far of my experience with nathan and finished with the question why wouldnt nathan want to go home let me see karen said in las vegas he has booze a girlfriend and an audience and chocolate cake in palm desert he has television i guess the more interesting question is why would he want to go home i hadnt thought about it that way neal hes a lonely old man who had some fun and company in las vegas she said then you hurt his pride so he decided hed show you and he did yes he did she said so go find him apologize and then talk to him about getting a nice condo in las vegas karen my job is to get him home not take care of him forever neal life puts things in your way for a reason you think so i know so this is a big difference between karen and me she thinks that life is a fated journey of challenges and discoveries i think its a random sequence of arbitrary occurrences i also thought that she was veering dangerously close to the baby thing if karen decided that having a child right now was fate i was doomed im glad youre not mad at me anymore i said i didnt say that i wasnt mad at you she said you said that you needed to talk now when i tell you that i need to talk which is about once a week you listen right so when you tell me that you need to talk which is once about every eight months or so im going to listen because i love you but im still royally pissed at you royally pissed royally jesus damn straight she broke the silence by saying so go find nathan silverstein get him settled then come home and knock me up click dial tone first things first i thought first find nathan then get him home sigh then find out if hed really rather live in las vegas it shouldnt be too hard to convince friends to get him organized with a nice little condo in vegas maybe somewhere near the great hope white so they could do whatever it was they did together then nathan could happily totter around smoke cigarettes drink vodka ogle women eat chocolate cake and perform impromptu standup routines in cocktail bars karen and graham were right what was i so worried about where to begin where to begin chapter theres a lot of talk these days about the learning curve learning curve you know youre ahead of the curve youre behind the curve etcetera well on the issue of why nathan didnt want to go back to his condo in palm desert i wasnt ahead of the curve or behind the curve i was standing flatfooted and stupid on the curve and the car was speeding around the curve right at me in my defense i didnt know then what i know now at the time i headed west through the desert on i looking for the nathan i knew nothing about listen it ticked me off when i found out about it i mean when i finally had a chance to look at the following documents i thought something along the order of sure now why didnt you show me this when it could have done me some good i dont want you thinking the same thing so craig d schaefferattorneyatlaw montereypalm desert ca ms pamela a holmstrumclaims superintendentwestern states insurance co flower streetlos angeles ca july dear ms holmstrum pursuant to your request that i evaluate the coverage situation visavis the fire that occurred to your insured mr heinz muller on may i undertook the following activities i reviewed the fire inspectors reports and spoke with captain mackenzie of the coachella valley consolidated fire department i took recorded statements of mr muller and his tenant mr abdullah i reviewed various financial records of both mr muller and mr abdullah i attempted to contact potential witnesses to the fire and i reviewed the applicable statutory and case law relevant to the insurance coverage issues please refer to appendix a for a discussion of the applicable case law based on this preliminary investigation i offer the following thoughts it seems clear that the fire which destroyed the insureds house at hopalong way palm desert california was incendiary in naturethat is an arson fire sheriffs investigators found trace elements of incendiary materialto wit gasolinein the flooring and subflooring additionally traces of wicksin this case bed sheets twisted and laid out in various strings throughout the housewere also found also sheriffs investigators state that this was a hot fire a comment which might seem a redundancy on the surface but which is actually a piece of jargon that refers to the relative temperature of the combustion a hot fire being indicative of arson in english ms holmstrum your insureds house went up like a torch equally suspicious is the fact that your insureds tenant mr sami abdullah also your insured as he has a rental policy with western states insurance company was out of town on a long weekend when the fire occurred mr abdullah states that he was in las vegas but cannot remember the precise name of the hotel in which he stayed mr muller who resides in nearby rancho mirage also seems to have been away that whole weekend mr muller states that he was in big bear and offered hotel and restaurant receipts to validate this assertion as to mr mullers claim for policy limits benefits under his homeowners insurance policy while we should by all means continue to investigate i am afraid that in the absence of any proof of mullers involvement in the fire you will owe such benefits while it is true that mr muller has been trying to sell the house at hopalong way it does not appear that he has any apparent financial difficulties that would be a motive for arson in fact mr muller seems as much as we can determine from his complex financial records to be doing rather well in the international importexport market furthermore he seems to have an airtight alibi for the time of the fire as to mr abdullahs claim for his personal property destroyed in the fire i can only say that i have some personal doubts as to the legitimacy of mr abdullahs claim that he had as a partial sample armani suits pairs of gucci loafers silk shirts largescreen sony television sets a valuable mustang in the garage and an edward hooper sic painting valued at the claim becomes all the more preposterous when you consider that mr abdullah can show no proof of employment for the past five years although he claims to have been making between thirty to two hundred fifty thousand dollars a year during that period as a consultant i think you are well within your rights to deny mr abdullahs claim cancel his policy and sever his additional livingexpense payments immediately based on fraud and misrepresentation unfortunately i do not believe that we have developed sufficient proof to deny mr mullers claim and advise that you pay him forthwith if you have any questions or if i may

rolled up and saw nathan coming out of the mens room i stopped the car jumped out ran over and okay i hugged him it wasnt out of affection mind you it was from sheer relief after i finished hugging him i held him at arms length and yelled where have you been ive been worried sick about you i called the police the hospital the mor did i tell you no jokes now nathan i said why did you take the car where have you been nathan started to answer when a voice behind me said hes been with me okay hes okay okay he was a little guy late thirties curly black hair and big brown eyes i couldnt quite place the accent but it was middle eastern of some sort he was wearing a ridiculous hawaiian print shirt with a lot of flowers white chinos and gucci loafers with no socks i picked him up the guy continued and im giving him a ride home i really appreciate that i answered but i can take him from here the guy said im going his way okay no trouble i live in palm desert im going his way too who are you the guy asked who am i i asked who are you you can take the boy out of new york et cetera who are you the guy asked mr silverstein do you know this guy he knows me i said i sort of work for him come on nathan lets go neal you he doesnt have to go with you okay the guy said hes going with me i dont think so i said i do he said now this was a little guy i figured even i could take him if i had to and im no fighter i have virtually none of the attributes of a good fighter size strength speed coordination or courage and even i could have handled this guy except for the gun a sleek little automatic that suddenly poked out of the ridiculous hawaiian shirt and pressed into my stomach did i mention im not especially courageous now if youve seen a lot of privateeye movies or television shows youll know that this is the point where the hero gets a glinty cold look in his eye then brings a lightningquick karate chop down on the villains wrist knocking the gun to the ground then they struggle until the hero aims a punch to the villains jaw and knocks him cold none of that happened none of that happened because a i am not especially courageous and b while it is true that there are no nobel prize committees waiting outside my door neither am i a complete moron popular opinion notwithstanding and while it is true that the hand is quicker than the eye a bullet is quicker than either of them so when someone shoves a gun into your tummy you do several things tremble have an instant religious revelation and sweat profusely i guess that my whole life would also have passed before my eyes but i was depressed enough already theres something else you do when someone shoves a gun into your tummy you do what he says which in this case was get into the car okay as we were walking back to the car nathan whispered to me i was trying to tell you i know that now you are the dumbest irishman i have ever met shut up the little guy hissed he put nathan in the passenger seat then climbed into the back while he held the gun on nathan and told me to drive i slid behind the wheel okay drive said the little guy this is a standard shift i said yes i dont know how to drive a standard shift i shoot you its true i shoot you he said drive believe him nathan said he really is that stupid i really am you could hear the little guy thinking about what to do it seemed like he thought for a long time then he said drive or i shoot you i turned the key in the ignition there was a horrible metallic screeching noise it was either the engine or the little guys voice as he screamed this is a mustang its very valuable not for long i said i cranked the engine again and stepped on a pedal or something nooooo he screamed okay okay okay okay okay okay i drive it took awhile for nathan to climb into the backseat and me to slide into the passenger seat and samias i later learned and you already know was his preferred aliasto climb into the drivers seat especially as sami was trying to hold the gun on both of us while we were all doing what i would later come to refer to as the lebanese fire drill but i began to feel a little better as i realized that sami was not exactly clyde barrow when it came to being a gunslinger when we were all settled in sami said no funny business okay i think career criminals should be banned from watching old movies dont you no funny business i said no monkey business either then sami seemed to be having difficulty figuring out how to shift steer and hold the gun in order to pull out of the rest stop he simply didnt have enough hands ill hold the gun i offered and if i try any funny business i promise ill shoot myself but sami apparently decided that the better option would be to stick the gun between his legs and expose himself to both the chance of emasculation and comments of a freudian nature so this is what he did and pretty soon we were roaring west on interstate for about a minute then he turned south onto a twolane blacktop the sign read cimaeast mojave national scenic area and even i had figured out by that point that nathan had a definite reason for running away from palm desert and not wanting to go back and that this reason was connected to the small but wellarmed man now driving us somewhere for some reason i did not know nathan turned in his seat to face me and said so arthur says to the irish kid this isnt pastrami and i leaned over to sami and said shoot me chapter sami didnt shoot me as we headed further south into the bleakest terrain i have ever seen and i have been to bayonne new jersey he just kept trying to interrupt nathans latest streamofsemiconsciousness soliloquy with a persistent line of questioning do you recognize me sami asked so arthur was laughing andsure i recognize you who am i who are you nathan asked youre the forshit fekokteh nogoodnik who is kidnapping me thats who you are so arthur i mean before that okay before what before i kidnapped you okay sami asked do you recognize me no nathan said im sorry but i do not recognize you im eightysix years old sometimes i dont recognize me i look in the mirror and say who is this old man so excuse me i dont recognize me sometimes im supposed to recognize you sami got an especially crafty look in his eye okay he said so you dont recognize me as your neighbor for example and arthur minsky who was a gentlemanwhat so you dont recognize me as your neighbor for example excuse me nathan said i live in a development that didnt get developed what neighbors i got no neighbors what i got is a burnedup smelly mess next door so are you my neighbor no no no no no okay sami said that was just an example example of what nathan shook a cigarette out of his pack and started to light it of how you might recognize me sami said please dont smoke nathan took a drag of the cigarette and went into his usual coughing spasm when he was finished he said i dont recognize you and sami said happily i dont recognize you must have been two other guys i said nobody laughed so i said having established that nobody recognizes anybody why dont we just turn around you can drop us back at the rest stop and well all forget about the whole silly thing this sounded like a very good idea to me especially because sami now turned off the blacktop onto a dirt road i have learned from long experience watching movies that when a guy kidnaps you and takes you for a ride on a dirt road in a vast desert you can cue the vultures and the smoke in the car was going to kill us all anyway so what do you think i asked i dont know what to think okay sami said i have to make a phone call to tell you what to think i asked yes okay sami punched some numbers on his portable phone being the ace private eye that i am i memorized the number so that if i lived i could get the name of the guy he was talking to hello heinz he said there was a pause okay ill stop using your name on the phone heinz okay yes i still have him someone else too you dont have to yell heinz sorry i forget who else some younger guy i dont know says he is working for the old man whatokay sami turned to meare you an insurance investigator no he says he isnt heinz okay okay ill ask sami turned to me again do you know craig schaeffer no he doesnt know him sami told heinz he says youre lying sami said to me who does i asked he sami said the person im talking with im not lying sami got back on the phone he says hes not lying heinz hes lying when he says that okay ill ask are you a jew sami asked not that im aware of i said it was a truthful response seeing as how i was to quote smollett a lovebegotten babe and could only answer to half my lineage nathan interrupted his soliloquy long enough to observe hes too stupid to be a jew hes not a jew sami said into the phone im a jew nathan said heinz said that even if you were a jew youd lie about being one sami said to me okay i answered im a jew nathan moaned he is a jew sami said happily if hes a jew nathan said im an arab im an arab sami said of course groaned nathan good news heinz the old man does not recognize me i dont have to take care of him sami said into the phone what both of them nathan said of course i get kidnapped by an arab talking to a nazi on the telephone both of them heinz both of them what i wondered this didnt sound good both of them what i asked i dont know about this heinz okay both of them what we had a girl at minskys used to do an arab routine nathan observed not that she was an actual arab which she wasnt she was a french canadian name of paulette something did a belly dance girl had a belly flat like a sheet of glass lovely girl used to go out with a fellow with a glass eye named hannigan i could have made him happy and asked what the name of the other eye was but i was too concerned about samis conversation with heinz samis complexion at that moment looked a lot more scandinavian than semitic he was ashen and blubbering i dont know about this okay several times i dont know about this okay let me talk to him i suggested he didnt let me talk to him he just said yes heinz i understand and hung up the phone what is it you understand sami i asked what i understand sami said sadly is that im supposed to take care of you both of you okay and by take care of i said you mean he nodded this time i went for the gun chapter dear diary what a day this afternoon i got on an airplane and flew to palm springs california to spend some time with natty i had forgotten what a sweet guy he really is natty may he oldand not exactly a firecracker if you know what i meanbut he is a lot of laughs and at my age maybe the laughs are more important so i flew to palm springs and took a taxicab to nattys condominium in palm desert what a place it sits out in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the desert and the first thing you see when you come through the gates is a waterfall in fact the whole complexand how nice its going to be when they finish itis called desert waterfalls isnt that cute where they get the water i dont know but then again they have a lot of fountains in las vegas so i guess these people just know how to do these things i thought id surprise natty but guess what natty surprised me he wasnt home maybe he stayed in las vegas for a couple of more days if i know my natty he probably got snuggled up with some chorus girl but im not jealous good thing he told me where the key was nattys place is very nice as you would expect from someone with nattys money it sits right on the edge of a golf course and i wonder if natty is worried about golf balls coming through his windows he has a nice living room with a wonderful view of this golf course and the mountains on the other side he has two bedrooms so it will be decent for me to be there as natty saysas if at this age im worried about my reputation but it is very sweet of natty to be dont you think all the furniture is white which i think is very interesting seeing as how my name is white maybe this was just meant to be and diary theres even a piano the place is very clean and neat which you would not expect from a widower so i think natty must have someone come in nattys condominium sits at the end of the street so he doesnt really have any neighbors there is an unfinished condominium across the street and the only one that is next door to natty must have burned down you can still smell the fire smell oh diary i hope that natty was sincere when he invited me to come and stay for a while and that it wasnt just sweet talk natty silver could always talk a girl right out of her bloomers blush blush but i think he really wants me to be here i hope he is pleasantly surprised when he comes home and finds me here i was relieved to find out that even though natty doesnt have neighbors he does have a lot of friends i dont think that i was here more than half an houri barely had time to freshen upwhen the visitors started to arrive first there was a nice young couple mr schaeffer and miss done who wanted to talk with natty it was so funny diary the young man asked if mr silverstein was home i said you mean natty natty he said sure i said natty silver you should have seen the smile on this fellows face nathan silverstein is natty silver he asked sure i said i thought he was going to start jumping up and down because it turns out that he is a big fan of nattys he started telling the young womanwho i guess had never heard of natty wheres she from diary kansas hahaall about nattys days in burlesque and the old sketches and lines from nattys standup routines this schaeffer fellow even knew all those stinko beach movies that natty was in with the boy with the hair and that girl with the bosom you know the one that used to be a mouse well the schaeffer fellow was so excited that i took the liberty of inviting them in i hope natty doesnt mind the schaeffer fellow looked all around the place he was so thrilled to see some of the mementos that natty has this is a picture of natty with phil gold he said i guess so i said phil gold was before my time they say that silver and golds whos on first was even better than abbott and costellos schaeffer said wait until natty hears this dont get him started on the subject of lou costello i said well schaeffer would have looked around all day but the girland she was perfectly nice and politehad business on her mind because she asked when will mr silverstein he back i said i didnt know but that i hoped it would be soon are you mrs silverstein she asked no honey i said there were at least three mrs silversteins but im not one of them im just a friend then the boy seemed to realize that the girl wanted to conduct business because he started to talk in a deeper voice and said will you have him telephone me the moment he gets back diary i think that theres a spark between these two if you know what i mean he handed me his card i got a little concerned when i saw it because it said craig schaeffer attorneyatlaw i was afraid that i had made a mistake letting them in because maybe it was one of nattys exwives trying to get more alimony so i started to say mr schaeffer if you are some kind of shyster here to try to bleed natty dry you can just no no he said quickly its nothing like that mr silver might have seen something well ill ask him to call you thank you said schaeffer and i could tell he didnt want to leave just yet miss done asked me by the way were you here on the night of may thirtieth no honey i said i was working in las vegas the girl turned red so i added i play piano i mean diary i may have accepted a lovely parting gift from time to time but i will not let anyone mistake me for a common hooker so i sat down and started to play i did i get a kick out of you ive never been in love before and whatll i do and they applauded and demanded an encore so i did adelaides lament which they thought was very funny diary i must have sung two dozen songs and schaeffer made tea and we all sang and had tea and chatted and then i said natty must have some booze somewhere in this place we found a fifth of stoli and schaeffer made a pitcher of vodka martinis and we all sat out on the patio and had a nice cocktail after a while the girl pamela sat at the piano and sang fairest lord jesus and she and i had a good cry guess what diary shes a methodist too from nebraska as it turns out an old farm girl just like me anyway they finally had to goa little tipsy i think young people these days just cant seem to hold their boozeand i was just about to see what was on television when the doorbell rang again this was a big fellow even taller than schaeffer and with muscles like a weight lifter short blond hair blue eyes chiseled jaw very handsome if you go for that type and the accent diary he talked like one of those germans in the old movies izz natan at hoom he asked no hes not i said may i ask who is calling on him he gave me what im sure he thought was a very charming smile yaah he said im a frient of natans i was driving by and saw lights and chust taught it tropp in to zee how natan is well im sure hell be back soon i said then he smiled kind of funny diary as if he knew something that i didnt zen i koom pack latuh he said and left just like that after he left i sat down and tried to think of what nathan could have seen that a lawyer would want to talk to him about and where is nathan anyway he certainly should be home by now anyway diary as soon as i find out the answers to these questions you can be assured that youll be the first to know your confidante hope chapter it was a stupid move all the more so because i knew better even if i hadnt known that this sort of maneuver only works in the movies i should have realized that a mustang doing mph on a dirt road does not respond well to lifeanddeath struggles between the driver and a passenger anyway i lunged between the seats and grabbed the pistol between samis legs sami grabbed my wrist squeezed his legs and pulled back his eyes were bugging out because the gun barrel was now pointed right at his balls and he was trying to control the carand doing a pretty good job of it until nathan took his cigarette and poked him in the eye ayyyiiiaaaaaa sami screamed and nathan apparently admired the effect so much that he did it again ayyyyiiaaaaaaaaaaaaa so the next thing i knew the little car was doing s sami was screaming nathan was yelling how do you like that you little arab bastard and i was holding on to the gun handle in samis crotch and praying that the car wouldnt flip over and kill us all which would have defeated the purpose of going for the gun in the first place i was pulling sami was screaming nathan was hollering the car was spinning around and then the gun went off now sami really screamed because he thought his balls had been shot off i screamed too because i thought the same thing then the gun went off again and we all screamed some more because the car plunged off the road by the time it came to a landing the gun ended up on the floor by samis feet sami was trying to get his pants off i was clutching the back of the drivers seat and nathan was clutching his chest gasping and coughing i lunged for the gun again but sami had it in his hand and pointed it at my head his hands were shaking like crazy but i figured that even he couldnt miss at this range so i sat back and tried to catch my breath sami got out of the car and looked down at his pants theyre still there he said but he was hopping up and down because he had some truly wicked powder burns what were you trying to kill me nathan yelled at me you tried to kill me sami screeched at me so it was all my fault of course then i saw two big holes in the floor of the car and realized that i had just shot not sami but a mustang then i smelled the gasoline get out i yelled at nathan but he was struggling with the seat belt i jumped out the drivers side ran around the back of the car and jerked the door open these seat belts are perfectly simple when youre getting out at the grocery store or something but theyre another thing altogether when your hands are shaking your legs are quivering an old man is fumbling around with the latch and the car is about to blow and the old man is smoking a cigarette i snatched the cigarette out of his mouth and tossed it then i got the latch unhooked got my arms under nathans shoulders and knees and carried him away from the car sami realized what was going on and stopped hopping up and down long enough to start running just as the stupid thing blew up sami was hopping up and down again like rumpelstiltskin not because of the powder burns on his balls apparently because now he was screeching my car my car i laid nathan down checked him for injuries and then felt around my own back to see if there were any stray pieces of a mustang embedded in it there werent any so it was with some relief that i sat down beside nathan my car my car sami whimpered stop whining i said you have insurance dont you for some reason that made sami really moan but by this time i was more pissed off than i was scared so i said your precious car my ass you know something you dumb little jerk im glad i shot your car sami pointed the gun at me i shoot you now youre not going to shoot us now i said i looked around on the other side of the road there was a smaller dirt road that led up behind a small knoll it looked as if there were some deserted shacks up there maybe it was a deserted old mine it would at least be some shelter for the night and some shade for the next day if there was one i helped nathan up and asked him if he was okay to walk he said he was so we started up the little road toward the shacks i shoot you now sami said as we headed out no youre not i said think for a second sami if you shoot us now you cant get away from the scene of the crime if you shoot us now youll be a married man in san quentin this time next year sami had a wonderfully blank expression on his face that i would have thought was funny if we hadnt been marooned in the middle of the mojave desert with a notoverlybright incompetent criminal who still had the gun oh sami said oh i answered youre right sami said this is probably a first for you nathan said so i figured he was basically intact we reached the old shack which was in fact the remnants of a playedout mine of some sort it was a oneroom cabin with two bustedout windows with no glass flanking a doorway with no door not only was there no glass and no door there was no water no food no blankets no nothing of anything that we could use but there was nowhere else to go and nathan looked like he was out of gas im staying here i said me too said nathan sami didnt know what to do so the next step was fairly predictablehe called heinz mr silverstein i whispered while sami was dialing would you mind telling me why these people want to kill you nathan shrugged maybe they saw the beach movies for some reason i thought he was being disingenuous then again i had seen the beach movies hello heinz nathan nudged me so this fella hannigan had a schlong that a horse shouldnt have that an elephant shouldnt have they called him the oneeyed giant and not because he was tall either sorry heinz i forget okay im very upset i cant do that heinz because then i couldnt get away from the scene of the crime one night were in a restaurant nathan continued im having a nice piece of fish hannigan leans over the table to get the salt and his eye falls out i go to cut my fish think im looking at the fisheye but what i am looking at is hannigans eye can you come get me heinz im sorry i forget where am i hold on sami looked around in the desert i start to cut into the fish nathan continued and hannigan looks at me with his one eye and says when did you ever see a fish with blue eyes well he starts to laugh i start to laugh paulette starts to laugh when did you ever see a fish with blue eyes some old mine or something sami started to give him directions then you go hello hello the batterys dead i said shit you can recharge it in the car sami gave me the best dirty look he could with his one good eye i shoot you he said not until heinz gets here you wont so i guess i told him so hannigan picks up his eye and goes into the washroom i go with him he starts to wash the eye under the tap when he loses his grip and the eye goes down the drain we call the owner jack donahue heinz is coming sami said yippee who was married to the former dorothy delillo whose sister was marjorie delillo together they used to be the former delillo sisters so heinz was coming at least wed get to meet the whole brain trust heinz was coming and i didnt expect sami to try anything horrible until the boss got here in the meantime there was a lot to do it wouldnt hurt to get a fire going because desert nights can get very cold especially for an old man so i gathered up some slats from the old shack borrowed nathans lighter and got the fire going then i sat back on an old log watched the fire and the bright stars which in the desert night looked like they were about ten feet away and thought about old men and babies and lost chances chapter maybe it was hormones but it just bugs me that whenever a woman gets truly emotional about something men ascribe it to hormones like theyre something we made up hormones are real so is wanting a baby and wanting it now i mean i was no suzy creamcheese sorority chick when i met neal my biological clock was already ticking and if neal wanted to wait two more years i just didnt think i could stand it my biological clock was becoming a time bomb so if it was hormones so what these hips were made for babies and the dumbshit would make a great father if hed just get over his own screwedup childhood and he knows it but i guess i was a little rough on him anyway after i talked to him on the phone i went upstairs and checked the calendar did the temperature thing and discovered that the old ovaries were in overdrive were talking prime time and i thought hell if i can get my butt down to palm desert maybe i could surprise neal and we could do it before he had a chance to start whining about how screwedup he is so i phoned up peggy milkovsky and she phoned up one of the cropspraying outfits and sure enough there was a pilot heading down to indio which isnt too far from palm desert and he said hed be happy for the company i put a few things in a bag met the pilot at the airstrip and got to indio just as the sun was going down i found nathan silversteins address in the greater coachella valley phone book got myself a cab over there and rang the bell to tell the truth i felt kind of pathetic standing there on the front step with my bag my bubbling ovaries and my round heels talk about easy chalk it up to temporary insanity please a woman answered the door i think she was expecting somebody else because she was wearing a white seethrough fulllength negligee high heels and red lipstick you must be hope white i said thats right honey she said she gave me a womans onceover and added and nathan must be doing better than i thought is neal carey here by any chance no hes not then i did the weirdest thing i started to cry i dont mean sniffle either i started to bawl im no wussy im a rootin tootin cowgirl mountain woman ive birthed calves gelded horses and stitched up drunken cowboys ive comforted abused kids stuck shotgun barrels into the crotches of their nogood daddies even listened to neal carey try to sing and never cried i dont cry easily but there i was standing in front of a nearly naked woman bawling my eyes out and i dont know why its just that at that moment i really needed to see him and he wasnt there so i was weeping and hope white pulled me inside and sat me on on the couch and actually said there there dear i was just blubbering youre looking for neal she said gently i blubbered and nodded you really need to find him dont you blubber and nod honey hope said as she put her arm around me are you crying because this neal got you into trouble no i blurted im crying because he didnt next thing i knew my head was resting in her ample bosom and she was stroking my hair and saying there there there there you just cry and tell hope all about it and i did chapter dear diary what a night after the german fellow left i took a long bubble bath made myself some dinner out of nattys refrigerator then got all dressed up the way natty likes blush blush sure enough about an hour later the doorbell rang and i thought it was natty and he had forgot his key so i went to the door flung it open flung my arms open to show him blush blush the goods and surprise it was a young woman at first i was a little upset diary because i thought natty had himself some young honey and let me tell you this one is a looker thick black hair gorgeous eyes and the hips well it turns out that shes not looking for natty after all a good thing for her a good thing for natty but for this neal carey i met in vegas the one who was supposed to be bringing natty home i told the poor dearkaren is her namethat neal wasnt there and the sweet thing starts to cry like her heart is going to break what else could i do i brought her in and sat her down and listened to her story diary the trouble is that this neal will marry her but not give her a baby just the reverse of the usual story go figure i told her sweetie youre going about this all the wrong way what do you mean she asked i told her just get him in the sack but dont tell him that you forgot your birth control i couldnt do that she said it wouldnt be honest it wouldnt be healthy for the relationship honesty relationship young people these days in our day we didnt worry so much about honesty and relationships girls got pregnant guys married them we had families we made out all right anyway she had a good cry and told me all about her and neal imagine that boy not wanting to have a baby with a beautiful girl like this but then we got to wondering where were natty and neal anyway when karen told me about natty taking neals car and neal setting off to find him i started to get real worried then i told karen about mr schaeffer and miss done and the german fellow and she started to get concerned then karen called mr graham and i got on the extension and the three of started to get worried together what could natty have seen we all wondered unless it had something to do with the fire i said what fire mr graham asked the one next door i said do you happen to know the address mr graham asked i can go look i said and i did the street numbers are painted on the sidewalks it was hopalong way and i told mr graham so he said hed call back in the meantime karen tried to call mr schaeffer but he wasnt in she found his home phone number but he wasnt there either ill just bet hes out with miss done theres a spark there i think mr graham called back half an hour later the condo belongs to a heinz muller he said diary thats the german fellow who said he was nattys friend i should have known that natty wouldnt be friends with a german he wont even ride in a germanmade car what was i thinking about suddenly diary i knew what had happened natty had seen something in connection with the fire after all natty had spent years playing the catskill hotelshed know arson when he saw it i thinkoh excuse me diary theres the door it must be natty thank god ill be right back chapter from the tape of an illegal microphone planted at the silverstein residence by craig schaeffer the voices have since been identified as those of heinz muller hm hope white hw and karen hawley kh hw just what do you mean coming in like that how did you get in hm what did the old jew tell you hw i beg your pardon old jew you get out right now before i telephone the police hm what did he tell you hw let go of me hm what did he tell you hw nothing sound of a slap sound of footsteps kh just what the hell do you think youre doing let her go then get your sorry butt out of here before i kick it out hm you terrify me kh mister ill put this boot so far up your ass youll need a pair of visegrips and a bottle of good whiskey to get it out hm laughing i would like to see you try unidentified sound a dull thump various bellowing sounds kh hope call hw honey i havent seen a kick like that since the line at harrahs kh hope call hm dont do that sound of telephone ringing hw silverstein residence oh hello mr graham listen i think weve located mr muller hes here right now andoh dear im afraid i have to hang up right now he has a gun chapter i should have known i mean i kicked that son of a bitch between the legs so hard i half expected to see his balls come flying out his mouth the big musclebound kraut hollered like a bull thats becoming a steer neal would probably call this an apt analogy becausewell never mind you get the picture and neal is always telling me that if im going to put a guy down make sure he stays down you know finish him off turn out the lights the partys over kind of thing as if neal would know the last time i saw him fight was a barroom brawl with some whitesupremacist trash a couple of years back neal blocked a couple of punches with his jaw and then kind of dragged his guy to the floor and passed out on top of him he wasnt exactly john wayne but he was game i think fightings stupid anyway it was just that this muller jerk was so damn arrogant you know first he breaks in then he pushes hope around and ive just seen enough of that trashy behavior to last a lifetime and i gave him a chance i explicitly told him what would happen if he didnt leave and he said hed like to see me try it and i was happy to oblige him in that particular request he was one big strong hulking side of beef too but every man has his achilles heel you know and generally it isnt anywhere near his foot i mean if youve ever seen a cowboy chasing a little calf and that calf kicks a hoof back around crotchhigh and youve seen that cowboy kneeling in the dirt sucking for air you have a pretty good idea of what heinzbaby looked like at that particular moment so anyway there he was on his knees with his big babyblues bulging out his stupid face and thats where i ought to have finished him off according to famed pugilist neal carey but i didnt and the son of a bitch had a gun a big pistol a magnum i have a theory about men who own magnums my theory is that they have to buy one because they dont have one you know and the way this muller galumph held that handpiece you just got the feeling that however large and passed out on top of him he wasnt exactly john wayne but he was game i think fightings stupid anyway it was just that this muller jerk was so damn arrogant you know first he breaks in then he pushes hope around and ive just seen enough of that trashy behavior to last a lifetime and i gave him a chance i explicitly told him what would happen if he didnt leave and he said hed like to see me try it and i was happy to oblige him in that particular request he was one big strong hulking side of beef too but every man has his achilles heel you know and generally it isnt anywhere near his foot i mean if youve ever seen a cowboy chasing a little calf and that calf kicks a hoof back around crotchhigh and youve seen that cowboy kneeling in the dirt sucking for air you have a pretty good idea of what heinzbaby looked like at that particular moment so anyway there he was on his knees with his big babyblues bulging out his stupid face and thats where i ought to have finished him off according to famed pugilist neal carey but i didnt and the son of a bitch had a gun a big pistol a magnum i have a theory about men who own magnums my theory is that they have to buy one because they dont have one you know and the way this muller galumph held that handpiece you just got the feeling that however large he was elsewhere well the big pistol was by way of compensation and they talk about us and hormones so this muller turd pulls this gun and says this is a magnum and could blow your head off so do what i say so i said okay heinz you got the gun big boy what do you want us to do what do you know i felt like i was dustin hoffman in that movie with laurence olivieryou know the one where old larrys the nazi dentistbecause i dont know anything except that maybe heinz burned his own house down and maybe silverstein saw him do it but i didnt think that was exactly the brightest thing in the world to say at that particular moment i know that you burned your house down and that natty saw you hope piped up she really is a lovely person but you dont want her holding your money in a poker game if you know what i mean heinzs eyes lit up like a pinball machine as if this news actually made him happy there are some jamokes you know who are just looking for a rationale to hurt people and i think that old heinz was one of these characters so he herded us outside where he had his land rover parked a brandnew land rover i guess arson pays he starts to put me in the drivers seat then asks do you know how to operate a standard shift heinz could build a standard shift i didnt bother to tell him that i grew up on a ranch that had a lot more tumbleweed than money on it so id helped my father reconstruct an old flippedover h tractor about three hundred and thirty times and did more than just hold the wrench too could i operate a standard shift about the only person i knew in central nevada who couldnt operate a standard shift was neal and god knows i tried to teach him the man is just hell on cars so i got behind the wheel and hope sat in the passenger seat heinz sat behind me with his magnum the pistol that is poked behind hopes ear no monkey business he said do not even consider blinking the lights or speeding or driving to a police station i will blow her head off this was a pretty smart threat he knew he couldnt blow my brains out or the car would crash where are we going i asked i will give you directions he said then added because he just couldnt help being an asshole we are going to meet some jews in the desert jews in the desert theres a fresh concept but i figured that one of those jews was probably nathan and i was praying that the other one was neal chapter ah night in the desert the open sky the sparkling stars a fire crackling in the brisk air add to these simple pleasures the joys of no food no water no blankets the inimitable camaraderie of an old man soliloquizing about the good old days and a moronic lebanese kidnapper pointing a gun at you and the heightened sensibilities produced by the awareness of ones imminent execution and you have yourself one of lifes peak experiences its miller time nathan seemed to occupy a mental space all his own i could hardly blame him a man his age must have been exhausted after a carjacking a kidnapping a car accident an explosion and a hike up a dirt road to an abandoned mine where he would be starved dehydrated and frozen i didnt feel so zippy myself so it was little wonder that he had gone into the drone zone a stream of consciousness that had innumerable pools and eddies we all leaned against our logs and stared into the fire sami held the gun in his lap pointed directly at yours truly while he used his free hand to alternately massage his sore crotch and rub his inflamed eye nathan had been at it for a good two hours and had just worked his discursive way back to the delillo sisters i was barely listening as nathan droned and the delillo sisters were twins you could not tell them apart except that dorothy delillo had a mole on her tukus but of course only donahue knew this because the delillo sisters were in vaudeville not burlesque nobody saw dorothy delillos tukus except for donahue because dorothy delillo was very proper except for one time and that was when she shared a bill with the great rulenska hypnotists always have russian names dont ask me why but you never see a hypnotist with an italian name rulenska wasnt russian he was polish from new britain connecticut why they call this town new britain ill never know because its all polacks there i stayed one night in new britain on my way from new haven to the catskills there go the delillo sisters i thought and i still didnt know what had happened to hannigans glass eye either not to mention how nathan had come to teach whos on first to lou costello i looked over at sami who had a dazed look in the one eye that wasnt all red and swollen and rapidly closing because there was a snowstorm you cannot get a lightbulb changed in new britain connecticut because there are so many polacks living there no jews either so just try to get decent deli a polish sausage maybe sauerkraut drech in the catskills they have jews more jews in the catskills than in israel i played the catskills many times the delicatessen magnificent not wolffs perhaps but very good the one time i played the catskills after spending an endless night in new britain connecticut i do my schtick to an empty room there are maybe twelve jews plus the waiters in the room try making twelve jews and three waiters who are making no money laugh they laugh at nothing a fire maybe they laugh at because the hotel is losing so much money i told them the joke about the priest and the rabbi father murphy goes up to rabbi solomon and says sorry about the fire in your synagogue solomon says shhh its tomorrow nobody laughed to them this is not funny that night what do you think i cant get to sleep i look out the window of my room what do i see nathan had my attention it finally occurred to me duh that what i was hearing was what we graduate school types recognize as an allegory sami on the other hand was not really listening but i dont think he ever had the advantage of attending graduate school so he was just staring into the fire but trained as i am to find symbolism in everything whether its there or not i was listening as they say intently i see sammy stein the hotel owner sneaking out the back of the restaurant with the gasoline cans sammy looks up and sees me then he gets into his car and a few minutes later guess what the restaurant burns down i dont say anything i mind my own business what am i going to do testify a few days later sammy that schmuck calls me tells me to keep my mouth shut if i know whats good for me i decide to go work vegas for a while in vegas i have friends what happened with the delillo sisters i asked softly ah nathan said dorothy delillos mole remained just a rumor until there is a party at donovans afterhours everybody wants to see the mole in a nice way i mean very friendly dorothy refuses finally rulenska says i can make you show the mole dorothy says bullfeathers i have seen your crummy act a hundred times its a phony rulenska just laughs gets out his big pocketwatch and starts to chant watch the watch watch the watch over and over again nathan was moving his index finger back and forth across his face watch the watch watch the watch youre getting sleepy sleeeepy sleeeeepy sleeeeeeeeepy samis good eye was just about closed his chin touched his chest sleeeeeeeeepy sleeeeeeeeeeepy sleeeeeeeeeeeeeepy i went for him sami opened his eyes and raised the gun i punched him in the face a knockout chapter yeah okay he was fivethree already prone and had previous wounds but it was still a knockout i grabbed the gun from his limp hand a regular benny leonard you are nathan said i got into the spirit of camaraderie and said a regular rulenska you are after all nathan and i had teamed up to the get the gun me with my lightning moves he with his hypnotist memories there was no rulenska you stupid nathan said i made it up bullfeathers the emmis i looked down at samis unconscious body what are we going to do with him i asked shoot him we cant just shoot him nathan why not nathan asked he was going to shoot us this was true it was also true that heinz was probably still planning on it but that was another discussion we dont have anything to tie him up with i said i didnt want to take a chance on getting that close to sami anyway i wasnt all that confident about my chances for another stunning knockout lets just leave him where he is and keep the gun on him simpler to shoot him nathan said you want i should do it no i could poke his other eye nathan offered youre a vicious old man after what hes put me through then he told me about seeing sami come out of the house with gasoline cans and drive off how he thought that sami saw him how sami had called him and threatened to kill him and how he had run off to vegas is that why you kept stalling i asked why you took the car an einstein this boy is why didnt you just tell me i thought you were with the insurance company nathan said that you were going to make me testify but why get in samis car what was i going to do run nathan asked i had almost escaped at the mens room when you stopped me schlemiel you are dumber maybe than lou costello who did not know salami from pastrami true i said but i have a wicked punch what wicked punch he asked you knocked a sleeping man unconscious my grandmother could have made that punch and shes been dead forty years yeah but he had a gun i pointed out he was asleep nathan yelled i put him to sleep what more did you want i should maybe put a gas mask on his nose then you could punch him i should tie up the sleeping man first maybe then you could be a hero and punch the sleeping man i said he was clearly awake before iit was lou costello who brought the salami sandwich to arthur minsky nathan raised his arms what do you think ive been trying to tell you sami woke up he lifted his head and moaned dont hit me anymore okay dont hypnotize you you mean nathan said sami rubbed his head and looked around he saw the gun in my hand heinz isnt going to like this he said who is heinz anyway i asked a nazi nathan said a nazi i asked do you know this guy who needs to know him nathan asked with a name like heinz nazi that doesnt necessarily he is sami said is what i asked a nazi sami said aha said nathan and he sent you to kill nathan i asked its true sami admitted a nazi and an arab want to kill a jew nathan said so whats new and hes coming here to pick you up sami said after i dump your bodies and you were willing to do all of this for an insurance claim and i thought i was cynical sami shook his head not for the insurance money okay for the lawsuit i dont get it heinz figured it out sami said what he planned okay was to burn down the condo and leave enough clues so that the insurance company would deny the claim because of arson but not enough evidence that a jury would decide arson so you sue the insurance company and the jury gives you millions in puny damages punitive damages i said okay sami said and that works oh yes sami said solemnly heinz has done it many times okay i love this country i said me too said sami of course witnesses are not good okay i wasnt going to be a witness nathan yelled sami asked who knew ask nathan snapped i would have told you sami shrugged i assume heinz owns a gun i said a big one will he come alone heinz has no friends said sami except me okay sami i said youre not heinzs friend anymore okay youre our friend okay okay do you know why this is i asked it was a rhetorical question but sami answered because you have the gun okay i guess if you grow up in beirut you have a firm grasp of the dynamics of friendship because i will shoot you i said if you try to doublecross us i cant believe i said that and yes i am embarrassed about it im embarrassed for two reasons one its a tired old line from about thirtyseven bad movies two of course he was going to try to doublecross us no no no no no sami said were the friends now okay as an expression of unabashed duplicity henry kissinger couldnt have it said it better so youre going to do exactly what i tell you to do right i said to sami you bet sami said what do you want me to do i tried to maintain some vestige of authority as i said i dont know yet but when i do know i want you to do whatever it is with that ringing declaration we settled in to wait for heinz not that it was necessarily a given that heinz would get there first i hadnt checked in with graham and knowing him like i do hed have already started to track me down chapter i figured out that we were in a sort of race in reverse that is the longer it took me to chauffeur heinz to wherever it was we were going the more time id give joe graham to get someone there first did you get that the point is that i lightened up considerably on my normal lead foot see where i live austin nevada is in the middle of your wideopen spaces in fact they call route which stretches across nevada into utah the loneliest highway in america and we tend to look at the speed limit more as a suggestion than a command ive never gotten a speeding ticket in fact i dont even know anyone whos ever gotten a speeding ticket so i normally drive pretty fast but now i slowed down thinking that saves lives might be pretty literal in this case heinz caught right on you are driving slow he said im doing the limit faster you told me not to speed he thought about this for a second then said speed cleverly it aint the autobahn you know step on it i dont know where he got the step on it bit but i took him at his word and put that pedal to the floor it had nice pickup for a fourwheeler what are you trying to do he yelled follow instructions you wish for the police to stop us well yes bonehead thats what i had in mind as long as you gave me permission i didnt say that of course anyway he yelled slow down make up your mind then heinz got on the phone and started punching numbers dont listen he ordered what did you say i asked he said not to listen hope answered helpfully i didnt hear him i said i wasnt listening there was something in me that loved jerking heinzs chain maybe it was the hormones it didnt matter though because the other party didnt answer i could hear that mousy little voice on the other end say the mobile phone customer you are trying to reach is not answering please hang up and try later as if its any of their business i mean if i want to sit there and let that phone ring until alexander damn graham bell gets up and answers it i will heinz wasnt all that thrilled either i glanced in the rearview mirror and saw that he had this bewildered confused look on his puss you know that sort of dazed expression that type triplea anal retentives get when things arent going exactly the way they planned i made heinz out to be one of those kind of cooks who absolutely positively cannot substitute an ingredient in a recipe there are some people like that you know they have everything together and are just paragons of control until they find out they have to use monterey jack instead of cheddar and then they just go to pieces i filed this piece of psychological insight away figuring it might be useful at some point because it was clear just then that heinz had just had to swallow his first slice of cheddar i guess neal would call that a tortured metaphor but screw him whoever it was that old heinzy was calling he damn well expected him to be there and the fact that it was a mobile phone led me to believe that heinzy was not precisely sure where he was going this would of course drive a type triplea anal retentive german neal would call this a double redundancy but screw him again just nuts not home huh i said see im one of those kind of cooks who just cant resist squirting lighter fluid on the charcoal briquettes i told you not to listen whats that i told you not to listen sorry he told you not to listen sweetie i told you not to listen yeah and what are you going to do about it i asked you know lighter fluid briquettes hormones whatever he sat back and sulked for a minute then he said when we get to the desert you will see what happens were in the desert dickhead language sweetie sorry into the mojave heinz specified where your bodies will never be found sorry i said what did you say i wasnt listening but i sure as hell was old heinz was taking us up to the mojave where the sun could kill you in about fortyfive minutes that is if heinz didnt want the giggles of shooting us and he was righteither way nobody would ever find our bodies not mine not hopes not nathans not neals nealthe reluctant father of our unconceived child then a really awful thought occurred to me if heinz was planning to dump our bodies had he already dumped nathans and neals chapter i was trying to stay awake youd have thought it would be easy right what with the fear anxiety hunger and thirst and all but theres something in the human system that just wants to shut down when things get too hideous and i was struggling to stay conscious and keep that gun pointed right between the beady eyes of our new friend sami so i tried to think about things first i tried to focus on the dynamics of our situation heinz was on his way and had a gun heinz would be thinking that we were already dead and all he had to do is pick up sami and drive back so the thing to do was to hide throw sami out as bait and get the dropoh god did i say get the dropon heinz before he figured out that we werent dead simple right what could go wrong another possibility was that graham would track us down before heinz could it wasnt out of the question graham wouldnt fly outthat would waste timebut hed direct efforts over the phone he would have already used my creditcard number to get the carrental agency and the license plate of the car a little grease would have the state police locate the car at the rest stop thats where it would get tricky would they just assume we kept going west on route or would they think of taking the back road south through the mojave if they looked down the back road theyd see the wreck of the car and figure it out from there if not hello heinz so what would graham do send his troops on the highway or the back road easy graham would do both graham would have a map spread out in front of him and would consider each and every possible route from where they found the rental car then hed send his troops out on a coordinated organized search with designated checkin times and places youd have to know graham to know how sure i was of this for example this is a man who does his weekly grocery shopping as follows he decides what hes going to cook then writes down all the ingredients he needs then he redoes that list rewriting the items in the order they appear in the grocery store as you work from the left aisle to the right that way he can go through the store once in one smooth progression from left to right if any man could sit behind a telephone in new york city and find the splotch of a burnedout car in the middle of the mojave desert that man was joe graham since i figured it was a push between heinz and graham getting there first and there was nothing i could do to affect the results of that race i moved on to another topic babies specifically a baby karens and mine not a real baby not yet but a putative baby a possible baby baby baby baby baby just the word was intimidating and yet maybe it was the very real prospect of imminent death that made me reconsider my timetable on the bword thing two years was a long time and a lot of things could happen and it would seem like a waste if karen and i didnt have a a kid karen would be a terrific mother and i would be awell i could be an acceptable father there probably was something to all karens psychobabble about unresolved rage at my absent father and inadequate mother that didnt necessarily mean that i couldnt rise above it though a man plays the cards hes dealt right a man sigh a father now if theres a scarier word than baby its father i know it seems obvious to you but i just then figured out that it wasnt the kid i was so afraid of it was being the kids father i mean what does a father actually do i knew from watching old television shows that a father takes the kid into the study and says wise things to it but that was about the extent of my knowledge and i believe weve already pretty much established that i dont exactly overflow with wisdom what was i supposed to do take the kid into the study and say petulant things to it oh man a father sigh okay so i never knew my father i never even knew who he was for the longest time as a kid i thought he was chinese or something because when i asked my mother who my father was she answered some john in my childhood years such as they were some john had loomed large in my imagination he was variously a football player a baseball player an astronaut a war heroyou get the pathetic ideaand in my imagination he was always coming back for me somehow hed get the idea that he had a kid and would move heaven and earth to track me down and one day id be sitting on the fire escape and see him coming down the alley and hed look up and see me and just know and in that deep manly television voice hed say son thank god i found you pathetic huh when i got a little older say ten i gave that one up by that time i figured out that my father was just another pathetic loser who had to pay a woman to be with him the kind of guy that even if he knew he had a kid out there somewhere wouldnt give a good goddamn so what does a father actually do see i cant tell you i can only tell you what my father actually did nothing thats what so what chilled me right then more than even the freezing desert air was the unavoidable fact that at least half of me was that guy that bum and i didnt want to do to any kid what man talk about bathetic next topic an old man nathan i was worried about him he was shivering now even by the fire and i didnt know how much more he could take ornery as he was hed already been through a lot and who knew what was coming up i snuck a glance at him he was lying with his head propped against the log his blue eyes were watery and tiredlooking now he seemed small and frail and quiet not poutingquiet either but really quiet for the first time since id known nathan he was truly silent i guess old men look at death all the time hey nathan yeah whos on first we went through almost the whole routine before he fell asleep then i managed to slip an arm under him and hold him against my chest it was still cold but that might keep him a little warmer me too i guess chapter one thing about the desertyou can hear a car coming from a long way off the sun was just up a pale orange circle in a lavender sky that wouldnt last long soon the sun would be blazing washing out the sky to a blue so pale its almost white nathan and sami were asleep i eased my arm from under nathan got up and peeked over the edge of the knoll a car was coming up from the south i figured we had about ten minutes when i came back to the fire nathans eyes were open for a second there i thought i saw nathan smile i put an ungentle toe into samis foot wake up i said what kind of car does heinz have he has a mercedes sami mumbled that was good news i wasnt sure what a mercedes was i had in mind a sleek sedan though the car i saw looked more like a small truck and a porsche a bmw and a land rover sami said that was bad news the car i had seen looked like it could be a land rover what colors the land rover i asked white i think heinz is here i said okay friend sami you know what to do sami bobbed his head like one of those dogs in the back window of a car i tell heinz your bodies are in the shack i bring him in okay okay i said and you do anything different im going to put one in your back id heard this line in a movie and thought it sounded pretty tough yeah okay i thought that sami would think it was pretty tough he didnt exactly quake though so i added if you try to signal him in any way any funny faces any hand gestures anything at all ill blow your head off okay okay sami said were the friends now yeah were the friends then i heard the crunch of tires on gravel the car was coming up the dirt road places please gentlemen i said i helped nathan into the shack and sat him down on the floor in the back then i crouched under the window to the right of the door the plan was that sami would walk heinz into the shack i would stick the gun into heinzs back and the good guys would win that was the plan anyway i heard the car pull up and the car door open whoever it was didnt plan on being there long because he left the motor running of course i told myself it was still possible that this wasnt heinz but one of the legions of private eyes that graham had doubtless sent to search for me i mean there had to be hundreds of white land rovers merrily offroading the greater californianevada desert biome it didnt have to be heinz hello heinz sami yelled of course it had to be heinz it had been that kind of a errand i resisted the urge to peek out the window as i heard footsteps coming our way i did sneak a glance to nathan he shrugged sami heinz said where are in the shack sami said very good sami so far so good heinz theyre in the shack and they have the gun sami yelled very bad sami so far so bad sami having somewhat compromised the old element of surprise i stood up and risked a peek out the window sami was bolting toward heinz like a lost puppy toward his master i could have indeed put one in his back except for three things im a terrible shot with a pistol i didnt have it in me and heinz had a forearm around karens throat and a gun to her head talk about your element of surprise what the hell was she doing here and what was hope white doing in the passenger seat using karen as a shield heinz advanced toward the shack and yelled put the gun down jew or i kill the girl did you ever wish you were clint eastwood the issue of looks aside did you ever wish you were clint eastwood so you could do the things he does in the movies see heinz was considerably taller than karen so his whole big flat head was exposed clint eastwood would have raised that old magnum and blown heinzs head clear off his shoulders but i didnt feel that lucky i really am a terrible shot and my hand was shaking anyway i just didnt feel up to making a snap shot just above the head of the woman i love the potential mother of my child drop the gun heinz yelled come out with your hands up no kidding he really said that and no kidding i really did it i couldnt think of anything else to do i tossed the pistol out the window then stepped into the doorway i looked at karen she looked scared of course but by no means terrified hi i said i dont do quips well in the face of danger hi she answered how are you oh fine how are you ovulating how can you not want to make a baby with a woman who says things like that is the old jew in there heinz asked what old jew i answered nazi bastard i guess he is i said then hes next said heinz he smiled raised the gun and pointed it right at my chest my heart stopped look out sweetie i hadnt even seen hope slide into the drivers seat but now she was plowing straight toward heinzs back karen slipped out from under his arm and dove to the side i flung myself sideways as the gun went off twice i cant tell you what happened next all i can tell you is that when the dust clearedliterallythe land rover was inside the shack karen was beating the crap out of sami and heinz and i were on our hands and knees looking at each other and his gun was on the ground between us we went for each other instead of the gun i was angry and desperate to save karen whom i loved and nathan and hope whom i had come to like andto tell the truthmy own life so i had a surge of adrenaline that i knew would carry me through i knew i could take heinz because i had to he beat the hell out of me i almost went out when his first punch smashed into the side of my head i punched back though and felt my fist smack into his jaw i hit him three more times in the back of the neck before he lifted me over his shoulders and slammed me into the ground i thought my back was broken i couldnt breathe and felt like there was a knife stabbing into my lungs my eyes watered and i could barely see heinz standing above me grinning he pressed his boot onto my throat leaned down and started to pick up the gun karen lunged for it heinz whirled around and kicked her in the stomach she doubled up and dropped to her knees i dove for the back of his legs and tackled him i climbed up his back got a forearm around his thick neck and started to choke him the big son of a bitch got up grabbed the back of my shirt and threw me over his shoulder he held on to my hand though and as i flew through the air he twisted my arm and jerked i guess i screamed when my shoulder popped out of its socket i guess it was me it might have been karen it might have been hope it could even have been sami as i tried to get up i saw sami grab the gun and hold it on karen i tried to push up with my feet but the ground was rolling around and the air was pressing down on my shoulders it didnt help that i could see my shoulder muscle sitting like a lump in the vicinity of my elbow i aimed a punch at where i thought heinz might be the next thing i saw was the flash of his boot in front of my face and then the world went black chapter when i started to come to heinz was carrying me on his shoulder like a sack of potatoes which aptly described me i was lumpy bumpy beat whipped mashed and about as useful in a fight so i was looking at the world upsidedown and backward as we headed up the dirt road up and behind the opposite knoll i didnt much care though i was sick dizzy and hurting in body and soul i was a miserable failure who couldnt protect myself the people i was supposed to look out for or the person i loved more than anyone in the world why heinz hadnt done me the favor of just shooting me back by the shack i didnt know i was going to find out because a few minutes later he stopped and dropped me to the ground it took all of what little i had left to swallow the scream ja this will do i heard heinz say he grabbed me under the arms and picked me up like a rag doll he stuck his face into my mine and said casually sorry to do this but i have only so many bullets ja and you made me waste two so a revolver six bullets two fired leaving four nathan hope sami and karen what mine shaft he said boring hole fifty feet deep perhaps so you wont suffer long and soon you have the company of your friends ja and he dropped me i slid down some dirt and then felt myself in open air i fell and fell and waited for the smack at the bottom that should end this i didnt exactly smack i splashed i plunged feetfirst underwater didnt hit bottom then struggled with my one good arm to the surface a circle of light tantalized about thirty feet up the hole was about ten feet in circumference and god only knows how many scant desert rains it had taken to leave this much water i tried to grab the side and my hand slipped i tried again same thing i couldnt even feel my left hand never mind raise it or grab anything all i could do was tread water and that just barely so there it is i thought theres no way out no way to help the others and nothing to do but tread water with one arm until i wear out nathan and hope were beyond help karen would die and i was drowning in the middle of the desert a while later when i heard the distant hollow thump of the shots i decided that drowning wasnt so bad chapter my ribs hurt like hell and my heart ached worse as i watched heinz carry neal away i knew i was never going to see him again neal i mean and yes i started to cry this time my heart really was broken and i didnt care that some little arab midget was pointing a gun at me and i didnt even care if he pulled the trigger my life was over anyway so when little sami i guess his name was herded nathan and hope out of what was left of the shack and sat us down in the sun to bake until heinz came to shoot us i didnt much care thats the downside to loving someone when they go they take so much of your life with them anyway old heinz came striding back a while later like he was king shit you know what did you do to neal i asked disposed of him he said then i really started crying i didnt care that the son of a bitch was enjoying it my damn heart was broken heinz kept moving fiddled with the land rover and managed to back it out of the shack then he said to sami you carry the old mans body i carry this bitch then we come back it will take both of us to carry the old lady i beg your pardon hope said okay said sami i he stopped in his tracks his mouth gaped as he looked over heinzs shoulder i looked too a jeep was barreling in on us the driver braked the jeep fishtailed and threw up a cloud of dust when it cleared i saw an older silverhaired man in an immaculate gray pinstripe suit climb easily out of the passenger side the driver a barrelchested man in his early thirties got out his own side sami dropped his gun in the dirt i could see heinz holding his behind his back the silverhaired man said hello mr silver nathan said good morning mr c mr c turned to heinz and said its not polite to keep people sitting out in the sun like this particularly older people what business is this of yours heinz asked wheres neal carey i couldnt see heinzs face but i knew it had that arrogant smirk on it as he said the same place youll he swung out the gun and went into a machoman combat crouch i swear that mr c didnt move flinch or even blink as his driver pulled his own gun and shot heinz four times in the chest before heinz could even raise his pistol mr c just turned his gaze to sami and asked wheres neal carey samis hand shook as he pointed toward the opposite hill i got up and ran chapter i dont know how long it was before i heard the footsteps at first they seemed far off and muffled and i didnt yell because it didnt matter anymore i figured that it was heinz and sami and that they were about to drop the bodies down the shaft i didnt want to see that anyway so i closed my eyes and tried to drown then i heard someone say i dont know maam im afraid hes dead and karen say then i want to find his body karen his body down here i yelled im down here i could hear the footsteps shuffling around down here im down here neal down here down here i saw karens face peek out from the circle of blue sky hold on babe she shouted theyre bringing a rope are you okay i think i have a cracked rib are you okay well im alive well i guess that beats the alternative she hollered i love you i love you too nathan i asked hes okay hope fine she yelled everyones fine except for heinz i dont think hes going to make it actually i didnt care if heinz made it or not you hang in there babe karen yelled theyre coming they came a few minutes later i saw the rope come down and managed to grab the end with my right hand then i saw the barrelchested guy from the sands peer over the edge can you loop that around yourself and tie it off he asked i didnt want to say that i probably couldnt do that standing on dry ground with two good arms so i yelled i can try trying wont cut it he yelled he pulled the rope back up hold on a few minutes later he was in the water with me he looped the rope around both of us and yelled take her up i could hear the jeep moaning in the sand a minute later we were in daylight at first the sun blinded me so i couldnt see karen i could feel her though as she put her arms around me when i was able to see her face there were tears on her cheeks i wanted to cry too to be honest but mickey the c was standing there in a threepiece suit in the desert sun not even sweating not a bead of perspiration on his smooth face thank you i said no problem he answered anything for natty silver the laughs hes given me and joe graham reached out for you said youre like a son to him okay maybe then my eyes might have moistened a little bit dont ever tell graham though okay in the distance i heard the basslike beating of helicopter rotors the cops i asked mickey the c snorted the cops they take forever to get here a few minutes later i was on a stretcher beside nathan silver on a mob helicopter zooming us back to las vegas wed been in the air about ten seconds when he mumbled so arthur minsky says to the irish kid son youre never going to be a good errand boy can you do anything else and the kid costello says i want to be a comic arthur laughs i laugh eileen the irish dream laughs benny the blade laughs then arthur turns to me and says there you go natty heres your replacement for phil gold teach him whos on first and i say this kid he cant learn it hes the dumbest mick i ever seen dumber maybe than you even i said to arthur minsky nathan yeeees didnt i meet you in cleveland once ive never been to cleveland neither have i i said must have been two other guys and i actually got a laugh out of natty silver chapter ms pamela a holmstrumclaims superintendentwestern states

rented annie hall if that will get you here chapter dear diary what a day i went over to visit nathan in the hospital he is sharing a room with that nice young man neal nathan says neal is kind of grumpy sometimes but nathan puts up with it because he says that neal is very eager to learn all about the good old days in burlesque so nathan is telling him all about it nathan is feeling much better even though the ordeal was very hard on him he has decided to buy a condo here in las vegas at first diary he wanted to move in with me but i didnt think that would be proper so i told him to get his own place nearby and i would come over for matinees blush blush that nice young man neal is also recovering he had a dislocated shoulder a cracked cheekbone a bruised hip a bruised throat a concussion and multiple contusions he says he is eager to get out of the hospital in fact the other day right in the middle of one of nathans lessons about burlesque neal said that if he didnt get out of the room soon he was going to stick his head down the commode and try to flush himself i think he must have been joking though because they wont let him up to use the bathroom and i think he is a little jealous of nathan about this nathan is already in a wheelchair and neal is still in bed im sure he was happy to see his fiancee karen you remember diary the nice girl that neal would not get in a family way she came in today as usual but she had a special gleam in her eye if you know what i mean blush blush she came in and said hello to us and kissed neal on the cheek how are you she asked better he said headache no shoulder not bad she smiled and dug into her purse then she pulled out a twentydollar bill and slipped it to me sweetie she whispered can i treat you to a movie or something she winked at me and i winked back and then i rolled nathan down to the cafeteria they have slot machines there karen was pulling the curtain around neals bed as we left i dont know what went on in that room while we were gone diary blush blush your confidante hope chapter men are dependable god blessem you can bust them up throw them down a mine shaft and half drown them they can have broken bones a cracked head and a body thats one big bruise in short they can just hurt all over and if that one part works they still want to you know do it its just one of the things i love about them not that i jumped right into the sack eased is more like it anyway when the moment came i eased into the sack neal being in a delicate condition and all first we made a little small talk petkovitch is suing you i asked when neal told me hes suing you too thats outrageous i said do you know a good lawyer i dont think well be needing one neal answered hes also suing mickey the c thats not real bright its downright dim neal said mickey the cs idea of playing rough includes a little more than sarcastic remarks in his correspondence i noticed right so how are you i asked i hurt all over one big bruise one big bruise i gave hope twenty bucks what for he asked get rid of her and nathan and nathan what for giving me that innocent look as if he didnt have a clue never mind i said youre in pain actually im starting to feel better and you need your rest in moderation he said with exercise but you cant get out of bed nope nope so any exercise youre going to get would have to be in bed hmmm hmmm i shut and locked the door then got out of my clothes im really feeling considerable improvement neal said what can i tell you the guy makes me laugh it must be the tender loving care i said is that it its about to be then i eased into the bed epilogue karen was just getting out of the shower when i asked her to get me a diet pepsi excuse me she murmured im in postcoital bliss i said and when im in postcoital bliss i need a diet pepsi why dont you get one i shook my head when a mans in postcoital bliss its the womans job to get the diet pepsi i smiled besides im not supposed to get out of bed im in postcoital bliss too too bad i looked at her with what i liked to think was a lascivious expression besides i said its your fault she got dressed and went out to the little refrigerator in the hall to get me a diet pepsi the phone rang hello son hello dad whats this i got in the mail today he asked from me no from elvis he said yes from you its a fathers day card i answered it isnt fathers day graham said it should be i said there was a long silence over the phone then i said dad thanks for finding me forget it graham said so hows palm springs i laughed then he nagged me about my various terrible injuries and i told him i was okay well you take care of yourself he said yeah you too we would have gone on in that vein but it would have been absolutely bathetic karen came back in sat down on the bed and handed me the diet pepsi did we attempt to make a baby i asked i was willing i thought i could handle it talk about your long silences then she shook her head i still want to though she said i think i do too but you dont know she said no she sighed lay down next to me in the bed and snuggled her face into my neck not knowings not good enough she said im sorry dont be sorry wherever you go there you are we held each other as tightly as two people with various broken bones could i think youre right i said i think i have a lot of stuff to work out i hate saying it she said but i think so too i just want you to know ive been thinking about it too a kid deserves that you know yeah i do i guess you do i swallowed hard and said so i think ill go see somebody you mean like a shrink dont sound so shocked no i think its a good idea she said im just surprised that you do i dont i just dont know how else to go about it we shared some more silence i think we should postpone the wedding she said is that a gentle way of saying were not getting married no its a gentle way of saying that we shouldnt get married until we know what we want she said and i guess we need to be alone for a while that scared the shit out of me youll be there when i come back if it works out that way she said and i hope it works out that way i love you i love you too i left the hospital two days later i was still sore and still hurting and had a heroic limp but it was time to go i said goodbye to nathan and hope karen had already left saying goodbye to nathan was harder than i thought it would be its funnyfirst i couldnt wait to get rid of him and when i finally did i felt kind of sad i just had this feeling that i had seen the last of natty silver and that there werent any more coming down the road i dont want to talk about saying goodbye to karen i didnt really know where i was going so i finally got on that flight to palm springs i hated to leave a trip unfinished i wanted to find a shrink and i figured that they probably had a few of them in california so i never should have got out of the hot tub right sometimes you get out of the hot water just to jump right back into it but maybe you have to almost drown before you really learn to swim and sometimes you find out that youre somewhat broken and you cant swim at all but you do anyway drowning in the desert you just tread water
