viable lewrie heir to a positive flood of guineas was none other than our lad alan and raised as a gentleman in st jamess square there followed the usual hellish childhood and a disappointing series of schools in which alan lewrie excelled at both his studies and the inventive some would say inspired creation of mayhem one example of which in resulted in the total demolition by use of explosives of the faculty stables and coach house at harrow arranged to be caught in bed with his half sister belinda willoughby so he could be exiled and never know that he was on the verge of being the last

prospect of a peaceful threeyear commission in command of a small vessel with the bahamas squadron at least as much as an unwilling navy officer may look forward to continued active service but then with alan lewries singular inability to keep his breeches buttoned his hands out of the honey pot his smarmy wit to himself or his mouth properly shut there is the distinct possibility that hes going to come a cropper again and judging from his own catastrophic past we may rest assured that somewhere along the line he simply cannot help getting into both peril and mischief now that we have all this out of the way then let us proceed with the continuing chronicle of our neerdowell rakehell i sed tamen nymphae cavete quod cupido pulcher est totus est in armis idem quando nudus est amor cras amet qui numquam amavit quique amavit eras amet yet take heed nymphs for cupid is wondrous fair when love is naked he is fully armed let him love tomorrow who has never loved and let him who has tomorrow love pervigilium veneris albius tibullus prologue is not to be entered into unadvisedly nor lightly but reverently deliberately the vicar intoned his voice ringing in stony rebuking echoes from the transept of st georges of the village of anglesgreen now they bloody tell me lt alan lewrie thought in anguish and in accordance with the purposes for which it was instituted by god the vicar continued casting a chary eye upon the couple before him which made alan almost wilt he directed bis gaze to his right where caroline stood flushed and trembling ready to faint with joy and the smile she bestowed upon him at that moment was so radiant so shudderingly glorious that he found himself quaking as well not completely in terror of his bachelorhoods demise into this holy union alan lewrie gentleman and caroline chiswick spinster now come to be joined if any of you assembled may show cause why they may not be lawfully married speak now or else forever after hold your peace the vicar warned wincing at the words as if he expected the hon harry embleton to charge through the doors at the back of the nave on horseback with sword in hand the crowd a devilish thin crowd alan noted fairly bristled and stirred and a sigh or two a grumbly cough could be heard i require and charge you both here in the presence of god that if either of you know any reason why you may not be united in matrimony lawfully and in accordance with gods word you do now confess it the reverend rushed on in breathy relief the tiniest quirk of a smile touched alans lips in spite of his best intentions as he mulled over his passionate albeit brief marriage to a cherokeemuskogee indian girl named soft rabbit and wondered if it counted no he sighed no benefit of proper clergy there he thought no way out damme and my enthusiasms for quim how do i get myself into these predicaments alan groaned caroline will you have this man to be your lawful husband to live together in the covenant of marriage the vicar inquired not without what to alan seemed a cocked brow in amazement will you love him comfort him honor and keep him in sickness and in health and forsaking all others be faithful unto him as long as you both shall live i will caroline declared without a pause with a tremulous eagerness and vigor delivering upon lewrie once more a visage of pure adoration alan the vicar intoned rounding upon him and to alans already fevered senses seeming to frown the slightest bit will you have this woman to be your lawful wife forsake all others lewrie shivered bloody bloody hell be faithful as long as we both i say hold on there mine arse on a bandbox the solemnity crushed in upon him then and he like as not would have torn out the doors if his legs would have shown any sign of strength beyond holding him shudderingly upright yet found himself declaring for all time i will with a force born on a quarterdeck that echoed off the ancient stones like a pronouncement of doom there was a tentative giving in marriage by uncle phineas in his role of paterfamilias for the chiswicks before the vicar ordered let us pray and they could thump to their weak knees upon the pad before the altar and as the vicar recited the short prayer of blessing before the lesson and epistle and the vows proper caroline insinuated a slim cool and soft hand into his and their fingers entwined to squeeze reassurance and strength there was no backing out now alan thought in for the penny in for the pound aint i ye gods it may not be that badi do care for her well as a rogue like me may care for anyone i might even call it love much as know what thats all about hd returned her squeeze and they secretly leaned their shoulders against each other and he became enveloped in the light citrony scent of her hungary water perfume again chapter it was springtime in england springtime in surrey and the high road south from guildford to anglesgreen was aflutter with the stirrings of butterflies young birds flitted and swooped or sat and chirped at their good fortune to be young alive and english bees buzzed and if one listened hard enough one could hear green buds and tender shoots sigh with delight in the somewhat warm wind two young men rode along the verge of the roadway to avoid the muddy spatters and deep ruts carved by winter traffic and the creaking wagons and wains of the local farmers the occasional flock of sheep being moved from one grazing to another one young fellow was a countryman towheaded and sinewy on a middling hired mare leading a pack horse upon which were strapped a few traveling bags of cylindrical leather or pouchlike carpet material he was dressed in a sailors sloptrousers shirt and neckerchief with a lowcrowned flatbrimmed hat of blacktarred straw on the back of his head and he gazed with a rustics fondness on the verdant green countryside recognizing merit and worth in welltended flocks and fields of trimmed hedgerows and woods the other was revealed a gentleman by his better horse by the fineness of his buffcolored breeches and waistcoat the newness of his plumcolored coat and dark beaver cocked hat and the sheen of his top boots this young gentleman snared the attention of passing travelers and the interest of the farmgirls whose sap was stirring after a long miserable winter there he found merit and worth he was three inches shy of six feet tall trim and lean hair of middle almost light brown crowned his head and fell in a short queue at the back of his collar bound with a bow of black satinand the hair was not drawn back severely but allowed to curl slightly and naturally at his temples over his ears like the bust of a roman or greek warrior the face was tanned much darker than most fashionable young gentlemen would care to display providing a background for eyes that would occasionally crinkle in delightful greetings to young farmgirls eyes that were sometimes gray sometimes blue and upon one cheek there was a slight white pucker of a scar which gave him the dashing rakehell air of past and present danger soldier or sailor most judged him a young man who held the kings commission from his clothing and the way he bore himself from his fine manners when he lifted his militarycut hat in greeting from the effortless way he rode as if born to a house of means with stables and the license of the hunt which did not come to the son of a crofter or tenant lt alan lewrie royal navy was feeling pleased as punch with himself and with life in general at that moment the spirited roan gelding he rode was a sound mount and there was nothing better to his way of thinking than to be in the saddle in the middle of a spring morning had his father not practically pressganged him into the sea service he might have considered a career a short one until he inherited he reminded himself in a cavalry regiment what else was there for a younger son that befitted one raised the way he had been trade a clerking job certainly not the clergy he shuddered much as he had at first despised the life he had discovered in the fleet and still looked upon with a chary eye as one of continual deprivation and bleakness he had in his luggage orders that would put him in command of a ship of war would transport him a quarter of the way around the world to the bahamas and the west indies for three years of steady pay at five shillings per diem to augment his prize money his french guineas and his mindanao pirates booty all now safely ensconced in london at coutts co bankers and each drawing a tidy sum of its own per annum and the world for once was at peace ninety percent of the fleet was laid up inordinary and there would be no roundshot round his ears for a change he did good as he felt admittedly suffer a tiny twinge of feyness from past experience whenever life tasted so succulently sweet but it was a very tiny twinge and it passed he had been far to the west country to wheddon cross in devonshire to visit his grandmother lewrie now a nuttbush which stratagem by the old lady had saved the estate from his fathers clutches though to his cost she had faded since his last visit in but was still among the living though that mercifully could not be said of the dour old squintapipes she d wed to transfer coverture and the inheritance out of sir hugos reach and now he was due at the chiswick estate there to languish in a lotuseaters paradise of sleeping late riding to hounds and splendid country dinners and dances until he was due to report to portsmouth to take command of a vessel named alacrity and on that chiswick estate would be the lovely and charming caroline chiswick who by the evident fondness in her letters to him was positively pawing the ground to see him once more what could be more perfect cony alan laughed out loud as he turned to look over his shoulder at his man will cony who had shared his adventures and his misadventures since yorktown deed itis a fair mornin sir cony enthused back beaming a farm lads pleasure to be in such fair country on such a fine morning an theres the squires house round the bend sir not a league from the public house at anglesgreen well stop for a pint hows that suit you cony lewrie promised then on to the chiswicks pintd suit me right down tme toes itwould sir will cony agreed kneeing his mare to match his masters quicker pace anglesgreen was a quiet community sited in a small winding dell along the banks of a sluggish but clearwatered stream with banks and bed flowing with rushes and grass the village was surmounted to north and south and at the far western end with low and gently rolling hills some forested some asweep with velvety swaths of rippling growing grain and those hills from the summit of the nearest seemed to topple to roll on forever like a delightful verdant seanorth toward glandon park and the thames south all the way to the channel at portsmouth there were three curving streets to anglesgreen two on the north bank and one on the south bank with two narrow stone bridges one at either end of the village there were shops on the high street georgianbricked fronts and bay windows for display spreading to either side of a much older tudortimbered public house called the ploughman behind the high street the homes were cottages with thatched roofs while on the opposite bank the houses were newer some georgian or semipalladian roofed with slate and looked upon with some suspicion as being a bit too grand and uppityall three streets curved to match the bend in the stream at the east end by the oldest bridge there was st georges church a high and narrow stone pile dating to the norman conquest with a topsyturvy cemetery nearby that sheltered headstones and monuments green with moss some from the ancient anglosaxon clan which had erected the nowfallen castle and bailey which brooded half a mile to the north of the first bridge now lost in scrubby woods and brambles that marked the edge of the local squires lands to the western end by the second bridge was a new green a parklike expanse of tall oaks that fronted another public house and inn replete with stables and a budding row of new cottages around itthe upstart red swan innit had only been there since henry vs times and in tiny anglesgreen one could ascertain a bodys station in life by whether a person frequented the older darker and cheaper old ploughman or rubbed elbows with the magistrate and squires crowd at the red swan lewrie knowing strangers were more welcome with the elite headed for the red swan and as they rode at a sedate walk up the high street villagers wagered correctly theyd not tie reins at the ploughman anglesgreen could be thoroughly boresome alan knewhed been there briefly once before in but it was homey a village so typically english with its stone buildings and fences its hedgerows and garden plots that anyone six months at sea would crave its peaceful boredom the trees were tall giving acres of shade ducks and swans swam the lazy stream in slow glides stocky fellows in homespun or a great houses castoffs fished from the bridges and banks gamboled on the greens strode about in boots and straw hats or sat sipping their ales in front of the ploughman a solid and dependable yeomanry who paid their rents on time worked their acres with diligence both prayed and played with vigor and formed the backbone of the nation there were smells of new thatch of cooking and baking of a load of wash being boiled and the scorch of ironing and starch of newbrewed ale mellowing in barrels and of cartloads of manure and animal fodder most especially ale lewrie smiled to himself as he drew rein at last in front of the red swan there was a daisykicker there in a twinkling to take reins and lead the horses off for a drink and a rubdown with the older ostler waiting hopefully by the stable doors to see if he might make money by putting them up for the night or rent them a coach there were quite a few horses tied at the rails splendid and shiny blooded mounts all sound hundred guinea horses with bright saddle leather and clean pads a backgammon game was proceeding at a table without the welcoming double doors in the shade of the trees and a lively sound of merrymaking coming from inside alan and cony entered handing their hats to a bobbing abigail in homespun and a pure white apron and mobcap the public room was crowded with gentlemen gathered around a large table all standing and laughing one of them alan recognized and went to his side governour chiswick he called the very fellow i was looking for good god here already governour said spinning to take his hand and thump him on the back we didnt expect you until the end of the week at the earliest by christ but youre looking fit an full of cream the chinee and the hindoos couldnt put you off your feed hey and i see that married life agrees with your digestion alan joshed him giving him a slight poke in the breadbasket governour chiswick the whiplean and dour eldest chiswick he had met at yorktown was now becoming a stout applecheeked fellow a settled and extremely wellmarried junior squire quite a change from the officer of a north carolina volunteer regiment and deadly with a ferguson rifle or sword or a pistol alan remembered this was the bloodthirsty blackhearted devil whod gutshot the informer that had gotten half his surviving company killed just before theyd escaped so he could linger in agony for days to look at him now youd never catch an inkling of that it does indeed governour grinned wryly come here alan and meet the lads and will cony still tailing along with this rogue of ours well step forward and take a stoup of ale with us good to see you alan and you as well cony thankee sir cony replied as someone shoved a stone tankard into his paws he stayed long enough for introductions then faded off to the counter apart from the quality to have a jaw with the publican and his pretty serving wench alan this is my fatherinlaw and you couldnt wish a finer governour boasted and the grayhaired man in question pretended to blush with mock embarrassment sir romney embleton the fellow who saved my bacon at yorktown lieutenant alan lewrie your servant sir alan replied so pleased to make your acquaintancemy brotherinlaw harry embleton governour babbled on sir romney embleton baronet was about alans height though heavier dressed rich and fine in dark brown velvet coat gray breeches and a white floralfigured satin waistcoat with the prerequisite black and browntopped riding boots on his thin shanks sir romney favored an older mans short white tiewig he looked to have been in his youth a most handsome and wellsetup fellow with clear blue eyes and a fairly smooth complexion free of smallpox scars and such the nose was a trifle beaky and the upper lip long as a horses the same could not be said for the son the hon harry embleton who though he was dressed richly as his father the baronet in red coat blue waistcoat and breeches could not aspire to the easy style and dignity of the father harry had the same extremely long upper lip the narrow horsy face of his father and to his misfortune the same overhanging beak of a nose but the eyes were set rather close together and were pouched as though by dissipation or too many late hours and where sir romneys hair might at one time have been blond harrys was almost black and lank tied back in a severe style and finally and most unfortunately where the elegant sir romney embleton was blessed with a square jaw young harry had a pronounced slope from weak chin to the point where his throat dived into his neckstock in profile he resembled an otter now were you with the army or with the navy lieutenant lewrie sir romney inquired as alan dipped his phiz into his ale navy milord alan answered wondering if he was teasing lock up the maids and yer daughters harry embleton guffawed or yer footmen the navys here damn the bastard alan winced as several of the rowdies had a laugh at his expense i think i could dislike this pissproud young fool alan stiffened and cut his eyes to governour who had winced a little himself i can assure you mister embleton your virginity is safe with me alan stated calmly as the laughter died away damme but this is a good ale havent tasted its like in weeks just ashore are you mister lewrie sir romney asked quick as a wink to cover the nervous laughter that reerupted this time at his sons expense out of the corner of his eye alan could see that governour had gotten a glum expression and that harry embleton was glaring daggers at him his face gone paler since february milord but i was visiting in the west country with my grandmother i dont believe devon has the soil for grains and hops that surrey has certainly not to make such a splendid ale as this alan stated now the chinese have good ale surprisingly you were with burgess chiswick in the far east sir romney nodded dominating the conversation a trading expedition an attempt to increase british trade milord alan said in reply he could never discuss what occurred in the past two years until england was once more at war with france the activities of english warships disguised as merchantmen had they been known would be a violation of the treaty terms ending the recent war to uhm open new markets and trading stations in cooperation with the east india company trade was not a gentlemanly calling though profit from an investment in trade was quite acceptable as long as a proper gentleman did not soil his hands with the sordid details of buying and selling this facile explanation breezed off with a languid wave of a hand sounded semiofficial requiring the presence of a naval officer and alan had gotten quite good at trotting it out since his return calcutta canton governour said with a wistful look i believe you saw both did you not alan deed we did governour alan turned a thankful grin on his compatriot and a host of trading posts you wouldnt believe for horrid heat and rain too took me a month to squeeze the last water out of my hats but tell me how does the chiswick family fare is caroline well quite well governour almost snapped father though well there was bad snow last winter and his horse fell with him laid out for an hour or so before anyone missed him and the surgeon had to take his leg where it had been broken by the weight of the horse governour how truly awful i had no word of it he recovered at long last thanks be to god but if you do recall how he was in wilmington when you first saw him ah alan nodded sewallis chiswick had been half out of his mind back then brought on by the death of his youngest son george of being burned out and impoverished by rebel irregulars led by his own relations because he was a tory a loyalist and had equipped the regiment in which governour and burgessserved a heavy burden on you govemour which i am sure you managed well alan concluded laying a supportive hand on governours broad shoulder thank you for that alan twas well said and well meant to be certain so how long can you stay with us govemour brightened three or four weeks if you can tolerate me that long alan laughed then its off to portsmouth and a new ship alacrity to be with the bahamas squadron ill need a good last dose of country life to do me that we can that we can govemour promised well have you aching for the sea by the time were done carousing sounds as if you gentlemen were doing a bit of carousing of your own as i rode up alan smiled did you race those fine horses i saw outside court day mister lewrie sir romney beamed we dealt with a couple of ruffians and were just recalling their appearance two poachers harry embleton explained weve been missing a rabbit or two from the warren a deers carcass was found stripped of meat well last night harry had to wheeze in fond remembrance for a moment last night douglas here our gamekeeper sets a mantrap or two and bang on midnight blam goes the trap we run out to see what we caught and no sign of em but this morning bold as brass they turn up at mister gallworthys the surgeons rattling with buckshot and he sent his man to fetch us caught em with the pelts the meat an all in their larders and had em into court one fellows bloody eye was gone chortled sir romney took the blast right in the face i suppose as he crawled up the path in the woods to lay a snare and will you believe sir that he claimed hee hee he claimed he knocked his own eye out cause the good lord told him to haw haw another stalwart chimed in said hed looked at a dirty book o pictures with only the one eye mind sir romney snickered an th good book says sir it says harry continued trembling with pentup laughter iffen yer eye offends ye then yer sposed t pluck it out aint ye now sir right yer honor sir as if that offending eye wasnt holed dead center with shot sir romney frowned shot from my springgun damme if it wasnt and the other could do no better than to say hed pelted himself whilst taking a loaded fowling piece down to show it off harry grumbled as though the second victim had been no amusement at all not even bothering to mock a country accent so what was the punishment alan asked appalled by them all hed seen men quilled with splinters limbs ripped off with grapeshot or puking blood from stomach wounds suffered in battle hed been hit enough to know what agony those men must have endured already transportation sir romney said and the families to be put out of the parish ill have no poaching on my lands and by jesus they know it and those two tenanciesll be enclosed last of the common lands this side of the stream anyway govemour stated calmly and they were always behind on their rents well alan i have to get back home finish up your ale and ride with me only if you promise you have some more waiting alan managed to smile good morning to you gentlemen milord i trust ill be seeing you again in the next few weeks well hopefully have merry times chapter bloody squires cony grumbled as they were fetched their horses a springgun a mantrap jesus sir and transportation to where i wonder with america lost lewrie speculated in a soft voice the fever islands that new van diemens land theyll rot in the hulks for months years and the famlies turned out sir just cause they aint freeholdin damn th bloody enclosure acts too easy now cony lewrie warned oh i knows sir cony huffed swiping his hair back from his forehead and putting on his hat might o been practiced sinnersn layabouts but they might o been poor folk what needed the meat tkeep their younguns fed too sir an not able tgrazebut one cow on th commons rabbits eatin up what little garden they got an them not able tlift a finger cause theys th squires rabbits life cn be hard fer poor crofters sir and a damn sight harder now they broke the law poaching alan declaimed with a nod of understanding but they knew the risks and they lost aye sir makes a man sad even so sir that it does cony lets get mounted then and go see nicer people than sir romney bloody embleton aye aye sir thats embleton land yonder governour pointed out as they rode west out of the village and crested one of those rolling hills our land starts at that creek mat feeds the stream up and over two hills west about a mile then down south to the chiddingfold road and another stream there were two estates in the beginning from our grandfathers on down two manors two famines father was due his parcel in but he wanted to stay in north carolina so he sold it freehold to uncle phineas to work as one farm paid a good price to us he did and brought it up to snuff altogether weve about acres in freehold or copyhold and when we came back to england uncle phineas rented acres back for a token guinea a year the copyhold recorded at which manor alan asked seeing that only the thin silver line of the small creek and its brushy bottoms separated embleton land from chiswick land glandon park with the embletons governour said once it was all part of the goodyers norman guidiers i think but the last of em died out lord four hundred years ago twas then the embletons were made baronets and awarded the land and the old castle and bailey alan pressed theirs ive a mind to look it over whilst im here think you i could the embletons should allow it governour smiled it was the eadmers vassals to king harold built it ill ask for you twas where i did most of my courting with millicent have to have a care though there may be mantraps thats where the rabbit warren is below the rise there i havent offered you my congratulations on your marriage alan exclaimed hitting him on the shoulder once more slipped my mind completely a lovely bride hey the most felicitous of women alan i cannot find words to say how charming how utterly governour enthused reddening with embarrassment love which had him halfseasover was not an easy topic for english gentlemen wait until you meet her i look forward to it eagerly alan assured him they reached a fork in the road and another bridge this one of stout oak timbers the fork led off to the right across the bridge over which they clattered onto chiswick lands at last damn fine lands mister chiswick sir cony volunteered as he beheld the lushness of the growing grain fields to either side the thickness of the wood lots and the pastures snowy with young sheep makes old gloucestershire look like a stone quarry so it does two hundred acres in corn and wheat an hundred in barley and hops and the rest rotated with sheep for manuring or hay for fodder governour boasted secondbest in the county next to my fatherinlaws uncle phineas has made it a paradise sheep are the coming thing in the south counties now weve orchards that make the best cider around and we rent out about eighty or so in sheep cattle sir cony asked with relish not so many as we may sell cony but enough for the use of the home farms weve pigs and chickens and ducks and all and a small herd of fine horses you take your pick alan youll see we have the beginnings of a good stud here the road forked again about a quartermile on the right fork went to the thatchroofed twostory cottage that alan had visited the last time and he began to turn his horses head in that direction no were all up at the main house now alan governour said thats leased out thought it would be better if father was under a closer regimen of care under uncle phineass roof and the honeymooners have to share a house alan teased well no ive a new place of my own down near the chiddingfold road it was a rough tenantry after all that house a man name of byford has it now hes the sheeper i mentioned around another turn across a pasture stood the chiswick manor house it was of homey red brick with a palladian entrance hall added on in front with two humbler wings of two stories each forking off at angles to enfold a lawn and flower beds around a curving drive race you to the door governour shouted putting spurs to his mount and was off like a shot alan howled like a red indian and got going in pursuit and his gelding snorted with alarm checkedand rose on its hind legs for a moment then caught the spirit of the game and plunged into a mileeating gallop stretching its strong neck out even with the docked tail of govemours thoroughbred they ran on alans horse gaining until its nose was even with the other horses shoulder both riders hallooing and yelling to draw the attention of the house to their antics out came an older man in breeches and waistcoat with a green eyeshade still over his brows an older woman alan recognized as mother charlotte chiswick a darkhaired beauty he took for the amazing millicent and there was caroline beat you ha ha governour bragged as they drew rein so hard they set their mounts back on their haunches look whos here alans horse couldnt help but paddle on across a flower bed and back in a circle shaking his head and snuffling rage at being bested curvetting as alan patted his neck and realizing that caroline had never seen him ride before which made him sit up straighter and extend his booted feet in the stirrups as he calmed the horse he sprang down from the saddle as a groom appeared to take the reins and strode to her side arms open in greetings how good it is to see you he cried its been a long two years and more alan lewrie oh welcome welcome caroline replied they met embraced for a second then held hands at arms length to gaze at each other and twirl around in a small circle at last she had become more lovely still too tall at two inches below alans height to be thought fashionable still willowslim and what london blades would call gawky but filled out rounder and fuller in the most interesting places her light brown hair shone like spun gold her hazel eyes twinkled with joy and the slight folds below her eyes crinkled in such a merry manner that he thought he could go on gazing at her slim highcheeked face for all time we didnt expect you til friday or the weekend she said i had good roads he replied i was inspired i rode like john gilpin caroline inclined her head to one side and winked with one eye forcing alan to notice that her mother was standing there he let go of her hands and fell to one knee before the old woman i was inspired by your ginger snaps mistress chiswick he cried i could not wait another instant to taste your ginger snaps alan lewrie you are such a wag sir mother charlotte said with a simpering laugh tapping him on the head with her fan come here and let me kiss you oh tis grand to see you well after all the adventures youve been up to among the heathens weve gotten a letter from burgess telling us all about it pirates and such and a battle hes well when last you saw our little burge well and full of ginger mother chiswick alan told her with a droll roll of his head its the hindoo cooking ya know full of ginger and chilies well and in command of his own light company in my fathers regiment so hell continue in good hands if you may call that good hands alan qualified to himself the last time hed seen him burgess was up to his teats in tawny hindoo maidens that he and a fellow officer shared in the quarters as their private bibikhana and his father had been going birr into a set of dugs himself well he thought pirate loot and satisfied creditors in londond keep his father on the straight and narrow and now that he was confirmed as lieutenant colonel of the th native infantry hed be happy enough for awhile uncle phineas allow me to name you lieutenant alan lewrie one who has done so much to restore the fortunes of the chiswick family sir your servant sir alan offered extending a hand im delighted to meet you at last and i you mister lewrie uncle phineas replied not looking one whit delighted by anything in the last thirty years he was a lean old stick dressed in rough homespun breeches wool stockings and old shoes that appeared to have been restitched but well blackened the waistcoat he wore was a very old style as was the linseywoolsey cut of his shirt and neckstock rich the man might be but he looked as dowdy as one of his poorer tenants he must have been in his sixties wrinkled as last winters apples with stray wisps of white hair peeking from under the green eyeshade cant thank ye enough mister lewrie uncle phineas said as he dropped alans hand after one quick dry shake and stuck thumbs into his waistcoat watch pockets gettin little burgess employed with the east india company wasnt sure hed find a situation not with times so hard wasnt cut out fer farmin thats gods truth and fer seein sewallis an his family safe to charleston so theyd be able to come home where they belong and for saving burge and governour after lord cornwallis surrendered at yorktown uncle caroline reminded him and he looked as if hed been reminded of that act of desperation perhapsonce too often for he screwed his wrinkled lips together and merely nodded i welcome ye to me home mister lewrie stayin long is it a few weeks if i may be allowed sir better that than kicking my heels in london or down in portsmouth waiting for my new ship to be turned over alan replied wondering just what sort of welcome hed come to ah caroline mother chiswick look whos here too you remember my man will cony cony had arrived with the pack horse and slid off his own to come to mem hat in hand god bless you young will mother charlotte exclaimed i remember you well from wilmington and all you did to get us aboard that ship ah youre filling out like a yearling colt you are and does our mister lewrie treat you decent that e does maam cony nodded shy in front of company well if he doesnt i know a snug niche for a good farm lad like you right here with us my word on it the older lady cackled missus chiswick miss caroline cony nodded again blushing more important have you been taking good care of al of our mister lewrie cony caroline asked saved my life time and again alan supplied for the ears of the comely housemaids who had gathered in the yard and did his kings enemies into fillets then tis more than welcome you are in this house will cony caroline said stepping forward to give him a sisterly peck on the cheek which made cony turn even darker red with embarrassment home you are for awhile with us thankee miss caroline maam cony bobbed and this is millicent alan governour said turning boyish as he introduced his young wife she was a lovely girl smooth and milky of skin with dark curling hair and startlingly gray eyes and a merry expression of her own it seemed as if millicent had gotten all the embleton elegance and neatness leaving her brother harry with none my best wishes to you maam on your marriage youve a fine man in governour as well i may attest your servant maam oh do call me millicent mister lewrie she chided with the regal dignity of her father the baronet such old friends of my dear governour should not stand on ceremony you do me great honor millicent thankee alan replied with a short bow prepared to like her if governour did well lets go into the house and have something to drink uncle phineas suggested yes i promised alan one of our ales even if he did lose the race governour laughed sorry about that but blood will tell you know i told you we had the start of a fine stud ribbons was one of our first colts and hes a treasure oh i dont know alan japed i almost had you neckornothing not bad for a fifty guinea new market gelding hes strong caroline said brushing alans horse on flank and neck before he was led away by a waiting groom short but a goer he looks like good build for the long stretch notthe burst canter by the hour he can alan agreed and worth an ale no matter his pedigree hey caroline made our ale last autumn millicent boasted oh just a few barrels caroline replied to try my hand at it then i must have some im sure anything she turns her hand to comes out superbly alan fawned and she blushed with pleasure at his words mmm yes uncle phineas frowned wrinkling his nose as if at a peculiar odor he surveyed the ruin of one of his flower beds and contemplated with very little joy of the doing just how long this ignorant arse was going to plague him chapter sewallis chiswick was a lot worse than alan remembered him whereas in wilmington the old man had been strong but vague he was now both reduced to pale ashes of a man in a wheeledchair and at times almost incoherent in his ramblings at least caroline was now spared the onerous duties of tending to him after a last few odd pronouncements a stout matron had announced that mr chiswick would retire and he was wheeled off to a ground floor chamber his bib still tied around his neck and spotted with attempts at dining it had put a definite chill on supper though they all tried to find other more amusing and lighthearted conversation to cover their embarrassment sometimes laughing too long and loud at hopeless japes then falling into an uneasy silence the supper though had been excellent somewhat plain but all hearty country fare there had been a salad carolines own apple vinegar and spices for the dressing fish from their own stream along with a plate of oysters up from portsmouth carolines own horseradish to spice them what the french would call a remoulade a cured ham baked in a golden honey sauce snap beans from the garden tiny new potatoes and shallots completed of course with roast mutton and followed by a peach jumble which carolines mother informed alan was cobbler in the carolinas her very own recipe though done personally by the talented young lady with the light brown hair aye proper victuals uncle phineas allowed grudgingly as he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and untucked the napkin from below his chin our little carolinell make a young man a goody he said using the old country term for a proper wife and the first name or gained nickname of a third of the poor women of britain are they at it again alan sighed sharing a smile with caroline as she ducked her head in what he thought was shyness im not under their roof four hours and theyre buttockbrokering her like a brood mare just like burgess did to me back in india economical she is uncle phineas went on as he leaned forward to top his glass up with the last of a rather good claret good in the stillroom the garden the stables present the right young feller with a goin concern wellsetup house a household run in style and economy is that his favorite word alan wondered he certainly takes economy to extremes with his own furnishings no lets say cheap i am ever amazed at how accomplished you are caroline millicent chimed in from the other side of the table you sew the neatest finest stitches play and sing wonderfully well why i believe you could spin straw into gold makes me seem such a wastrel drudge in comparison im simply useless at practical things i assure you youre not goveraour guffawed i know i have the bestrun household in the county two counties and a most felicitous one as well mdear and you to thank for it the sight of the bloodyhanded governour chiswick pissing down his wifes back and fawning so gapejawed foolish over anyone was not the sort of thing alan lewrie had ever expected to see on this earth still it was interesting to see millicent deliver a fond gaze at the oaf and lower her lashes in a very intimate but significant manner and alan being a keen observer of countryhouse games among those circles of rakehells and corinthians he had known before the navy knew in an instant that theyd be at each other before their coach got into their own drive oh but you are so clever and accomplished millicent caroline assured her it is i envy you while i merely learned country things in the carolinas and all the better for it when the time comes to wed phineas chiswick pronounced yer both o ye the finest young ladies o me acquaintance an here yell be livin side by side sittin in the same pew an more than just neighbors all yer lives god willin like the way ye play yer music millicent to the harpsichord an caroline yer flute a fine duet yell play in future uncle caroline attempted to protest wringing her napery into a ball alan perked up a bit this was more than shyness on her part it sounded more like an old topic which had been done to death and still dragged up for tasting often as communion wine and what does he mean alan asked himself all this side by side in the same pew by god just who are they buttockbrokering her to she looked out of the corner of her eye to alan and he lifted one eyebrow to quiz her and for a hopeless unguarded moment there was almost panic on her face and a silent plea what the hell is going on he mused caroline chiswick is one woman i never expected to look so lost and helpless why shes the most capable young woman i ever did see speaking of a duet mother chiswick intervened mister lewrie has never heard caroline play her flute she is most talented i assure you sir and dear millicent fairly makes the harpsichord sing with the angels what was that piece we heard in london that you both do my dears by that german fellow the dead one handel momma caroline replied looking in a bit of a sulkpublic musichall antics uncle phineas groused ringing his tiny china bell for port cheese and biscuit trash germans hah i fear most of the great composers are german alan chuckled theres that fellow in vienna whos making quite a splash another of em that mozart i heard some of his stuff in london before i went to devon and bach of course now you can hardly call jesu joy of mans desiring musichall trash mister chiswick oh we know that millicent enthused caroline mother chiswick let us leave these fine gentlemen to their port whilst we set up the parlor for music and icarte mother chiswick is correct mister lewrie caroline is divine on the flute she was indeed divine for an amateur while governour turned pages for them from behind the harpsichord they played several duets together and millicent proved to be a most accomplished young lady as well playing with feeling and passion instead of the clumsy almost monotonous clumping pace and nevervarying strength of tinkling one usually heard in someones salon they did assay a handel piece a short sonata originally for flute and continuo intermixing a program of country airs and sober bach cantatas alan watched caroline a cup of tea cooling on his knee he was impressed by the solemnity and deep concentration she showed but disturbed by the toobright glitter of her eyes when at the sadder pieces millicent noticed too and began to play rounds for them to sing governour bellowing out hunting songs and things hed learned in north carolina alan had to rise and try to sing pulleyhauley chanties for them rollicking verses each more improbable and more scandalous than the last until uncle phineas announced that he was tired of all the folderol and was off for bed and no one seemed the slightest bit interested in ecarte so alan could only peck caroline on the cheek and be lit up to his room for the night there to ponder what could make a girl of such a gay and stalwart nature so sad mrroww then again louder and more plaintive mrrrowwv howls of torture of blackhearted denial lewrie sprang awake in his bed and tore back the curtains there came another mrroww from the door softer and more pleading this time oww bloody bloody hell he muttered swiping his hair out of his eyes and staggering to the door he opened it and beheld a very ragged yellow ramcat of his acquaintance seated on the parquet flooring one william pitt if anything he had gotten uglier since hed last seen him in one ear was tatters one eye squinted and the tail was missing a patch or two but it was the same huge onestoneinweight monster that had ruled the shrike brig with claw and fang pitt you bastard alan said stooping down to touch him but william pitt was having none of that he shied away and ran into the bedchamber to leap for the bed making the mattress bounce on its rope supports and lashed his tail as he stood there bristled up well you wanted to come in so what is it you want from me hey alan went back to the bed and sat at one end wary that the cat had not remembered their brief grudging alliance and would rip into him as was the animals wont when he first reported aboard a barely wetted down commission officer he wiggled his fingers and pitt flicked the good ear shook his head then ambled over to sling his considerable bulk against alans hip and begin to purr loud as a bilgepump chain in stupefied amazement alan discovered that william pitt would allow him to scrub under his chin on the top of his head and on his chest by god but youve mellowed alan whispered in awe like as not youd of had my fingers in shreds by now killed any livestock this week have you the odd pig there was a rap on the door and cony entered with a small tray which bore a china cup a lidded silver pot and a sugar and creamer mornin mister lewrie sir cony bubbled over with bonhomie well if tisnt yer ole cat william pitt got ya up afore i did tis a fine fine mornin perfect for a canter on the downs hot chocolate tperk ya up sir ere ya go push ya into clothes an theres a country breakfast awaitin belowstairs sir now a maid i made hacquaintance of she told me that

til th piphany youll be needin me on yer ride this morning sir cony asked with an askance glance ah no i dont believe so cony alan replied after one sip of the perfectly wonderful chocolate recognizing when his man was so cheerful that he was practicing his own form of coyness were both here to enjoy ourselves ow he had ignored william pitt who had rolled over on his right side and was pushing hard against alans nightshirt with all four of his paws claws out and huffing for more attention now theres a bloody wonder alan sighed mystified once more and turning one hand back to ruffling the cats throat and jaws why dont you just fart about today have a yam or two with your new ah compatriots even go down to the village for a pint or two ill not need anything more til oh supper say er thankee sir cony showed quick gratitude then feigned contriteness at abandoning his master and his responsibilities iffen ya think theres no service i could be adoin for ya that is theres two shillings on the dresser there alan said as he finished the cocoa and set the cup down for pitt to peer and sniff at i trust the girl is pretty aha so thats it you rogue maybe you could practice some of your hindi on her hamare ghali ana achcha din hello wont you come into our street a whores greeting larlcee bahut sundar hai jeehan ellooee sahib cony blushed a bit though still more fluent than lewrie would ever be bazaarirahndi naheen hai makaan naukarilarkee the girl is very pretty yes lewrie master not a bazaarwhore a house servinggirl namaste conyji lewrie snickered putting his palms together and bowing his head may god protect you cony got me a cundum sir cony whispered darting out the door as lewrie shucked his nightshirt and reached for his stockings god damme ive corrupted him swear if i havent hey pitt do they let you take breakfast hungry alan finished dressing and headed for the stairs and william pitt leapt off the bed and made a tawny streak ahead of him god there was leftover ham salted kippers hard peppery sausages crisp bacon strips boiled fried or scrambled eggs on the sideboard warming in candleheated covered servers racks of thick chewy homebaked bread toasted on forks over the kitchen fire and fetched out by the halfloaf the remains of the peach jumble sat on a raised pie plate and stone jugs of preserves jams and marmalades paraded down the length of the breakfast table along with huge sweaty globs of homechurned butter between every two place settings and for the serious feeders there were pork chops sizzling on blackiron pans heaping bowls of gruel and three different kinds of cheeses as for beverages there was ale a lighter gassier beer tea coffee more chocolate or a heavy almostblack berry wine made on the property more of carolines doing he discovered though he could not assay a taste after heaping a plate and taking three cups of strong tea there was a mob at table caroline looking a bit perkier this morning dressed in a middlegreen wool dress with a short jacket for riding on over it governour in rustic and worn boots breeches and waistcoat so he could tour the properties millicent was there in a white sack gown shawl and mobcap mother chiswick was turned out in gray wool there was the head groom the gamekeeper the assistant estate manager who was trying to keep track of a twosided conversation between governour and uncle phineas who was gnawing his way through a stack of pancakes pork chops and ale both eager to be out and doing and a continual parade of underlings there to take orders and turn to with a will alan picked at his food trying to carry on a conversation with caroline who was seated by his side this morning with william pitt in either his or her lap peeking over the top of the table and singling out particularly dainty delicacies from their plates with one sly paw when not being offered fatty bacon fast enough to suit him christ is it always like this alan managed to ask in one of the lulls broken only by the sounds of somewhat sedate chewing ive seen quieter twopenny ordinaries on boxing day im afraid so alan she smiled the work of a farm starts early and never stops then thank god i was never cut out to be a farmer alan said in reply the navys bedlam enough cony mentioned something about riding this morning if you would wish it alan she assured him if you would rather loll about for the morning we could go later that is if you could tolerate my being your guide anywhere as long as its not here he chuckled patting her hand and anywhere with you caroline then lets be on our way right now she urged halfrising if you have eat sufficient point me to a horse chapter she rode as if the hounds of hell were at her heels astride the olderstyle saddle and bent over low her light brown hair touched with gold streaming from beneath her straw bonnet like flame her mare was a goodun making it hard for alans gelding to keep up for at least half a mile until they thundered up a rising down towards a patch of wood lot their mounts sucking and blowing like bellows at last they slowed to a walk as they neared the summit and alan could draw alongside her to see what had vexed her so good little mare you have there he complimented her and you ride prettily but what was all the hurry i just wanted to get out from under foot she replied just a touch wan though flushed with the exertion and the excitement of a hard ride i liked our little house near the road better instead of all the coming and going around uncles at least down there we felt settled and at peace snug in our own house at last i dont see why you had to move really alan said as their mounts cropped grass after getting their wind back surely the maid that cares for your father could have come there instead uncle insisted on it caroline replied with a wry grin which flitted away quickly he insists on rather a lot of things i fear caroline is there something the matter here alan asked far be it from me to presume to intrude in your familys affairs but oh alan you whove done so much for this family already she warmed to him leaning over to lay a gloved hand on his sleeve as if we dont consider you kin by now of sorts you do not intrude to ask me anything then whats going on he shrugged when father lost his leg and fell ill he was months in bed caroline sighed looking away down the toppling downs toward the sea to the south governour was head of the family then but he was still estate manager to uncle phiqeas and just married to millicent embleton so by rights uncle phineas is the master of the land and of our lives what did the romans call it paterfamilias and the booty that burgess sent home from india did not help only in improving our finances caroline said with a frown but not in our station you see we are still tenants relatives yes but mostly tenants when it comes to uncle phineas we had hoped for a warmer reception from blood kin i remember in london when we were finding burge his situation your uncle did not sound wholly solicitous and charitable to you it was his obligation nothing more caroline told him a chore of blood he was eldest responsible for his younger brothers folly thats what our plantation was in the carolinas folly their father united the two estates after my granduncle died without issue ive always felt uncle phineas feared that father would split it again even after getting a fair price for it when he sailed for the colonies he didnt have to pay him a shilling for it after all he was the eldest due to inherit everything yet he gave back acres for a guinea a year alan pointed out oh yes he rented back acres but that ended last year caroline almost hissed in anger father too ill to work it gove up on the larger tract or pining for the embleton land who else could do it mother my mother is a dear woman alan but she depended on my poor father for everything it could have settled on burgess but you know what he thinks of farming and governour makes no objections alan asked unable to see the usedtobe fiery young hawkface accede to losing land dearest alan governour will inherit all when the time comes caroline barked in sour amusement the last eldest chiswick male then uncle phineas will have what hes always wanted and what is that alan asked an heir to hold the land if hes said it the once hes said it anhundred times she frowned the land is forever men and women rise up and die but the land is always and he doesnt want to see it in a strangers hands the embletons get what they want as well she almost spat in conclusion and that is that the two biggest estates are united caroline shivered after all these years with governour and millicent wed they are linked now i see why governour would not object alan laughed in understanding theres always the offchance hed outlive harry and end up with it all oh yes caroline nodded and to ensure his complaisance sir romneys putting governour up for commons next byelection as his pet member from a rotten borough he controls up north harry already sits for anglesgreen therere not twenty men with the hundred pounds in rents or income to vote here and even less in teverly new town caroline shrugged then smiled ruefully forgive me alan a woman is not to know such or involve herself in mens doings but thats the way things stand here as if that ever stopped you alan hooted trying to cosset her out of her bleak mood ive seen you before remember so eager to talk about any subject then fade back into the woodwork when you think youve overstepped yourself what a bloody waste thank you alan i do appreciate your understanding caroline truly smiled for the first time that morning yes i find it hard to be so subservient in north carolina so much more was expected of a woman so much more was she allowed as a helpmeet to her man and her family here one sews neatly she complained one plays an instrument one reads and distills and orders servants and cannot dirty ones own dresses at gardening but must tell others what to do here in england i feel so like an illbred lout out of place he muttered laying a hand on hers this time and she seized his hand like a drowning victim and linked their fingers not a pinkcheeked rude colonial surely out of place yes she sighed almost on the point of tears truly i wonder if i have a place or a life i may call mine own and what sort of a life do you desire caroline i wish to be happy alan i wish to to wed someone i love so deeply and do i if indeed have the the economy to present that man with a wellrun home then that is what i want i want children and perhaps one maidofallwork to help a little but i want to be useful not only around the house but on the land and to myself and those i love i know i may not aspire to a mans role in this life i have no wish to enter parliament or night wars but i do wish to be able to use those talents god gave me as a woman and the mind i believe he gave me for something more useful than bakingl to be able to talk about any subject without restrictions alan suggested oh god yes caroline beamed laughing at her immodesty or what most in society would have called an unnatural desexing immodesty to be included when men talk about important matters and not be run off to the parlor to drink tea and get the card table ready to be listened to if i feel i have an idea they havent not patted on the head and told tuttut there there little girl even if its but the one man who would listen to me that would be enough i think and no one is listening to you now alan said letting go her hand and dismounting he held her mares head while she got down revealing a dizzying vision of a slim white leg above the tops of her riding boots for an instant as her gown and petticoats raked down the saddle burgess used to she said taking his hand once more as they strolled to the south edge of the rolling wooded hill to look at the splendid morning view it was a little cloudy and gloomy yet before the sun broke through and the tiny dells among the downs were clotted with wisps of mist and when i was with you i felt that you did or at least attempted to alan but very few people now now i listen and i am told what i feel what i should think whom you should wed perhaps alan said stopping them so she would turn to face him is that why you are so sad i came down expecting to see the pert lass i remembered and i find you troubled and melancholy who is the right young man of whom your uncle speaks i have two wonderful choices in life caroline gloomed again three really the last may be the most acceptable it does not demand me living a lie i may take service as governess to a widowers children mr byford who rents the land and house we once had and the other two between embleton and glandon park there is a family with more than one thousand fine acres she said with an impatient shake of her head george tudsbury another widower is in need of a wife hes in his forties with three children to raise mostfortunately all of them girls who may not inherit the land if a younger wife is living hes a very good friend of my uncle phineas of much the same tastes ugh alan exclaimed and again ugh he at least is a decent man alan with no vices and no hard edges such as uncle phineas in that at least they differ may i assume that he is your uncles preference no you may not there is also harry embleton she tensed mine arse on a bandbox alan cried why i met the bastard and what did you think of him alan caroline teased enjoying alans use of what she had come to know as his favorite phrase caroline were i a london pimp id have him wash first and still charge him double for the insult to me whores alan shouted oh god alan i do so enjoy talking with you caroline laughed out loud taking hold of his upper arms youre just the breath of air that i ve been needing youre right he is a a bastard she took a deep breath astounded by her own boldness hes a cruel cruel a god if he were in the carolinas hed be a low country slaver no matter the quality of his birth hes dull hes they have a library at embleton hall hundreds of books and i doubt hes read more than three in his entire life its all horses and hounds politics and sport who he insulted last how he put someone in their place and youve expressed your lack of interest to your uncle i take it alan asked yet he still allows these gentlemen to call insists upon it caroline sobered once more it matters not which i end up choosing as long as i choose he gains more land on either side or i may remain a spinster earning my own keep should i spite him govemour wont back you oh governour is all for harry they hunt and fish and ride together god knows what all caroline said with a wave of her hand as though to drive away a pesky wasp thank god millicent is for me she has not pressured me in any way much as she might care to have me as sisterinlaw i cherish her for deflecting some of governours insistences he thinks that i am of an age to marry and that beyond the two men i have few other choices for a suitable match therefore i must marry and if i must then harry is the better the richer and the younger and not as plodding as mister tudsbury who merely wants a married governess for his living children he points out that if i marry harry then either he or i end up with the two estates in time what a marvelous bloody bargain alan glowered and you the prize mare to seal it christ now you see why i have been so downcast caroline sighed and why i was so looking forward to your visit when you wrote to say that you had first to visit in devon i was almost beside myself but now youre here and for a few weeks at least i shall feel more at ease the dashing alan lewrie could cheer up the dead ill do all in my power for you alan vowed ill sing songs ill play the merryandrew and be your court fool if thats what it takes shall i do a handstand he laughed trying to balance on his palms and ended up rolling flat on his back i know he suggested getting to his feet quickly what if i climb this damned oak and fetch you an acorn or two she was almost shrieking with laughter as he tried to scale the stout trunk to the lowest boughs come down here at once oh alan not an acorn i beg you bloody squirrel then he huffed springing at the tree once more and clawing his way up about six feet off the ground william pitt fetches me quite enough squirrels thank you do come down alan ill settle for a leaf just a leaf she cried in stitches at his antics ill take one thats fallen my kingdom for a fallen oak leaf god but you do look foolish is that the way you scale the rigging on your ship im graceful as a bloody monkey alan crowed and began singing a suggestive chantey called the holy ground he finally dropped to the ground and scooped up an entire pile of oak leaves and brought them to her dribbling a trail behind him he knelt at her feet and heaped them round her boots for you my lady queen of the hill oak leaves for your kingdom arise sir knight i dub thee knight of my realm she giggled touching him on both shoulders he stood and there was not a handspan between them and they stopped laughing she looked up at his face uttered a tiny hitching litde sound that sounded like a sob and threw her arms around his neck her cool lips pressed upon his her breath warm and clean on his mouth and he put his arms around her lifting her off her feet to drape against him she felt so light so slim and completely encirclable in his arms and alans head spun with the scent of clean hair and soap of the light citrony and balsamed tinge of the hungary water she had dabbed on burgess forgive me but i think i want to tup your sister he thought and what your family thinks of me after that bedamnedthe sound of hooves interrupted them two sets of hooves at the least of horses being urged up the hill to them and he set her down and stood a little back from her full of regret that the moment had passed his groin was on fire and his heart was pounding such as he had never experienced with common lust or the fine edge of expectation before consummation caroline chiswick made him dizzier and woozier to hold and kiss than anyone he had ever known and ive had my share now havent i so i ought to know alan told himself damme to hell but i think im in love with her not not just afire to have her damme if i aint been toyin with the thought of her since caroline brushed his cheek with her gloved hands and stepped forward for one last toobrief openmouthed kiss then took a few steps away composing herself to see who was coming have they sent someone after us he asked softly i dont know heavens it might be something wrong with father i can think of no other reason dear god no alan pray for him a short prayer to spare him now she commanded in a fret two riders topped the rise and alan turning to look at her could see the tension still in her pose for it yet might be bad news of mr sewallis chiswick but the light in her eyes and the joy on her face that he had put there a minute before fell away like an extinguished sunset when she beheld who led the pair of horsemen my dearest caroline the hon harry embleton exclaimed as he drew rein to lord over them from horseback your uncle said he thought you might have come this way had you forgotten that he had given us permission to take a morning ride together this day good morrow mister embleton caroline nodded coolly and good morrow to you mister lane you have met mister lewrie i think mister embleton sir alan grinned touching the right side of his cocked hat in greeting like a casual salute to a deckofficer and i believe i met mister lane douglas lane is it yesterday at the red swan your gamekeeper is he not sir joy of the morning sir mister lewrie harry embleton replied sounding a bit arch as he squinted his closeset eyes at him then just as quickly lost interest and turned his gaze to caroline well shall we have our ride my dear he asked turning almost cloyingly mild mister embleton i do recall that my uncle did give us his permission but i considered that was dependent upon whether i gave my consent to it caroline replied in fact in the excitement of mister lewries arrival i quite forgot it perhaps you should talk with uncle phineas and me for another time god the girl has steel in her backbone alan exulted well since we are all here that is harry suggested looking extremely miffed and hunching down into his coat collar since there was no way to turn him down without being rude she heaved a small sigh to show the slightest bit of exasperation at his intrusion and allowed as how they might ride for a piece together if you would assist me alan she asked after he brought her mare to her embleton sprang down from his saddle to come to her side but caroline was already taking alans offered hand to steady her as she put a booted foot in the stirrup and got aboard my thanks to you alan leaving harry flicking reins on his boots foolishly any time caroline lewrie smiled looking up at her and it mattered to him to see how she would handle this most women hed known would have exulted in having two men snarling over them and would have gotten a certain joy out of the heightening of a bad situation alan crossed to his gelding and mounted then walked up to her side well where to now down towards that middle stream you told me of after clawing up this hill im sure the horses could use some water yes that sounds pleasant she replied and led off without a backward glance harry and alan caught her up and rode to either side of her a lovely morning harry embleton said dye know that we put up a fox on the way over be good sport wish we had the hounds with us do you hunt lewrie not for a long time in kent cruel it is alan replied blood sport not tyer taste then my word youve come to the wrong place hey caroline harry guffawed i was speaking of the horses sir alan smiled evenly too much neckornothing like a steeplechase these days now a proper hunt you have to stop and let the dogs have their scent take care of your animals ive seen too many fine horses put down to some fools carelessness to suit me i do think it cruel as well to kill a blooded horse for the momentary joy of chasing a fox whose pelt price would not buy a new saddlepad mister embleton caroline added much as i love riding and going hard crosscountry id never lash little sabina here to her death she patted the neck of her mare lovingly and the hunt does result in a lot of damage to crops and such surely snares are to be preferred to keep down the fox population foxes be too clever tsnare miss chiswick lane said from behind e takes too many rabbitsn hens an its good sport caroline has ridden on our hunt havent you my dear i had no idea you disliked it so harry pouted i did not say i disliked it mister embleton i merely said that some are too heedless of their horses she replied without turning to look at him now last fall you lost that fine gray taking a fence when the gate was open not a furlong farther down to let the dogs through and think of the colts you could have had from that black that fell going down the steep bank a thousand guineas lost dont trouble your head about profit or loss caroline the honourable harry stated with a little titter of amusement they gave good sport in their lives and thats what horses are for and we own enough of them mister lewrie i say you ride well i see perhaps you might be interested in taking a look at douglass mount there i think you could appreciate his formation douglas here you ride with mister lewrie for a span whilst i and caroline go ahead i see hes a goodun alan said turning in the saddle to eye the horse in question then turning back im more taken with sabina here is she from governours stud caroline indeed she is alan isnt she beautiful caroline waxed almost rhapsodic about her mare who perked her ears up and arched her neck as she was praised shes such a bighearted old baby i cannot tell you how often shes gone the limit when she knows she should quit goodgaited too and on a canter youd think you were in an armchair they discussed the finer points of the mare to exhaustion and to the total disregard for the earnest harry embleton who sulked on the far side his ears burning and his breakfast congealing into some stony lump in his stomach and what are the horses like in india alan did you get to ride while you were there caroline demanded to know heavens more to the point what is india like your letters told me some but not in such detail as i would have liked well picture alan began happy to monopolize another topic which might be good for the rest of the morning you exchanged letters harry sniffed that did not sound very promising and he felt another spasm of jealousy and hatred for this interloper he hadnt known that they wrote each other such was for people already plighted or betrothed or those who would be when circumstances allowed dammit all oh yes father gave his permission in charleston long ago mister embleton caroline told him looking in his direction for the first time in half an hour but hes i mean your uncle he is aware embleton flustered almost drawing rein to pull away that my father is no longer able to direct the affairs of his children mister embleton caroline huffed not liking to be reminded of that fact and at twentytwo i am hardly a minor to have to ask with whom i am able to correspond as a friend of the family embleton sighed finding a cause for relief i see as a friend of our family certainly caroline said turning to smile at lewrie as one of my dearest acquaintances as well a lovely spot this alan said pointing to the grove of willows by the little freshet toward which theyd been riding god wish wed thought to pack a lunch have what the frogs call a piquenique we could do that tomorrow caroline exclaimed oh lets do or we could ride back to the house and put one together now alan suggested its what mile and a half out and back he took his watch from his pocket and studied it just in time for dinner will you ride with us back to the house mister embleton caroline asked him perhaps you could dine with uncle phineas and governour and i know millicent hasnt seen you since last sunday church you owe your good sister a visit you know she concluded with mock severity then turned back to lewrie should i bring my flute do you think if you do not find my playing tedious i insist on the flute alan laughed i was quite taken with your playing last night it was only then i learned you were so musical and talented a frenchstyle piquenique a bottle of wine and music what could be grander give my regards tmy sister harry embleton glowered turning turkeywattle red at not being invited to join them ive things to see to at home then for today at any rate my dearest caroline allow me to call upon you for another ride soon i shall speak to yer uncle then for his permissionyou may speak with my uncle mister embleton caroline said with a touch of ice sidling her mare round in a small circle to end up with alan almost between them we shall see g good day to you caroline harry grumped sweeping off his hat and mating a bow and to you lewrie good day mister embleton caroline nodded joy o the mornin mister embleton alan said with a grin raising his own hat in parting harry sawed the reins about and put spurs to his stallion off in a cloud of dust and high dudgeon lashing with the reins to goad the poor beast into a furious gallop lane touched the brim of his hat and took off in pursuit hoping young harry didnt kill another animal in his rage chapter for perhaps a week longer lewrie and caroline were inseparable there were more daily rides piqueniques strolls through the village to shop together with alan allowed the signal honor of carrying her basket for her of opening doors for her of offering her his arm upon which she would from time to time rest her soft hand and forearm there was divine services at st georges with alan ensconced by carolines side in the chiswick pewboxes holding the prayer book and hymnal for the two of them which perforce required them to come together demurely at hip or shoulder and in the yard afterwards it was alan who was by her side as introductions were made to other young people of her acquaintance especially the other young ladies of anglesgreen and its environs introductions at which alan lewrie strove to shine to be singularly pleasing and courteous though never more than mildly interested in anyone else as he appeared so attentive to caroline and her mother the other girls tittered behind their fans and prayer books casting sly meaningful glances at the pair or peeked from beneath their bonnets or over their shoulders at the hon harry embleton who ground his teeth and cursed under his breath at being shut out so completely left to stand in foolish neglect when he insinuated himself into their company alan had always considered caroline chiswick the jnost delightful young woman of his acquaintance the most skilled the easiest to talk to and one of the most intelligent beyond her fair willowy beauty which any young girl could for a time boast there was an intellect a depth beneath the frippery and japery which had always intrigued him she was not a snickerer or titterer much and though it was the nature of young women to be enthusiastic and at times giddy or so lewrie thought from past experience of young women who could be styled ladies mere was beneath carolines merry nature a placidity a centered calm not unlike the eye of an indies hurricane where one might discover a safe lee abounding common sense and natural grace and warmth far more alluring than the most exciting young chickabiddy which would be there when all else failed or withered what had he really known of her before he wondered a brief encounter in wilmington during the evacuation in a day and night aboard the desperate frigate on the way to charleston and one soulshattering midnight kiss on that freezing quarterdeck letters on rare occasions when mail caught up with his ship and then three weeks of closely chaperoned and toobrief meetings in london whilst he finagled an appointment for her brother burgess through his patron adm sir onsley matthews a whole three years later all of which had led him to say that now theres a sensible and lovely young lady whod make me a fine wife someday assuming he lived long enough to wed he qualified assuming he ever had an urge to do something so completely stupid and alien to his rakehell corinthian nature now in a positive orgy of constantly keeping company with her and given the heady rush of randiness she aroused in him her wholehearted approbation of him and her merriest most affectionate and warmest encouragements alan lewrie gave up thinking and dove in to wallow in that affection consideration and encouragement his heart too went out to her when he contemplated which of her gloomy choices for her future she might have to accept once he was gone he had met the tudsbury fellow her uncle phineas liked and the tenant byford and it made him ill to think of either of the elderly farts sharing table with her much less bed worse than harry embleton damme if they werent he gagged there was too at last lewries perverse streak to consider he doubted hed ever warm to the hon harry embleton who struck him as the sort of complete fool who were it raining claret would have but a floursieve to catch it inand hed drop that lewrie knew his constant and seemingly affectionate attentions to caroline made harrys liver fry he knew harry detested him more than cold boiled mutton and made no bones about it one could toast bread on his overt scorn his hostility and being alan lewrie lewrie cheerfully and with much mirth enjoyed every cuttyeyed glare and schemed to see what new devilment he might invent to vex him i havent the lip for it i fear caroline alan admitted to her after a paltry assay at playing her flute he laid it aside on the blanket and lay back on an elbow to poke into the commodious food basket to see if there was anything left of their rustic repast perhaps a flageolet would serve better caroline told him a wry smile still on her lips from the horrible sounds he had produced one blows into the end not across and how ones lips are pursed is of no matter pursed lips are unsuitable for other amusements as well he chuckled trying not to sound too much anyway as if he were leering we were discussing music sir she reddened eyes demurely downcast but with a smile on her face i enjoy music immensely but ive never seemed to have had a talent for the playing of it alan shrugged i admire your gift as a musician almost envious in truth ah but have you ever really applied yourself alan she said teasing inclining her head to one side and making her long glittery light brown hair swish most fetchingly i cannot imagine anyone so capable as you not mastering anything he attempted god bless you for your high regard of me caroline he sighed in pleasure taking her hand to bestow a brief kiss upon it i hate to disabuse you of the notion but i aint perfect not good at everything thankee kindly for it though he lay back on the blanket to stare up at the sky his coat and waistcoat for a pillow she reclined as well on the other side with two decorous feet of blanket a gulf between them though she still held his hand across that space lord what a perfectly lovely day it is he chuckled happily it is indeed she agreed eyes shut and lips curved in a secret smile and a ruined castle of our very own not that norman pile she concluded with a little laugh days before they had ridden with governour and millicent to the guidier castle and bailey to tour it escorted most unctuously by harry and his constant minion douglas lane the gamekeeper who was there to disarm the mantraps and springguns what joy there may have been in the excursion had been ruined by harrys black looks alternated with his feeble attempts at gallantry and possessiveness this may be just as old caroline boasted older perhaps not as grand certainly but ours on chiswick land far by the northwestern bounds there stood a tiny ruin atop a bare hill norman keep angle or saxon hill fort ancient roman camp or celtic oppidum reared before caesars times no one could tell for it had lain empty and barren time out of mind there was a spring and a wellshaft full of stones and trash on the western side inside a fosse now filled with weeds and bushes behind a raised earthen parapet and manhigh wall of drylaid stones now mostly tumbled down to lower than ones knees in most places a watchtower reared from the center on a higher platform of stone and earth like a broken tusk the narrow doorway gouged into a shallow veeshaped opening one could now drive a cart through and its circle of walls no more than waist height the whole green with moss and the hardiest grasses the spring now trickled down a grassy slough through a rent in the wall and the moat down a slight slope littered with remnants of the walls stones to the musically trickling creek which marked the boundary inside the parapet and fosse the horses grazed and sipped water while within the circumference of the fallen tower they lay at their ease they had ridden to it that morning partly for caroline to show off what chiswick land could boast against embleton and partly for the deliciously daring separation it afforded them from the great house and its doings they could quite easily imagine that not a single human being stirred within two miles of their aerie alan was blissfully contentand most pleasantly stuffed they had dined on cold sliced tongue and mustard served gaminghouse style a la lord sandwich between crusty new bread slices on fried chicken cheese and sweet pickles and had washed it down with a cool bottle of rhenish another sat waiting to open in the chill waters of the spring an expertly tiedround turn and two half hitches on its neck made from a length of smallstuff to draw it up with which caroline had thought most clever of him to bring along and also most knacky of him to know how to tie she let go of his hand and he put both of his palms beneath his head as he gazed up at the fleecy clouds that sailed overhead framed in the circle of the watchtowers ruin as if seen through a spyglass birds flitted and warbled through his squinted vision a pair of rooks sailed along from one tree to another and a falcon circled lazily above them he heard music as caroline sat up legs tucked to one side and began to play a very old country song hed heard before but never knew the name to he gave her an encouraging smile before turning his face back to the sky and closing his eyes more than ready for a short nap of satiation and peace almost at the verge of sleep he did not notice when her music ceased almost adrift he barely sensed her shadow over his sunshut eyes no more than he might have noticed a cloud occluding the light for a second or two he grinned slightly as something soft tickled his cheeks as a sweet fruity perfume insinuated its way into his snoozing awareness of grass wool and fried chicken what woke him was the soft moist pressure of her lips his eyes flew open and there caroline was kneeling over him bending down with one hand supporting her the other holding her hair back a most fond look on her face and in her eyes grinning at waking him grinning with delight at the way she had done so and grinning with excitement of being for a fleeting moment just a bit wanton chaperoned as they had been as in public as they had been in the last week they had not had opportunity to kiss beyond that one enthusiastic but interrupted moment the first day theyd ridden alan smiled back at her and she leaned forward once more to bend down to him then being alan lewrie his baser instincts took over and he raised a hand to caress her cheek as their lips met to stroke under her thick hair to the base of her neck and hold her from escaping his arm encircling her upper back the other to explore the length of her down to her waist from her shoulder to draw her down to recline against him his nether regions sprang awake as wefl as their jips parted as their tongues met and circledhis with long practice hers in a shivery experimental response to his immense surprise she did sink down beside him atop him sliding her feet down toward his as he began to kiss her cheeks her eyelids her nose and her brow to nuzzle deep under her hair to her ears below and behind them into the secret hollows of her throat and under her chin down past her collarbones to her exposed chest with a shuddery impatience she put her arms about his neck and sought his mouth with hers once more with a swishing of cloth in ancient instinct one thigh crept up across his outstretched legs and near his groin mewing with her first heady experiencef passion she returned his attentions measure for measure her breath coming ragged and sweetening cowandclover musky as it mingled with his as his free hand stroked down her flungacross thigh to discover the last hem of her skirts the smoothness of a stocking tied above her knee and the exquisitely maddening softness and smoothastalc texture of her thigh she shivered and wriggled against him as he made his way soft as butterflies and caressing with his fingertips all the way up the back of her leg to the fold where slim thigh ended and softbutfirm buttock began until she began to weep against his neck her tears and breath hot as a forge oh god alan but i love you so much she cried trembling with her passion ive always loved you he froze after a moment his insistent hand came back up to her back to hold her close and stroke her hair she kissed him once twice thrice more chastely soft then rolling with enticement each time before she leaned back the slightest space i have loved you ever since you first came to our door in those rented rooms in wilmington alan she told him her lovely face alive with fleeting emotions first joy and pleasure then hesitancy at her revelation five years ive dreamt of this five whole years ive wondered how youd feel i know proper young girls aint to own to such i know young english ladies oughtnt say such things butat last youre here where i may at last tell you face to face and other things alan shuddered trying to be light and other things she echoed nodding slowly and resting her body a little more atop him again our toofew letters theyd never serve to tell you alan you were half a world away at sea and you could have dismissed me as a foolish young chit had i ever dared record my feelings towards you on paper but now we have so little time before youre off again i could no longer keep it to myself do you see alan before you sail out of my life again you have to know how much god save me how deep in love i am with you oh caroline he whispered into her hair folding her into his arms tighter and closer for want of something else to say as his mind rattled about like a startled sparrow in a cage and like a sparrow seeking an exit you darling darling girl damme what do ye do now ye poxy clown he wondered what do ye say to the poor little mort it was not as if he hadn t been halfseasover about her those past five years every one of her letters that had survived the post and the voyage of delivery had been a veritable feast for his soul every sight and scent and sound of her in their tooshort rencontres had made him woozy with both delight and lust but then so had a platoon of delectable young mutton have i been a fool all this time alan dearest she asked in a small slightly scared voice against his cheek i do confess i love you have loved you such a long long time ive dreamt about you thought about you made up silly fantasies she rushed on frightened by his silence and unwilling to give him pause in which to answer fearing an answer which would break her heart he could not hurt her feelings could never even consider hurting her feelings of that he was sure she was indeed dear to him but by replying with the truth or nearly the truth he would step over the bounds of flattering but playful gallantry and creampot courtship into another infinitely restrictive world of course he speculated quickly as she prated on her family might not approve after all and would deny them or he could vow his love for her but plead his new commission in the bahamas requiring a long betrothal for what that was worth to her sparing her tudsburys byfords and most especially embletons advances then what he might do with his own life overseas would be his own still setting anything permanent far off into the future could he spurn her affection and break her heart no could he be callous enough to sail off and leave her to a cruel fate no could he rescue her yes he could and still remain mostly free i love you caroline he muttered in reply at last stopping her lips first with a fingertip then once more with a kiss and she yelped aloud in shivery relief in pleasure and in sudden springing joy and when she drew back once more to gaze upon him her visage crumpled somewhere between tears and heavenly elation the look she bestowed upon him so full of love and promise was all the reward that any lover could ever hope to see truly i do love you he grinned back at her jolting himself with the horrifying thought that for once in his miserable dammeboy life he was telling the truth when he said that to a young lady oh alan god youve made me so happyl she exulted with a trembly laugh of victory my alan wonderful marvelous alan my own love there ensued a few feverish minutes during which neither of them had need for speech as they swooned with the wonder of kisses and caresses of rolling about on the blanket limbs twining as they took the measure of each other heated nearly to a forges glow or the blue white heat of steel experimenting with how two alien bodies would mesh together in the years to come first clumsy and with no clue where hands and arms would be most comfortable or exciting but learning quickly though still gowned caroline was explored with gentleness and nowhere alan caressed or kissed her did she flinch from though she started now and again as she experienced sensations she had not in her limited knowledge ever even imagined and she chuckled and sighed and groaned with delight laughing once out loud in reverie of a neighbor boy in north carolina who had dared to kiss her on the shoulder and lips one night when she was sixteenpurselippedand how she had at that time thought that the heady sensation she had experienced then was the height of human passion alan reclined atop her her sack gown and underskirts were rucked up near her hips her thighs parted by his weight and ancient instinct on her part their groins pressed close and shifting slowlyagain in instinct on her part as alan tenderly undid the buttons of the back of her gown rained kisses and endearments muffled by her flesh upon her shoulders her chest and the tops of her breasts alan she groaned we yes he muttered hoarsely we should stop for now dearest she concluded please jesus bloody christ on a cross he groaned to himself damme not now but he with the utmost regret of his life suffered himself to slide to his left to recline beside her though with one arm behind her still there was no way he would be able to ride back to the great house in his raging aching tumescence he thought he would be fortunate indeed if he might manage to walk but she was right he thought miserably as he enfolded her once more and confined his attentions to kisses and close hugs with no more attempts at removing her gown ill not make her think she was tumbled in a hayrick like a goosegirl he told himself what if she became pregnanti havent my sheepgut condom with me a pristine betrothal could become a swordpoint wedding in the blink of an eye and then whered we be i ask you youll make me yours soon dearest alan she comforted i must own to ignorance about caroline blushed and fumbled a tentative hand against his shirt buttons im told by older ladies it may be pleasurable after the after the first ill not cause you pain caroline he vowed i love you i know you would not she asserted strongly please be a little patient with me dearest i know you love me ive seen it in your eyes ive heard it in your voice every time weve been so fortunate as to be together i would not have bided my time a whole five years if i had not i believe that with you it will be a complete pleasure if this is anything by which i may judge do remember im a country girl after all with two older brothers eh he asked puzzled by her seeming non sequitur the barnyards she flushed again lowering her gaze and our studpens the animals every spring and my brothers boasting about their when they thought i couldnt hear oh he fathomed with a furtive smile once were wed then i know my introduction to the pleasure of marriage will be gentle and tender and so full of joy she said marriage he gasped sweet lord jesus what have i you are so smart and knowledgeable alan she sighed happily and you are a man grown after all and a sailor one might hope somewhat experienced she beamed stroking his cheek fondly uhm he allowed with a sage nod squirming inside thinking it wouldnt do if she knew hed rattled half of london i will own to ermm previous encounters infrequent though they were being so much at sea and only when well when the need was hellish then you must teach me sweetest alan she said smiling an enigmatic smile which he was not sure signified that she knew he was lying like a butchers dog i will be a most willing pupil she ended with a most fetching shyness and a heartstopping promise ah hmm he mused nonplussed with his erotic fantasies at a furious gallop right then could it be that bad you do wish to marry me do you not alan she asked of course i do he heard himself sputter i love you oh alan she cried hugging him the first banns could be read this sunday we could be wed three weeks from now let us go ask of my family right now so theres no possible delay mother may be halfexpecting our wonderful news though the others will be all amort over it most likely alan agreed wholeheartedly and damme if i aint amort meself christ shit on a biscuitmarriage not only have you saved me from any number of cruel cold destinies alan she enthused as he got her to her feet and they embraced close together once more but youve given me every last measure of happiness i ever imagined i could know i was so fearful youd want to make a higher rank in the fleet before youd wed i was fearful youd have found someone else all the years you were gone that i was only spinning daydreams we are awfully young most wait until their late twenties when theyre solidly established and all a hint of doubt swept over her face are you as sure as i alan my love i love you caroline he swore we love each other now why would i risk losing you after all this time and run the risk of never finding your like again there was truth in that as well then lets hurry home she beamed chapter goddamn my eyes sir uncle phineas screeched loud as some goosed panther once they bearded him in his study goddamn my eyes ill not have it and

of posting banns of publicly stating his love for caroline of being wedmuch less betrothedgave him the squirting fits so bad hed not trust his own arse with a fart but he had had just about enough abuse poured upon him and upon caroline as a foolish chit of a girl too stupid to know her own mind or recognize a scoundrel when she met one my stars governour exclaimed and gave a whistle at those sums like to purchase freehold land alan with that much you could have your pick around here hey oh do shut up governour uncle phineas snarled no as head of this family my father is the head of my

for love mothers told me long ago before the war she did were alan lewrie truly a blackhearted schemer were he truly worthless i would not approve i had hoped of course that she andharry might gove believe me caroline assured him sharing his sadness if only because her brother was sad for what was not to be i could never feel the slightest affection for harry for anyone but alan ye throw away a future baronet a member of commons and the finest estate in surrey uncle phineas griped and if not harry a man of worth and bottom like like a man old enough to be my father uncle phineas caroline

governour caroline told her brother i will not demand anything that would deprive you or millicent of a single morsel burgess sent home nigh on three thousand pounds caroline governour stated i could no she insisted hitching a deep breath and a simple wedding so no one will be begrudging or beholden later just as long as we have even a semblance of a blessing alan said left out of the conversation and the longrunning dispute among the chiswicks gladly up until that moment and even more impressed with carolines levelheaded sensibility well not coach to gretna green well not elope to portsmouth and some sailors chapel in a warehouse stew i have enough to rent or purchase a decent cottage for us and enough to provide for her proper comfort and station in life while im away should you demand a long engagement alan caroline protested thinking still of a quick match should you demand we wait until ive returned from my active commission i would provide for her gladly he concluded damme but theyre hitching the cart to this horse a tad rapid for my likes he thought it was one thing to win approval and blessing but hed thought the altar could wait awhile longer surely alan caroline frowned trying to sound fond though vexed forgive me caroline but ill not abduct you without your familys blessings he said much as i adore you ill not have you starting life with me under any sort of cloud ill not have anyone in this world ever suggest we did not begin on the right footing oh alan youre such a dear caroline relented a little then why do i feel like im declaiming like a posturing clown like one of the actors in the beggars opera he wondered not forthe first time whenever hed assayed sounding noble decent and upright most sensible people throw fruit at such players damme i could damn near give me hives she is not due to inherit anything unless absolute disaster strikes this family uncle govemour sighed rapping his knuckles on the side table for caution pray god it dont he added for extra measure you disclaim responsibility for her then i do phineas smouldered then as eldest in our fathers stead ill pledge that when our finances are sufficient to spare an annuity carolinell have an hundred and twenty pounds alan dear little sister caroline devil if i know just when thatll be god bless me but ill swear you that on paper governour you dont have to caroline teared up rushing to embrace her elder brother but thank you and god bless you for it thankee governour alan added going to take his hand and give it a vigorous pumping ah i should have read the signs you know alan governour chuckled shaking his head at his blindness twas all we ever heard from her alan this alan that and nary a swain no matter how he tried could sway her you will be a good husband to her youll be good and true to her and make her happy lewrie didnt think that sounded much like a question and for a fleeting moment he conjured up the scarifying image of governours ruddy phiz framed over the yawning barrel of a dragoon pistol big as a twentyfourpounder pointed right between his eyes i swear i will governour he smiled he will be caroline agreed happily an arm linked with his swear you will indeed you will governour barked with wry amusement well have a coach brought round mother i do believe youd do well to accompany them to the vicars hey just let me go and change son chapter hounds yelped handlers cursed and riders jollied themselves in mounting and boasts as servants of embleton hall made their way between the fidgety horses with trays of stirrup cups to hand up to eager hunters and tried to avoid the stalings on the drive and the grass the fresh puddles of urine as fine horses tittupped and farted prior to a mornings run across country harry embleton reined his overeager stallion in roughly as he attempted to join the chiswick party at the dinner and dance the night before hed suspected there was something different about caroline shed danced with him three times a bloody wonder that and shed been pleasant for once though distant as was her usual wont but hed sensed it was for a different reason for awhile hed imagined that she was finally coming round that governour had worked on her long enough to incline her affections towards him but then she had danced five times with that interloping lieutenant lewrie and had evinced such a rosycheeked elation towards him that it had taken all of his selfcontrol not to have rushed onto the chalked dance floor to pull the smarmy devil away and thrust him from the house the common jumpedup son of a whore that lieutenant lewrie danced extremely well with such liquid grace and style to any music and set every eligible girl to twittering like so many brainless hens was infuriating as well and what did all those curious stares and giggles those sly looks from the girls mean he wondered they had been directed at him as much as caroline surely that meant something wondrous was about to occur but they giggled and leered at lewrie too he had thought to ask of governour millicent or her uncle butcould not stoop so low as to gamer gossip a young man in his class and position could not would not a fine morning for the fox reverend he said tipping his hat to the vicar as he passed him and his daughter emily emily had once been spooned by governour chiswick had set her cap for him in fact now shed lost governour it was not much of a secret she pined for harry there were few suitable bachelors left in the parish surprisingly she did not gush over him so blatantly as would be her custom and only looked away reddening a trifle aye twill be young sir the vicar agreed though shying devil take the lot of em what was the matter this morning harry wondered do i look like i have leprosy harry me lad roger oakes bellowed waving to him to come see him a wager twenty guineas first to the hitching rail harry turned his horses head to join him distracted twentys an insult roger harry sneered make it

you you scapegrace aye fair enough hoy lad brandy here for two oakes ordered a scurrying footman been down to the church harry he asked as two more of their fellows joined them not since sunday last harry shrugged looking over his shoulder at caroline who was beaming and laughing with governour millicent and the dashing lieutenant lewrie missing the wink oakes tipped the others whats posted makes interesting reading oakes sniggered damn yer blood oakes harry snapped having just about all he could take of leering winking and tittering of odd reactions to his presence whats got into everyone today and whats so bloody important posted at church banns oakes smiled maliciously to be read o sunday and read last night im told that makes two im thinking but then there may be a need of haste aye lads and the rest chuckled over the rims of their stirrup cups and whos the unfortunate young drab harry smiled sensing a wry jape or two over some yokels slut or a juicy scandal caroline chiswick of all people roger informed him with a wink damme when we met lewrie he told you your virginity was secure didnt say anything about the lovely caroline though did he ha ha damned fast workers the navy goddamn you harry shouted striking the cup from oakess amazed hand devil take you you the master of the hunt was summoning riders and the master of hounds his own father was pacing away blowing his shrill horn to get things started there was a good scent laid down with a brush to spur the hounds into the countryside where theyd be sure to get a true spoor and they were off in a brindle speckled flood yelping and baying as if theyd treed or denned something already apologize or owe me satisfaction damn you harry oakes demanded face white with umbrage he took harrys wrist in his hand to hold him ill not take that even from a friend youll have to stand in line you bastard harry screeched tears in his eyes someone else owes me satisfaction first he twisted free and put spurs to his stallion making it rear and whicker with anger at his treatment now youve done it roger one of the stalwarts commented as they got under way that lunatic is going to kill somebody if he doesnt kill himself first oakes shrugged unfazed off her own land in public caroline was required by society to ride a sidesaddle so they made slower going in the middle of the pack of riders sometimes at a trot sometimes at a sedate walk as the hounds cast back and forth near the edge of embleton lands they milled about for awhile before the hounds at last had a scent and then they were off once more this time at a lope behind the masters and the hounds the first jump once the pack increased speed they took side by side and alan whooped in joy sharing a brief grin of pleasure with caroline it had been years since hed hunted down in kent in the times his father sir hugo still had acreage and the privilege of the hunt since alan had gone down for a summer after his last expulsion just before his unwilling entry into the navy he had to admit he was rusty as a rider but it was coming back to him as was the heady exaltation of galloping crosscountry and devil take the hindmost there was a second jump over a narrow but highbanked stream and a third not two musket shots later this time over a hedge onto chiswick land and then the pack veered left toward the great housemoments later the hounds were circling and leaping around an oak tree baying and yelping loud as the hound of cerberus and they reined in behind the master in confusion oh bloody hell sir romney chortled damned dogsve treed a cat damn my eyes heel sirs come away damn you all heel good god its william pitt caroline gasped as the ragged ramcat lay hunkered on a highenough limb bottled up and spitting and raking the air with one paw claws extended at any hounds nose that came within scratching distance your pardons milord alan asked of sir romney as he rode up to him might i pass you for just a moment hes my cat dyou see and caroline has been harry rode up as well having gotten a later start off the mark from his house but galloping all the way he sawed his reins setting the stallion back on its quarters and skidding dirt with its hooves beside them jostling both mens mounts harry weve treed mister lewries beast yonder sir romney laughed as handlers began to drive the dogs off beating at them with switches think his taild make a good brush on my walls hey harry gave lewrie a black glower and spurred past him to ride under the tree reaching up with his riding crop to slash at the cat making pitt howl with each lashlike blow forcing the cat to slink backwards on the limb and climb higher feed the bastard to the dogs harry almost screamed lewrie spurred forward as well harrys actions had awakened the hounds to return to the tree and redouble their yelps howls and blood lust they were now almost uncontrollable damn you sir alan barked in his quarterdeck voice you hurt that cat and youll answer to me goddamn you harry shouted back alan took hold of his whip hand and pulled it down to waist level harry struck out with a left letting go of the reins striking alan in the cheek and knocking his hat off and as alan rocked back upright harry slashed him across his face with the riding crop as the excited horses circled and bit at each other lewries gelding shied away from harrys stallion to the right and lewrie yanked reins to circle him small and return to what was now a fight damn you harry whats got into you sir romney demanded in a hoarse shout above the gasps and cries of the other riders at this outrageous conduct stop i say boy hear me lewrie spurred his mount forward to rush him like a joust the horses met right shoulder to right shoulder and lewrie swept out an arm to drag harry from his saddle to sprawl heavily on the ground then leapt down to finish him harry twisted round and almost got to his feet though hed landed hard and lost half his wind he slashed once more with the crop grunting you bastard with the effort alan ducked the blow to his right letting the leather crack on the back of his coat and then brought both fists upwards and to his left right into harrys startled face harry embleton was almost lifted off his feet and did a halfturn yelping in a sudden pain to go down hard and stay down rolling on his back with both hands to his nose too hurt and out of wind to rise damn you sir sir romney snarled if youve hurt my boy ill he threatened his own crop raised as if to strike lewrie to protect his son he struck me milord alan snapped whirling to face him his eyes aflame with fist and crop not the actions of a gentleman milord im within my rights as an english gentleman to demand satisfaction from him is that your desire milord sir romney looked into those eyes odd hed recalled them as being light genial blue but in anger lewries eyes glinted as bright and steely gray and as hard as a drawn sword and in them he saw implacable rage and murder what harry had done for whatever mystifying reason smacked of lunacy sir romney shivered and truly totally unforgivable and so public the best of local society the cream of the landed gentry and superior classes the parish and county could boast had seen it no sir romney grunted unwillingly the surrender wrenched out of him slowly he lowered his fist to the pommel of the saddle and he lowered his eyes unable to match glares with the young man see to your son milord lewrie ordered and call off your hounds ordered to a man whose every whim whose every pronouncement was nearly sacred writ to parish village and county without waiting to see if that order would be obeyed sublimely confident that it would be lewrie turned to see to his horse to gentle him and stroke him over for possible injury mr lane toby get the pack away and home sir romney sighed dismounting to go to harry and help him to his feet to pry his hands away from his face to look upon his smashed nose caroline rode forward to join alan as he remounted sure his gelding had suffered no hurt good god alan are you alrightshe put out a gloved hand to his cheek and turned his face to look at it he welted you with his crop she huffed by turns solicitous to him and outraged at harry and bruised your cheek nothing a cold cloth and a measure of brandy wont heal he smiled reaching up to take her hand in fondness for a moment now how to get pitt out of this tree alan rode under the limb and drew rein he stood high as he might in his stirrups and reached up wiggling enticing fingers come to me pitt he cooed come on down you silly fart dont hiss at me twasnt me treed your silly arse pitt these dogsll tear you apart if you dont come down to me come on now the cat slunk backwards towards the trunk reached the fork and mewed uncertainly as it turned taildownward and inch by wary inch began to crab down the trunk toward alans outstretched hands theres a brave little man alan encouraged now come to me thats the lad he stretched upwards and put a hand under pitts tail another round his middle it was like trying to peel off barnacles let go the tree you stupid little pitt at last turned his head and leapt curling up in a ball of angry fur as alan fumbled him onto the saddle and his lap once there william pitt lay still suffering for once the indignity of being enclosed and held though he trilled deep in his throat moaned and hissed licking his chops at the affront sir romney had walked harry back to his horse away from the softly gossiping onlookers suddenly he broke away from his father and advanced on alan and caroline to end standing by her stirrup is it true caroline harry demanded in a broken voice is it true youre to wed this it is harry caroline nodded somberly and all weve been to each other means nothing to you he fumed gaining strength from what to him felt like betrayal we have been neighbors mister embleton caroline continued i have never encouraged your attentions had you misunderstood my cordiality for something more for that i offer my apologies harry hes a nobody harry groused a little muffled from the hurt to his nose which was now oozing blood and mucus and swelling large as an angry turnip not landed not i love him with all my heart caroline replied turning to alan as she said it rewarding her choice of mate with an expression that left no doubts even among the onlookers out of earshot bedamned to you then harry raged pinktinged tears trickling past his nose you cheap bloody whore you silly misguided brainless faithless bitchl alan encumbered with pitt in his lap began to spur forward but caroline acted for herself she leaned forward and lashed harry with her reins with which she had been nervously toying across his ruined beak harry yelped in redoubled agony and sprang away hands up to protect his face once more hunching over as caroline rode forward herding him like a steer and lashing at him that for your slurs harry embleton she cried that for your cruelty slander me will you put your dogs on our cat will you that for a purseproud tomnoddy you vile wretch caroline for gods sake alan shouted riding up even with her and taking her hands taking her reins to stop her and lead her away before even more lasting harm was done drop it deadun damn him she spat her color up and her hazel eyes ablaze i think he got your point mdear alan told her and he could not help himself from betraying his feelings with an approving smile caroline blew out a deep breath and looked at him then she began to smile too lowered her head and bit her lip to keep from laughing out loud at the sight of harry scuttling away though no more blows struck him by god youre a tartar no error alan told her i hope you have not deceived me with amiability am i to wed a termagant he cajoled leading her towards the chiswick house oh alan no caroline softened at last you must never think that of me its simply his i am sorry i usurped your place as my defender darling but the fool rowed me beyond he struck you alan hed have killed pitt to spite us and what he called me had i a gun id have soon shot him as looked at him had i a sword id have run him through god help me sounds termagant to me alan said tongue in cheek i promise i shall be a proper wife to you alan she calmed properly demure and so very affectionate and complaisant surely i trust to your affectionate and gentle nature there will be nothing but the sweetest tranquility and joy between us i know that sure as i know anything in this life a goody alan japed your uncles favorite word oh aye a goody caroline replied throwing her head backto chuckle with wry amusement though i fear he favors economical the more your goody at last my dearest love they took hands between riding knee to knee and gazed into each others eyes damme alan thought but shes got more bottom than any woman ever i did see with her wits and her fire im in for a lively old time with her might be more interesting than i thought who said a marriage had to be drab as ditchwater your uncle wont care for this much he sobered dearest alan i dont know anyone in anglesgreen who will she rejoined this is the stuff welsh feuds are made of will you duel him she asked suddenly realizing the ramifications i beg of you do not hes a henhearted bufflehead alan sneered and he got a lot worse than he gave after all i doubt sir romney wants his boy carved up any more than he already is hell be a lifetime living this shame down and i doubt hes the nutmegs to do more than slink away to london or guildford away from all his friends and neighbors who saw his beastly behavior he looked and sounded completely daft alan caroline said with a frown oh lord what if he found the bottom to challenge you crossed in love bested before his contemporaries by you as well caroline alan laughed heartily if indeed he does summon up the stones ill be your second ii hecuba ite ite danae petite iam tuti dotnos optata velis maria diffusis secet secura classis go go you danae seek now your homes in safety let your fleet now spread its sails and at ease plough the longedfor sea troades seneca chapter there was no challenge though it had been deemed prudent for lewrie to ride back to london to gather what household furnishings he possessed from storage with the matthewses at his old lodgings to make himself scarce for a week or so whilst caroline gathered her own trousseau and goods bought what was lacking and ordered a new gown from the dressmakers there had been a lot of sighing mooning and handwringing in the chiswick house uncle phineas bemoaning his nowconfounded schemes praying only for icy civility at best from the embletons for the rest of his life mother charlotte sunk deep in the moping blue devils which required an hourly change of handkerchiefs and lots of sad alases govemour and millicent squintapipes split two ways by fondness for alan and caroline and regrets for connections which were now effectively severed removing millicent chiswick nee embleton from familiar converse and governour from hope of support for parliament or the conjoining of the lands it had been a rather grim wedding party with half the guests either secretly armed to prevent further scandal in support of the chiswicks or present to gawk and gossip as if their nuptials were a raree show or dramatick which would end in highflown and safely vicarious violence well represented though the gentry were there had been few representatives solidly partisan or beholden to the baronet and his son and of course no embletons at all save wan but game to the last millicent the wedding supper had been held at the ploughman instead of the red swan inn and alan suspected that whenever he had cause to return to anglesgreen god help him on those rare occasions he would do his tippling and socializing there for the rest of his natural life odious as that thought was to him once he had inspected the dim sooty slightly rank gloominess of that shoddily delapidated establishment and finally and most unhappily it had been deemed again prudent for the happy couple to depart instanter for portsmouth rather than consummate the vows in any local bed they had had to coach as far as petersfield to feel safely out of range of any residual rancor once there in a homey lowceilinged set of rooms at a rambling old coaching inn the happy couple celebrated the especial bliss of newly begun married life in proper style which left caroline purring and alan so ecstatically spent and so delighted by her physical charms and her ardor that he wondered just how he was going to deal with being separated from her once his new ship was ready for sea charms or no there was a thrill of expectation that morning following a teasing tickling mirthful and infinitely pleasing bout after the abigail at the george inn had brought their tea breakfast in the public rooms and a lingering goodbye kiss alan still felt an impatient urge to tear away from her dressed in his best brandnew uniform white waistcoat and breeches gleaming and buttons and metal appointments shining fit to blind the unwary lt alan lewrie royal navy made his presence known at the shore offices of the port admiral before going out to his new command and you are a punctilious silverbuttoned naval clerk said with a traplike opening and shutting of a severe little mouth lewrie sir alan replied im come to take command of alacrity the clerk looked him over carefully one bored eyebrow cocked in cynical appraisal silverbuttons had sometimes been appalled by the turnout of some holders of the kings commission by how shabbily and pinchbeck salty stalwarts could dress themselves as if their slightest attempt at nearness was a civilian crime silverbuttons also made a rough estimate of lieutenant lewries value during his appraisal real gold coat buttons not gilded a new cocked hat and by the officers london accent probably from james lock real silver buckles on his shoes a good watch and impressive fob and a damned good sword even if it was a hanger and not a slim straight smallsword a gill s and they didnt come cheap hmm silverbuttons rang a tiny handbell on his desk to summon his compatriot the regulating captain of the portsmouth impress service aye this lieutenant lewrie had the wherewithal unlike so many others and could pay to get his ship commissioned and manned when the pettifogging frustrations of the dockyards and silverbuttons knew just how to invent said frustrations became insurmountable for an aspiring young captain not too much though silverbuttons decided that scar upon the cheek that restless look in those genial eyes were they gray or were they blue he dithered spoke caution and a limit to what lewrie might abide before making loud complaints to silverbuttons superior might i see your orders mister lewrie the clerk smiled deciding upon a larger measure of civility than was his wont alan surrendered his documents from the admiralty youd be amazed how many sea officers positively lurk around this anteroom silverbuttons tsktsked as he read those precious papers or attempt to bluff their way aboard a ship bold as a doginadoublet one must be certain of the bona fides in these times aye yours are quite in order sir he concluded with a smirk quite sir alan nodded itching to get his documents back and safely into a deep side pocket of his coat would it be proper for me to make my courtesy call to the port admiral at once sir or might i perform that chore after reading myself in i regret to inform you lieutenant lewrie that that worthy is not here nor will he be for the rest of the week silverbuttons sighed with an audible sniff matters of state in london with the board of admiralty do you see ah captain palmer captain palmer allow me to name to you lieutenant alan lewrie come down to assume a new command lieutenant lewrie our regulating captain your servant sir lewrie said extending a hand to the oily older man who had appeared with breakfast grease on his chin nay i be yours sir and that soon im thinking and what ship the alacrity sir alacrity alacrity hmm silverbuttons mused searching his files stacked in untidy piles on a sideboard a ketchrigged sloop sir to turn over then fit out for the bahamas squadron lewrie prodded impatiendy ah here we are silverbuttons brightened tengunned once a bomb ketch should have been in port over a month ago but she found nasty gales returning from gibraltar and broke her passage hmm once in lisbon and a second time in nantes oddodd sir whats odd lewrie fretted was she damaged how badly to dock in frogland she is here is she not sir well of course shes here lieutenant lewrie silverbuttons snapped else how would i have this paperwork hey came in tuesday last as to her material condition i havent a clue though i cannot be expected to keep track of everything aha docked and breamed last week her coppering redone and is now lying at anchor awaiting turnover and does that say how many hands stayed aboard sir lewrie continued any discharged i must recruit to replace or will the men turn over entire portsmouths full o willin hands sir captain palmer said after masticating a last fetching bite of bacon ill be that able to fulfill yer evry desire bahamers is it to be did ysay then yd rest easy to know theres cuffy sailors aplenty awishin the hot o their tropics mister powletts marine society o londons sent down a draft o their very best and were ya able to deem em ordinary seamen seein as how they know their knots an can box the compass good as a hand a year at sea then half yer problems solved i say i see sir alan nodded west indies sailors were as good as any hed seen in his limited experience though most english captains would not take them they were better behaved more religious and a lot less likely to cause trouble as long as they were treated fairly he didnt know squit about any mr powletts marine society of london but it sounded very much like some poor relief for street urchins if theyd gotten any instructions at all theyd stand head and shoulders higher than truculent ignorant landsmen from a debtors prison i must confess ignorance as to my needs for personnel captain palmer lewrie said finally getting his documents slid back to him and into his pocket once more i shall go aboard alacrity and read myself in at once determine my lacks and get in touch with you sir afore the admiralty changes its mind hey palmer cajoled quite sir lewrie smiled bashfully captain palmer had hit the nail directly on its head god shes lovely alan breathed as he beheld the gun ketch which lay at anchor before him as he was rowed out by a bargee ever ship be sir the bargee grunted over his oars alacrity was a saucy thing seen sideon which view disguised her wide beam she possessed a lovely curving sheerline to bulwarks and gunwale and the jaunty upward thrust of her jib boom and sprit yard made her appear eager and lively she was about seventyfive feet on the range of the deck and ninety feet overall from taffrail to the tip of her bowsprit she was rigged as a twomasted ketch a bomb ketch of the older style with equally spaced masts the after mast by the break of the quarterdeck railings shorter than the mainmast forward her principal motive power would be those two courses rigged foreandaft on the lower masts hoisted like batwings from gaff yard atop and long booms below she sported crossed squaresail yards for topsls on both masts and stays forrud for outerflying jib inner jib and foretopmast staysl her hull below the black chainwale was linseeded or oiled a dark brown with a glossy new sheen while her gunwale and bulwarks all her upper hull was a spritely blue several shades lighter than royal blue and her rails transom carvings quartergalleries beakhead and projecting strips above and below the gunwale were done in a yellow deep enough to at first be mistaken for giltwork her crownedlion figurehead at the tip of the beakhead below the thrusting jib boom was the only place true gilt appeared boat ahoy one of the harbor watch shouted in query alacrity the bargee bellowed and raising several ringers in the air to indicate the number of sideboys due their visitor and with his shout telling them that their new lord and master had arrived he stilled his oars and let the rowboat coast to give them time to sort out a proper welcome the boat at last thudded against the hull by the boarding battens and dangling manropes alan hitched his hanger out of the way set his hat firmly on his head and stood he reached out took hold of the manropes and heaved himself onto the wide and deep shelflike battens to ascend to the entry port cut into the bulwarks above he heard the sweet trills of bosuns pipes squealing his first salute as a captain of a man of war and once through the entry port and standing on the starboard sailhandling gangway his gangway he relished he doffed his hat in reply surprised as they were to see him he was as much surprised to see a commission officer standing before him with a sword drawn and presented in salute welcome aboard sir the young man said once the ceremony was done and he had sheathed his sword lewrie alan announced alan lewrie and you are ballard sir the trim little officer replied arthur ballard he pronounced it ballahhrd emphasizing the last syllable are you temporary or alan quizzed first officer sir ballard informed him with a slight raise of his eyebrows a bomb would normally rate but one commission officer as master and commander sir but rerated as a sloop sir ah i see alan nodded with a smile he would have someone else to help with the navigation and the watchstanding which suited his indolent nature perfectly did you turn over with her sir from her previous commission came aboard to join four days ago sir just after she left the careenage ballard rejoined right then lewrie said digging into that side pocket for his precious orders assemble ships company mister ballard aye aye sir ballard intoned with a sober mien it was thin audience lewrie had to witness his readingin two gangly midshipmen of fourteen or so hopefully salty enough from being at sea since the usual joining age of ten or twelve eight or nine boys dressed the usual beaunasty he took for servants and powder monkeys twenty or so hands from fifteen to forty dressed in blue and gray check calico and sloptrousers plus the older men who affected cocked hats and longer frock coats with brass buttons who would be her holders of admiralty warrants the bosun carpenter cooper sailmaker and gunner and their immediate mates who were the ships career professionals alan read them his orders savoring every mellifluous ringing phrase which directed him to take charge and command of his majestys sloop alacrity finished at last he rolled up the document and retied the ribbons wondering if he should say else i am certain he began looking down at their hopeful faces peering back up at him from the waist amidships that many of you came up on blood and thunder in the recent war as did i service in a ship in peacetime may not hold the everpresent threat of battle we may have more time for makeandmend more ropeyarn sundays but that is only after weve drilled and trained to be ready to fight and i am satisfied and our old friend the sea is still a demanding mistress i deem peacetime service no less rigorous than war mind you im no tartar nor a slavedriver but i am a taut hand and a taut ship where every manjack works chearly for me our ship his mates and our fleet is a happy ship ive found and that is what will satisfy me and that is what will bring us safely home from the fiercest gales or the hottest fight should they come to us fair enough he asked expecting no answer thatll be all for now dismiss the hands mister ballard aye aye captain ballard replied using that honorific for the first time now that lewries assumption of command was official ships company on hats and dismiss what next sir introduce me to the warrants and mates mister ballard once more lewrie felt he was standing outside himself like some theatregoer judging his own performance on the navys stage he had almost reddened with embarrassment as he uttered those tritebuttrue phrases hed borrowed from other and whom he considered better men ive six years in the navy why do i still feel like such a low fraud he asked himself he knew his own preferences for peacetime service would be to cruise like a hired yacht sip claret and dine well perhaps carry some doxy in his cabins for sport yet he wore the kings coat and perforce had to live what felt like a great sham a sham which he was sure others would someday recognize mister fellows the sailing master sir ballard said as alans senior mates gathered round fellows was short wiry gingerhaired and seemed like a timorous store clerk mister harkin the bosun sir harkin was built like a saltbeef barrel with arms as thick as hawsers and a round hard face mister maclntyre the surgeons mate this is mister taft the sailmaker mister fowles the master gunner fowles lewrie interrupted ariadne winter of you were but an able seaman then my first ship as a newly aye sir i were thankee fer membrin me capn sir the clumsy older salt bobbed happily an that appy i be t be aservin unner ramcat lewrie sir the introductions finished lewrie plucked at his uniform i meant to pay my respects to the port admiral else id have dressed more suitable for a firstdays inspection men he said with a small jape at himself something less grandl so ill delay going over the ship from bilges to mast trucks until tomorrow at eight bells of the morning watch at which time i will wear slopclothing and put my nose into everything so put right what you will and have a list ready concerning any deficiencies you want corrected in your departments or items still wanting hey he gave them a warning and time enough to present a going concern sure there were glaring faults hereabouts in a ship fresh from the graving dock and careenage with most of her furniture and fittings recently reloaded mister ballard let us go aft i assume the ships books are in the greatcabins they are sir this way sir ballard replied gravely how many hands have turned over mister ballard alan asked as they descended to the waist from the quarterdeck for the hatch to the aft cabins at present sir there are thirtysix hands aboard ordinary able or landsmen all but eleven may be rated seamen the purser mister keyhoe has nine men away from the ship at present to row him over to the dockyards alacrity came into port with fiftyfive ten short of her rated complement five were discharged sprung or ruptured three retired but theres a new frigate fitting out here sir and we lost eleven hands into her the port admiral sent an officer aboard and got them to ahem volunteer for her ballard said with a wry pout well damn my eyes lewrie said with a weary disgust there was no getting around the problem of manning the kings ships seamen were always the rarity one could bedazzle calfheads at a rendezvous tavern to take the joining bounty with tales of faroff ports of call and there were young lads aplenty whod shun their farms to run off to the sea boys enough with stars in their eyes to sign aboard as servants or powder monkeys but seamen in peacetime the impress service could not press by force ashore even if the regulating officers could find a bribable magistrate who would sign a permission even in wartime the press could not take a man outside the ports could not in theory pressgang civilian landsmenonly recognizable sailors alacrity could should the need be direful board arriving merchant vessels in the channel or in legal soundings of the british isles and press seamen but such men were resentful and mutinous and alan didnt much care for that solution neither did he care for the scrapings from debtors prisons those who knew nothing of the sea and only took topsl payment to get out of gaol for their debts of less than twenty pounds we need twentynine more hands to make our rated sixtyfive alan figured at least ten or twelve of those have to be able seamen lets be pessimistic and say ten a dozen landsmen for waisters and make what we may of them captain palmer suggested a mister powlett s marine society of london know much of it mister ballard aye sir ballard nodded they take poors rate tykes off the streets scrub them up and teach mem some knots and pulleyhauley i do believe they teach them letters and figures after a fashion too sir some practical boat work on the thames if they can read and write a little theyre miles better than most then lewrie snorted he offered them in lieu of ordinary seamen what think you of that idea if theyre not too young they may make topmen sir and god knows we may lash and drive anyone to knowledge given even a slight spark of common sense to begin with sir damned right lewrie chortled having been driven and lashed himself to his lore good christ what a brothel his greatcabins were empty of furnishings except for a double bed a hangingcot for two and a few partitions and the chart room desk and shelves the black and white checkered sailcloth deck cover yawned vast but the cabins were painted a showy french blue picked out with goldleaf trim with borders overhead deck beams transom settee and window frames all painted a gaudy pinkish red quite elegant sir lieutenant ballard said with a tiny smirk just the slightest quirky lift of his mouth and a crinkle to his eyes i am informed your predecessor lieutenant riggs adored his comforts more than most officers youll be wishing to repaint of course sir damned right i do alan growled he knew what the navy thought of elegant any officer unless he was so senior he no longer had to cater to anyones opinion was thought unmanly should he aspire to any degree of comfort or sophistication beyond barebones spartan living as handtomouth as a lone gypsy on the scottish border in the meantime i would admire if you would arrange for my personal furniture to be fetched offshore ill sleep ashore for the nonce at the george until we put this right and the painter will have to work around my things aye aye sir the books mister ballard on the chart table sir ill leave you to them then thankee mister ballard thatll be all for now shall i have some coffee sent aft sir from the wardroom stores for now as a welcomeaboard gesture as it were sir thankee again mister ballard aye oh whom should i ask for at the george sir ballard asked pausing in his leavetaking uhm with mistress lewrie mister ballard alan blushed making the removal of his hat taking a seat on the one stool remaining and opening one of the ledgers a suddenly allengrossing activity aye aye sir ballard replied lifting his brows in wonder damme what have we here arthur ballard asked himself after he gained the weatherdecks mr fowles called him ramcat lewrie rare for an officer young as me to have a nickname already must be a holy terror and married unless mistress lewrie is his mother god no whod have his mother come to see him off god in heaven a married officer then whew he whistled softly mister harkin boat party take the cutter chapter how long before youre ready to sail alan caroline asked once they were tucked companionably into the high bedstead and the last candle had been snuffed for the night four days i should think he yawned she had at least a halfhearted refit before i got her copperings good hulls sound and the bosun has most everything set to rights again once were done loading stores and our passengers oh god your what did you call them livelumber she snickered in the dark as she snuggled to him as he put out an arm to receive her head on his shoulder more he complained putting his face to her sweet hair more how she asked god knows darling theres that trinity house master gatacre and his mapmaker theyre to swing hammocks in the wardroom six midshipmen in a draft for the bahamas squadron and never one of them ever aboard a ship hanging like bats from the overhead on the orlop rightaft by the fishrooms and this morning the port admiral tells me im to transport a chaplain and his wife and servants to nassau in my cabins that means id have to feed and water them out of my own purse damme ill end up in a hammock in the chartspace if they keep shoving bodies at me least they could do is put plate aboard whats that if you carry coin for the treasury or solid pay out to a foreign station you get a small percentage no hope of that though he sighed some reverend townsley and his lawful blanket why i met them alan caroline exclaimed theyre staying here at the george stiff company must be a poor sort of hedgepriest if he has to take chaplain pay alan chuckled you never see reverends in wartime too busy at saving civilian souls of a sudden dont ya know what were they like snooty as earls she shivered against him theyre related to some captain no some commsomething commodore alan asked suspiciously that was it a commodore garvey out in the west indies oh stap me hes commanding the bahamas station alan cried they could ruin me if i treat em less than royal gawddd we took tea together this afternoon caroline said he said your commodore already had his wife son and daughter out there the sons in the navy too a midshipman i think he told me or maybe hed just made lieutenant i forget theyre a formidable pair and with two wagonloads of goods so they couldnt have left a poor parish she decided unless they looted it on their way out two wagonloads lord alan groaned wherell i stow it all maybe i should just give em my cabins for the entire voyage and ill leave em blue and rose too that ought to be grand enough for em i think theyre lovely the navy wouldnt i should have painted earlier let them describe their quarters to commodore garvey once they get to nassau hell think me a primping dancingmaster still say they looked elegant caroline decided aloud found lodgings yet he inquired theres little time left i know my love she sighed as she burrowed deeper into him with sudden ardor ive seen several ill take care of it never fear oh god this is going to be so hard to watch you sail away and here i am in portsmouth where i dont know a soul four days she wailed softly four days we should make the most of alan muttered running a hand over her hip and thigh delighting in her shivers of expectation that night in petersfield theyd left a candle burning in their eagerness and shed come to him with a robe on not a bedgown a robe which slid down her shoulders and parted to reveal a girlish slimness a veritable feast of creamy skin andproud young closeset breasts a taut flat belly trimmed by riding and long incredibly fine and tapering smooth legs he still had not gotten over the wonder of being with anyone so delectable of her being his to caress and stroke into passion at a whim like venus on the halfshell he exulted silently like aphrodite rising from the waves but even better you dont think me gawky and spindleshanked she teased him as he nuzzled her graceful neck you dont prefer more roundness god caroline youre the loveliest woman ever i did see he told her truthfully she rolled on top of him to kiss him to receive his kisses as his hands slid down to her firm little buttocks to draw the bedgown higher she uttered a thrilling little laugh as he found her hips as his fingertips brushed her bare flesh she sat up astride of him to lift the bedgown over her head raising her arms high and inclining her head with her hair loose and long like a silvery shimmer in the almostdark his hands rose to take possession of her firm breasts and she leaned into his palms for support and excitement rough hands she whispered taking one so she could kiss it a sailors hands rough from all those ropes and things too rough on you he grunted in rising ardor never a bit of it my love she chuckled again softer i know its not seemly but i want you to teach me something new alan wanton jade he teased sitting up a little to nuzzle at her nipples which had gone puckeryhard from his caresses your wanton jade she promised going goosepimply with rising delight only yours darling make me yours again he drew her down to him enfolding her in his arms so they were drawn against each other her knees up by his chest and one hand of his stroking the softest most intimate of her flesh oh god but making love is so she moaned near to transport her hips were moving now against his hand her upper body rocking slowly left and right she began to slide off to draw him over but he stopped her come to me now she implored right where you are love he grinned oh yes she sighed gasping as she felt his member brushing her she slid down just a trifle rose up on her palms as he fitted himself to her and thrust upwards with gentle but insistent pressure down a little more she slid then gave out with an inarticulate groan of surprise and pleasure as he slid deep riding st george he exulted as she made more happy groaning sounds each ending in a rising note the dragon spitted pon his lance below ohh she laughed sit up darling he coaxed sit up caroline oh its so oh yes she bit her lip rolled her head to either side he took her hands and held them tight their fingers entwined fiercely hips rocking upper body swaying her head far back and her throat bared to the ceiling in her ecstasy she met his movements anticipated and amplified them oh so completely so deeply jesus ill surely die of more ahhhahhh then i think well die together alan panted swooning with the entire world reduced to the friction of moist flesh and his own release building like the pressure from a powder charge in guns barrel time slowed down time had no meaning the planet and its tawdry doings ended beyond what they could touch feel or hear and then she broke weeping with release crying out as if given a tiny glimpse of paradise and he took hold of her slim hips and firm little bottom and drove upwards reveling in the creaking of ropes that supported their mattress the pumpwasher sound of their two bodies fused her astonished further cries as she collapsed on top of him with her breasts brushing his chest and then the faraway groan he shouted to the night as his groin and his brain exploded into royal fireworks neither of them had an ear for the irritated thumping of the lodgers next door not the first time that night nor the second its so unfair she whispered much later after their third congress of the night just before wellearned sleep what is alan mumbled his mind reeling that we at last know joy of each other for such a short time before we must part she sighed snuggling down inside his embrace one thigh across his exhausted lap and her long hair draped over his chest i wish you could smuggle me aboard your ship and take me wherever you go to know so much pleasure from your dear hands alan and then to be deprived for three whole years its a hellish wrench for me too darling girl he admitted eyes shut and almost glued together for want of sleep if only we had longer a year or more so i might have grown accustomed she wished or does it ever cease to be such a wonder will making love with each other be forever this new and daring dearwith our enthusiasm id wager deep on forever he chuckled as he stroked her long smooth back spinsters succumb to the green sickness caroline muttered now what would you know of that he chid her gently fall ill and die for lack of it she laughed and their only cure is this now i know how marvelous it is ill be taken to my bed for want of more we both will youll sail back from the west indies and find me wasted away to nothing from want of you and nought a cure for me but your rapt attentions none but your kisses and caresses will save me then i wish us a very long recovery he rejoined several long minutes passed as lewrie began to breathe deep on the verge of slumber then alan ahmm he uttered i cant go home to anglesgreen uhmm i know and i dont know a soul in portsmouth she went on softly uhmmhmrn reverend townsley is taking his wife out there and your superior thinggummy in nassau he has his wife and daughter with him already therere so many loyalist families settling in the bahamas with their wives and children we once considered eleuthera ourselves hmm why could you not take me with you she queried hopefully oh caroline its heat and flies bad as india he grumbled wakened enough to counter her mosquitoes roaches big as as if in north carolina id never seen a palmetto bug she scoffed that was a polite way of saying a cockroach big as your thumb theres fever caroline yellow jack and malaria cholera now and again poxes that no one even knows what to call by name he objected no dear dear as i desire you with me i cannot i love you too much to subject you to such risk ive been inoculated against smallpox we had physicians good as london she pressed though in a soft almost wheedling tone as she stirred her body against his ive seen yellow jack before i might have had it when i was little i cant remember you dont know what you ask caroline he groused sitting up in bed now arguably awake though the hour was late and he had to rise at first light caroline believe me when i tell you that i love you to distraction frightened as i was of marriage more than most bachelors believe that too life with you is a joy beyond all imagining and it will be in future but if were to have that future you must be here for me to come home to if i lost you out there id were i selfish enough to take you with me and something happened to you id wish to die too and damme if i dont mean every word of it he realized shes become as dear to me as christ whod have thought i stand just as much chance losing you in the islands alan she fretted squeezing him tight what life do you think id care to live with you gone in a shipwreck or carried off by some fever and id never have been a real wife to you but this single fortnight oh alan take me with you do at least when alacrity puts into nassau we could have a week or two here and there together in a snug little home of our own is nassau such a terrible place then pirates footpads cutpurses he described to her therere drunken sailors and their whores reprobates and discourteous rabble carousing and caterwauling til all hours like portsmouth is it she asked and even in the dark alan could almost espy her puckish grin yet you entrust me to this town half the world away from you what would be worse about nassau caroline its so he sighed his desire for her and the lust for unknown adventures crossing swords with each other just as they had before hed become so quickly engaged i know im being so foolish and missish alan she weakened do but consider it though darling please love her kisses stopped any further objections he could muster lets sleep on it she urged sweetly fluffing up his pillows and guiding him to recline again so they could snuggle even closer to each other i do love you more than life itself alan goodnight my dearest love goodnight my darling chapter were making good progress even so sir lt arthur ballard told him a few days later as they sat in alans nowfurnished cabins sharing their morning tea still four hands short even with the west indians the debtor landsmen and the volunteers alan sighed over the rim of his mug i spose it cant be helped and damme if ill make the impress service any richer than i already have how are the marine society lads quite pleasing considering sir ballard smiled they taught them knots boathandling mast drills theyll work out sir he said theyre eager to please more than one may say about the men from the debtors prisons lewrie was pleased with ballard as well arthur ballard was an inch shorter than he just a few months younger but had joined as a cabin servant at nine hed served as an ordinary seaman and a topman since his fourteenth year had made midshipman at sixteen so he was thoroughly seasoned hed been third officer in a frigate rising to second officer before she paid off in late he was a neat little fellow though of a more serious bent than alan was used to in officers so close to his own age ballard was regular and square squarish head and regular features his hair was wiry and wavy set close to his head his brows were a trifle heavy thick and dark shading intelligent brown eyes which regarded the world so soberly and adjudging his nose was short straight and a bit broad his face ended in a square chin with a pronounced cleft but even at his young age his mouth bore frown lines to either corner betraying his sobriety though evincing a passionate nature he wished to contain were lips full and sensual in a broad mouth the lower lip quite plump and slightly protruding ballard dressed neatly but in slightly worn uniforms like an officer who actually lived on his pay and little else pulling it off with his sobriety and great care for his person those uniforms draped a body neither very broad nor very slim which gave him stolid solidity without true bulk yet within that body was a powerful set of lungs a deep baritone voice which could carry forward without the use of a speaking trumpet and a surprise to the unsuspecting person who might meet him and at first dismiss him caged alan thought of his first lieutenant hes like a beast in a cage not the pacing kind hes the sort who sits and waits for his keeper to drop his caution someday before he flees sail drill in the forenoon alan announced at last working parties after the midday meal livestock for the manger and household goods for the townsleys to be stowed their goods first then sir no shite on their furniture aha very good mister ballard alan laughed once loaded one more day in port for lastminute items and then he sobered off for the bahamas sir ballard said with a trace of glee all for now mister ballard lewrie said rising carefully so he did not smash his skull on the low overhead which allowed him only three inches more than his full height and only between the deck beams oh theres goods of mine as well to be stowed make them first in last out and ill see the ships carpenter mister stock aye aye sir ballard said mystified alan put his hands in the small of his back and paced aft ducking each threatening rosypainted beam to the sash windows for a view of the harbor as he pondered his most recent decision he had put this one off quite late how to make room for both himself the townsleys and their servants in his greatcabins which would not make a decent set of rooms at the george great hah he mused only to a mate in a dogbox below and make room for caroline she hadnt nagged or harped upon it yet she had kept the idea of going with him ever in his mind daily shed worn a little more of his resolve down first with affection and passion then with her cleareyed discussions of bahamian weather living conditions which winds blew all feverish miasmas to leeward to the real fever isles shed marshaled support from other senior naval officers and wives staying at the george or other establishments nearby never at all giving them the slightest hint that she was more than curious as to what her dear husband might face in that particular clime slowly shed changed his mind as she had excited his tenderest affections for her that were only halfformed and ill conceived weeks before back in anglesgreen had made herself dearer to him than he had ever hoped to imagine until he could not picture himself without her for three whole years there were too his rising fears being loved at all was to put it mildly just a tad outside his past experiences and to be loved and adored so openly so deeply and enthusiastically was such a blossoming wonder that he found himself waking in the middle of the nights to marvel at the stunning creature who shared his bed and slept so trustingly and vulnerably in his arms to watch her dress brush her hair enter the public rooms when he sat waiting for her was a heartlurching joy and their converse over a weighty matter or a jest was an absolute delight what had he known as love before pretty much a spectral semblanceflattery and entendres which passed for wit and talk followed by ogling grappling and frantic coupling on whatever fell to hand never regard never esteem fellowship never some affection of course but nothing of a lasting nature on off and where the devild i drop me shoes he scoffed granted it would be bad for his career but had he not already blighted that by marrying at all so junior an officer and once this commission was ended in would he really shed a tear to spend his life ashore on half pay no matter how much pride he had at last derived from his growing skill as a sea officer he could spend that life with caroline with enough money to buy land to live off interest with coutts co some investments in funds two weeks ago the idea scared me witless and now lewrie puzzled bemused by his eagerness to admit that he was married and married most damnably well too to an absolute gem of a young woman even if it had come about like an unintentional dismasting yet lewrie knew people admittedly some thoroughly despicable ones he knew the enthusiasms of grass widows and the sort of men who went baying like a pack of hounds in pursuit of abandoned and lonely women god knows he d prospered on them he could see how other officers and portsmouth gentlemen regarded her so hungrily when he and caroline were out and about the town already might she even caroline succumb at last missing lovemaking so much after a brief glorious introduction with him away for three years might she christ ive rattled too many wives and widows he muttered in gloom ironic justice thatd be maybe innocence and ignorance would be a blessing god surely not her so when the night preceding caroline had shyly confessed that she had not actively sought decent lodgings and begged his forgiveness for scheming to go with him he had been more than relieved of all his worries and had surrendered to her will most ecstatically there was a rap on the cabin hatchway ships carpenter mister stock sir the lone seaman on guard called out filling in for the marine sentry alacrity did not have enter lewrie replied yew wanted tsee me captain sir the youngish mr stock said as he ducked his head to enter and removed his stocking cap aye mister stock lewrie brightened i need your expertise to rearrange my cabins to accommodate our passengers id thought you might be able to turn the starboard quartergallery into a second necessary closet give our passengers some canvas and deal partitions to provide privacy oh about here say and their maid needs sleeping space the manservant will berth below in the stores room uhm stock pondered foldup pilotberth here sir over the sideboard in the dinin coach f r the maid double berth f r the married folks here stock actually blushed weve partitions enough sir and yon double hangingcot aready not a days work sir best build a double hangingcot for them lewrie said leave me equidistant room down the starboard side and a passageway tother side im ahumphh partial to the existing double oh aye aye sir stock agreed with a sad expression chapter god what a bloody potmess alan fumed on sailing day as he beheld his little command turn from a trig gun ketch to a bloody ark from a sane and rational construct to a barking shambles heave and in sight parham one of his fourteenyearold midshipmen howled from up forward jib halyards gaff halyards peak halyards mister ballard alan snapped the inexperienced landsmen and volunteers were being trampled by the ordinary and able seamen the draft of midshipmen flitted about trying to appear useful or to avoid a mob of hands who suddenly stampeded in their general direction a yearling steer gave out a mournful bellow of annoyance the pigs and sheep squealed or baaed in sudden terror and ducks and geese in the focsle manger squawked and fluttered so that alacritys foredecks were nigh awash in feathers there was a deal of cursing from professionals too the ships boys served as nippermen seizing the lighter line to the heavier anchor hawser whilst inexperienced landsmen under the direction of the bosuns mate a portuguese named odrado tried to deal the stinking coils of saltstiffened cable into manageable heaps then down to the cable tiers to drape over the bitts to dry and it was a truism that had alacrity been a st rate gunned flagship they would still not have had enough deck space for the nippers the men on the cable the hands heaving on the capstan the sailhandlers or the sheetmen on the gangways ready to brace the jibs and gaff sails blocks squealed lignum vitae sheaves hummed and gaffs cried as the sails were hoisted aloft payin off tlarboard no helm sir neill said from the long tiller sweep with his fellow burke standing by ready to lend strength for when the wind gave enough way through the water to make the rudder function forrud lewrie bawled walk your jib sheets to larboard and haul away brace up the after course there lads a luff no more foredeck alan spun to walk to larboard to peer over the side to see if there was even the slightest hint of a wake and to gauge distances to other anchored ships he almost collided with the reverend townsley and his wife who were gawking about like farts in a trance cackling with amusement and treating the spectacle like a rare show your pardons he said not sounding much like he meant it as he brushed past them he had advised caroline to stay below and out of the way until he sent cony for her once the ship had gotten under way and things were a bit less disorganized brace on the capstan well the cable ballard called tending to his chores ready on the cat thank god for a first lieutenant lewrie thought and thank god for a competent one there a wake he exulted he tossed a chip of scrap wood over and watched it bob astern foot at a time bite tthe helm sir neill cried larboard your helm mister neill bring her up to weather on a soldiers wind for now forrud alan called once more stumbling over the townsleys who had moved to the forward left corner of the quarterdeck nettings haul away on your larboard sheets silly bugger burke yelped as his way with the tiller sweep was impeded alan didnt have to turn around to see who it was that had gotten in the way you might do better all the way aft by the taffrails reverend alan said then shouted vast hauling luff enough now belay alacrity was free of the land free of the bottom and moving faster the wind was from the west with a touch of northing giving them a clear shot down the western passage past the isle of wight with enough strength to it to let them harden up to weather to keep off the coast to their lee to go closehauled if they had to without a tack with luck and no traffic they could get to sea in the channel on one long board lewrie heaved a slight sigh of relief comical as they might have looked to ships longer in commission and practice alacrity was on her way he walked back up to starboard along the narrow space inside the quarterdeck railings and the after capstanhead to starboard the windward side which was his by right as captain anchors fished catted and rung up sir ballard told him touching his hat with a finger those studious brown eyes held the slightest hint of glee cables below hawsebucklers fitted thank you mister ballard lewrie smiled not too awful considering two rehearsals seemed to have turned the trick thank you again for your suggestion my pleasure captain ballard said inclining his head his long upper lip curving just a trifle id admire should you attend to the gun salute to the flag lewrie instructed the experienced hands mind aye aye sir ballard said turning away lewrie looked down on his gun deck and gangways what had been total disorder was now flaked down and lashed hung on the pintails in neat loops halyards and sheets braces and lifts were stowed for instant use senior seamen were explaining things to their rawer compatriots beginning to play the role of sea daddies william pitt sprang up atop the quarterdeck railings his tail lashing with excitement alan reached out and ruffled the fur behind his ears how does it feel to have a ship of your own to terrorize again hey pitt good pitt tucked his paws in and lay still for an english day it was remarkably lovely there was some bite to the breeze of course but the sun was out peeking between thin scud making the waters of the solent gleam giving them color for once beyond steely gray brightening the vista of ships and sea cony alan called flinching as he remembered caroline aye sir my respects to mistress lewrie and inform her the deck is quiet enough for her to come up he told him unable to control a blush at using the unfamiliar title mistress lewrie theres the pretty caroline said stroking pitt as she came to the quarterdeck by one of the short ladders from the gun deck and pitt stood to get his petting oh how marvelous she exclaimed in delight coming to his side to link arms with him a perfectly gorgeous morning good morning mister ballard good morning to you maam ballard replied doffing his hat to her your pardons maam but twill be a little noisy in a few moments aft there prepare to dip the colours mister fowles be ready aye aye sir abeam of the principal fort alacrity began to thunder out a gun salute she dipped her colours briefly as the equallyspaced shots rang out with fowles pacing aft from one gun to the next muttering the ancient litany of timing if i werent a gunner i wouldnt be here number three gun fire ive left my wife my home and all thats dear number four gun fire thank you alan dearest caroline whispered to him between shots ill never give you cause to regret your decision i love you so completely and i love you caroline he whispered back bending from his rigid pose of lord and master for a second grinning foolishly boom at least on passage i shall learn what sort of life you lead aboard your ships caroline went on so i may understand you better and picture you more clearly when youre away boom oh alan were setting out on a grand adventure she laughed such a honeymoon no one has ever had there there my dear lewrie comforted almost gagging himself as his bride cast her accounts she knelt in the starboard quartergallery the necessary converted from a wardrobe little larger than a small closet it passes it will she looked up at him dulleyed and wan her livery face now devoid of expression dear jesus could i but harrackkk back her face went over the hole as her body rebelled at such infernal motion at the stomachchurning odors of ship and food he knelt with her to hold her head to apply a towel below her chin as solicitously as he could for one whose castiron craw had withstood the fiercest gales since his first hours in the navy but he had to dwell on the smells of freshsawn wood and new paint most closely there was a rap on the flimsy louvred door to their share of the greatcabins mister ballards respects sir and i am to tell you he is desirous of tacking ship a thin voice called out mister mayhew is it alan asked trying to differentiate between two soprano midshipmen aye aye sir the fourteenyearold said voice cracking my compliments to the first lieutenant and i shall be on deck directly he instructed caroline dearest i must go on deck to oversee a change of course ill be back soon i swear do you think you might be alright until then love all she could do was nod dazed by illness her face twisted inmisery as it was poised over the slop chute he kissed her on the top of her head rose and made his escape feeling pangs of guilt the reverend townsley collided with him in the narrow larboardside passageway hands to his mouth and sprinting for the jakes but alacrity was loping like a deerhound over the sea stern rising high then settling like a dogs haunches as it dug in for a thrust with its back legs dropping with a giddy swoosh one moment running aft was hastened by the slant of the deck the next moment one churned in place or lost ground as the bows plunged at least laid hard over on her starboard side by the wind she did not roll the good reverend danced in place like punch pursuing judy then was almost hurled the last few feet to crash into the transom settee and the stern timbers his feet went flying over his head and he landed like a pile of dominies washing black ditto coat breeches stockings and waistcoat all of a piece he regarded lewrie for a mournful moment like a hound being put down would stare at the gun then spewed the last contents of his body over his lap and chest so much for serving fresh pork roast lewrie gagged as he turned away to stumble forward theres four shillings wasted the door to the townsleys cabin was swaying open left gaping in the reverends haste and lewrie caught a peek of mrs reverend townsley and her prunish maid fighting to share a bucket oh land us ashore captain lewrie she wailed giving him such a glare as said that it was all his fault no more i beseech you we shall all drown for sure gracious jesus to be on solid ground approaching a lee shore in the dark in these seas maam would be drowning for certain lewrie explained sorry excuse me bad weather might be best he thought as he gained the quarterdeck save me money feedin em broth an gruel for a few days winds dead on the bows and blowing right up the channel sir ballard had to shout at him and now the tides turned were set too much northerly on the larboard tack headed for a lee shore the english channel was a nasty piece of water with tidal flows as strong as spring rivers in spate those combined with the current and wind could waft a ship along quick as a diligencecoach on the high road or nail her in place for twelve hours no matter how much wind or sail area to beat against them and alacrity was like all shoaldrafted converted bombs tending to slip to leeward like a sot sliding off a chair closehauled into that stiff wind she would require four or five times the mileage to make good a direct course with a more favorable beam or stern wind on the starboard tack we have sea room til dawn when this tide turns lewrie declared in return aye make it so mister ballard before you tack though take in the outerflying jib shes too much pressure on her bows and ill not have her broach beamon to wind and sea if she tacks too sharp aye aye sir ballard agreed with a firm nod and the first slight smile lewrie had seen him attempt mister harkin all hands stations for stays focsle captain take in the outer jib getting her head round was no problem with no need to pay off a point free on the helm to gather speed for a successful tack they drove her up with her helm alee and alacrity tracked about quick as a wink deck leveling as she approached stays sails luffing and thundering blocks rattling and tinkling hull and masts crying meet her alan warned the helmsmen nothing to loord let go and haul ballard screamed over the howling wind her bows crossed the wind and in a moment she was laid hard over on a new tack sails cracking like cannon shots as they filled and bellied out hard as iron some luffing still as inexperienced men tailed on sheets too slowly but paying off a bit too far and pressed hard over helm down helm down keep her hard up aweather lewrie said throwing his own strength to aid neill and burke on the long tiller thus steer westsouwest half west better sir ballard stated after the deck was back in order smartly done mister ballard for such an inexperienced crew lewrie complimented him thank god we have enough skilled hands or wed have rolled her masts right out of her thank you sir this may blow out by morning sir fellows the sailing master opined after recovering his hat from the scuppers damme though she swims even this lumpy sea devilish nice dont she aye she does mister fellows lewrie agreed mister ballard before you dismiss the hands take a second reef in the gaff courses now weve unbalanced her by taking in the flying jib trim her until youre satisfied hank on a storm trysl and bare thetack comer for a balance on her head able seamen only out on the sprit tonight mind aye aye sir ballard said going forward on starboard tack all day tomorrow most like sir fellows decided once the tide turns with the current tack again i fear as we fetch alderney in the channel isles id admire were it guernsey but we make too much leeway lewrie agreed picturing a chart in the minds eye then larboard tack all the way toward torquay and tor bay and hope the winds back north an hour later alacrity rode much easier with her large gaff sails reduced in area and their centers of effort lower to the deck and the center of gravity eased as she was lewrie had the galley fires lit so hot beverages could be served to ease suffering clear broth and biscuit ballard mused just the thing for touchy stomachs though my other ships ran more to hot rum and water royal navys panacea for all ills lewrie chuckled as he had a cup of steaming black coffee and rum i think it uhm ballard began to say then had a second thought for a fleeting moment he showed indecision what mister ballard oh just that i thought it most considerate of you sir to be solicitous to the hands their first night at sea easing the ship as we have the galley of course lewrie thought were feeling each other out for the next three years they were stuck with each other for good or ill two total strangers thrown together at the whim of the admiralty an admiralty which would not or could not take into account the personalities of officers when handing out active commissions it could be a good relationship or a horror it could be friendly or it could be cold and aloof as charity well half of emre cropsick as dogs at the moment lewrie shrugged they need something hot they may keep down or wontclaw on the way back up and whats the sense of thrashing to windward as if we were pursuing a prize the tidell turn after all but those new uns make an easy adjustment to the sea dont make em hate the life they signed on for so eagerly most captains would not consider such sir i had a few good teachers lewrie allowed as im sure you did aye sir ballard grinned and how fares our livelumber wailing and spewing lewrie snickered uncharitably praying for dry land last i saw of em and and your good lady sir lieutenant ballard asked carefully good christ lewrie cried i told her id be right back and here its been two hours at the least uhm when i left her she was suffering bad as the townsleys mister ballard my tenderest respects to mistress lewrie sir and i pray that her seasickness will soon abate ballard offered im certain she will be heartened by your kind concern sir lewrie replied stap me two whole hours shell scalp me but i must confess being on deck being active relieved some of my pangs too uhm and will mistress lewrie be ah ballard squirmed oh alan snorted do i intend to cruise the west indies with my wife aboard was that your question mister ballard your pardons captain i mean no disrespect its just that the warrants some of the turnedover hands were talking and do they disapprove lewrie demanded your predecessor lieutenant riggs had no storm damage sir ballard admitted he shammed it and used admiralty promissory notes in lisbon and nantes to stock his wine cellars he was never without female companionship aft a veritable parade of foreign morts im told sir i gather that the people resented it and feared you might be im not augustus hervey mister ballard lewrie said thinking even so that hed made a fair beginning on that worthys estimable record of over women in a single threeyear commission hardly a man may be sir and may still walk ballard found courage to jape with a droll dry expression much as i might care for it mind lewrie laughed but as you say the hands would grow surly and insubordinate were i to parade what they want and cant have in their faces i may not be an experienced captain yet but i do know better than that sir im sorry if i discomfited you sir and i am of the same opinion as you sir and understand completely ballard said even if he didnt yet understand what would compel a man to wed so early in a career risk the loss of it it had taken so much for him to even get to sea and progress as far as he had son of a kentish innkeeper a private school letter boy had it not been for a navy captain who kept lodgings with them when he was ashore doinghis father a favor to take young arthur on as a cabin servant he might still be forrud garbed in slopclothing still a topman and able seaman a mate at best if you will allow me the deck sir you may see to your wife ballard extended as a peaceoffering for this evening at the least unless theres an emergency you might no mister ballard lewrie decided finishing the last dregs of his coffee im no augustus hervey nor am i a lieutenant riggs call me as stated in my order book should circumstances merit but i will take advantage of your kind offer and go below for awhile god over two hours shell have my liver good evening mister ballard and good evening to you sir ballard replied relieved and do convey my sympathies to mrs lewrie i will and thankee hes a raw un no error ballard thought as lewrie stumped down to the weatherdecks means well but not too well aint playing a robin goodfellow to be popular with the hands just taut but caring so far ballard should have envied lewrie bitterly he was taller and fairer boyishly handsome and came with an indolent courtiers repute hed not gained the sobriquet of ramcat lewrie for his choice of pet alone ballard grimaced womanizer a brotheldandy hed heard with the confidence around women that ballard lacked the panache the frogs called it to spoon them just shy of scandalous and the deviltakeye glint in his eyes to seem dangerous and desirable yet he was a good sailor and a married one ballard should have resented lewries rapid rise in the service six years from gentleman volunteer to not only commission officer but a captaincy in foreign waters while it had taken young arthur ballard long nights of study years of quiet observation to develop his skills with a stubbornly silent will to equal or best his contemporaries and gain this first coveted slot as a first officer eleven years to his commission to lewries six why he should have despised him for a whipjack sham a wellconnected idler oddly he did not lewrie was too much of a puzzle to envy or despise trust ah that might come as they progressed together he already felt he might come to trust him but it was early days the one thing that genuinely irked was the lovely caroline who adored the fellow so enthusiastically the sort of young woman ballard had always most desired but never seemed to find and lewrie had found her so effortlessly caroline he whispered testing her name on his lips say somethin mister ballard sir neill the quartermaster inquired steady as you go mister neill ballard said shrugging deep into his soggy grogram boatcloak caroline was asleep on the transom settees pad curled up hard against the stern timbers by an open sash window overlooking the wake hugging her knees alan took the painted coverlet from the hangingcot and folded it about her to ward off the chill of the stiff winds oh youre back she groaned weary as death spent from all her wracking heavings she reached out for him weak as a kitten as he got a damp cloth to wipe her face she didnt sound accusatory he noted with relief im so sorry caroline but thats a ship for you alan lied it took forever a tug here a pull there are you feeling perhaps the tiniest bit better darling a bit she allowed now youre here just hold me alan miss me he teased easing down on the edge of the settee by her side as she rolled to him and embraced him my love i was much too busy to miss you caroline sighed amazingly able to jest even then the fresh air helped best once i got the window open and made my final offering to neptune i was dead to the world you should get into bed sleeps the thing for you now the bedbox doesnt pitch or roll would you care for some brandy i do not trust myself she said after one quick peek at their hangingcot which swayed impressively she rinsed her mouth with the brandy but spit it out over the stern not trusting her stomach with any fresh contents either you are so good to me she crooned sleepily stroking his face as he came back to her side im so sorry to be a burden when i promised just this morning id not be youre no burden love alan smiled every sailor has to find his sea legs you sleep now and youll feel better in the morning he reclined with her stroking her hair until her breathing went slow and regular only then did he close his own eyes and nod off his head pressed against hard oak lulled and hobbyhorsed to sleep by the ships motionthere was a rapping at the door unnh he groaned starting awake from treacly sleep midshipman parham sir the sailing masters respects and he wishes to shake out the second reef in the main course and inner jib captain sir very well mister parham alan replied reeling with weariness ill be on deck directly chapter once out of the channel and around ushant alacrity became a much happier and tauter ship seasickness abated and the hands back on their feet were then brought to competence with drills and hard work fire drills boat launchings and recoveries procedures for manoverboard rescues and working the ship became the days chores they tacked they wore ship spread or brailed up the topsls and royals struck or hoisted the topmasts they replaced entire suits of canvas cables for towing were laid out then recovered boarding nets were strung along the sides and hoisted from the yardarms then lowered and stowed away for the complete neophytes and the newest midshipmen the bosun and his mate conducted classes in knots and in long and shortsplicing with the next days exercises applying those newly won skills in practical uses there was practice at musketry at pistol shooting at towed targets cutlass and pike drill under the first officer or the ships corporal a heavily scarred bruiser named warwick they learned to serve the great guns the ships ten iron sixpounders twopounder boatguns and swivels discipline was brought to full naval standards gradually once the hands gained some knowledgedefaulters were allowed a chance to make honest mistakes with light punishment stoppage of tobacco or the precious rum issue stiffened rope starters used as horsewhips on the slow and clumsy were at first discouragedlewrie did not feel the sting of a starter in he hands of a mate on some poor inexperienced landsman much of a goad to learning later the starters could be plied more freely if a man was truly shirking later insubordination and the usual sinsdrunk or asleep on watchwere awarded days of bread and water along with a touch of the cat one dozen lashes for a first penalty two dozen for the second backtalkers mostly the landsmen who insisted on their godgiven right as englishmen to complain at brusque usage were marlinspiked into silence with a heavy iron marlinspike bound between their teeth for a day and the midshipmen suffered being bent over a gun barrel to kiss the gunners daughter to be whipped on boyish bottoms rather than fully male backs or suffered to be mastheaded consigned to the crosstrees aloft without food or water in all weathers and told to remain there shivering and puking at the exaggerated motion of the ship until lewrie saw fit to relent in a harsh age ballard and the warrants at first thought their new captain a little too mild until they saw him administer captains justice fairhandedly and issue lashes with the cato ninetails in the forenoon watches on those few truly recalcitrant or shifty they were fortunate in alacrityand lewrie and ballard thanked god for that good fortuneto have at least half the crew made up of seasoned people to have had the men pressed for them reasonably intelligent and healthy that a fair portion of those pressed were volunteers times were hard ashore what with enclosure acts unemployment and low wages so navy pay was steadier and surer than daylaboring and the ј s d net pay for a raw landsman was half again as much as he could make as a civilian even figured at a parsimonious lunar month instead of the calendar month with deductions of sixpence for greenwich hospital and one shilling for the chatham chest monthly plus the pursers subtractions for tobacco shoes slopclothing plates scarves hats and sundries it was a decent annual living alacrity settled down to being a somewhat happy ship most of her people were young and full of energy even after a full days work or drill in the short dogwatches of late afternoon when the weather permitted there were sports and competitions watch against watch and there was music and dancing with fiddles fifes and drums stacks of spoons slapped upon knees if nothing else for meterenglish morris dancing irish jigs and scots reels along with hornpipes or west indian dancing sometimes midshipman parham on fiddle bosuns mate odrado on a beribboned guitar of which he was especially proud the carpenters mate a swede named bjornsen on fife and caroline with her flute would play concerts by the quarterdeck rails the reverend townsley made hymn books available for those seamen who could read and the crewmen would gather aft for a singalong or stare rapt at drawingroom compositions theyd never heard before their eyes alight to bach purcell handel or other great composers but then caroline would insist on rollicking airs familiar from an hundred village greens or taverns or plaintive ballads sometimes tunes shed grown up with among her north carolina neighbors and the hands would sing along lustily all over the scales but enjoying themselves greatly the townsleys disapproved of some songsbut then they disapproved of a lot of things divine services could not be conducted on a daily basis but only on sundays after divisions and after the first one lewrie had suggested shorter sermons and more hymns and when the second droned on long as the first hed ordered the bosun to pipe clear decks and upspirits to issue rum ending services quite effectively the townsleys sniffed prudishly at breakfasts when alan and caroline emerged from their tiny cabins flushed with excitement from making love once over her seasickness caroline began to enjoy voyaging and both hangingcot and transom settee provided ecstatic pleasures the townsleys far past their own first remembrances of passion coyly hinted that too much laughing giggling and odd noises in the night had disturbed their slumbers which hints only served to spur lewrie and his enthusiastic young bride to even greater feats of passion of an even noisier nature and the townsleys were upset that lewrie did not wish to break his passage in vigo lisbon or the madeiras but with gatacre and his own sailing master john fellows to assist determined upon taking a faster route for the bahamas edging more westing to each days run so that alacrity was well out to sea and beyond the normal corner at which most ships would turn west for the indies off cape st vincent he did it admittedly to save his fastdwindling supply of wine and brandy for the good reverend made more than free with the bottle at meals and raided the wine cabinet in the narrow passageway every night at least he did until cony placed a bottle of undiluted navy rum mixed with seawater in the brandys squat decanter and beyond a startled splutter or two and a fit of retching no more was heard of reverend townsley after lights out for the rest of the voyage and so the weeks passed from brisk westerlies in the bay of biscay to topsl breezes standing into spectacular tropic sunsets on the atlantic crossing from the gray green of the channel to cobalt blue of biscay to bright blue waters of the americas from shivering with cold to the need for a hand fan in the daylight hours as alacrity reeled off miles from one noon to the next until she rode a river of air the noreast trades into the providence channel their last sunset together was a beauty beginning just at the end of the second dogwatch from the deepest rose to palest saffron it flamed across the whole of the western horizon heightened by the darker clouds the sea glittered on the glade of sunset turned gold and amber ahead of alacritys course fading to a deep blue gray to either beam and almost black astern the first stars were out and a gibbous moon brushed more gold than silver rode low on the evenings horizon the wind was steady but gentle pressing alacrity forward with a starboard quarterwind that filled her winged out gaff courses and the reduced topsis the heat of the day which had not been particularly fierce that early in the year had faded and the evening air was fresh clean and most temperate well gentlemen it is about time for mister gatacre to give you one last lesson in taking the height of the evening stars alan told the crowd of midshipmen and time for me to dine show heeltaps on your glasses and be about your duties with his cabins crowded so it had been impossible to dine any of his officers and warrants in on the voyage as a captain usually did to get to know them better so he had been reduced to a nightly court on deck once the weather had moderated as they neared their tropical destination with wine served out to be sociable ahem midshipman mayhew coughed rising uhm sir and mrs lewrie we uhm we should like to propose a toast to your lady sir i think i speak for all of us for all the ships people forrud as well youd better mayhew we deputed you remember midshipman parham teased and the boys laughed nervously well sir and mrs lewrie mayhew began again turning somewhat sunsethued himself for those whose first voyage mis is among us and for those of us whove sailed before i have to state that we shall remember forever how pleasant this passage has been because of our captains lady for her kind words for her musical accomplishments for her grace and niceness of condescension to all hands and for moderating a tauthanded captains wrath upon us he concluded with a jape to mistress lewrie might it be possible for her to sail with alacrity forever hear hear the others chimed in to mistress lewrie i thank you all young gentlemen caroline blushed prettily may you have joy of your future careers and my affection and gratitude for an exceedingly pleasant voyage to you as well thankee maam they shambled thankee as they set down their empty glasses and wandered off forward to the sailing master that was so sweet of them caroline sighed touching an eye to control tears theres no one like you in their experience alan said as he took her hand nor in mine they sat down together on the signalflag lockers by the taffrail in the very stern nor any voyage like this for them again most like it aint the usual navy experience the lads in the draft god knows what sort of captain theyll have next if they get a ship at all it was sweet all the same she insisted dreaming on the horizon and a heavenly voyage for me our honeymoon a lovely month at sea seasickness notwithstanding he japed the townsleys notwithstanding caroline whispered leaning close to laugh with him the cabin skylight was open to catch air and their words could be heard belowdecks by their passengers as they dressed for supper you will go easy on parham and mayhew i trust dearest i know theyre incorrigible imps bad as my brothers when they were that age but theyre good lads at bottom when they deserve it i assure you i will love so much to do on the morrow caroline sighed leaning close to him again shoulder to shoulder get ashore find lodgings and furnish them i shall miss this god to sleep without you will be dreadful and i you caroline how long do you stay in port do you think a day to unload another to replace firewood and water some more rations three days at the least ten at the most i suspect he scowled putting an arm about her shoulders small ships spend less time at sea than most and alacritys about as small as one may get in the fleet and its not as if i have to perform war patrols cruising until the saltmeat runs out half a month could be spent swinging at anchor in nassau harbor id care very much for that she said snuggling into him oh look the last of the sunset lets watch do my last with you for awhile she sniffed a little but many more to come for us he promised many many more they waited until the last spark had dropped into the sea before rising and the world turned quickly dark as the night usually fell in the tropics i love you alan she whispered turning her face to him in the companionable and secluding darkness aft i love you caroline a quick supper and an early night caroline vowed as that pepys fellow said my love alan joshed and so to bed oh then let us hurry iii look from your door and tell me now the colour of the sea where can i buy that wondrous dye and take it home with me bliss carman chapter nassau and its snug protected harbor had changed drastically since alan lewrie had last seen it in where there had swum tall frigates there were now only brigs sloops and cutters to represent the might of the crown but the commercial shipping had increased an hundredfold and the town itself now boasted attractive stone public buildings where once there had been only wood biscuit boxes with palmetto thatched rooves and the oncesleepy streets were humming with commercial endeavor there were hundreds more homes to be seen and of course since nassau had been a shoddy pirates haven since the s no matter the strenuous efforts of a string of royal governors since woodes rogerss days it boasted more taverns more ordinaries more public inns of dubious repute and more outandout brothels but the transformation was stunning with the arrival of thousands of dispossessed or disgruntled american loyalists who had fled their spiteful republican cousins the population had doubled and tripled humble bay street was now a good road and was fashioned the strand while shirley street named for a former governor had become more sophisticated than a sandy lane lined with ramshackle and could boast many fine residences stores and shops though the official area of town was still bounded by bay street on the harbor on the east by east street the west by west street and on the south by west hill and east hill streets more modest lanes had been laid out east and west of government house and overthehill the slumlike stew behind bennetts hill where the free blacks poor whites and the criminal elements made their homes had mushroomed the morning was not particularly warm for the bahamas in alan lewries experience no warmer than high summer in rural england and the trade winds did much to moderate it though late summer in these islands could be at times oppressively hot and humid alan was grateful to note that despite the hundreds of draft animals on the streets the swarms of flies and mosquitoes had diminished greatly due perhaps to the marshy areas he could recall from previous visits which were now drained and filled and claimed for small farm plots and houses even in his best blue wool broadcloth uniform coat and kerseymere waistcoat and breeches he was not unduly uncomfortable even inside the local shore offices for the royal navy squadron commodore garvey will see you now captain lewrie the clerk at last announced and alan rose shot his cuffs andtugged his uniform into order to enter his new commanding officers presence lieutenant alan lewrie sir the clerk said for their masters benefit just come in from england in hm sloop alacrity sir saw you come to anchor garvey grunted from the tall windows where he stood in shadow hands behind his back and head bowed by what seemed all the worlds troubles no more than adequate work that a new crew sir in commission two months alan checked wary at once and hedging defensively there had been little wrong with the approach down hog island their reach across the wind between there and silver cay south and east or their rounding up to windward and coming to anchor amid the disorderly swarm of shipping just in line with frederick street with topsls already brailed up harbor gaskets on and yards squared theyd cruised in neatly with the after course and two jibs standing fired their salute and coasted to a stop without a flaw and the best bower anchor was let slip the instant they lost way alan was away in his gig before the stern kedge anchor could be rowed out and set but hed seen that go well too ill brook no lame excuses from a newly wetted down junior lieutenant lewrie garvey barked though it was more an old dogs jowlflapping petulance you may be one of those who deem a peacetime fleet all claret and cruising but youll find to your dismay i demand the utmost of my captains should you persist in whipjack seamanship and slovenly navigation our waters here in the bahamas will lay you all aback quick enough garvey made his way from the tall double windows to his desk out of the shadows into proximity enough so lewrie could see his lord and master no longer silhouetted against the glare i lewrie began to rejoin muddle through at your peril sir garvey threatened either youll wreck that fine little armed ketch of yours or you will answer to my exceeding wrath do i speak plain enough for you lieutenant lewrie indeed sir lewrie said fighting to hide his resentment as he once had as a midshipman when dealing with ships officers he gave garvey a sweet smile of complete agreement one which had always turned away wrath as the bible promised or masked ironic amusement i have despatches and the latest post sir lewrie offered bringing a thick canvaswrapped packet forward these are the official correspondence these are your personal letters your clerk already has the squadrons mail sir sit garvey commanded pointing in the general direction of a wing chair as he leaned forward and dragged the personal bundle towards his side of the desk brandy lieutenant lewrie claret perhaps the man had turned uncommonly civil and benign in an instant i would admire coffee or tea sir lewrie stated settling on the front edge of the chair bit early in the forenoon for me sir hmmph garvey frowned as if disappointed and lewrie was left to stew and fidget for many long minutes as garvey sorted through his personal mail breaking the wax seal on the more interesting to read a snatch or two then set them aside for closer perusal later it was quite outside lewries experience for a serving officer to ignore the official despatches so blithely hed kissed the gunners daughter for being late in delivering orders aboard his first ship in favor of sorting through the personal missives for something from home first horace garveyanother bloody horry lewrie thought with wry humorwas slightly stoopshouldered and fond of his table too if the gotchgutted appliance that bulged his waistcoat near to bursting was any clue his face and hands were burned dark by tropic sun finely wrinkled and splotched here and there from ancient searing or by drink his forehead was high and narrow the nose a prominent narrow beak and his eyes were downwardturned at the outer corners and slightly watery and gooseberry at one time garvey had probably been a rather striking specimen about lewries height and fashionably slim but that heroic and gentlemanly frame had put on poundage in the trunk and face though his limbs were still long and spare you departed which port sir garvey asked at last portsmouth sir lewrie piped up on the th last a fast passage garvey noddedwe had good westerlies in the bay of biscay and a favorable slant of wind off lisbon sir allowing us to cut the corner without dropping as far south as cape st vincent lewrie boasted just a trifle my sailing master and my supercargo master james gatacre assured me id find leading winds around thirtyeight degrees north and sixteen west so we might reach to make enough souwesting to pick up the trades sir in lewries last ship telesto captain ayscough had sneered at the old way of navigating where ships would fall far south to run across the atlantic on a line of latitude for dominica in the leewards even were they headed for the bahamas even were they bound for new york did you indeed garvey sniffed sounding unimpressed and whilst in portsmouth did you by happenstance come to hear of passengers who were to be given government passage to the bahamas sir oh do you mean the reverend and mrs townsley your brotherinlaw and your sister sir lewrie smiled as garvey sat up with a show of interest at last they are arrived in my alacrity sir with you garvey barked in that cockleshell of a ketch aye sir lewrie nodded damme just what does please the bastard he wondered damme ill lay into the officials who entrusted them into a frail vessel such as yours garvey ranted was there no other ship available no west indiaman callous hounds mark my words i will blister whitehall with a letter expressing my displeasure one does not treat relations of a senior officer so so she is a converted bomb sir quite sturdy lewrie offered foul miserable cramped bucketing about like a dory in all weathers and you did not break your passage to ease the misery your passengers surely experienced sir garvey accused sir my orders said to make the best of my way alan replied evenly from long usage that is to say just short of with all despatch as i am sure you are aware sir then youre a fool a heartless fool sir garvey snarled my other passengers sir alan winced as he carried on what more to be crammed in anyoldhow garvey sneered mister gatacre and his assistant sir seconded from trinity house to the admiralty to conduct a hydrographic survey and a draft of six midshipmen sir i assume they are mentioned in the official despatches sir he concluded with what he hoped was a suitably subtle reminder about the navy correspondence as if i need more midshipmen garvey scowled newlies two rather young sir two middling twelvish and uhm the last two from the royal naval academy at portsmouth sir worse man kings letter boys garvey sneered sots and mountebanks latin math and not a single block in any of their rigging hah toplofty cunnythumbs and cackhands not an iota of wits in the lot foist em off on me will they wellll ill put a flea in the admiraltys ear about that too boys cannot learn the sea in a bloody classroom cant make the connections in the fleet necessary for patronage and advancement chasing and caterwauling is all they pick up at that damnfool academy they did learn sea skills on passage sir a plow horse leaping two stacked boards aint a blooded hunter lewrie nor never will be they are indeed a scurvy pair of tomnoddys sir lewrie agreed assaying a small witticism to ease the tension of this vitally important first interview with the man who could make or break him in the next three years which had so far been tantamount to a disaster at present theyre no better than freshcaught landsmen confused they may be but neither of them is backward they learn fast sir what is your armament sir garvey inquired suddenly changing tack abruptly your draught alacrity mounts ten sixpounders four dismountable twopounder boatguns and the usual swivels sir lewrie answered crisply glad to be back on safe professional matters properly laden and ballasted she draws just shy of nine feet say a half less than nine sir hmmmm garvey mused idly toying with the lid of his silver inkwell opening it and closing it again and again as if something other than ink would magically appear for once anything needful firewood and water the usual plaint sir lewrie smiled in reply restock our biscuit and saltmeats from the dockyard she is in all other respects ready for sea sir a touch too weak for deepwater patrolling garvey surmised weve more than our fair share of pirates and buccaneers still and ships voyage past the bahamas at their peril too many privateersmen from the latelamented war spoiled by easy pickings youre not well armed enough to cow merchantmen violating the navigation acts either aye sir lewrie responded automatically whenever some senior officer paused to gather his thoughts as he did in this case shoaldepth enough though to be useful inshore in most instances where the opposition would be even smaller and weakerarmed than your ketch this fellow gatacre dyou say i was to supply him with a suitable vessel i could not presume to know his complete orders sir lewrie wavered nor the contents of whatsoever directives from the admiralty accompany him i may only suppose he did however express a desire for two localbuilt luggers in addition to ships boats from the vessel supporting him sir and what do you possess for ships boats sir garvey smiled a twentyfoot launch a cutter of similar size and my gig sir since he is already aboard your vessel lewrie and you have room enough aboard after all i do believe ill let him stay there garvey smirked the other cutters and such of this squadron would cramp him unmercifully but alacrity now used to extra lumber aft will cope i am certain and those two naval academy midshipmen aye sir lewrie felt his buttocks puckering in dread hed been charitable at best as to their prospects and abilities but would be glad to see the back of them hed not have them if they came with a postcaptains rank good at mathematics to the exclusion of all else useful garvey said leaning back in his cool leather chair and who could be more helpful to the exacting work of hydrography than superior students of mathematics and surveying hmm what a splendid idea sir lewrie beamed pissing down his back as if the bastard had done him a signal honor though he seethed at the very idea what eminent good sense it is sir i should be delighted may i suggest to mr gatacre that he may feel free to call upon you to discuss his other requirements then sir once you have had time to peruse what the admiralty wrote you concerning his duties that is a day perhaps at your convenience sir uhm of course he may garvey replied taken aback by alans reaction you may hed thought to punish this upstart for treating his kin so badly to be the whipping boy for the admiraltys callous unconcern for their comforts to put this newly in his place right from the start and may i be allowed to inquire sir as to whether i may give leave tickets to my hands too sir lewrie fairly oozed unctuous oils of sociability sounding as though butter would not melt in his mouth once alacrity is reprovisioned and suitable luggers found before we begin our surveying sir i might allow it garvey almost sulked put out that alan was not put out within reason mind further sir might i inquire as to your standing orders for the bahamas squadron lewrie pressed bestowing blissful smiles upon his station commander do you require captains to sleep aboard as i do believe the channel squadron is wont to do in wartime or may i consider shore lodgings for myself between voyages sir like to stretch your legs on solid ground do you garvey asked lifting an eyebrow which evident suspicion as to his motives almost made lewrie cringe with worry it might be disallowed a run ashore now and again would be welcome sir lewrie replied with brighteyed innocence within limits of course sir i do not begrudge my officers their pleasures lewrie garvey informed him whats good for jack is good for his betters aft so long as you conduct yourself with the proper decorum expected of a sea officer a christian and an english gentleman and just when did you last see decorous sea officers lewrie asked himself in wonder at such a ludicrous statement leaping rantipole and playing balumrancum in church hymnsinging in brothels so i would have time to seek out an establishment sir alan said cocking a brow of his own to nail the agreement shut without having to mention the necessity of such lodgings or the fact that he had brought caroline with him he didnt think garvey would care for that i suppose garvey sighed yes you may thank you sir quite grateful quite before you sail i will send specific orders aboard lewrie garvey went on pulling the packet of official documents to him for an excuse to dismiss him as to the survey what needs doing against our piracy problem the enforcement of the navigation acts and how i expect ships of the bahamas station to conduct themselves use your hydrographic work to familiarize yourself with what perils our waters hold and remember i warn you now to handle your vessel with due care and sober rectitude or ill dismiss you from her command and replace you with an officer who does things my way hear me i understand you completely sir lewrie told him with sucha sober and abashed countenance that even garvey thought hed gotten his message rammed home sufficiently what with all this correspondence and the cares of this squadron i have no more time for you lewrie you may dismiss thank you for receiving me so promptly sir chapter fubsy crusty dilberry lewne seethed at supper ashore that evening combed like a louse from the hairy dirty black fundament of all creation caroline put her napkin to her mouth to hide her snickering pompous posturing pusgutted hymnsinging barnacle he ranted on though in a low voice as he wrangled knife and fork over a stringy cut of beef tougher than old anchor cables which would end up costing him half a crown when the reckoning was fetched alan dearest caroline suggested once she trusted herself to lower the napkin and not cackle out loud at his frustrated antics i am so sorry this garvey was so uncharitable towards you truly but he is your superior after all do compose yourself or at the least wait until were in our set of rooms who knows who might be listening she waved one hand at the many officers at table nearby sorry caroline but the man rowed me beyond all temperance alan sighed giving up on the choice cut of english beefsteak and leaning back in his chair at least the wine was more than palatable and he topped up their glasses bloody shilling the bottle he noted chalked on the neck nassau had grown no less expensive than it had been during the war i dont believe anything could please the man out of sight out of mind then she replied on this survey of yours which i am certain you shall complete most successfully if i know the slightest bit about you and when you return he may by then have more regard for your abilities alan reached across the table to take her hand and give her a thankful squeeze youre right of course he canned and rewarded her with a fond smile thank you for having good sense enough for both of us darling and for your regard for my abilities truly i am coming to realize that i am the most blessed of men when you go on a rant you are so almighty amusing though she confided with a quiet laugh thank you alan for what my dear for taking me into your confidence she said for sharing with me your worries and your hopes for listening to my thoughts always my dearest he vowed happily ahem the black waiter coughed as he came to the table you may clear mine alan said the dogs may now break their teeth on it uhm yassuh uhm dese notes be fo you sah dot genmun in de cornah capum finney like ya an de missus tjoin him ot his table un dot navy officah ovah dere sah he does too sah de missus done with her groupah moom hes a sweet fish moom he kin eat good sweet as de lobstah any day alan opened the first note to find an almost illegible scrawl and looked up to gaze upon the man who had sent it captain finney was a civilian in overdone finery handsome blond and darkly tanned he peered at alan with an almost hopelessly naive expression of longing and ducked him a smile he was surrounded by a brace of shoddy types though with a trio of obvious trulls for companions alan wanted no part of them he opened the second note got de stilton un exra fine biscuit got de fine port got de keylime puddin un got de brazil cawfy black un hot the waiter enticed sah moom raisin duff sherry trifle keytime puddin lets have the keylime pudding caroline suggested eagerly it sounds marvelous and ive never had it before lets do alan agreed for two with coffee and please give captain finney our regrets but i do not know him nor wish to join him do however deliver my compliments to commander rodgers and we will be delighted to join him and his companion we will take our dessert and coffee with them ah tellem sah lewrie smiled at the navy officer then turned and gave the man finney a short dismissive shake of his head he turned back to look at caroline and winced as he saw her single arched eyebrow if that suits you caroline he grimaced forgive me dear for not asking your preference but im so new at being married i oh alan we both are she whispered forgiving him instantly and tilting her head to one side fondly two invitations one from the navy officer yonder a commander rodgers and one from the thatchhaired fellow and his crew some fellow named finney heavens caroline muttered as she eyed the other party too seedy a lot for me alan i could swear those women with them dear lord darling so thats what prostitutes look like she grinned she shivered and turned her gaze back to alan finney is the one in the center dear she asked the man just leered at me of course well accept commander rodgers kind request hes senior to you and kindly disposed to you theres a wonder after your horrid morning let us do thank bloody christ lewrie thought relieved to have escaped a thoughtless deed damme but this marriage business is a terror he knew himself well enough as a selfish rogue and he was used to giving orders and having them obeyed so having to take counsel with someone else not having his wishes treated as holy writ was a wrench they crossed to the other table and the introductions were made commander benjamin rodgers was about thirty a trifle stocky and dark as a welshman his companion was a young lady in her middle twenties named elizabeth mustin a saucy brownhaired piece with sparkling blue eyes and a most impressive toplofty figure off that ketchrig come in this morning commander rodgers asked then answered his own question course you are ya had to be a new officer i never clapped toplights on before knew it welcome to the bahamas station captain lewrie take joy o your posting thank you sir and your ship is whippet twenty guns th rate sloop o war rodgers answered lord yes he was senior sloop was a loose catchall term for any vessel larger than a bomb revenue cutter or armed yacht below the standardized rates alacrity was technically a sloop no matter how she was rigged aloft but a sloop of war was a miniature frigate smallest of the threemasted shiprigged vessels in the fleet and her captain was postcaptain in all but name sure to be made post soon rodgers already wore a postcaptains ironbound coat but for three cuff buttons instead of four and profuse with gold lace the mark of a man rising to the top of the seniority list like a signal rocket are there many on station sir alan asked only one more ariel rodgers informed him you know how reduced the fleet is as im certain our lord and master told you when you reported to him this morning saw you being rowed ashore like hells fire was licking your gigs transom hey aye sir lewrie grinned as their coffee and pudding arrived were a sorry lot these days rodgers babbled on happily a single th rate fiftygunner royal arthur our flag we possess but one frigate captain quids guardian and shes only a twentyeight weve half a dozen others from revenue cuttersized twomasted luggers or schooners or brigrigged or ketchrigged sloops like yours too few too slow too weak and too bloody lost from where troubles occur oh pardons mistress lewrie for my language i have heard worse from my husband commander rodgers caroline informed him with a chuckle and that recently mean to say you two really are married rodgers marveled i thought pardons again but my experience o navy marriages is that most of emre but a convenient sham and for a man frisk his future fore makin post ouch pay him no mind bens a conceited arse elizabeth mustin said after poking her innamorato in the ribs but with no real sign of anger yes dear some officers do wed those they love you set a hellishbad example for all of us captain lewrie rodgers admitted not the slightest bit abashed once the word gets out every girl

thank god weve peace with france just long enough to stock up for our next setto or pray our smugglersre bold enough to dodge the kings customs so i spose commodore garvey gave you your marchin orders

fellow gatacrell be just the thing bahamas are badcharted if charted at all below the populous islands caroline thought it a blessing too sir alan agreed and what did you think of our lord and master sir rodgers asked sounding offhand but looking cuttyeyed at him ah sir lewrie opined on his guard but he didnt believe rodgerss ebullient personality would sit well with garvey either so he could not be a favorite hmm sir he added rolling his eyes did he offer drink captain lewrie and did you accept he did sir but i did not i didnt get my requested coffee then thank your lucky stars ya didnt rodgers muttered as he leaned a little closer it all has to do with his son shipped out as a midshipman in royal arthur and soons they dropped the hook he was commissioned and a good man turned out to make room for him hes fourth lieutenant into her now if garvey had a budget thatd purchase more patrol craft hed be on his own bottom even as we speak garvey rewards his favorites and chastises those that cross him what he is lookin for is any excuse to promote people up an outa royal arthur so the squadron is captained by his proteges and young virgil garvey prospers any slip on your partd give

ashore i would be too tis a damned impressive pile no tis best youre far away for now theres other unfortunates not among the saved for him tcull through so his sycophants can advance moren a few as

good kings coat an makin noises like a mans read a real book dont ya know english tarpaulinsre supposed t sound so simpleminded even the others notice sir stump about the quarterdeck yellin luff and cursin damn my eyesha ha damn my eyes lewrie pronounced tongue in cheek slowly as if trying it on for the first time and is that best uttered with one hand on the hip sir perhaps gazing aloft and wondering why the devil all that laundrys drying up there sir goddamme but youll do captain lewrie youre a jolly young dog and blessed with the secondhandsomest lady in the islands i do avow youll do right well for me my irreverent sort of fellow i will endeavor to please sir lewrie smiled back lifting a glass of champagne to his lips this rodgers was a merry wag himself the sort lewrie would feel most comfortable and sportive with and found himself liking commander benjamin rodgers a great deal wishing he was the commander of the bahamas squadron instead of garvey and do you lodge in town miss mustin he heard caroline ask conducting their own conversation apart from navy gossip god no nassaus fearsome noisy and rowdy caroline may i call you caroline and you must call me elizabeth if only to escape the stenches i have a small house east of town out towards fort montagu one gets first shot at the trade winds out there blowing all manner of nastiness alee as benjamin puts it a loyalist family of my acquaintance bought a plantation there but the soil is awfully thin played out so theyre running up houses thank god for the loyalists or nassaud still be dull as a dead dog rodgers commented theyve braced this colony up good as a soldiers wind and got it moving god help the american republic after running the best of em out and god be thanked they lit here caroline is of a loyalist family alan bragged never you mean it elizabeth gushed truly why so am i my dear new yorknorth carolina caroline rejoined and they both fell into a swoon of comradeship at once god how wonderful i cant weve a funny society here in the bahamas lewrie rodgers told him as he topped up the champagne glasses aint this grand stuff though theres us on top government military and naval officials from home right under us are the oldtime families from nassau eleuthera long island or the exumas the rich traders and planters whove been here for years thirdbest but greater in numbers are the emigre loyalists under them you have the poor whites the artisans and tinkers and such expirates deserters freebooters and buccaneers who smallhold or fish ply their poor trades or loaf about then come the cuffys and its the same story chapter and verse as it is for the whites how so sir free blacks first ocourse then slaves at the bottom but they have a caste system bad as any ive read of among the hindoos octoroons quadroons mulattoes brown to coal blackuns so a free black but a blueskin is rated lower man a free black whos almost white dyou see straight or woolly hair pale or dark skin now the blueskin may be a home owner and educated with a shop of his own makin enough money to bloody vote in england but his fellow with the straight hair and talk of portuguese sailors in the family tree is the better man even were he dirtpoor illiterate and ignorant as so many sheep damned funny world aint it ive heard that said sir lewrie japed raising his glass in a mock toast though ive never heard much laughter about it hah youre a sharp un sir a glass with you my lad uhm about losing my ship sir alan inquired urgently as they lowered their glasses to refill who are your patrons rodgers asked unashamedly in the navy family connections petticoat influence and favors given and gotten mattered almost as much as merit and seniority or competence and wits young officers aspired to a circle of sea daddies who looked after their careers senior officers culled their wardrooms and lower decks looking for proteges with connections too or talents and abilities a man was judged by the quality of his proteges by his wisdom in the choices he sponsored so the nation and fleet were better served and success by a junior shone just as brightly on his sea daddy retired admiral sir onsley matthews sir alan stated and i received this commission from admiral sir samuel hood ah didnt we all though rodgers grunted since hood had sat in charge of the admiraltys professional side for several years from his hands personally sir alan boasted first in off cape francois then this february along with admiral howe at the admiralty face to face as it were sir dont come any better than that rodgers said with brows up in appreciation i know for certain neither o those worthies suffer fools gladly damme what wicked fun i do believe ill have a chat with our lord and master commodore garvey tomorrow put a word or two in his ear about your dare i say august connections to shiver his topsis make him wonder what youre doin here in his command if youre here to keep an eye on him even more reason for me to sail as far off as possible alan sighed and stay there until i rot sir aye but with a rovin commission an independent ship free of all his guff rodgers chuckled cant ask for better duty nor better chances for mischief im thinkin no once i drop the word on garvey your commandll be safe as houses hell fear to displace you so his son may prosper that is a relief sir damme i may have to start bein sickeningly patronizin to you mself lewrie rodgers laughed if i mean to aspire if you do not fear captain garvey sir lewrie responded tongue in cheek perhaps i should begin to patronize you one never knows does one rodgers snickered eyes alight the waiter came to open the second bottle of champagne and alan leaned back in his chair to see the civilian captain finney and his party leave the room finneys jaw was tight and working fretful flexings he swiveled his head to look back once and gave lewrie a petulant glare and fuck you too alan thought smugly whoever you are chapter hmmm lewrie had opined when caroline had shown him which house she wished it had once been a gatehouse stables then some overseers cottage for the boudreau plantation a bermudian saltbox done in stone little better than a country croft it had one large parlor and dining room in one half and two bedrooms for the other with deep covered porches front and back a breezeway had been added on the righthand side opposite the sitting rooms what caroline termed a carolina dogrun to make a covered terrace and separate the house proper from the addedon kitchen and pantries and their great heat off the back porch was a detached bathhouse and jakes it had clearly seen better days and needed work bit dowdy aint it hed suggested dubiously the boudreaus want an hundred guineas a year for their row houses alan caroline had told him wood with barely a scrap of land in back sure to be eaten to the ground by termites in a year here we have stone walls and stone floors and stone will be cool in high summer the boudreaus will replaster replace the shakes and allow me to retar against the rains i know it looks a fright but with some paint our furniture draperies and just look out at this view all this for only sixty guineas the year alan the house faced noreast fronted by bay street across the sound from the eastern end of potters cay turned eatercorner to face the trades so the porches and dogrun would be cool even in midafternoon heat and from the porch potters cay and hog island were dark green and pale dun swimming in waters that ranged from as clear as gin or wellwater to aquamarine turquoise emerald and jade and there was an inviting beach just across the road on the east bay where only the smallest ships could moor here well have half an acre for a small vegetable garden and flower beds alan shed praised on should i wish a coach or saddle horse i may dayrent from them stead of us having to buy mounts or an equipage and paying to stable them and theyll allow me all the manure i wish for the garden and all the boudreaus are charleston loyalists low country huguenots alan wonderful people and when betty mustin introduced us and they found i was from north carolina well tis a marvelous bargain dearest well hed waffled not seeing the possibilities so close to them ill need but one maidofallwork at a day alan saving us even more on servants wages with their land played out and a glut of slaves now theyre servantpoor oh do but indulge me in this love and when you return ill have us a home to do an admiral proud what the devils a fellow to do he sighed to himself wondering again at his easy surrender to her will at how quimstruck he had become so quickly so like aby godso like a husband he shivered at the image why next would come children sure as fate nappies and fouled swaddlings conversations centered upon a host of domestic dullitiesteething potty training breeching and all no he thought grimly surely not with spritely caroline please god and though the house was a bargain at sixty guineas there was more to consider those drapes those painters and plasterers those improvements his purse was nicely full but not bottomless yet to move them in stock the larder purchase implements for the gardens equip the kitchen and outfit those porches with some needed furnishings had set him back an additional sixty guineas already so there had gone most of his grandmothers remittance and the ј he had brought out had to be left with a local banker for her to draw upon for improvements the bulk of it and her household allowance doled out to her with his shore agent at what he prayed was a liberal eight pounds the month suddenly marriage was becoming more a pinchbeck coincounting drudgery than a terror he decided pray god phineas was right he muttered aloud shed better be economical as christ feeding the five thousand sir lieutenant ballard asked interrupting his pacing to leeward eh lewrie jerked wakened from his pecuniary musings i swore you said something sirjust maundering to myself over the high cost of domestic life mister ballard lewrie said with a shy grin waving one hand idly pay me no mind now weve what seems a constant threeandahalf fathoms to work with in this exuma sound i was indulging myself aye aye sir ballard said going back to his duties alacrity stood sousoueast with a touch of easting driven by the trades large on her larboard quarter the day before theyd gone closehauled up the chain of cays and shoals east from nassau toward eleuthera threaded the fleeming channel near six shilling cays and now loped across the exuma sound for their first survey area well perhaps loped was too strong a word since they towed a pair of localbuilt twomasted luggers of thirtyfoot length with their own ships boats atrail of them on long towing bridles so their forward speed was much impaired lewrie wasnt sure he wanted too much speed anyway given the clarity of the sea around them he could look over the side and see the bottom quite easily in the midmorning light could espy the occasional coral head to the west as the sound shoaled and observe alacritys shadow rising and falling away as it passed over stray startled batwinged rays or sharks below or shimmering clouds of brighthued fish james gatacre and his assistant came aft from the bows trailing the four midshipmen he ascended to the quarterdeck and peeked into the compass bowl he laid a thickfingered hand on the traverse board which made john fellows the naval sailing master sniff suspiciously gatacre turned his heavy craggy head aloft and eyed the set of the sun he peered down at the issue chart and paced off progress along their course from the fleeming channel entrance ahum he said folding up his dividers and shoving them into a pocket captain lewrie my compliments to you this morning sir mister gatacre lewrie nodded pleasantly might i humbly suggest to you sir that we get the way off her and come to anchor in the next ten minutes or so gatacre said there are rumors of a sandshoal and sand bores ahum just about here to be plumbed sir lewrie peered at the chart himself where the dead reckoning of their course ended assuming the chip log was right and they were doing six knots and a bit where gatacres thick thumb rested given four miles to the inch they were gods teeth lewrie spat mister ballard all hands take in topsls pay out a cable to the best bower hand the forecourse and the inner jibs nought to dread captain lewrie gatacre smiled confidently weve a good two miles before we fetch it assuming the position of the wreck was taken correctly ocourse nought to dread the wreck lewrie goggled christ on a bloody cross quartermaster put yer helm down two points to weather mister ballard loose sheets and let her luff did i not mention it last night in your cabins sir gatacre frowned you mentioned shoals sir but said nothing about a wreck bless my soul i was sure i had sir gatacre chuckled at his failure bemused by a faulty memory he stuck a forefinger into his ear and waggled it about vigorously as though that action restored thoughts a shipwreck lewrie muttered to himself mine arse on a bandbox iv ite nunc fortes perorate pontum fonte timendo go now ye brave plough up the sea whose streams you ought to dread medea seneca chapter it was just as well that dreadnought gatacre was armed with a host of assorted charts from france england holland and spain that spanned centuries of sailing in the bahamas he also possessed tomes of sailing directions from ancient to modern gathered by the admiralty over the years and pored over closely for the slightest variations in cartography or acceptable agreement over soundings bearings and channels among the coral reefs the sand shoals and sand bores else wed be at this til the last trumpet lewrie thought had they been forced to dismiss all preceding data he doubted if they would have finished mapping the chain of cays that led from new providence to eleuthera in alacritys threeyear commission and would still have been hard at their task when the last ships boy had become a doddering whitehaired pensioner fortunately many of the foreign charts proved truthful so it was mainly a list of unsurveyed waters they had to explore or those areas where no consensus could be agreed to shortening their task considerably midspring became high summer as alacrity felt her way south three months labor that passed in fits and starts there were fast exhilarating passages in brisk winds and balmy weathers followed by long days at anchor with the boats and luggers dragging and sounding with short lead lines oars dipping across glassycalm bays they scouted all down the length of exuma sounds western side past all the shoals and cays they plumbed the waters around conception island and rum cay peeked into crooked island passage along the windward shores of acklins then beat to windward for samana cay the plana cays then soueast once again to explore the jagged reefs of mayaguana island as settlers flocked into the bahamas as plantations and towns grew on the islands south from new providence onto virgin territory the need for safe sailing directions for the lower bahamas became a crucial matter as civilization invaded those cays that had before only been watering anchorages or pirates lairs the fleet had a vital need for potential bases from which to protect trade it was vital yes and a sober responsibility but it was fun hot as it became as they proceeded southerly the winds were bracing and cool and when a blow came up a safe anchorage could always be found in which to ride it out with four boats to be worked most of the hands had to be away from the ship during the days free of onerous repetitive labor and the hands enjoyed that the midshipmen were each assigned a boat of their own separated from their officers exasperations and they enjoyed that too and when the hydrographic work became boring there was always a passage to somewhere new to break the monotony and then arms drills fire drills gun drills and such were a welcome break in routine to which all hands fell with a will they took midday meals away from the ship for the most part and the cays and islets provided good sport for hunting or fishing with wild pigs or goats fetched back to supplant salt rations in the messes and those islands which were populated provided welcome entertainment after a good days labor a signal gun would summon the boats back alongside for a laterscheduled rum issue supper and easy discipline period of music and song before lights out and sleep and it was lovely for the bahamas were a sailors paradise for startlingly beautiful waters and islands for highpiled banks of cloud scudded along by bright clean winds instead of being far out to sea deprived for months of the sight of anything green of anything fresh to eat they partook of fruits and vegetables daily like so many lotuseaters and feasted their eyes on trees and grass walked beaches unmarked by human feet and sometimes rested in the shade of madeira mahoganies sea grapes or pines and palmettos amid lush and fragrant flowering shrubs listening to the oceans breeze stir fronds above their heads or the sea raling gently on the sands some do say theres routes cross the caicos banks gatacre told them at supper one evening as usual he had a foldedup chart near his plate at which he jabbed now and then with an inky ringer or a mustardsmeared knife and rumored entrances on the loord so a ship o moderate draught might pass through the breakers we could spend the rest of summer til hurricane season seeking them lewrie commented between bites of their supper a real boon to settlement of the turks and caicos were they to exist though sir lieutenant ballard suggested neatly delivering some iguana to his mouth they were anchored off fort george cay by the isles on the norwest side of the caicos where a palmettolog sand and tabby coralblock fort guarded the approaches to the salt isles will cony had gone ashore with lewries lightcaliber fusil and had nailed a brace of the fearsomelooking lizards with neat head shots and the ships cook had skinned and roasted them pronouncing them good as chicken any day aye mister ballard lookee here james gatacre went on a bigger sort o islands here in the caicos blue hills just a little way below us tthe souwest some name it providenciales fourteen mile long fairly wide north caicos a few miles noreast then ya have middle caicos east caicos teast an south all of em huge by bahamian standards wellwatered inland and fertile f r any sorta agriculture like an atoll they are strung round this shallow bank though to find good anchorages ya have tsail all the way round outside the caicos banks but with navigable passes commerce could flow with little dread o piracy or enemy ships in time o war the local garrison commander knows nought of em lewrie said with a shrug fort george depends on a monthly packet long way about bloody soldiers whatd they know gatacre sneered ive my doubts theyd know how to bait a hook were they starvin an that from the beach and in wartime fort george and any number of outposts would be cut off from turks island or south caicos and would fall without a way to resupply lewrie added and its not just protecting the salt trade look wider afield mouchoir passage turks passage the silver bank passage caicos even mayaguana and crooked island passages up north of here any ship leaving the caribbean through the windward passage has to thread one of these to get to the open sea a british base in the caicos could guard them all or deny them all salts important too sir ballard stated since the late s bermudian ships had been coming to the turks to evaporate seasalt in shallow salinas then rake white gold in the summers there were few settled islands so far but displaced loyalists and other opportunists were beginning to flood in so a crown presence was now necessary what about this pass here between water cay and blue hills eastern tip sir lewrie asked this quaintly named leewardgoingthrough narrow an shallow f r deepdraught merchantmen or men o war sir gatacre frowned an coral reefs which block access west toward discovery proggin or sapodilla bays our best hopes are o findin a pass outa caicos creekr malcolm road on the western coast maybe from clear sand road south o west caicos what lies beyond em is a mystry so far though south o west caicos theres reefs an shoals aplenty passes even so but where they lead been a graveyard o ships down there ye have deep water god fathomless deeps tleeward then in lessn three cables half a nautical mile it shoals so fast and the breakersre so rough that youre smashed like an egg on rock an coral fore ya could put yer helm over theres said tbe millions in pound sterlin o gold an silver litterin the ocean floor might ya dredge along the inner reefs past the breakers i spect theres untold fortune an that but a fraction o what these shoals have claimed since the days o cortez my word lewrie started and in shallow water dya say shall we haul up a bucket of doubloons before or after breakfast captain ballard japed now youve done it mister gatacre lewrie sighed talk from the wardroom always gets forrud quick as lightning well be lucky to get a decent hours work from the hands tomorrow ah dont ya think such talkll make em pay real close attention tthe bottom though sir gatacre snickered chapter malcolm road led nowhere but to high bluffs and jagged coral heads caicos creek had been promising twentyfour feet of water at the narrow entrance and led east to south bluff on blue hills thence to proggin bay and sapodilla bay then discovery bay which was a good anchorage but a reef with exposed coral heads blocked progress to the east and the caicos bank shallowed to six feet not very far offshore to the south and continued like a clearwater lake all the way to the horizon and the tempting sight of other islands and there was not twelve feet of water from south bluff across the direct course to west caicos inside the banks to clear sand road so they had to thread their way back out caicos creek to reach the sea then proceed south along the leeward coast of west caicos which was the situation for which they sought a solution in a nutshell at least we know theres fathoms depth within a mile of shore lewrie announced as they loafed along under reduced sail in west caicoss lee hands in the forechains were swinging the deepsea lead while the luggers prowled much closer inshore of alacrity a touch rocky for good holdingground but one could come to anchor quite close up to the beach yonder aye sir though if the winds veer westerly id not trust it for a storm good christ gatacre snapped suddenly william pitt had dined on iguana the night before too but had salvaged himself a few choice morsels of offal before it had been cooked and had appeared on deck towing a taloned paw in his mouth nearly the size of his head he brought it to lewries feet and dropped it sat back on his haunches and looked up evidently quite proud of himself expecting a pet or two stole it from the cook did you pitt lewrie chuckled as hebent down to rub the ramcat between the ears i suppose that qualifies as hunting good cat good lad you are gawd what a stench gatacre complained softly one should not complain about stench until one has discovered a breadroom rat half his size in ones shoes o the morning sir lewrie told him at least he is useful in that regard captain profitable too mister gatacre lewrie joshed with a droll expression as he rose the midshipmens mess pays dear for miller fattened on ships biscuit dear god ye gatacre winced looking a touch queasy i suspect the purser mr keyhoe breeds em as a sideline to tobacco and slopgoods fresh meats always been no bottom the larboard leadsman sang out no bottom to this line quartermaster ease your helm alee pinch us up shoreward a point lewrie ordered well rediscover the fathom line sail ho the masthead lookout called as well one point forrud o the starboard beam threemaster runnin soueast busy morning gatacre mused must be on passage for south caicos or turks island if shed dare run down these breakers heading soueast sir anyone elsed give em a wide berth may she have joy of it lewrie nodded cony do you discard this little offering of pitts for me would you aye aye sir and for another hour they loafed south with the merchantman looming hullup over the horizon coming within a league to seaward then passing ahead as she cleared southwest point on west caicos island and gradually began to subside below the horizon deck there the lookout called again urgently there be luggers clearin the point fine on the larboard bows mister ballard recall the ships boats at once lewrie said do not use the signal gun make a hoist instead ill thankee for the loan of your glass sir aye aye sir ballard nodded taken unawares lewrie slung the telescope over his shoulder by its rope strap and trotted forward to the taller foremast he stepped up onto the bulwarks and swung outboard onto the ratlines of the shrouds and began to scale the mast as high as the fighting top from there he could see four possibly five shallowdraft localbuilt luggers some with one mast some with two all bunched together like a sailing race they had low freeboards appeared scrofulous as badly maintained fishing craft but would be fast but there were to his eyes far too many men aboard the nearest ones to be fishermen pirates by god he exclaimed turning to the lookout were going to see some action damme if we aint without pausing to gather the breath hed lost in climbing the mast he took hold of a tarred backstay and let himself down hand over hand halfsliding with his legs wrapped around it to the deck mister ballard the boats he panted coming now sir coming so is bloody christmas stir em up lewrie paced eager to get sail on his little ship and clear for action tell off a midshipman and two hands per boat to tend them none of the gunners mind mister harkin prepare to crack on sail mister fowles ready your guns now with what hands you may gather its pirates after yon merchantman mister ballard standing out under the point and so far they wont know were here until we clear it mister gatacre mister fellows what do your charts tell you about shoalwater south of here i wish to press up to windward inshore of them so they cannot escape back over the banks uhm john fellows spoke up quickly more attuned to haste than the civilian gatacre theres reputed to be ten fathoms closeto along the reefs captain once round the point it runs eastsoueast across the mouth of clear sand road theres passes through the reefs after southeast reef one after molasses reef ah here and maybe a pass below french cay here another here before west sand spit do we keep the wind gauge we deny them those passes and keep them seaward lewrie nodded with a grim smile good mister fellows thankee damn my eyes wherere those bloody boat crews alongside now sir ballard replied sounding a touch eager himself now leave mr shipley with em lewrie decided relegating the more useful of the royal naval academy midshipmen to their command hes to put into clear sand road and anchor to await our return aye aye sir mister harkin pipe all hands get sail on her alacrity began to fly as the topsls were freed by men aloft on the footropes clews were drawn down to spread them to the wind and they bellied lightair full rustling and drumming outerflying jib and foretopmast stays soared up the stays up forward filled with air and were manhandled over to the starboard side by the focsle crew though still in west caicos lee and robbed of the full power of the trades there was a rivulet of wind close inshore that swept almost due south along the coast a wind she took full advantage of mister ballard beat to quarters lewrie snapped before we meet the stronger winds below southwest point aye aye sir the gun lashings came off the tackle and blocks were laid out on deck clear of recoil and the guns were run in to the full extent of the breeching ropes ships boys came up from below with the first leather or wooden cylinders which contained premeasured bags of powder from the magazines gun captains under the direction of the quartergunner buckinger fetched rammers wormers and slow match while the traintackle men appeared with handspikes and crowlevers to be used to shift aim right or left quickly with brute force gun captains went to the armthick shot garlands made of salvaged towing cable to select the roundest truest iron roundshot stored within rolling them and turning them over and over to look for imperfections or dents which could send them offaim charge yer guns buckinger snarled uncover yer vents alacrity trembled to the slamming noises of flimsy partitions and furniture being slung below on the orlop stores deck out of the way so her crew would not be decimated by clouds of flying splinters shot yer guns tamp em down snug now lads wads open the gun ports and run out mister ballard aye aye captain the sixpounders wooden trucks squealed as the heavy carriages were hauled up to butt against either bulwark with the black iron muzzles now protruding through the swungup gun port lids overhaul yer breechin ropes overhaul yer runout tackles buckinger roared no man steps in a bight right lose a foot an ya got none tblame but yrself andanswer tme later and heres the wind please god sir ballard said with his excitement tightly repressed alacrity had cleared southwest point skating across the open waters of clear sand road and found the everpresent trades which laid her over fifteen or more degrees onto her starboard side hands to the braces hands to the course sheets she heeled harder still until the angles of her sails were set then rose up almost level and set her shoulder to the sea her bluff bows snuffling foam as topsls rustled and cracked with the newfound power one could feel her leap forward could exult in the way she sprang to life hotblooded and eager as a racehorse hoist the colours lewrie said as cony fetched him his coat and hat and his sword to buckle on the threemasted merchantman had turned south once she had seen the suspicious luggers pursuing her to open the distance and turn the hunt into a long stern chase but the luggers were fast off the wind sails winged out like bats wings and skimming the shallowdraughted boats across the bright blue waters quick as pilot boats two of them had gybed and were a little west of the trading ship while the other three were boring in for her larboard side as alacrity plunged along they could see tiny puffs of smoke on the merchantmans high stern from a pair of light chase guns and white feathers of spray leap aloft near the luggers the luggers opened fire in reply and nearmisses splashed close alongside the trader one hit twirled lumber into the air from her poop rails what seemed like minutes later the flat sounds of the artillery reached them like faroff thunder they still dont see us lewrie exulted quartermaster a point more aweather steer us just inshore of that trio to larboard of the chase well trap them between our guns and hers to leeward there was a clear sharp horizon the sea dark blue and winking in the morning sun ahead and to windward the shallower waters were a palette of greens and pale blues the white breakers of the reefs curling and spuming like artillery shots and beyond toward morning the caicos bank lay still and calm the palest aquamarine with the clouds mirrored upon it like some desert mirage at last though someone aboard the luggers looked aft in the act of reloading a boatgun and gave a great shout of alarm and lewrie saw fifty heads swivel about and fifty mouths gape open in the round iris of his telescope alacrity ran down on them commissioning pendant streaming long as a topsl yard the red ensigns of the bahamas squadron flaming huge and menacing to leeward from her taffrail and her foremast truck her gun ports open and a frothing white mustache of foam growling under her bowsfast as the luggers were alacrity had infinitely more sail area a longer waterline and she drew closer to them as they bore off from the merchantman to run south the pair to leeward gave up their chase and turned to join their comrades thinking that there was safety in numbers mister ballard i make the range possible for random shot lewrie said at last lets try our eye on those two yonder aye aye sir ballard replied eagerly almost running to the quarterdeck nettings to look down into the ships waist starboard guns mister buckinger take them under fire number one starboard gun barked its crew shying back from the recoil run as the gun captain jerked the lanyard of the flintlock igniter the barrel was cold so even at maximum elevation the roundshot struck short but within line of the target slowly the other four cannon of the starboard battery exploded stinking clouds of powder that swirled downwind toward the luggers number one fired again this time with a warm barrel and its roundshot scored a hit so closeaboard the leader of the pair that it heeled over almost on its beam ends and rolled back upright its single mast snapped off and the large lugsail draped over its stern the trailing lugger ducked leeward behind its injured consort which act raised sarcastic jeers and catcalls from the british gunners as they pounded shot around the nowstationary target another strike lifted the injured lugger clear of the water breaking it in two and spilling its crew into the sea the pirate lugger behind it continued on course weaving at speed to throw off their aim id not like to be swimmin in these waters gatacre shivered sharks and spets aplenty cowardly bastards leave their mates to drown or get chomped gahh mister ballard tell the gun crews well done cease fire for now lewrie ordered quartermaster put your helm down two points well shift our attention to the trio there how close may we come to molasses reef mister fellows the charts infer theres ten fathoms within a cable cable and a half sir fellows told him rolling his eyes and shrugging id suggest we stand off at least two cables about yards captain well be fetching molasses reef in another mile the trio of luggers ahead of them were now bending their course soueasterly as though to run down close to molasses reef themselves or make for the reputed deepwater entrance at its north end trying to dart under alacritys bows to escape quartermaster helm down another point mister ballard take the nearest lugger under fire lewrie smiled discourage them hot now the gun barrels had a harsher more insistent sound and the low carriages and barrels leapt as they discharged rearing off their front wheels to crash back to the deck hot barrels meant slightly greater range five tall feathers of spray erupted as graceful as poplar trees all around the singlemasted lugger which trailed the trio once the foam and spray had subsided they could espy her hauling her wind to bear away out of range toward the open sea the leading pair fitted with two masts turned more southerly to continue to run as well denied a chance to get to windward alacrity had taken the pass below southeast reef from them the pass above molasses reef once more the luggers tried to turn up into the wind below molasses reef but alacrity was too close and hauled up onto the wind herself had cannonaded that idea from their minds the morning wore on as they chased them south slowly gaining a lowlying spit of sand french cay fell astern by noon and once more the luggers turned east to seek escape into the banks but alacrity peppered them with roundshot so fiercely they turned south again daunted by the rapidity and closeness of her fire west sand spit in sight sir fellows announced fine on our larboard bows five miles about theres a long reef with breakers and exposed coral below it fifteen miles it runs sir all the way to white cay and shot cay and no more passes after this un lewrie demanded two perhaps sir either side of white cay fellows shrugged deep water east of us now captain lewrie gatacre told him seven fathom reported five fathom from that thumb o deep water as runs south to west sand spit do they wish escape so bad sir thisd be their last chance yell have em closeaboard in two more hours deck there midshipman parham howled from aloft in a squeaky wail chases go closehauled on the wind sirs the four surviving luggers had caught up with each other in a loose gaggle the twomasted ones outdistancing the singlemasted all had turned due east to beat against the trades as close as they could bear they were at best threequarters of a mile ahead with alacrity able to run down on them to close the range rapidly before she turned up to windward and took them under fire again this time at about four cables distance they were daringthe best killing zone for a longbarreled sixpounder showing their desperation helm down quartermaster mister ballard hands to sheets and braces haul taut closehauled to weather lewrie ordered quoins out on the starboard guns and prepare to open fire the angle was almost right for all but the leading lugger which had gotten too far to windward for alacritys guns to bear fists rose in the air as gun captains signaled their charges ready flintlock striker lanyards were taut as bowstrings fire lewrie called out alacrity roared out her defiance thrashing along with wind singing in her rigging foam flying about her hull spray leaping high as the clews of her jibs the guns crashed and bellowed and a wall of smoke gushed from her to be ragged away astern fire and another broadside howled from her artillery a singlemasted lugger was torn to splinters leaping sternhigh and pitchpoling tumbling as if shed tripped over her own bows she crashed upside down into the sea in a welter of white water and began to sink at once reefs ahead to larboard a lookout shrilled helm up quartermaster bear away starboard lewrie shouted deep water to starboard sir gatacre counseled from a perch on the starboard bulwark where he could see ahead and below ten fathom tthis line a leadsman shouted back from the foredeck pointing to his right to indicate blue water and safety the clever bastard lewrie sighed with relief he knew what he was about turning to windward so early to wipe us off him in passing so to speak sir lieutenant ballard commented the guns cannot bear sir unless we turn up to windward again eight fathom tlarboard eight fathom tthis line sir the other leadsman sang out clear water ahead mister fellows mister gatacre do you think there is depth enough for us to continue the chase sirs lewrie inquired for a space sir fellows allowed another mile or two sir if were quick about it gatacre recommended quartermaster put your helm down lay us closehauled aye aye sir closehauled tweather neill parroted the luggers had gained at least half a mile on alacrity after she was forced off course and now lay more ahead than abeam of her after she began to beat to windward once more the gun crews had to pry the guns about to angle them within the ports to point at the foe grunting and sweating as they put their backs and arms against the metal crowlevers and handspikes quartermaster pinch us up and let her luff lewrie snapped gun captains as you bear fire one at a time the guns belched and leapt rolling back from the gun ports and snubbing on the breeching ropes slewing a bit due to the acute angle and making the tackle men swabbers and loaders jump back tacking the foremast lookout wailed lewrie stepped to the left side of his small quarterdeck for a view the luggers had tacked across the eye of the trades and were now heading westnorwest back the way they had come all during the long morning chase but this time they were inside the caicos bank sheltered from pursuit beyond the reefs and breakers skimming along over pale aquamarine waters far too shallow for alacrity vast there lewrie roared mister buckinger ready the larboard battery quartermaster ease your helm two points aweather mister ballard aye sir well not have much time im thinking so be ready to haul our wind and come about to loord six fathom the leadsman warned guns ready sir buckinger called out open fire mister buckinger alacrity rocked with recoil and spent powder smoke rolled over the decks like a thick fog only slowly wafting away shot moaned in the air across the shoaling waters across the sand and coral reefs which separated them from the foe a second broadside a third and one of the twomasted luggers was at last hit two shots slammed home rocking her at the extreme limit of alacritys range powder charges or a cask of powder aboard the lugger must have taken light for there was a sudden ruddy mushroom cap of flame followed by a squat bulging hump of grayblack smoke shot through with whirling wreckage then a hailstorm of splashing debris and she was gone the sound of her ruin came to them as a twofold crumpfhwumph as the smokecloud turned to a sooty mist chased low across the shallow sea and the whiteroiled waters became a series of ripples out of range sir buckinger informed them from the foot of the ladder to the waistthree fathom a leadsman called mournfully three fathom to this line and shoalwaters ahead two cable no more sir mister ballard haul our wind mister buckinger secure your guns for a gybe lewrie commanded run out unloaded bowse up to the bulwarks and belay the quartergunner told his hands put those slow match out sheetmen bracetenders stations for wearing ship off yer belays and haul taut ballard instructed ready about helm hard up to weather quartermaster wearho once settled on her new course out toward safer deeper water and the guns secured with charges and shot drawn vents covered and striker pans emptied ports closed and the guns lashed securely hard up against the hull lewrie had all hands summoned they thundered aft to mill about at the foot of the quarterdeck grinning with delight and chattering their excitement lads we did damned well he told them putting a brave face on his embarrassment from powder monkeys to waisters to the guns we shot like a crew three years in commission and im well pleased with you this day mister keyhoe we will splice the mainbrace they cheered the announcement of a double rum ration one free of accumulated debts among themselves of sippers and gulpers then he continued raising his hand to silence them then lads we pick up survivors and clap em in irons we go back to get our boats and other mates in clear sand road and hunt the rest of this pack of murderers and cutthroats down and bring em to court to hang mister harkin pipe clear decks and up spirits after the clamor died down lewrie paced aft to the taffrail on the windward side he raised his telescope and glared at the surviving luggers as they receded from view two miles or more away now hulldown with their sails mirrored on the glassy waters inside the caicos bank he had hurt them hed sunk three out of five of them saved a merchant ship come to think on it he gloomed where had that bugger gone so quickly without a word of thanks hed put the fear of kings justice in the rest of them but it wasnt enough the fact remained that he had been outmaneuvered fooled hed almost lost his ship on those razorsharp reefs somewhere out there was a very clever criminal laughing fit to bust he was certain at how hed bested him a criminal who had outsmarted him chapter a brother johnathon ship lewrie chuckled wryly i saved a yankees ship and now here he is selling bold as brass that you did the local magistrate mr lightbourne said as they strolled past the openair market of sheds just above the hightide line ive no way of stopping him no reliable bailiff no real power to regulate for the governorgeneral but this is a violation of the navigation acts sir lewrie insisted is there no kings ship in these waters nothing against your fellow officer captain lewrie but there is but the one tiny singlemasted cutter and shes off at the moment the gloomy magistrate said halting their stroll to make a point sir were it not for yankee ships coming to the salt isles we would have no imported food or goods not in the winter months after saltraking season to tide us over certainly when british ships put into port their prices are dear dear sir with a halfbattalion of troops a fleet of revenue cutters the full force of the kings customs even then i would have no hopes of enforcing steep prices just to benefit fat london merchants who got this order in council passed so you have to tolerate this alan said trying not to sound too accusatory to mr lightbournes reluctant nod he went on may i take it sir that some revenue is gathered some import duty uhm lightbourne shrugged eloquently but meaning no the navy cutter alan said did she just happen to be away as an interloper is selling here in cockburn harbour or anchored here when yankees enter hawks nest harbour over on turks island better that than being sued sir lightbourne told him try to arrest a foreign vessel impound its goods and one ends up incourt months later with damned little support from the crown try to panel a court i dare you they vote for acquittal every time and then the accusing officer is liable for damages for slander false arrest for restraint of trade lost incomes for demurrages accrued while the suspect vessel was at anchor and the crews back wages by tophet the fellow spluttered now you shew me the navy officer able to defend himself against that or the one with a purse fat enough to afford counsel and court costs oh the navigation acts are a grand idea but no thought was given to just how crown officials were to enforce them sir twould be better were we to accede to the inevitable deal with the possible and levy imposts to gain a little from each shipload but to bar foreign traders and goods to demand all british trade to and fro is done in british bottoms well the only way possible would be if the foreign vessel resisted being stopped and inspected lewrie surmised aloud as they resumed a leisurely stroll past all the palmettoroofed sheds the canvastopped pavilions heaped with goods of every description if they fired on a kings ship aye and theyre not that stupid sir the magistrate said with a wry chuckle thumb their noses at you bare their bums introduce me anyway sir lewrie sighed in resignation he was led to an opensided pavilion where several civilians sat in the shade imbibing wine or ale as lewrie approached dressed as a crown officer several of them found reason to finish their ales and make off while the rest shifted uneasily mister lightbourne a grayhaired sea captain nodded to the magistrate a splendid good afternoon to ye sir captain grant allow me to name you lieutenant alan lewrie captain of his majestys sloop alacrity sir captain lewrie grant beamed extending a calloused hand captain grant your servant sir lewrie rejoined taking the hand is that good ale youre enjoying there sir philadelphia beer captain lewrie grant allowed it travels well though do sit and enjoy a mug if youve a mind i would sir alan replied removing his cocked hat and taking a shaky seat in a sprung chair at the rickety table which rested on a shipping pallet over the sandy soil here on some official business are ye captain lewrie grant inquired with an innocent expression and a deal of humour to seek a small measure of gratitude captain grant alan said as a wooden mug appeared foaming and aromatic with hops you and i almost met two days ago off west caicos sir aha your alacrity was the brave little bulldog that saved me bacon from those pirates was she grant boomed well now tis deed happy i am to make your acquaintance captain lewrie devilish it is sir the brass o those cutthroats tis getting so an honest trader goes in fear o his very life engaged may he be pon his innocent occasions my undying thanks to ye sir should have seen it lads chased them buggers right to the razors edge o the reefs off french cay he did within a whisker o tearing the stout heart o his fine little vessel out oh yeve bottom ye have sir no error i saw ye sink one rest get away sank three sir lewrie replied as the others gave him cynical cheers and captured a dozen survivors we have them in mister lightbournes custody at the moment two boats escaped me youll get em grant prophesied eager young feller like yself they got no chance sir i will thankee sir lewrie smiled getting to the meat of the matter as for the ones now in custody though a case must be laid sir not merely my word they were taken in arms i need your testimony as the intended victim captain grant else theyll be set free instead of swing to continue their foul activities of preying upon honest merchantmen engaged upon their lawful and innocent occasions well now young sir grant frowned ready to strangle on such a preposterous notion me testify bless me soul captain a long voyage to nassau weeks waiting for the court to convene sir demurrages piling up and all were i to be paid recompense i might be able to but hurricane seasons almost upon us and me poor old sarah and jane mister lightbourne does assure me captain grant that a deposition would be sufficient lewrie interrupted and was galled by the sarcastic humour from all present his suggestion elicited my ye are a youngun aint ye now grant chuckled for me to depose in a british court american master and all wheww you would have to lay yourself open to a charge of violating the navigation acts i know sir lewrie said reddening with anger at their laughter and their lawyer would make pucks fair of you but were you to state that you were on passage for hispaniola ahh grant smiled as he was let off the hook and we said that you forced me to enter harbor here so your testimony could be written out by a crown officiallewrie sketched on an unbiased magistrate appointed by the governorgeneral of the bahamas who could provide additional testimony to the unimpeachable nature of your voyage sir why bless me soul young sir if ye aint the knackyun grant hooted and leaned back on his rickety stool and whilst i was in port here not o me own free will as it were i do believe i did trade hispaniola goods fer salt straight across the board hey lewrie blushed once more feeling sullied by what he was being forced to ignore your uhm commercial endeavors following what testimony you render sir are none of my concern captain grant and surely are not required to be cited in the deposition playing fast and loose with king georges official edicts was an unsettling experience for him one he knew for certain he did not wish to repeat sins of a personal nature were one thing but the law and placing his personal honour in jeopardy to boot we understand each other captain lewrie grant simpered this once we do sir lewrie insisted yet i would pray you complete your trading and clear these waters with all haste i might just be possessed of a deepenough purse to defend myself were i of a mind to inspect your vessel the next time i see her do we understand each other now captain grant grant laughed and gave him an elaborate seated bow i do stand admonished captain lewrie he allowed with a wry expression well not cross hawses again moren like and if we do ill try to outrun ye stead o bribing ye ye catch me though i just might try the depth o that purse o yern cant expect the fish to be hauled aboard without a fight ye know i know lewrie nodded still want that deposition then grant asked i do sir if youre still of a mind then lets be about it grant agreed faster i give me testament the faster ill be out o yer hair and out of port lewrie prodded and out of yer jurisdiction grant beamed fair enough galling aint it mr lightbourne said as they walked back to the commissioners house together now you begin to know what i face here in the turks no support from nassau no real authority threat of being lynched were i too effective or turned out by those bonelazy worthies on new providence for being incapable were they to discover the true circumstances which obtain here ive turned many a blind eye long as theres revenues from salt quarterly yet i cannot blame the people hereabouts for wanting lumber and luxury theyd go naked and starving without the illicit trade thered not be one decent shack to live in without it mmmm lewrie frowned pacing into his advancing shadow eyes downcast i do not sell my office captain lewrie lightbourne told him nor do i think you would watch yourself though sir theres enough would sell their honour turn the blind eye and pray not to be bothered some of our exalted so to speak superior to you and me and some so venal theyd even countenance your pirates long as it was foreignflagged merchants they plundered have a care captain lewrie whom you arrest they might turn out to have powerful allies you caution me to ignore the navigation acts sir lewrie demanded stopping his stroll and looking up sharply at lightbourne i caution you do nothing rash captain lewrie lightbourne shot back his own honour touched think deep before you commit yourself before you do what honour dictates but dont trust to a single snare lay yourself a web mazey as a spiders so there is no way for your prey to wriggle out and like me be thankful for a small victory now and then stead of going crusading i see lewrie softened seeing what sense lightbourne was endeavoring to give him thankee mister lightbourne ill take a round turn and two half hitches look before i leap then and thats a trial best tested later for now ill be satisfied with running the rest of this gang to earth no way i suppose those in custodyd talk to us tell us where the rest may be found this lotre practiced sinners captain lewrie lightbourne shrugged resignedly honour among thieves some freebooters code of silence the black spot and all that theyd rather swing game on the gallows and be infamous for a few days no hope of that then itll take combing these islands lewrie vowed but comb em i will however long it takes chapter make captain repair on board mister mayhew lewrie ordered as alacrity ranged up to within half a cable of the wayward navy cutter aemilia they had spent a whole day and night seeking her first in hawks nest harbour on turks island long bay and balfour town on salt cay and had finally discovered her cruising south of big sand cay in the lower turks passage the young officer who came through alacritys starboard entry port came most unwillingly having dressed hurriedly and still had a blotch or two of shaving soap behind his ears a fresh tea stain on his shirt front and acted very put out and sulky courtney coltrop the officer said before alan could open his mouth his demeanor on the ragged edge of open insubordination i was not informed another ship was in my area sir alan lewrie mister coltrop lewrie said taking an intense dislike to him at once and spurning the honorific of captain which he merited youre a hard man to find sir i do not maintain a set patrol sir coltrop almost sneered so i may spread confusion among our kings enemies the better pirates and smugglers aye lewrie glared such as the yankee trader in south caicos harbor yesterday which you did not find on your irregular patrol nor the pirates off west caicos the other day ever patrol as far as that do you the bulk of the trade is here in the turks sir coltrop said waving an arm about the empty straits and i am one small cutter with a huge area to cover here now whats the date of your commission he demanded irked at the preemptory questions february of lewrie snapped yours as if it matters march of sir coltrop reddened realizing that he was junior at last and should begin to show proper courtesy though it was a mystery to lewrie that the lout would not automatically assume the deference due a captain of a warship larger than his tiny sixtyfoot cutter alan put it down to insufferable overweening pride or impeccable connections and patronage some powerful sea daddy mister coltrop you were unaware that a substantial band of pirates were active in the caicos there was no rumour of an action off west caicos three days ago sir no hint of past depredations no sir coltrop grunted considering the consequences if you would be so kind as to join me in my chartspace sir i will discover the matter to you lewrie smiled benignly and use your knowledge of these waters so we may hunt the others they repaired below to alans quarters lewrie the truculent coltrop sailing master fellows and james gatacre lewrie sketched out the area where the action had occurred with a pair of dividers picked up our boats here and searched the foreshore for them he said laying the dividers aside at last there was some sort of temporary camp but no arms or stores palmetto leantos or shacks empty and abandoned they had nothing to return for but i believe they have some lair in the caicos still that dont follow sir coltrop told him screwing his face into a moue of disagreement theyre freebooters live wild like so many bloody gypsies more than like they came up from tortuga off hispaniola maybe over from spanish florida or cuba with all their goods in their boats you scared the bejesus out of em so they crossed through one of these passes after dark to scuttle off to safer waters theyre probably drunk as lords in some hurricane hole this very instant just came over for the odd raid or two one or two luggers i deem a raid sir lewrie smiled but five boats with about eighty or ninety men between them would need a shore base where they might store their illgotten gains one or two boatloads could take one ship of the summer trade at best but five seems enough to raid all summer and they had to have a place to cook to sleep to keep lookout for inwardbound ships well one would suppose sir coltrop sighed as though he were bored but given me hurt you allege you dealt em id put my guineas on their being long gone from the caicos by now a fatal assumption for the next ship taken if such assumption is wrong lewrie snorted theyve two swift luggers still and could take at least one more vessel so they have some profit torepay their pains and i doubt if determined and ruthless men know when to quit for revenge if nothing else conversely lieutenant coltrop john fellows said raising his gingery eyebrows as was his wont when he got excited what if there were ships already taken they must have stowed that plunder somewhere in the caicos and theyd not sail away without it an even more compelling argument for them remaining i wonder if you are aware of other ships that may be missing sir lord coltrop gaped in mock wonder how would i know with absolutely no method of determining how many ships set sail for the turks to begin with the when or the wherefrom youve heard no talk among the arriving masters no rumours of what happened to old soandso lewrie pressed it is not within my duties to question arriving masters or to deal with them except as to whether they abide by the law sir yet in pursuing your duties of enforcing the navigation acts in boarding and documenting arriving ships manifests lewrie cooed trying hard to rein in his growing anger in determining whether a vessel is allowed to enter british ports you have absolutely no converse with their captains and mates sir is that what you are telling us sir i have heard no gossip no complaints no speculations about missing vessels sir coltrop replied stiffly haughtily very well then mister coltrop lewrie said after a deep breath and a long sigh of frustration lets proceed along another tack mister fellows my sailing master and mister gatacre who now directs my ships activities as her supercargo from the admiralty lewrie said inflating gatacres status without having to tell a baldfaced lie or be specific deem that our pirates need a place where there is a tall headland they need a reliable well or stream for water shelter from seaward to hide their boats and what prey they take so they may loot em at their leisure shoalwaters wide enough to prevent pursuit by a warship or gunfire closer than random shot and easy access to the caicos banks so they may flee if their lair is found not too close to fort george cay up north nor close to turks passage where you patrol that means they must be based either to the west of the bank or somewhere along the northern side of north middle or east caicos island now just where assuming our suppositions about their needs are correct in your experience in these waters would you believe the most likely hideout to be coltrop leaned over the chart hat under one arm and elbows tucked in close to his sides as if he wished to avoid touching it or getting in any way involved he blew out a breath puffing his cheeks in perplexity lord sir he said at last with a hopeless smile fraid i havent a clue sorry know the turks passage and all dyou see but good christ gatacre exploded youre about as useless as teats on a man how long you been in these waters puppy year and a bit sir i coltrop shuddered too scared of gatacres uncertain amount of seniority to continue his smug bluster gatacre wore navy blue but it was a civilian suit more apt on some merchant master but for a military cocked hat big as a watermelon the buttons were plain pewter though so what was he if not some civilian official from the lords commissioners of the admiralty a secretary whod report back about lieutenant coltrop and tell them lord and youve leashed yourself to the turks passage gatacre went on indignantly never explored the caicos or are they too far from your bottler your table the brothels that good in the salt isles are they sir sir i ever been down to the ambergris cays as far north as drum point on east caicos took a peek into windwardgoingthrough have you gatacre sneered god ive never heard of a sea officer with an active commission so unaspiring nor so unambitious i have been to fort george cay sir to deliver supplies as needed sir coltrop quavered out i have put into the ambergris cays when the whales run sir but this is the wrong season theres no one there now the whalers wont be back a fine place for pirates then lewrie commented an empty whaling station deep water for their ships huts for shelter trypots and fuel for cooking in place water a tall headland or two thats where well search first alacrity to big ambergris and your cutter to little ambergris where the depth is too shoal what does your cutter draw mister coltrop ijh seven feet sir but sir if there are pirates then surely my place is in turks passage to defend to accompany you i must leave shipping open to god knows what by whom mister coltrop lewrie fumed tripolitan galleys levant corsairs theres one band of pirates we know of and if we put pressure on them with our search we halt their activities did you not tell me your patrols are irregularly timed so you may how did you put it sow confusion and doubt well then lets go sow some doubt and confusion and capture ourselves some pirates sir i coltrop began to protest then swallowed his outburst of course sir i am certain the aemilia will be of inestimable assistance to you sir coltrop turned suddenly sweet and got his pride of old back a bit too quickly for lewries taste do you know she is named for our commodores daughter sir in her honour so thats who his powerful sea daddy is lewrie thought as he studied coltrops regained smugness with distaste commodore garvey will be most pleased that she will figure in your uhm adventure captain lewrie coltrop grinned then youd better take care she doesnt trip on a shoal and wet herself mustnt you mister coltrop lewrie smiled back at him go board your aemilia and set course for little ambergris while we still have some light and mind your soundings aye aye sir poxy bastard gatacre grumbled once he was gone ive never seen such a worthless idle a wellconnected bastard though lewrie grunted i cant wait to read his report on the action damme mister gatacre if we dont find these pirates if they take a ship under our noses hell have my nutmegs on a silver tray best do what all the good captains do then sir gatacre chuckled as they walked forward to go on deck plaster a confident grin on yer phiz an dare anybody to gainsay ya chapter of course nothing went that easily there were signs of recent human habitation on big ambergris much like the abandoned camp on west caicos their suppositions the pirates were still around were fulfilled but just where they had gone remained a mystery for another week alacrity and aemilia prowled in company back up turks passage toward drum point on east caicos along the spectacular coral reefs by lorimers point and joe grants cay which sheltered the mouth of the windwardgoingthrough channel between east and middle caicos islands the bluffs were high enough behind the reefs to provide excellent watchposts when they went ashore in luggers and ships boats they found sources of water there were deeps very close inshore where looted ships could be scuttled to avoid detection but no pirate band lewrie was getting extremely frustrated it was not the sneer on lieutenant coltrops face which upset him though that irked him every time he had reason to talk with him he realized he had made the pirates and their destruction a personal quest there was commodore garvey to please to impress with what he could accomplish and capturing or destroying these buccaneers would be a way to expunge the chagrin he felt about his bargain with the american captain grant turning a blind eye to his violation of the navigation acts and in that first flush of exultation hed shown to his crew after sinking those luggers hed overstepped himself and promised they would get the rest now if he did not he felt the men would lose confidence in his abilities and his captaincy of alacrity would become a drudgery instead of a delight being someone elses junior officer felt so damned good alan told himself in the echoing privacy of his cabins aft without caroline aboard he was severely limited now in whom he could confide oh he could dine in bags of people and share jests with them as the most genial of hosts but it wasnt the same as being able to unburden his cares and worries on someone else but then thats why they pay me five grand shillings a day sir lieutenant ballard said coming to alans seat on the taffrail signalflag lockers aemilia has put about and is bearing down on us lewrie rose and made his way forward it had just gone five bells of the second dogwatch evening quarters had been stood and the hands had eaten and were now entertaining themselves in the cool afterglow of sunset mr midshipman shipley and his mostly hapless colleague mr midshipman joyce were doinghornpipes in the waist for the amusement of the people forrud part of the larboard watchs price as losers at drills that afternoon was he not to peek into highas cay and bottle creek sir ballard inquired perhaps hes seen something at last lewrie snapped a quick look at ballard to see if his at last was a subtle condemnation but ballard had a telescope to his eye and was intent upon the ghostly shape of aemilia as she sailed back east to join them he was mister ballard as you say perhaps this hopeless search of ours will be rewarded at last lewrie could not help rejoining theyre somewhere out here still sir ballard said quickly i know youre correct about that its just the where or how long they might remain if they fear a new more active warship is stationed in the turks and caicos id hate for them to run before we nab em thankee mister ballard lewrie relented with a shy grin i was beginning to fear i was the only one who wished to continue this chasing of wild geese chasing shadows more like most deadly shadows sir ballard intoned with a sober nod but with a quirky little grin of his own should lieutenant coltrop be the bearer of glad tidings do you wish the taffrail lanterns lit sir or should we proceed darkened theres a ninetyfoottall bluff at the extreme west end of middle caicos just by highas cay lewrie pondered do not give a possible watcher anything to bite on and alter course to seaward if aemilia has news for us hell come to us out there i only wish there was a way to signal him without a fuzee to stay dark himself here sir coltrop jabbed exultantly at the chart just under the headland overlooking highas cay and the narrow channel between middle and north caicos there were cook fires i saw the smoke sir did you stand close inshore lewrie asked unable to hide his mounting excitement did you see a camp didnt want to blow the gaff sir coltrop laughed for once almost pleasant to be around i stood north for a time as if to go to seaward of north caicos then doubled back but as far as i know there should be no one there a few farms so far on north caicos a fish camp or two but none on middle caicos yet what do they call this area mister gatacre lewrie asked conch bar sir gatacre replied theres rumoured to be some caves there that indians used in columbus time tis a barren place now though watered though fellows insisted and where you find water youll find our pirates look sir its perfect bluffs to spy from just as we deduced deep water about an hundred fathoms close up to the reefs and shoals an inlet between highas cay and conch bar bluff where ships may moor an escape run down this saltcreek between north and middle islands to the banks and their main camp would most likely be about a mile in from the shoalwater line out of range of random shot depth though mister fellows lewrie implored unsurveyed sir fellows had to admit deflating a fathom maybe less once inside highas cay and it may be a fish camp after all lewrie fretted out loud but then again we must examine it if their main camp is inland about a mile or better that would put them here down by this last point opposite the second islet past highas cay they see us coming they run through this passage for the banks where we cannot follow to prevent that we must use all the ships boats and our surveying luggers and land a party between them and the escape route cross the shoals above bottle creek wend our way under the shoreline into that channel to here at dawn alacrity must be just without the shoals to cover highas cay and deliver unaimed fire on this inner point as a diversion and to flush them out if they get the wind up mister coltrop i want aemilia inshore even further make the best of your way across the shoals with your sevenfoot draught norwest of the inner point of land to block any possible escape up bottle creek and out to sea off north caicos and scour the beach under the bluffs with your fourpounders good god sir ill rip her bottom out sure coltrop gasped close as you may without holing yourself make a demonstration frighten them into running straight at me lewrie decided you sir fellows goggled sir its well its been the traditional thing for the first officer to its the riskiest part of our venture lewrie countered if theyre not pirates i wish to be the one nearest on the scene to call it off and if they are ive more experience with landfighting should we not keep an eye on them for now sir coltrop asked send for troops from fort george cay surely its their if they are pirates mister coltrop they saw you sure as imstanding here and theyre considering whether they should stay or run we cannot take the time to send for troops and let them escape ill begrudge not a single wasted hour not a single wasted minute aye aye sir sir its my place of honour ballard protested as the boats were led around to the entry ports as the armourers files and stone rasped to put brutally sharp edges on steel blades and points how else are lieutenants to rise if they go in their captains shadow with the shore party away alacrityll be shorthanded mister ballard i need you aboard to run her as bristolfashion as a st rate lewrie smiled and keep her off those shoals once one makes captain sir its time to let a younger man be ones goat ballard rejoined not backing down an inch let the junior officers make a name for themselves or a muck of it is it that you see me making a muck of it sir i have the utmost confidence in you mister ballard lewrie said tis coltrop i dont put faith in i scare him you dont and if i have to tow his damned cutter inshore to get him in place ill do it ill scout him an anchorage for dawn during the night and then be there to give him strict orders to take that anchorage or suffer the consequences you have a copy of my orders to him in yours if he fails should i fall and this expedition fails you must see to it that he pays the price for not supporting me id rather be the one to risk my life on such a slender thread as that idle fop than risk yours arthur i see i think sir ballard surrendered at last growl you may but go you must lewrie laughed clapping him on the shoulder in parting old navy proverb might be the thirtyseventh article of war hey right after the captains cloak there were only thirtysix articles of war the last gave a blanket power to a captains lone decision for anything not covered by the specifics of the other thirtyfivethe captains cloak the very best of fortune go with you sir ballard said and enjoy your temporary command sir chapter it was slow going rowing or poling in the darkness first to run through the boisterous shoals two miles above highas cay safely hidden by the night then to grope about close under the foreshore of the low islet that screened bottle creek from the sea inshore the caicos were rife with mosquitoes and biting flies and once out of the trades and into the marshysmelling mangroves along the beach they were almost eaten alive aemilia followed sounding her way through a twofathom pass she threaded her way into bottle creek behind that inner second isle to screen her from view and alan found an anchorage for her sounding with a short lead line and counting the marks in it by feel until he had her a spot where the bottom was ten feet or would be at high tide the cutters light fourpounders would not make much real impression on the pirate camp from that range but it might put the fear of god in them then they completed their voyage snaking out of bottle creek south along the shore of north caicos staying to the western side of the possible escape channel to avoid detection and went a mile below the suspected position before turning to cross the narrow strait i kin smell em sir cony said his poachers senses alert wood smoke an cookin goat moren like mayhap fish stew on the boil too sir right savory iff n ya dont mind my sayin there sir one of the hands poling up forrud whispered i think i see fires like they wuz usin one o them caves tcook in once on the eastern shore they poled back north in water just a bit deeper than their shallowdraught keels about four feet until the coast bent back norwest past the mouth of a tiny inlet half a mile little more to go lewrie decided and hard sand all the way to the point were on foot the rest of the wayput into the inlet men lewrie ordered in a harsh mutter leave the boats no one is to show a light no one is to load his musket or pistol until i return and tell you to not a sound now mister parham mister mayhew you and the bosuns mate are in charge until cony and i return taking only edged weapons lewrie and cony set out up the hard sand of the beach for a ways then moved into the deeper softer sand above the tideline toward the sheltering sea grapes and stunted low bushes a ledge of rock began to rise at their right hand as they progressed and climbed higher and higher in irregular slabs as they neared the suspect camp soon they were creeping along its base for concealment as it rose above their heads thisll climb all the way to the sea bluffs lewrie muttered i dont think theres a way up it too crumbly sir cony agreed in a whisper limestone an ole coral cut ya tribbons iff n ya tried it in the dark it would listen lewrie cautioned kneeling down lower there were sounds of shouting of laughter and of music that came to them under the rush of the night winds and the continual sound of foliage stirring and then there was a womanly scream wimmen cony hissed close to lewries ear might be a party theys avin might they be fishermen after all sir lewrie laid a finger to his lips and took a deep breath to make his limbs obey him he half stood and placed one tentative foot in front of the other his grasp sweaty on the hilt of his hanger with tremulous caution they gained another long musketshot about sixty yards to an outthrust of rocky ledge to go around it would mean exposing themselves to the camp they found a narrow crevice that took them up top then crawled on their bellies through sharpedged grasses and coarse bushes until they could see it wasnt a fish camp lewrie thought feeling a flush of relief fill him there were the two luggers that had escaped him along with another pair larger and twomasted anchored very close inshore to the beach and on the beach below him were a brace of longboats with their bows jammed snug on the land the longboats were royal barges compared to the scrofulous condition of the luggers obviously taken from some earlier prize of theirs perhaps from two different prizes since their paintschemes did not match there was cooking smoke coming from the mouth of the nearest cave under the bluff several more smaller fires burning in a circle beyond the boats there were crates and chests scattered about for rude furniture several more piled up and covered with scrap canvas near the mouth of the cave more still piled on the lower beach and just offshore anchored foreandaft parallel to shore was a twomasted schooner of about sixty feet overall on which lanterns burned at helm and forecastle the people on the beach got alans attention next they were a gaudy crew dressed beaunasty in checked shirts opulent satin waistcoats sashes around the waists spanish hidalgostyle in either breeches without stockings or sloptrousers they wore neckerchiefs bound about their heads like gunners would to protect their hearing or in tricornes or straw hats each affecting a highly individualistic and rakehell sense of fashion and they went armed swaggering they were under the weight of pistols stuck into their waistbands or sashes cutlasses or swords at their hips some muskets stood propped against crates of loot and there were enough weapons in sight to equip a halfbattalion of light troops theres the wimmen sir cony pointed out spanishlooking in the firelights flickering glows or black and sheened with sweat they were swilling rum wine or brandy with as much gusto as the men their finery obviously looted goods too they lay there and watched the piratical band roister for half an hour carefully counting heads trying to pick out leaders who sat apart more quiet than the others they watched fights and brawling among both the men and the women they watched men take women off to the cave or up the beach beyond the light prisoners sir cony mouthed almost silent tugging at alans shirt sleeve them wimmen yonder back by them covered crates lewrie pulled out his telescope and brought it forward inch at a time careful that the lens did not reflect firelight he studied the party of women by the pile of loot slaves some of them and some whiteskinned and bedraggledfree women and their maids he speculated as he lay in the hide watching one of the men he thought of as a leader went to the women staggering drunk and reached down to pull one to him she began to scream and plead only her loudest and most inarticulate cries reaching them brutally he backhanded her into silence then dragged her back down the beach to the circle of fires to throw her down peel off his breeches and fall atop her to the exultant cheering of his band and once he had slaked his lust with her three more sprang forward like inferior wolves to savage hertheyll kill them wimmen oncet theyre done with em mister lewrie cony whispered mortified by the sights he had seen without being able to lift a finger to help jesus god amercy might have been saving em for tonight lewrie nodded if they sail on the morrow theyll want no witnesses left alive see those goods piled close to the beach so they may begin loading the schooner and the biggest luggers if wed waited wed have lost them lets get back to the boats it lacks two hours til dawn cony went unwillingly and it was only once they were back on the beach with the horrifying sights and sounds of pitiless rape put behind them that he trusted himself to speak wisht there was ought we could do for em sir tonight that is he whispered plaintively dawn might be too late tsave em i want you on that ledge at dawn cony lewrie told him i want you and my fusil and the ferguson rifle up there in good hands pick your likely country lads and gutshoot anyone that lays a hand on em or even glares in their direction that suit you cony aye sir it sure tgod does chapter the dawn smelled of crushed foliage and trampled flowers overlaying mud and mangrove marsh of damp sand and beach burrowers the fishscale aroma of the coast most landlubbers mistook for seaair the true seaair smell came on the whispering trades the baked salt and iodine tang of ocean deeps borne by winds ceaselessly stirring from across thousands of miles of brine damp clamminess was stripped away by the breezes even as they brought the balmy warmth of a humid sunrise bedewing the steel in his hand lewries nostrils drank in the smells almost quivering like a beasts much as his limbs trembled in anticipation stiff with a tooshort and troubled nap as they made their stealthy approachmarch damme but this is a daft businessand a bloody one alan thought keyed up rumpled and miserable but dont this morning beat all for handsome an hundred sunrises could pass unremarked but take up arms and the risk of dying before breakfast and even a winter rain could be sweet its bitter soaking chill savored because one was still alive to suffer it before the madness set in he turned to study his men there were thirty from alacrity half of her adult crewmen and twenty hands off aemilia almost half of her crew too they yawned and scratched flexed their fingers on their weapons nervously eyes shifting as squintapipes as a bag of nails at every rustle in the bushes every seabirds cry or soft lap of the inlets surf on the beach armed to the teeth they were with cutlasses clasp knives long boarding pikes good brown bess caliber muskets wicked needlesharp offset bayonets jammed in the waistbands of their sloptrousers as desperate a crew of cutthroats as the pirates to look at them laden down with clumsy sea pattern pistols for each man in addition with all the powder flasks bullet pouches and cartouche boxes hung about them as they plodded and scuffled strung out in a long single file below the rising ridge of crumbling rock half buried in the greenery for cover just round this outcrop seventy yards or so lewrie grunted calling a halt at last mister parham your boatgun at the foot of the shelf mister mayhew your twopounder atop the shelf with cony and his marksmen grape canister or langridge at first and keep em away from their boats as i bade you right the rest of you lads i want you ready to rush out and form a skirmish line from mister parhams gun to the beach there was a faint rustle in the air and lewrie pulled out his watch to check the time which made him nod grimly the rustle became a sizzling swoosh of roiled air then a quavery moan alacritys guns had just opened fire a mileandahalf away shooting almost blind at the bluffs fowles first ranging shot was on the way there was a thunderclap so close it seemed it went off in his pocket as the bluff to the north above the sea caves was struck the iron ball exploded in a bright yellow flash of sparks metallic shards and shale starting a small avalanche of graveland the sunrise echoed with the soft fummumm of an unseen gun now where are you you silly bastard lewrie fretted turning to look for aemilia across the channel once she found her proper position even her puny fourpounders could rake the beach and the anchored vessels across the quartermile strait he was relieved to see a bowsprit protrude from behind the low foliage and the first starkly pale tan panels of her jibs stood out against the dark green and dun another roundshot droned in from the reefs fired at maximum elevation with the quoin block removed from below the barrels butt and this struck short of the bluffs to raise a great pillar of foam in the inlet about half a cable short of the anchored schooner the pirates were up now stirring and circling in hungover and blearyeyed confusion some lay still too comatose from rum or their excessive indulgences to be wakened women camp followers screamed or cursed in a cacophony of dialects and languages orders were shouted that for the moment went unheeded they mostly dashed to the piles of weapons drew swords to brandish against just what they did not yet know stampeded first toward their boats then back to the shelter of the piles of goods or the bluff and the drycave entrance as a ball moaned overhead to bury itself in the sand come on coltrop come on lewrie hissed to speed the cutter as she made her entrance as slow as a onelegged dowager trying to go up a flight of stairs aemilia was turned bowson now rounding the first western tip of the islet her gaff mainsl winged out alee and her commissioning pendant streaming as long as she was oh bloody hell coltrop had run her aground on a sand bar she canted over a little to leeward and came to a stop slowly pivoting on her bows to show her starboard side far short of the near tip of the islet where her guns would be in good range i warned him that channel was tightern virgins quim alan raged the bottom was hard sand though so he might yet get her off it if he tried but no coltrop fired from where he was the two fourpounders in her starboard battery coughing out roundshot at the schooner they hit short and ricocheted once almost rocked her as the ripple patterns expanded but the range was too great to do any harm to her or the beach there was no help for him then lewrie and his party of fifty were on their own with six men tied up in serving the boatguns up against sixty or seventy alert and armed pirates mister parham shift your aim for the thickest throng yonder open fire he ordered hoping to cut the odds down niceties bedamned there are women among them sir parham protested shocked cutthroats whores mister parham cutthroats themselves if they get their hands on you shift aim and fire mister mayhew canister up there volley into the nextbiggest batch mayhews face appeared over the lip of the rocky shelf for a moment turned pale as he gulped then withdrew anyone with a weapon you are to kill lewrie told his hands and i mean anyone the boatgun gave out a chuffing bark a rrrupp of anger that startled a cloud of sea birds which had fled aemilias rude disturbance of their morning back out into midchannel a moment later mayhews gun on the ledge barked as well both explosions echoing and reechoing along the rocky bluffs two spreading shotgun blasts of tightly packed canister flayed the sands creating twin dust clouds shrieks of alarm cries of pain erupted as pirates and their fell women who had clumped together for mutual comfort in the face of danger were scythed down from behind too intent on aemilia or the artillery fire from seaward skirmish line lewrie shouted stepping out in front form line cock your locks level fire trigger mechanisms clacked flints flew forward to scrape on frizzens filelike rasps pans ignited with tinny high cracks and brown bess spat out a sputtering ripple of musketry to raise even more screams more terror confusion and agony and more pirates down lewrie strode out in front as his men hastily reloaded sword in hand in the coat cocked hat with dogs vane and gold lace of a sea officer in the kings name he bellowed in a quarterdeck voice i order you to lay down your arms put up your hands and surrender even the cries of the wounded ceased for a long startled moment several of the nearest buccaneers did drop their weapons while others further on ran about like headless chickens seeking an escape then a musket shot sang past his ears like a fat bee and some desperado shouted with derision they knew they would hang iftaken and some would rather go game be slain than face the noose take em lads them or us mister parham fire lewrie yelled stepping back as several more shots rang out defiance they had their chance the boatguns lashed out again lewries muskets came back up and locks were cocked the barrels leveled and fired at em alacrities lewrie called waving his sword over his head to spur them on and drawing his first of four pistols come on take the boats they surged forward at a shambling trot in the deep sand going for the luggers first to deprive the raiders of an escape by water to the beached longboats where they could kneel and fire aemilias take cover and shoot alacrities with me you want to escape he thought grimlywant your boats hey then come and take em from us you bastards the pirates did come spurred by desperation without their boats they were nothingcrippled sailors no matter how they had besmirched the noble calling of the sea but they had to come across the bodies of their dead from the boatguns lashings over whimpering and shattered wounded so it was not a daring neckornothing charge blades clashed as lewrie and his seamen met them some pistols popped and whitefaced men shouted in each others faces to fan alight their flagging courage they met and merged and swirled in melee but when bayonets jabbed when muskets swung or buttstroked when boarding pikes lanced wicked points forward and when navy hands went into the fearsome full cutlass drill shoulder to shoulder there was nothing in the world that could stand before them right foot stamp downward slash left foot backward slash advance and balance motion stamp and slash slash and advance alan crossed blades with a coppery skinned man with long and greasy hair bare but for tootight breeches and a flowered waistcoat and sash his heavy cutlass rang on alans hanger all the way up his arm he drew back to slash and alan lunged low giving him eight inches of steel in the belly he moved right to face another foe armed with cutlass and dagger this one alan shot in the chest a third came at him a black armed with an ornate smallsword which he poked with inexpertly like a spear point no swordsman alan noteda slavey just out of the fields he parried slashed to his right shying him flying cutover to reengage steel against steel a ringing double parry to force him high to open his guard so he could raise a foot and kick him in the balls the man doubled over dropping his sword and alan chopped down into his neck and shoulder then trampled over him a seaman following put a pike into the fellows stomach to finish him off madre de dios a skinny little fellow paled as alan advanced on him with gore sliming his threatening blade he turned to run and the pikeman behind sprinted forward shouldering alan out of the way and jabbing the fellow through the kidneys lewrie drew a deep breath and pulled out another loaded pistol while he had time his hands shaking too hard to stuff the empty one into a coat pocket he let it drop to the sand to retrieve later more pirates were throwing down their weapons those wounded and unable to fight longer those who had given up all hope of escape they threw themselves on their knees or curled up in fetal positions waiting death or capture john canoe trotted past a huge west indian seaman whod taken his name for the manner hed escaped his former owners years before he engaged one of the few pirates who still had fight in him a man as big as himself with a thick beard john canoe battered the mans cutlass aside with easy strength then ran him through to the hilt and lifted him up off the ground to dangle and wriggle like a piked salmon keening shrilly in terror around his bloody vomit watch out canoe lewrie shouted ware left as a black woman camp follower rose up and ran at him with a carving knife to avenge her man lewrie skipped to his left for a clear shot took careful aim and bowled the howling harpy over from a dead run with a caliber ball in the chest to skid bawling and writhing at canoes bare feet ya silly woman ya who canoe cursed her as he dropped her dying man on top of her heah be ya whi mon lovah bitch wot kine o fool ya be ya fock de ones dot whipt ya gahh then he turned to lewrie and gave him a sudden radiant smile ah thankee berry moch capum sah those freebooters who still hoped for escape had by then retreated into the cave at the top of the beach and were sniping at the sailors take cover up here lads lewrie shouted behind these boxes and chests shoot slow and steady to keep em busy mister odrado si senhor capitan the portuguese bosuns mate panted coming to his side weary with the effort expended on killinground up the whole prisoners and put em at the base of that ledge down the beach tell off ten of the aemilias to guard em i want em searched close for weapons mind dont let any more of the lads take hurt

with muskets just in case and scale up the goat path yonder to the headland to signal alacrity to cease fire lewrie ordered as a broadside of five rounds warbled in short canoe aye aye sah go tell

then row out to the schooner and take her find papers if you can to see who she belonged to aye aye sir warwick nodded then trotted off lewrie wiped his blade clean of gore and sheathed it then took out his pocket watch amazingly everything had happened in a brutal seven minutes he turned to look down the beach it was a horrible litter he beheld the dead spilled like so many isolated heaps of old clothes some wounded gasping and choking on blood writhing or twisting in pain and clawing at their hurts thankfully damned few of em were navy he recognized only three royal navy men he considered dead and perhaps eight being tended by the luggers parham and his gun crew came lumbering along the hardpacked sand where the going was easier for the small but heavy twopounder on its smallwheeled carriage they were half dragging it with help from cony and his countrylad marksmen now that they had run out of targets to snipe at sir sir a sailor called from the firing line behind the crates of looted goods white flag sir think theyre strikin a tall man in gaudy but bedraggled finery appeared in the cave mouth waving a white rag spitted upon his smallsword cease fire lewrie ordered he walked forward up past the crates into plain view and trudged perhaps ten more yards through the deep sands do you surrender he asked wanna talk navy the filthy rogue in stolen silks and satins rejoined with a maddening calm an who might ye be im askin lieutenant alan lewrie royal navy captain of his britannic majestys sloop alacrity he snapped compliments tye on a neat bit o business this fine mornin

parham he muttered in an outraged snarl aim high for the roof of the cave just inside the entrance and stand ready but sir i gave you an order midshipman parham aye aye sir parham replied meekly ready

up here bound si capitan odrado replied puzzled aye aye lewrie strode back up the beach farther than before and just a bit off to one side of the mouth of the cave he drew one of his dragoon pistols checked the priming and pulled it to halfcock hoy doyle he shouted ahoy the cave ah yez made up yer mind ye have squires son doyle japed as he appeared with his lying flag of truce on his sword once

laid it against the kneeling scoundrels ear i aint foolin squires son the pirate leader snarled at him pressing the swords point deeper drawing a trickle of blood and a muffled wheedling scream from the tormented girl neither am i lewrie told him and pulled the trigger on the pistol and shot the kneeling pirates head apart like a melon nombre de dio odrado croaked crossing himself fetch up another prisoner mister odrado lewrie instructed trying to keep his bile down as he turned to blow the remaining powder embers from the priming pan and reload that for me jesus and mary ye doyle blanched then recovered his bluster i swear tchrist this bitch is dead he began to stab her through the throat she fainted dead away trade lives with me will you lewrie scoffed i kill one you kill one

throw down your arms and come out of there youre dead now damn your eyes the two buccaneers holding their squealing struggling captives were just as appalled as anyone else on the beach and peered around their prisoners to gawk at one of their comrades shot to flinders god save me lewrie prayed now cony two shots rapped out as lewrie ducked to the side and drew one of his pistols one light crack from the caliber fusil musket an accurate weapon for a muzzleloader and the deeper report of a breechloading ferguson which in an age where brown bess couldnt hit a man in the chest at sixty yards could reach out flat and true to one pirate gave out a high scream as he was hit in the temple the other grunted as he was plumbed right between the eyes abajo senoras lewrie screamed down ladies get down the women had the sense to drop to their knees but began to scramble and claw away from the terror away from the cave mouth on their knees and bound wrists scraping over the rocks despite lewries pleas shit fire mister parham fire the boatgun chuffed and there was a howl over his head as the canister spread with enough wind to take off his hat the roof of the cave sparkled and smoked just inside the entrance shelf profligate as a royal fireworks show then the cave sang with winnings and keenings as the musket balls caromed and ricocheted inside to a satanic chorus of screams lewrie rose from his protective squat as the pirate doyle did took aim at the amazed man and fired doyle grunted with the impact and went over backwards lifted off his feet by the heavy ball and dropped out of sight but for his heels drumming on the shale come on lads up and at em lewrie called drawing his sword he stepped up the short slope of rock to peer inside as his men came thundering up to join him there was no fight left in them those pirates who had lived through that lead sleeting lewrie knelt by doyle who was gutshot and going fast jesus an mary wot kind o kings officer they givin commissions tnow damn ye doyle panted wincing with agony yer not supposed tdo you surrender to me now you bastard lewrie grinned devil take ye he groaned and sank back no the devil take you billy bones lewrie spat i just wish id had the complete pleasure of watching you swing v expulsis piratis restituta commercia he expelled the pirates and restored commerce former national motto of the bahamas chapter alan lewrie was jealous it was a novel experience for him this gnawing apprehension instead of the cutandthrust quickly done sort of rivalrous jealousy of his bachelorhood where the prize was discarded once gained and the only thing that mattered was outwitting ones rivals but now with the prize becoming ever dearer to him and with the evidence clear after his long enforced separation from caroline he was fearful that jealousy and its attendant alarums would be a permanent way of life one never even hinted at in those tales of happilyeverafter one read of in fiction for the characters of the smugly moral richardsons novels or even the risque rogues of a fielding book there was always a happy ending where two souls after much bother of course share a life of indolent bliss together with nary a cross word nary a threat once the principal villain has been dispatched spooning and bussing from morning til night in blessed mutual agreement and in such sweetly disposed and addlepated disconnection with the rest of the scurvy world that it could go hang as long as the happy couple got their tea water the right temperature and nothing more distressful than burned toast ever seemed to plague them from that moment on then of course alan lewrie grumped moodily theres the real world and youre bloody welcome to it all those writers fielding richardson even bloody smollett were a tribe of debollocked clueless hopeful bachelors it had begun soon after his return to nassau harbour to a heros welcome as dizzying as a conquering roman general might have received the eightday wonder with manacled pirates as his captives to parade under the yoke as a spectacle in his triumphthe spanish ladies he had freed were greeted and swooned over in the better salons in nassau society as the epitomes of romantic tales in which the virtuous young maiden is rescued by an english knight from the dragons very mouth and alan had been feted as their champion much like a modernday st george until of course the town had learned that those poor piteous senoritas had not done all a plucky english girl would have under the circumstances that they had not gamely spurned their captors base designs as heroines in fiction seemed to do when taken by turks and slung into the sultans harem their social stock fell considerably and with a great sigh of relief and many muttered imprecations such as what may one expect theyre only dagos and blood will tell they were hustled off for cuba to complete their voyage quicker than one could say knife so rude fact could not contradict highflown popular sentiment as that fame faded for alan the trial which followed restored him to center stage which trial resulted in a hanging fair as gay and cockawhoop as any hed ever seen at tyburn and the trial had kept alacrity in harbor for weeks so testimony could be taken which had coincided with the height of the hurricane season so alacrity ended up swinging at her anchors even longer which enforced idleness was simply the nuts to alan for he could spend nights ashore with caroline in their snug little home and enjoy the fruits of his variant labors and a heros proper welcome deliriously happy as he felt it was then that he began to see portents which disturbed him it rankled him when officers from the garrison or fort montagu down the eastern road halted their rides together to tip their hats to her and converse a tad too gallantly for his liking when he and caroline went to town to shop or accept an invitation gentlemen came up to them to exchange pleasantries and gossip from past social gatherings would they go to tea to ecarti a drum rout or ball or a cool evening salon there would be fashionable young sprogs sidling up to her to discuss people and topics of which he was ignorant at dances he would end up grinding his teeth by the punch bowl as caroline was surrounded by hopeful blades who begged just the one dance or come nigh on snapping his neck to keep an eye on her as he performed his social obligations to dance with the stout clumsy or frippish matrons and their pimply runnynosed daughters in his absence caroline had developed social relations with many loyalist families and a fair number of oldtime bahamians as well she had also struck up a close friendship with betty mustin commander benjamin rodgers kept mutton who was no shrinking violet when it came to accepting invitations she and caroline went coaching together riding horseback as an almost inseparable pair shopped and visited back and forth as dear as catercousins and made the social rounds together in company with the much older peyton and heloise boudreau their landlords along as chaperones innocent as it sounded lewrie thought betty mustin just a bit fly and a disturbing influence perhaps it was all innocent socializing he thought but then he could remember being cockofthecompany and buckofthefirsthead in such circumstances too in his bachelor days when he had preyed upon the loneliness of abandoned young matrons with an itch to scratch and shammed being a robin goodfellow until theyd come around to his way of thinking it gave him pause it did giving him pause too was his reticence to believe that such deceit had entered his married life or to bring up the ugly subject what could he say that would not make him look like a foolish cully where could he draw a line without shaming her how was a fellow to order some simpering young toad to sheer off and leave his wife alone in future he was even fretful to mention it to her in private if her tempestuous reactions to their first disagreement were anything to go by that had occurred about a week after his return after the dew was off the rose so to speak uhm caroline he had asked having regarded their paintings and sketches on the restfully pale tan walls of their house and found one missing wheres that oil o mine the large one with the women taking their baths that nude harem scene shed frowned though fondly alan really whatever could you have been thinking of to purchase it it was taking up space and i could not hang it anywhere decent people might see it i sold it sold it hed goggled but i rather fancied traded it really shed laughed quite matteroffactly i obtained yon sunset over nassau harbour there a local artist did it augustus hedley it has such lovely ships in it and the colors are quite spectacular do you not think as near to any as ever i did see on our voyage here whenever i gaze upon it it reminds me of our honeymoon aboard alacrity and makes me blissful you can look out the door and see sunset over nassau harbour and all the ships you wish anytime you bloody well please alan had groused why not a painting of a gashbucket then ifyou want to be reminded of the voyage or the townsleys at table pretty much the same really horrid feeders they were and spewers we wont always live in nassau alan she had responded with a hug and sweet reason and then we will wish a memento of our time here i quite like it dont you damned ships arent even rigged proper damme if they aint whos this hedley then the funny little fellow in the yellow ditto suits we met him at the dance last week hes very talented he does everyone who is anyones portraits people say hes good as any in the royal academy well i hope he does noses better than he does masts or hes overcharging alan had laughed then must art depict reality so closely one could use it as an illustration in your falconers marine dictionary shed asked him rather sharply ominously there was a tiny vertical line of threat between her lovely brows a line he could not recall seeing before hed sensed an argument and had submitted humphing into silence the real explosion had come later after supper as they sat on their breezeway savoring sundown and a postprandial brandy alan had speculated to his cost which particular shade of green the house was now painted and the boudreau house up the drive hed allowed easily his feet extended slumped down in an unpadded wooden chair caroline had had a local carpenter construct pink as cooked salmon a bit offputting i must say whatever happened to white cream or gray like a london row house all these pinks and blues and all and pale mint green she had inquired very coolly looks as if they could get nothing but castoff paints sent here hed blathered on attempting to be amusing that pink must be a mix of ships bottompaint white stuff and red stuff stirred up and slathered on same as alacrityd get afore recoppering i would have thought long as you were painting and they were youd have put your head together with heloise and come up with a match i chose this mint green to make our house appear different alan she had replied archly not an extension the gatehouse or coachhouse to theirs any longer as long as we live in it well it was though wasnt it dear and will be again so that no one would come riding by see it and wonder if it is still occupied by the head groom or their slave overseer really alan you dont like it well i didnt say that look at all ive accomplished shed demanded look at all ive done to make a home for us the garden out back the flowers the painting and carpentry work and the is there nought i have done that does meet with your approval then must you cavil or carp and and sneer at every decision i made in your absence caroline hed wilted at her first tears i swear alan you use me ill as shed wept brokenly just short of bawling fit to bust as so many b bears and he had had to pursue her beg at their locked bedchamber door then once hed at last gained entry had had to cosset her to dandle kiss and spoon her to calm her and confess what a total ass he was to be so unappreciative and what a treasure she was so clever and resourceful and how pleased he was with things in the main which had ended their first fight that and the boisterous and healing lovemaking which had followed their first squall had been weathered he dreaded a second god amercy alan thought she has done a lot in a little over four months with all her endeavors whod have time for an affair i ask you the house was painted inside and out and the wood trim shiny with white enamel against the interiors pale sandy tan or the exteriors light mint green the roof had been patched with new shakes and tarred proof against tempestuous wind and rain their few carpets were clean his dark blue settee and wing chairs were ensconced as a group at one end of the parlor area hers had been recovered with yellow and floral chintz for another conversational grouping his old table and chairs made a gaming area whilst her table eight chairs and the sideboard and cupboard were their dining facilities and their few precious silver or silverplate candlesticks serving trays and tea things gleamed on display alongside the locking caddy for tea sugar coffee and chocolate the floors were spotless the drapes new and sewn by carolines hands their few paintings minus his harem scene looked grand as government house his portrait hed commissioned in in uniform some chiswick forebears his granny lewrie her favorite pastoral or hunt scenes and the seabattle granny lewriedbought him at ranelagh gardens and his anonymous grand tour sketches shed stored away the heavy velvet bed curtains and replaced them with light gauzy draperies to ward off insectsthose that the ubiquitous lizards did not eat rather noisily in the night on top of that shed camphored every upright clothes closet or drawer lined everything with paperthin cedar strips kept the house in bristolfashion with just one maidofallwork housekeeper who came by the day a free black woman named wyonnie and not content with household economies she had put in a vegetable garden had tilled it with the help of wyonnies husband ind her aged father and his equally aged mule watered it tended it weeded it to the amazement of nassaus white society who thought her youthfully eccentric and to the slackjawed stupefaction of the free blacks who had never before beheld a white woman of even the least means do a lick of work if a slave could not be put to it first not content with a goodly crop of victuals such as corn beans pigeon peas tomatoes and salad greens caroline heloise and betty had ridden all over new providence seeking flora to plant about the house to screen the back lot from the main house and to beautify it the pale green house was now awash in an informal lush jungle there were tamarinds and acacia torch ginger and jumpupandkissme little treeoflife bushes with indigo flowers frangipani or red jasmine cascarillas bright yellow elder both red and purple bougainvillea vines on trellises framing the porches and the dogrun there were flamboyants with blooms as big as birdbaths poinsettias and poincianas bird of paradise angels trumpet and flamingo flowers in gaudy profusion there were replanted palmettos for a hedge and young saplings in tubskeylime and lemon trees sapodillas soursops and guavas candlewoods and sea grapes and braving the forgelike heat of the kitchen in high summer a spotless kitchen caroline had put up exotic new fruit preserves in stone crocks an impressive selection was now ranked row upon row in the pantry and that was on top of her cider vinegars her dried and candied preserve slices her considering all she had accomplished in so little time at so little cost was daunting ive the handsomest sweetest cleverest and god rot your soul uncle phineas the most economical young wife on the face of this earth alan concluded so why do feel like harry embleton chapter so who is this finney then alan asked attempting to sound casual about it as he emerged from the water and sat down on the hard sand just above the lapping wavelets john finney peyton boudreau replied opening one lazy eye from a doze quite the hero hereabouts dont ye know haw haw a damned richun too striking fellow alan allowed as he toweled down from a dip in waistdeep water no more most sailors could not swim and alan was proof of that particular truism aye he is the elder man agreed pity hes so low is he alan inquired relishing this dirt on the suitor he feared the most hed remet the artist augustus hedley and found him to be a simpering mincing dandyprat lap dog to the nassau ladies a flagrant molly said to be exiled on remittance by his family so his predilections would not harm their reputation most of the others had sheered off once alan was back but finney dublin bogtrotter peyton boudreau snickered a product of the stews went for a sailor young and drifted out here the lord be praised hes a bay street merchant now though owns ships has the best imported slaves doesnt deal with the dagos in hispaniola he sends vessels to africa for black ivory imported in prime condition too stead of the usual third lost fancy goods from all over the latest fashions all the delicacies which make life tolerable runs packets from the continent in all seasons hang the winter gales or hurricanes dont see how he manages that but he does ah think ill go back in and dip meself lewrie watched the elegant older man rise and pad into the sea to flop on his belly and paddle about and wondered how he could gain more information about finney without looking foolish or concernedthey were on a maroon on hog island on the whitesand beach on the norwest shore it was a popular amusement in the bahamas to sail out to a deserted cay with food and guzzle set up a camp with furniture cooking utensils and perhaps a pavilion and go saltwater bathing in total privacy some even spent an entire day and a night though most returned at dusk the boudreaus were great devotees of it and had suggested that alan and caroline with betty mustin along too might enjoy the excursion caroline betty and the older but still impressive heloise were down the beach a way cavorting in the water and laughing and giggling gay as so many ducklings they had gone into the boat in old sack gowns without stays or underpinnings with only one underskirt straw hats and parasols their oldest cracked shoes cotton stockings and towels were the thing for the ladies those and a single voluminous shift of light cotton or muslin to drape themselves in between dunkings at present from what little alan could see they were bathing nude or with a short chemise at best alan rose and strode back into the water for more information the december sunshine almost kind for once to his back and shoulders after hurricane season ended around the first of november the bahamas were cooled by northerly or westerly winds the daytime temperatures never soared much above mild and the nights got downright coolish if a brisk breeze was blowing off the ocean but never shivering cold he waded out to chestdeep and bobbed about in the ginclear water slightly tinged pale turquoise ducking his head now and again you said he was a hero alan asked once peyton had paddled near enough the older man stood in the water and swiped his shortcut hair dry who finney peyton asked wiggling an ear clear of water yes what did he do privateer sir peyton smiled a most successful privateer ended up with a flotilla of his own in these waters spanish french rebels no vessel was safe from him tis bruited about he took over two hundred thousand pounds sterling in prize money but what sealed his repute was when the spanish took nassau in just before the revolution ended you know of col andrew deveaux the loyalist soldier from im quite proud to say dear south carolina of my birth ive heard of him well he determined upon an expedition to retake nassau all on his own peyton bragged on his former neighbor sailed a scratch militia here april of with what weapons they could come up with tagragandbobtail effort with no help from the crown you see well finney threw in with him brought a brace of his privateers tricked out as ships of war they rowed their socalled troops ashore and landed them then they had those few men lay down in the boats and rowed back out looking empty to supposedly embark another batch kept it up until the dons figured they were hopelessly outnumbered and they threw it up as a bad bargain dyou see haw haw quite a stunt and with not men all told a clever fellow too this finney alan smiled well twas more andrews idea than finneys of course our calico jack is shrewd and ambitious but i doubt hed have thought of it on his own dont you know or cared much one way or tother if the spanish held nassau another year hed have made more profit from taking their ships whilst his store sold them victuals and wine calico jack alan grinned with mirth and how did he come by that charming sobriquet wasnt there a calico jack rackham a pirate in these waters long ago there was peyton sneered aristocratically finney came by his by the tradesmans entrance so to speak and more prosaic more common haw haw peyton boudreau and his wife heloise were splendid people in the main though given to languid highly cultured and snobbish aloof airs of fallen huguenot and charleston low country nobility no matter that their estate had fallen since leaving fabled south carolina they were still accounted regal pluses to nassau society and told damned juicy gossip with such wit and relish wasnt always rich yknow peyton continued had but the one packet ship and a usedgoods chandlery past east hill street almost in overhill inn chandlery an allnations dram shop brokered whores out of there too by all accounts sold slopgoods and shoddy not fit for anyone but slaves and the idle poor little of this then a little of that to show a profit had mongers out with drays hawking his castoffs like ragpickers but he did the best of his business in calico and nankeen cloth for use on the plantings to dress slave gangs condemned saltmeats weevily flour gin rum and ratafia brandy that sort of hard bargain handtomouth trade peyton dismissed raising a cultured eyebrow significantly then in when the revolution broke out everything changed for him overnight the admiralty court gave him a letter of marque to turn privateer and the next thing anyone knew he was teatrade nabobrich a most impressive feat alan had to admit though it galled for a man who started out illiterate in the gutter boudreau sniffed toploftily by the time heloise and i got here in when the crown abandoned charleston he was strutting golden as an ottoman sultan with that big snips chandlery his fancygoods shops on bay street and half a dozen privateers flying his house flag but dont yknow peyton snickered the brats in the streets still tailed after him chanting his cant calico calico wholl buy my calico tis jack jack the calico man haw haw oh poor bastard lewrie smiled relishing what chagrin that would have caused the handsome finney then of course peyton sobered that was before he killed three men in duels for ragging him or sneering at him and after he and andrew deveaux retook nassau he became a veritable social lion for a time mind peyton chuckled meanly only for a time one may not turn a sows ear into a silk purse after all for all his fame and his money hes still beautrap and too ill mannered for most decent people no manners at all though hes said to work hard at gaining some small measure of refinement built his fine town house hired dancingmasters tutors in elocution only the best tailors and such moik me a foin gennulmun damn yuz oyes he told em hey peyton scoffed cruelly imitating a bogtrotters brogue one may gild dried dung but all one has to show for it is goldplated shit after all and hes still tight with his old chums from overhill niggers scoundrels shiftless whites and whores pickpockets cutthroats and such and he is irish when you come right down to it he seems welcome in everyones salon though alan commented and people seem to accept his invitations willingly enough thats the fly nature of bahamian society peyton guffawed how few of them arose from the better classes in charleston in london it goes without saying and i suspect even in his native dublin in the better circles john finneyd still not be admitted but to the tradesmans entrance theres damned few refined folkd set foot inside his door we do not nor do those who aspire to true civility ever invite him in like manner he has never seen my parlor our salon sir nor shall he peyton declaimed grandly then cocked his grizzled head to peer closely at alan and why this sudden interest young sir he has irked me by showing an undue interest in caroline ah i see peyton drawled out yes she did once receive an invitation to some affair he was hosting thankfully she told us of it before she responded and we were able to discover to her what one may mention in polite company of his background which discovery dissuaded her from attending god be praised truly alan flushed embarrassed that the truth was out sir alan peyton said kindly heloise and i are that taken with your lovely caroline she is a most handsome girl and a most intelligent and discerning one in addition to her sweet and modest nature since you and she became our tenants she has been like one of our own daughters to us she most sensibly inquired of us the usual things where best to shop where best for bargains and such and more importantly which places best avoided and which people to avoid so no breath of scandal ever taints your good name or soils her dare i say immaculate repute unlike some i could name to you yet he seems to be everywhere we go sir alan complained and he is so gracelessly impertinent and persistent you may not avoid him totally since our society here is so small a circle even with the influx of loyalists by the hundreds peyton counseled finney rose from the gutter by dint of dogged and slavish persistence so one would suppose he believes anything will come to him if he but perseveres still he knows his place deny it though he will if he does persist mister boudreau ill have to call him out for it alan frowned lord no alan i beg you the older man shuddered do not duel him hes a crack shot and chopping fair with a sword so am i sir alan insisted then blurted out his fears in spite of his best intentions if not finney then one of the other sparks who flock round her like so many importunate he tangled his tongue on his bile ah the rest are but amusing themselves playing the gallant and serving jacksauce peyton dismissed with a chuckle lookee here young sir duck your head and cool your blood and ill tell you a tale thatll set your unease to rest dammef i wont lewrie ducked and came up blowing and snorting when heloise and i were first wed peyton boudreau began his tale with a grin of reverie i was that jealous of her thats the curse one takes upon oneself when one weds an incredibly lovely and desirable lady as you did i could not abide the attention all of her old beaus showed her nor begrudge her time or her laughter they took from me now had she been nothing but handsomewith no bottom or sense filled with frippishness and flirtations or more so than charleston society permitted young ladies id have slain a few of the bastards or died because of it and lost our last twenty years of wedded bliss mind you peyton cautioned tapping his nose and winking it aint all custard and cream no paradise on silver plate no marriage is new marriages even less so before one becomes accustomed but women are not the emptyheaded fragile and vulnerable vessels not as false a tribe as the martext reverends tell us youve a levelheaded lady lad have some faith in her good judgment in her sense of propriety carolines not the sort to do anything or allow anything or anyone to give you pause tis all in your head the more one loves the more intruders seem threatening and believe this when i relate it to you the girl loves you with a singleminded devotion i could toast bread on your name or tales about you form half her waking conversation i doubt she could sew a hem in a drape without thinking of how you would approve of it thankee mister boudreau sir alan sagged in some measure of relief tis gratifying to hear but what dissuaded you from dueling those former rivals of your wife a long talk with a sage old uncle of mine much like this and did it help you sir not immediately young sir peyton allowed with a rueful grin that came gradual as does wisdom but i did take a long look at it and discovered that heloise would allow no gallantries or importunate addresses beyond a very firm boundary and would give the rogues who crossed that boundary the cutdirect the next time she saw them i learned to trust her a hard lesson ill admit but once learned i became even fonder of her than ever before fortunately for you though sir alan sighed you had none to deal with but gentlemen who could take a hint you had no finney dogging your heloise watch and see if your caroline cannot put even a thickskull irish rogue in his place if he persists peyton laughed and to the galling scorn even of bahamian society haw haw trust her to handle herself alan and i will give you assurance that heloise and i will continue to chaperone and advise her so you will have nought to give you worry when you sail the next time i may be dense as bloody marble most of the time alan thought but even i can recognize good sense when i trip over it i will remember that sir and be damned grateful to you and your good lady for it alan enthused at last taking boudreaus hand and pumping it warmly i feared to leave her in portsmouth without someone to count on im happy to have found good friends here that we may both trust you have indeed young sir peyton smiled you have well all this sun has me parched theres a bottle of ale with my name ont thatd go down nice dammef i aint a touch peckish too you your servant and mine have something succulent on the boil to tempt me i must allow sir alan said wading ashore in a ragged set of breeches to towel off and don a patched old shirt without sleeves conch chowder the very thing peyton exclaimed lobsters thick as your arm let us join the ladies i see theyve come ashore like so many fair daughters of neptune haw haw the lovely heloise the superbly handsome and lissome caroline the bounteous charming betty poor chick he sobered sir alan asked as they trudged along the hardpacked sand bettys a sweetun near as sweet as your caroline dyou see a trifle headlong in her enthusiasms and her affections though to her cost a bit too much the hearty coquette but she has bottom peyton assayed if not the sense god promised a titmouse i find her a bit forward and frippish alan said not the best company for caroline as a constant companion that is in point of fact tis your caroline whos been very good for betty boudreau countered family scattered helltobreakfast one side rebel tother tory her fathers over on great abaco farming and timbering she ran away with that irresponsible rodgers and let him set her up here as his hired doxy for lovel had she a man who would give her a decent promise of marriage had she some sense of security in his affection well shed be happy as a kitten in the cream pot but hes a slender reed is benjamin rodgers so shes allowed certain young rogues and corinthians address her and squire her about on rides at balls and such to fill his absences to make him pay more attention to her when he is in port and we both know that rodgers sort of rakehell never responds to such ploys with anything other than scorn hed simply find another and turf her out to fall further i do know that sort of rakehell alan thought wryly damned well do i know me of old but with caroline and her eminent good sense to guide her shes mending her ways peyton allowed even turned her hands now and again to gardening and household economies though i fear shell never be a tenth part the wonder your lady isno dont begrudge caroline her friend alan heloise and i quite like her just wish she had a better man one she could trust one whod show her the sort of real affection and attention she craves do you not know some other naval officers who might wish to meet an attractive young lady alan that sobersided lieutenant of yours ballard i doubt he wishes to marry so early in his career sir well if not marriage she could be mistress to a better fellow than commander rodgers peyton suggested she could have someone decent to pine for when hes away she has some means to keep herself so she wouldnt be a burden on a junior officers purse do give it a thought heloise and i would appreciate it i shall sir act more pleasantly disposed towards betty too will you have i not been pleasant sir alan inquired a little irked that peyton boudreau once he had gotten the slightest status as his and carolines dutch uncle was now ready to play avuncular to the hilt damme you wish to adopt us alan thought play my fathers replacement youll have to stand me an hundred guineas a year i have seen some snippishness alan the older man shrugged after all shes not calico jack for gods sake caroline dotes on her if you trust carolines good sense and discernment surely you can be accepting betty needs good friends worth having aye i suppose so mister boudreau alan found himself agreeing i suppose i may even come to tolerate calico jack finney if i follow your advice and allow caroline to pull him up short well you wont see much of him now the trials evidence is common knowledge peyton assured him as they neared the campsite lying doggo for awhile im certain now word is out your pirate leader was billy bones doyle might be in mourning fars i know haw haw they were compatriots alan started oh billy doyle was a mate of his long before the war and master of one of his privateers boudreau replied breezily as if it were no matter after the war finney sold off half his ships and got replacements more suited for trade paid half his men off too gave doyle title to a schooner in gratitude along with ten thousand pounds sterling profit a splendid gesture doyle was along with finney and deveaux on the expedition to retake new providence dont yknow he no sir i did not know that it is news to me lewrie said and no one commented upon the connection no one even wondered and why should they after they parted company a year ago boudreau sniffed with bahamian society riddled as it is with former pirates and privateers former cutthroats and merchants greedy as highwaymen whats one more knave with a scandal amazing lewrie goggled oh doyle and finney were thick as thieves at one time haw haw thick as thieves do ysee sir i would suppose he dropped him once hed wasted his money and his chances to better himself quite the cockofthecompany for awhile was billy bones but he spent it all on drink and whores on flash clothes and gay amusements and some disastrous investments whenever he drew a sober breath now i ask you how may a man lose his last farthing in a market so brisk as the bahamas were he not a total fool sir made a sorry surly besotted spectacle of himself in the end and sailed off to god knew where to escape his creditors for which respite the good people of nassau thanked god i tell you boudreau related with glee just goes to prove the lower orders havent the wherewithal to improve their lot to emulate their betters no matter that the opportunity to do so falls from on high like manna and is beaconed by a burning bush haw haw so the schooner i captured at conch bar wasnt a recent prize hed taken lewrie realized she was the one finney gave him very likely indeed bound to come to a bad end that sort illiterate guttersnipes and mongrels no matter how high they assay to rise they always revert to their sorry roots when they fall upon hard times back to the criminal habits they learned in their stews and to be rewarded for criminality in wartime given stamps of approval letters of marque and praised for looting enemy ships tosh i say sir what else may one expect i ask you or become a royal governor like morgan or woodes rogers alan commented with a wry grin they both sailed under the jolly roger mister boudreau well they were successful pirates boudreau dismissed with a leer and turned on their own kind in the end ah ladies may we join you for our repast now youre decent haw haw chapter alacrity would be sailing soon and lewrie needed to replenish his personal stores for his pantry and wine cabinet leaving caroline after breakfast he borrowed a horse and cantered to town and out of prurient curiosity he wandered into finneys there was an entire row of shops for clothing for shoes for ladies fashions and fabrics with the latest miniature gowns on the porcelain dolls sent from paris and london depicting the height of that seasons styles and colors there were cheese shops spirits stores awash in wines brandies harsh whiskeys gins and liqueurs of a dozen nations finney had furniture for sale wallpapers and chintz for drapes or recovering kitchen wares from america and home fine china and silver services glassware from utilitarian to finest crystal pieces one entire block of bay street on the southern side and around the corner of market street for half of another block was his socalled mart his commercial fiefdom though he rued giving finney any of his trade or any of his money he did find good prices on quality merchandise and ended up purchasing stationery and ink various cheeses and meat sauces and several interesting books to fill his solitary hours some with the pages already cut by a previous owner though offered as new alan opened one of the books and found it dogeared on several pages it was a recent english translation of a french novel he had heard about les liaisons dangereuses by some frog scribbler named de laclos the dogeared pages contained scenes of a most pleasing and salacious nature which made alan smile even as he winced at the chalkedon price of six shillings thumbing further through it he discovered an inscription in the frontispiece from daniel to his scamp of a brother nathan may this inspire you aboard matilda on your next voyage may her new st mate have similar joy of the swarthy bahamian ladies wonder if he did alan thought with amusement and did he have to sell it to pay for the mercury cure to rid himself of the pox those bahamian ladies gave him he decided to buy it and added it to the pile on the counter that should be all here alan said to the young clerk who was following him about keeping a running total from store to store might have a peek at this before you leave captain sir the young man suggested the very latest scientific device to predict the tropic storm hang this on your bulkhead belowdecks and youll have all the warning a sailing man would ever need how does it work alan asked looking at a bulbous glass flask with a tall narrow sealed neck inside the flask was a blue liquid of some kind it was brassbound to a wooden plaque the better the weather the more of the liquid will gather at the bulbend on the bottom sir the clerk told him but when there is a storm brewing why twill soar up the neck the worse the storm tobe the higher will it go sir tis said sir he confided with an air of secrecy that the admiralty will be requiring every one of their ships to be equipped with one soon weve shown one on display over tthe ships chandlery all this past year and tis been a wonder to all whove seen it for how accurately it reflected the weather it has and only twenty guineas sir should the admiralty require it then let them buy it for me alan scoffed lets go select some wines very good captain sir the spirits shop was set up much like a coffeehouse or an inns public room with tables and chairs the walls were lined with barrels and wooden cases of bottles with a combination counter and bar at the rear well damme alan was forced to exclaim as he espied an oil painting over the counter it was his harem scene that caroline had traded off to the life there were the same buxom darlings on the same draped couches with a slender lass featured in the foreground standing to be toweled after her bath the one who somuchresembled his first whore in covent garden the infamously handsome change court betty in all her bare splendor inspiring aint it sir the clerk simpered here davie the captain would like to sample some wines this day aye sir the vendor smiled wiping his hands on his apron as he came from behind his counter pray have a seat sir and take yer ease tell us yer wants sir an well trot em out for yer to select those as best suits yer palate lewrie took a seat and removed his cocked hat lets begin on port ill need one case going back tsea are we sir the vendor clucked got a fine rainwater madeira just in got a lovely nose aint it sir try a sip of that now a door in the back that led to the storerooms opened and alan paused with a sample glass to his lips as john finney emerged intent on a loose sheaf of papers he looked up spotted lewrie and smiled hesitantly then put a bold face on it and stepped forward captain lewrie the top o the mornin tya sir he lilted in an irish brogue tis delighted i am tsee you again sir and in my establishment at that finney stumbled seeming to be trying to recall a lesson in elocution to sound more english though with a hard emphasis on those breakteeth words not common to his everyday speech mister finney good morning lewrie nodded willing to sound at least affable in reply he even threw in a small grin i trust me my clerk david is satisfactory sir finney continued laying his papers down on the counter most satisfactory sir thankee lewrie rejoined god but hes an imposin bastard lewrie thought as he sipped the madeira finney stood a full six feet tall broad of shoulder and deepchested as a yearling steer he was sailordark in complexion with a full head of bright blond hair drawn back into a queue as low as his shoulder blades his face was angular and square and in his chin there was a pronounced cleft for someone whod come up from a stew he had remarkably good white teeth and penetrating sometimes mocking blue eyes with that heft he could have looked daylabourer common but he was flatstomached lean in the hips and thighs and showed a very shapely calf in his silk stockings his hands and his feet betrayed his origins though huge clumpinglong feet and hands square and thick as a bricklayers roughened by a lifetime of hard work no matter the heavy and expensive rings he now sported thatd that is the rainwater madeira david finney inquired coming to the table to pick up the bottle a pleasing and tasty selection captain lewrie not as dry as some like it quite good yes lewrie agreed though a guinea the bottle is a trifle steep mister finney we could arrange splitcases sir finney assured him pulling out a seat allow me sir thank you say four bottles or so of the rainwater and the rest made up from a lesser vintage for guests who cant predate the best ay why deprive yself o fine port just cause ya dine alone aft most o the time and is it sailin soon yll be captain lewrie he asked lapsing into brogue there was a craftiness to the set of finneys eyes at least to alans suspicious imagination and yet there was almost a pathetic eagerness too the eagerness of a seller he wondered the pandering of the outsider towards a better lewrie took a moment to sneer or that of a basically lonely man risen out of his element and trying to fit in to make contact with newcomers who didnt spurn him i have no orders at present but lewrie shrugged giving finney the same smile hed bestow upon any acquaintance weve been so long at anchor its bound to be soon davie finney said whirling on his chair david bring out last years oporto for captain lewrie to try four shilling the bottle im that sorry tsay but nigh as tasty and a grand bargain now wot ya say tthat sir mmm rather nice lewrie had to agree let us say eight of this oporto and only four of the better madeira and ill simply have to treat myself less often done finney exulted slapping the table top as if he had won a trick at ecarte now wot else will ya be desiring lewrie spent almost an hour in the wine shop with finney as bis eagertoplease host away from formal affairs the salons and dancefloors where he most likely felt strangled and out of place he proved a likable enough fellow alan had to admit as they compared voyages ports of call and past storms as sailors ever will an wuz ya niver tindia now finney had exclaimed with joy an canton too gawd twas a time a grand time i had mongst the heathens meself topman i wuz then main topmast captain then finney would catch his accent and affect his more genteel persona striving for more civil speech until his next enthusiasm which put the lilt and gaelic structure to his words again so your reckoning sir finney said at last after alan hadmade his final selection the split case of port one cask of brandy two of claret lessee one cask of bordeaux damn good st emilion thet is an tastes young f rever two cases rhenish one of hock and the odd case of cordials sherries holland gin and such lewrie saw why finney had such a scrawl for a handwriting he was a cackhand a lefthander another unpopular trait to rise above twentyfour pounds six shillings and ah the divil with it lets say twenty pound even an be square sir aint that a handsome bargain for ya now captain lewrie finney loudly decided at last that statement such an eldritch echo of billy bones doyles own words from the cave at conch bar nearly set lewries nape hairs on end bringing back his every nagging suspicion twenty it is though i fear tis at your loss sir lewrie found wit to reply without betraying the cold feartrill that took him dont go bruiting it about the town though captain lewrie finney chuckled or the restll think theyve been cheated were to have this delivered aboard alacrity tday then if you could that would be fine lewrie replied a final glass with ya then sir finney smiled reaching for a sample bottle of brandy wot yer hunters call a stirrup cup topping lewrie allowed as finney filled their glasses fine little ship you have there sir finney congratulated may i be so bold as toffer a toast now to alacrity long may she swim in safety on the kings business they clinked glasses thankee mister finney ah call me john finney cajoled or jack tis how im known best in the islands jack thankee for the thought then lewrie said restless to leave as finney became bolder damme the next i know hell name me alan old son and ill have to be pleasant to him in public or have him in for a homecooked supper brrr before you sail captain lewrie finney suggested you and your wife must attend one o my little gatherings a pleasant meal some cards a little dancing should you be able to stay later aha lewrie thought so thats your chummy game is it i heard you werent entertaining lately jack lewrie told him nor do i recall you attending anything in the last week well life goes on don does it not sir finney said eyeing lewrie sharply and the geniality leaving those blue eyes im told some of the men who were hung once worked with you lewrie was emboldened to say with a sad and sober expression of shammed sympathy and so they did sir finney told him speaking slower and choosing his words and their pronunciation more guardedly what my old gran told me is true yknow you can lead a horse to water but you cant make him drink theres some in this world will seize an opportunity to better themselves and some as wont for privateering they were a grand crew all tarryhanded and smart as paint as willing to dare as any id ever seen sir when the war ended and i paid em off i told em theyd have an honest berth with me whenever they needed it some signed on some went their own ways like doyle lewrie needled sporting a commiserating smile aye like william finney sighed looking wistful for what might have been me my bosun at one time met him lord thirteen year ago when we were topmen on a liverpool blackbirder on the middle passage i made third mate he made bosuns mate he was the grandest seaman of all but not a thinker god have mercy you know sailors captain lewrie they live from shilling to shilling what would you find of yer fellow men from one of yer old ships were ya all to get tgither who among emd prospered and who among emd sunk the fleet cant afford tbe picky when it needs seamen an i couldnt turn me nose up at the lads as signed aboard with me and when ya get right down to it finney shrugged with a sad grin ya cant be yer brothers keeper a manll go his own way divil a try ya make tredeem him quite so lewrie had to agree with the sentiment and the sense of what finney said well i must take my leave sir thank you for a most enjoyable morning and a most pleasing reckoning wotiver yer needs think o finneys first the man insisted as they rose from the table theres no finer selection an for you and your fine wife captain lewrie therell always be some specials held back at the same pleasin prices break me though they might i shall keep that ever in mind mister finney lewrie said you tell yer missus ttry us first stead o misicks or friths finney rattled on as he walked him toward the door those stores on shirley streetd sell ratty his own pelt charge extra for a good fit an im niver knowin twas skinned soon as he entered their doors i shall tell her that sir dobe planters from santo domingo lime fertilizers jack finney rhapsodized about his merchandise the latestfashions just about anything the new homemaker needs for a burgeoning house for the ball for good day sir lewrie beamed offering his hand which jack finney took and pumped vigorously and once again thankee ive a drum planned for saturday sir finney announced of a sudden i would be honored should you and mistress lewrie be able to attend late afternoons cool standup buffet champagne ah i fear not lewrie replied though they had no current plans for the weekend should alacrity still be in port we will dine some guests in on saturday alan lied easily theres a scheme afoot to introduce my first officer lieutenant ballard to a young lady of our acquaintance and see how they progress over cards and music a fearsome business but let a young wife see others unattached and he concluded making a face and faking a shiver some other time would be more convenient perhaps some other time then sir finney replied with a shrug of his own finally dropping alans hand and good day to you sir and thank you for your trade do come again mind lewrie stepped out the door which david the wine clerk held for him doffed his hat in farewell once more and strode away towards his horse he undid the reins from the hitchrail and looked across the saddle towards finneys store idly as he fumbled with a stirrup finney stood just inside the stillopen door in an unguarded moment before he realized that alan had glanced back at him he was caught glaring at him from beneath blond brows beetled together with hate and when caught finney put a shadowing palm over his eyes as if the suns glare had caused it made his face bland with a smile of seeming sincerity and used that shadowing hand to wave him goodbye chapter you shopped at finheys caroline goggled once he was home whatever possessed you to enter that mans stores alan call it curiosity my dear he allowed stripping off his coat and waistcoat undoing his neckstock and taking his ease in a chair on the front porch where it was cool caroline had a pitcher of sweetened limewater near at hand damme if he didnt have good prices too and a wider selection you do not only with wyonnie to accompany me she frowned i find good bargains along the docks directly off the trading ships uhm caroline those that sell direct off the ships alan complained those goods arent landed or bonded the imposts arent paid those are yankee traders so i noticed she grinned between sips of limewater theyre violating the navigation acts caroline he pressed laws im sworn to enforce damme dash it all how does it appear for the wife of an officer holding the kings commission to to commodore garveys wife shops right alongside me alan she told him as does the cook from the governors mansion the butlers for every household thatve ever invited us the well im damned would you rather have my eight pounds gone in a twinkling at bay street or shirley street shops then alan she queried without a qualm do you need more money then he asked not a farthing she chuckled leaning back into a chair and putting her feet up on a padded footstool darling i manage quite well with more than enough left over at the end of each month but i could not without seeking out bargains alan i will not break you to support me i am not spendthrifti know that caroline he softened reaching out to take her free hand and id not begrudge you our entire fortune were you to need it i know that too love she purred and that is why i will never ask of you until it is needful i am quite content on my house allowance and too much in love with you to ever wish to lose your regard by being extravagant i dont think im much for extravagance anyway she chuckled im a country girl at heart i love you too dear for so many reasons he cooed back at her every day i recognize a newun i shall send wyonnie and her husband to shop the docks for me in future then love caroline promised so we do not give the impression that you condone anything illegal now its cooler ill bake more at home stead of buying bread from the bakers though summers i will have to trade with the bakeshops and local dishes are tasty and filling i need no heavy imported dishes when fish rice and all are just as nourishing and the openair markets are much cheaper i love it here in the bahamas and shirley street stores are closer and just as economical if one looks carefully at imported goods misicks and friths alan nodded in agreement how did you know where i market alan have their bills at the end of the month bothered you she teased i heard theyre a little higher than finneys but not so dear as to rival bay street alan stumbled feeling a flush of color as he wondered just how jack finney had known the exact stores she favored damme has the man been following her he shuddered i have a surprise for you dear caroline blushed two to be truthful sit right there and close your eyes hope tis a better surprise than the ones ive had this morning alan thought going back over his long conversation with finney i know christmas is supposed to be a time of sober reflection and in england people spend it with their noses in the prayer book she said as she came back to the front porch no keep your eyes shut for a space longer she bent down to kiss him for a moment giggling at his temporary helplessness and mistaking his agitation for impatience but the klausknitzers that german couple have the most wonderful traditions that carpenter fellow who made these chairs they exchange gifts such as the magi brought the infant jesus alan and i thought it a grand idea and the perfect season for mine to you may i look now he grinned now first he beheld a shiny tube that she held out to him a flageolet she said proudly made from tin you always said you wished you could play a musical instrument and i thought it the perfect one theres a little chapbook of tunes and instructions in how to read musical notes now theres reason for a crew to mutiny alan thought though smiling happily ill make a bloody nuisance of myself bad as some noisome welsh harpist darling its wonderful i had no idea he said instead and this she said sweeping a dropcloth away from something that was leaned on one of the support posts gawd he could but exclaim in awe what he beheld was carolines portrait an ovalframed oil of her from the waist up she was depicted standing in her flower garden by the front gate dressed in a gauzy white offshoulder sack gown and flowered straw hat potters cay and hog island were hinted in the background behind overhanging tropical flowers and palmettos in a hazy spring morning damme thats alacrity anchored there he gasped out first as he recognized the ketch in the far background which flew the red ensign and streamed a redwhiteblue commissioning pendant bloody hell wrong thing to say he winced within himself my god caroline the artist has captured you to the life i swear he added quickly kneeling down to look closer why he did you so true id expect your eyes here to blink any moment and he caught your smile perfectly tis like having you looking at me from your mirror scantwise as you do of a morning when youre looking pleased and full of ginger i told you augustus hedley was a wonderful artist alan rose and took her in his arms lifting her off her feet to swing her about as he kissed her i take back everything i ever said about him darling alan laughed heartily youre right as always he is damned good alan had been married long enough to know to forbear mention that the waters east of potters cay were too shallow for anchoring a warship or that alacrity did not sport tgallant yards above her topsls darling alan do you really like it she teased like it god yes what a magnificent gift he assured her now every time i look up from my desk or dine in my cabins ill have you there so fresh and lovely ill ache for want of you mmm having you ache and miss me when youre at sea wasmy main idea darling she murmured coyly in his ear do you still begrudge giving up your awful old harem picture hmm not one whit augustusd done so many island scenes he practically gave our sunset over nassau harbour away in trade she boasted pleased with herself and with his enthusiastic reaction to her gift and he did my portrait for only five pounds and a dozen crocks of my pineapple marmalade now am i not economical my love uncle phineas would be proud of you alan snickered as he let her down to her feet again though still draped against him i am too theres only one place i know you to be spendthrift and thank god for it you dont have to go aboard ship until after dinner caroline whispered with a suggestive smile then why do we not go and be spendthrift for the rest of the morning thats my lass he beamed lifting her off her feet again to carry her inside bring the portrait she said between long seductive kisses well stand it up against my dressing table mirror and see if i look as full of ginger as you think chapter oh poor little fellow midshipman parham said to himself as william pitt escaped the greatcabins by the quarterdeck ladder and sat on the deck to scratch at his good ear the sound of their captain practicing the scale on his tin flageolet came stumbling to their ears through the open skylights aft sound like another ramcat to you does it poor puss poor afterguard poor me and i thought you would appreciate music mister parham lieutenant ballard said hands behind his back and rocking back and forth on the balls of his feet as alacrity rolled along music aye sir but parham shrugged as he grimaced his opinion below lewrie broke off doing scales and started a halting attempt at the chorus from the jacobite lass which prompted their surgeons mate mr maclntyre to sing along equally badly gied ma love the white white rose thats growin at ma fathers wa it is the bonniest flow v that grows where ilka flow r is braw theres but ae bonnier than i ken fae perth unto the main an thats the flowro scotlands men thats fetchin for his ain oh dont encourage him mister maclntyre parham tittered lord mister ballard sir the captain cannot play and mister maclntyre can neither sing nor speak the kings english of a sudden a proper shambles that is thats enough that is mister parham ballard smirked and a jacobite tune too sir parham continued disloyal to king george is it not mister maclntyre next time ye hae a boil on yer bum mister parham maclntyre warned twill be ma dullest lancet an ill nae be gentle masthead mister parham ballard intoned with a cock of his head and frown enough to let him know his antics had best stop there was another verse without vocal accompaniment this time before the music ended with an embarrassed cough lewrie emerged on deck moments later in breeches and shirt and looked around as the afterguard and watchstanders suddenly found something vital to do or something fascinating to see over the side seas getting up lewrie stated scanning the horizon about them she swims a mite more boisterous than in the forenoon aye sir lieutenant ballard replied primly winds are yet steady from the noreast some backing in the gusts to east might be half a gale no more sir the weather horizons clear for now though we are getting whitecaps now and again the rigging whined with a sudden gust of wind that came more from the east with perhaps a touch of southing alacrity rolled a bit more as the winds picked up from astem and the normally lumpy waters of the northwest providence channel were now long sets of rollers windward faces rippled like hides by the gusts and capped with white spume where a borning chop collided with itself smell rain mister fellows lewrie asked twitching his noseaweather as the gust faded and the winds clocked back to the expected noreast of the trades sweet water somewhere captain fellows agreed just a hint now and again id wager squalls by seven bells have the hands eat lewrie inquired aye sir ballard reported topmen aloft then take in the topsls and brail up secure then well have gundrill as we planned but no more than one hour lewrie ordered face wrinkled wary well practice wearing ship to either beam and firing broadsides at a chase aye aye sir ballard agreed bosun pipe all hands do you send topmen aloft trice up lay out and brail up topsls if this is a late cyclone mister fellows could we shelter in a hurricane hole on grand bahama north of us lewrie asked as the men thundered up from the mess deck what about hawks bill creek hmm fellows squinted taking off his cocked hat to scratch at his gingery scalp do we stand on westnorwest the rest of the day sir wed be too far to loord of hawks bill creek and would have to beat back to it with grand bahama a lee shore to larboard and grand bahamas a graveyard for an hundred ships caught such nasty coast in a southerly wind but cross bay on the western tip should be abeam by late afternoon sir round behind settlement point in cross bay theres a good holding ground lowlying land with nothing to break a gale but much calmer waters behind the breakers and mangrove swamps keep that in mind if this isnt your regular gale we could ride a gale out reaching south after gundrill well lay out four anchor cables just to be safe lewrie decided very well sir fellows agreed by six bells of the day watch three in the afternoon it was clear that this was no average tropic squall line the horizon astern had darkened to a deep slate gray shot through widi ragged sizzles of distant lightning at the base the highpiled white clouds of morning had turned gray and lowering and raced themselves overhead to loord they took in the outer jibs reefed the gaff courses once then for a second time before wearing ship north for shelter with alacrity laid over on her larboard side the wake creaming within arms reach of the deck as she swooped and bounded fast as a cambridge coach darting for safety like a lowflying tern it was one thing to trust their stout little vessel in deep water in a full gale but this had the smell of a bad un an outofseason hurricane the first sprinkles of rain hit them as they beat into harbour around settlement point shorttacking easterly and the wind gusted from the eastsoueast hard enough to make it difficult to breathe about here sir fellows had to shout in lewries ear best bower then second bower out there to southrd of the first ready forrud lewrie yelled through a speaking trumpet mister neill be ready to tack her ready mister harkin helm up and meet her midships jesus let go forrud alacrity rounded up everything lashing and flogging and came to a stop in her own length against the winds as the best bower anchor splashed into the harbour larboard your helm let go main course halyards back forrud sheets lewrie called alacrity almost spun like a fallen leaf over to the opposite tack and began to sail away to starboard driven by a triplereefed aftercourse and an inner jib reduced to little more than a storm trysl the best bower hawser paying off abeam howling through the hawsehole round up mister neill meet her let go second bower and pray both the bitches bite lewrie thought as alacrity paid off the wind with both anchors out each placed fortyfive degrees off her bows hand the courses hand the jibs down came the last scraps of sail leaving alacrity drifting to the west at the mercy of cross bays sandy bottom should the anchors fail to hold she would be wafted onto coral a couple of miles astern before they could get a way on her again she snubbed the best bower anchor weighted with thirty feet of fistthick chain and a twopounder brass boatgun to ease the jerking which might dislodge the flukes had held and a moment later so did the second bower similarly weighted on its rode mister harkin pay out half a cable on each hawser and even the scopes lewrie called then turned to ballard you wanted delegated action at conch bar mister ballard now you have it off you go make it quick before the storms really upon us aye aye sir ballard replied summoning his boat crews they would row out the stream and kedge anchors from astem and set them down to match the angles from the bow cables cony odrado lets go it took an hour of juggling and pulleyhauley to equalize scope on the cables by then as the hands fell exhausted from the capstans the storm was upon them and a curtain of furious rain sheeted over the decks blanking out all vision beyond a couple of feet blowing so hard it was nearly horizontal lightning forked and arced around them one explosion striking the island the next so closeaboard their hair went on end and the thunderclaps were so loud and continuous it felt like alacrity was being hulled by thirtytwopounder fortress guns making the deck tremble and leap as the rigging and masts wailed an unearthly eldritch chorus of harpys shrieks lewrie was wet right through the rain driving past tarred tarpaulin coat and hat like they were gauze soaking breeches and shirt cool as the rain was in the winds he was clammy and hot beneath and stiff with blown saltwater cloth flogging painfully with the storm had come unnatural eerie nightfall a yellowgreen dusk torn by lightning bursts on either hand trees ashore bent and tossed sickly green palmetto fronds and leaves came slapping in the air to cling wetly for a moment then be torn away to swirl aft alacrity jerked trembled and snubbed on bow cables on stern cables tossing her head like a colt being held to be saddled whats astern should we drag alan asked fellows in one of the few partings of the rain in which they could take bearings little bahama bank sir fellow shouted back what the dons called the great shallows miles and miles of coral heads and reefs alacrity was whirled by a gust drove forward and snubbed on a stern cable hard enough to make them stumble before paying back to jerk on best bower then second bower making the cables groan on the bitts hellish sunset became black night blue black with lightning frying iron gray rain clouds that brushed the masttrucks with the winds moaning all about like a witches coven but it was not a cyclone not a hurricanejust a terrifying winter storm and it finally blew out by four bells of the evening watch the rain drummed vertical and with less punishing force thinned at last then ceased the clouds parted to the east revealing a late moon and a few kindly stars even though cross bay still tossed and churned and alacrity continued to quiver soon the winds eased to half a gale with lulls between gusts they could see the storm astern now a spectral sea battle raging on the leeward horizon as it tore across the gulf stream and the florida channel a wall of blackness supported by a thousand legs of flaring lightning strokes like blue fires on dark velvet not a millpond yet sir ballard commented grunting with a weariness brought on by tension and fear but its over praise god calm enough to suit me arthur lewrie muttered you turn in and get some rest set regular anchor watches and a harbour watch i think our people have earned some sleep at last and you sir ballard inquired dry clothes and a boat cloak and ill doss down in my deck chair ill take the middle watch lewrie offered aching though he was with exhaustion and the blessed release of being spared disaster no sir you turn in ballard objected almost truculently i normally stand the middle damme arthur youre silly enough to offer ill give you no arguments lewrie smiled for the first time since midday call me at eight bells my normal time then aye aye alan our normal routine ballard said shyly and damned glad of it lewrie commented as he went below chapter there were for once lashings of fresh water aboard sluiced into barrels from all the rain and lewrie after waking from gummyeyed sleep was enjoying the pleasure of a bath from a lavish fivegallon bucket when he heard a lookout cry that a ship was entering harbour he dressed quickly in clean clothing and dashed to the deck warship sir lieutenant ballard informed him as he lowered his telescope a sloop of war whippet i do avow lewrie borrowed the telescope to eye her himself yes it was commander benjamin rodgerss whippet of the bright redgunwales and a lowersteeved jib boom than the older sloop of war on station a recognition signal flew from her main yard mister mayhew hoist this months private signal in reply lewrie ordered he gave ballard his telescope back and scratched his chin which still wanted shaving cony well breakfast commander rodgers moren like and wheres my coffee tis acomin this minute sir cony assured him nother hoist sir mayhew piped from the bulwarks clinging to the starboard stays shes flying make sail sir and here is a third sir take station on me then we wont have breakfast ourselves lewrie spat mister ballard pipe all hands and prepare to single up to the best bower mister mayhew hoist anchor then numeral four and hope he gets our sense whippet prowled north and south off the coast with make haste flying continually until alacrity had taken in all her anchors made sail and joined her once out of harbour whippet hoisted captain repair on board and left it flying until lewrie was in his gig and being rowed across to her took you long enough rodgers commented sourly so unlike his usual merry style your pardons sir but i had four anchors to get up after we took refuge from the storm last night i trust our signals what you nosailor you rodgers laughed suddenly becoming his charming self again runnin into a hurricane hole at the first halfgale whats the navy comin to i ask you you rode it out i see sir lewrie said peering about the deck at the sailmaker and his crew who were stitching madly at the hands aloft still reeving new stays and halyards had to layto with a single trysl jib a spanishreefed main topsl and the spanker at three reefs rodgers boasted put out a sea anchor and i was just about ready to spill evry drop of oil we had fore the storm passed nasty one had i been closer inshore id have been tempted damaged are you no sir small stuff mostly easily set right good rodgers exulted cracking his palms together damned good theres work afoot lewrie more bloody pirates didnt know there was winter traffic enough to prey on sir ran across a spanish threemaster yesterday off great isaac at the mouth of the providence channel thought it suspicious that she was makin nornoreast closehauled as if she were goin to put in for grand bahama when theres not much here smugglers or banned traders i thought at first but when we got her hullup we saw a schooner with her and then she flies up inirons and ailaback and the schooner scoots off north fast as her little legsd carry her shed been pirated by god chased them until the storm came up and then it was save yrself might have gone down in the storm sir lewrie suggested only port on their course was here by settlement point where they could strip their prize in private rodgers went on thats why i peeked in here tsee if theyd sheltered an hadnt cleared harbour yet you saw no other vessel at all once we got the anchors set i couldnt see farther than the end of my arm for all the rain sir lewrie had to admit no damn rodgers spat all but stamping his foot on the deck in frustration damn he reiterated she was too small to ride out a storm like that smallern your little alacrity i was so sure might have sheltered round north of us sir nearer the bank and wed never have known it lewrie commiserated by indian cay damme all this folderol for nothing then he griped to himself and i still havent had me breakfast hmm still ah sir lewrie added you took their prize back and they were running here the storm dammit rodgers groused not in the morning sir lewrie said slyly and once they were aware a storm was building they still ran for a lee shore during the afternoon doesnt make sense unless they had someplace specific in mind some hideyhole an uninhabited cay somewhere in the little bahama bank where they felt snug and a place to ride out a storm damme but youre a knacky un lewrie of course rodgers realized with a grin where they thought whippet couldnt follow em you were right about doyles hideout you may be right in this now look you here sir aye sir i draw twelve feet forrud so i dasnt risk the banks but i could cruise offshore you draw eight and a half sir lewrie replied getting a sudden onset of nerves damme here we go again tiptoeing through coral north of memory rock yonder theres a tenfathom pass commander rodgers schemed oblivious to the harm alacrity might suffer on this mission mister cargyle chart he shouted over his shoulder to summon his sailing master the way one would shout for a slowcoach waiter ah here we both could enter illtake the deeper water between middle shoal and the lily sand bank noreast across the bank to just north of matanilla reef alacrity will go inshore of me to exit through the walkers cay channel farther south and east and we meet up there then well both have a peek at walkers cay tis a famous pirates lair of old mayhap these buggersre usin it again aye aye sir lewrie answered knowing what lieutenant coltrop down in the turks had felt like at last dont get too close to walkers cay dont spook em out too soon captain lewrie rodgers warned him if theyre there should i be so fortunate as to get across the bank in a whole vessel ill not sir lewrie commented wryly still have that trinity house sailing master gatacre aboard no sir lewrie sighed commodore garvey promoted his first officer off royal arthur into the schooner i took and sent dreadnought away to survey the east coast of andros so lieutenant garvey is now third in royal arthur rodgers grunted rising like a spring tide his career does sir gawd old horry must bloody love you these days rodgers laughed right then off you get trinity house pilot or no aye aye sir lewrie scrambled over the side into the stern sheets of his gig for a lumpy ride back to alacrity after the salute had been paid to him the sea was still fractious in the wake of the storm and he held on for dear life at last he thought though ill get my coffee my shave and my bloody breakfast chapter as the crow flies it was only forty miles sailing from the deepwater entrance on the western side of the little bahama bank roughly eight miles north of memory rock to deep water on the east side in the middle of walkers cay channel in the wake of the storm though the winds had gone lunatic one hour they might have noreasterlies the next hour theyd clock around from the north or the norwest the mornings watch had been sailed nearly closehauled to weather but in the afternoon they even had winds up the stern from the west it took alacrity all that first day to navigate her way eastward to the lily bank in waters than ran from twentyseven to thirty feet deep but near sunset they encountered shallows not fifteen feet deep and there was no pass through the lily bank and its myriad sand bars which lay bare or awash with thousands of sea birds crying and wheeling over them as they fed on tiny reef fish or mollusks they anchored at true dark at about west and north at the lily banks southeast extremity having covered only a heartbreaking thirtytwo miles eight tantalizing miles short of walkers cay just a bit before sunrise the next morning they found depth enough and open water to the noreast except for one quick fright when it shoaled around a circular submerged outcropping from eighteen feet deep to a bare ten then within musketshot of the northern side of walkers cay channel theyd shaved the topaz shallows of matanilla reefs southernmost tip to give the island a wide enough berth so any pirates in harbour would not be alerted but giving alacritys lookouts a chance to spy out the anchorages they then headed out to sea to meet whippet and report your schooner is there sir lewrie told rodgers in his cabin which lewrie had to admit was even fancier than his own may not be your pirate schooner but a schooner and a threemasted ship too how near did you go rodgers fretted think they saw you no sir lewrie grinned we struck our topmasts and reefed the gaff courses and jibs low to the deck then kept off seven miles with only our lower masts and fighting tops showing they showed no sign of alarm long as we had em in sight damned good lewrie rodgers nodded in relief they must think were still huntin em off grand bahama or goin all the way northabout outside the little bahama banks where exactly lewrie spun the chart around on the table so everyone couldhave a good view he and rodgers the sailing masters fellows and cargyle and the first officers theyre in this long tongueshaped inlet north and west of the island proper sir lewrie sketched out theyve rocks and shoals to their norwest on the east side of walkers cay channel coral and exposed rocks north and shallows on the east to seal cay but there is a chain of tiny islets running norwest from the western tip of the island theyre anchored here half a mile or less off the beach by the last one west they must have fifteen to eighteen feet depth in there sir sand bars on the south side of walkers cay too sir john fellows stuck in they trail off south then east all the way to this grand cay and theres reputed to be a onefathom shoal souwest of the island about here perhaps making one entrance channel into their sheltered inlet off those islets sir lewrie thought it odd that cargyle said nothing at all but he put that down to the man having been daunted by rodgers aggressive personality in the past he thought it an unproductive relationship theyre in a culdesac rodgers elated if that shoal you suspect does lie to the souwest mister fellows then there are only two escape routes they come to deep water in walkers cay channel and run out that way or they take the eastern side of your shoal back down south over the little bahama bank again how big is it no one knows sir sorry to say fellows fidgeted nervously but from the south end of this shoal norwest of the island one could reasonably expect a channel into the anchorage and this long tongue inlet where they are moored of perhaps mile and a half and were whippet to be in the middle of that channel north of your mysterious shoal at dawn her guns could cover anything that moved rodgers sighed with pleasure and here is where i wish your alacrity on the morrow captain lewrie oh bloody suffering hell alan thought as he saw where commander rodgers was jabbing at the chart you enter walkers cay channel ahead of us go south and east until you get round the sixfoot shoal that forms the two channels and block the southern one your guns have as much reach as mine so we have them between us to squeeze if they can anchor a proper ship that far up this tongue of deep water then we can sail right up and give em broadsides at pistolshot range from two directions i see sir lewrie nodded feel game for one more quadrille cross this bloody little pond sir rodgers demanded much amused of course sir lewrie replied with false ardor to get to the desired position by sunrise and sunrise would be best if rodgers wished tactical surprise he would have to take alacrity back through the threemile span of walkers cay channel in the dark grope about like a blind man with a cane tapping against the curbs and cobbles avoid a shoal no one knew the extent of then round it and feel his way into artillery range in that southern channel which could not be a mile wide at best now i know why lieutenant coltrop turned so pale alan thought this is going to be trickier than falling downriver from chatham from one stream anchors grapple to the next at least sane people try that in broad daylight thats my lad captain lewrie rodgers praised i knew you had the bottom for it long as i have a bottom under me by tomorrow noon sir he rejoined with a wry expression and a half two the leadsman cried mournfully telling his depth marks on the leadline by feel alacrity showed but one light on the quarterdeck the lantern in the compass binnacle and even it was shielded by a tent of canvas bloody wonderful lewrie complained softly winds right up our arse the currents running deadset against us and the chip logs no clue to our speed less we take time to anchor and measure the flow and to top it off tis darker than a cows gut tonight whod be a seaman hey sir arthur ballard chuckled back ballard had the sometimes infuriating capacity to take a great deal of joy in having his seamanship tested to the ultimate by what a reasonable man would have thought a stomachchurning horror lewrie would have put it down as insanity or sublime ignorance of the consequences had he not seen ballards keen intellect at work judging to a nicety his own and the ships limits infuriating he might be but alan was beginning to find arthur ballard a calming influence for his own windier moments as long as arthur ballard was composed he could assume there wasnt much to get panicked about we should be southerly nough now sir fellows muttered from the darkness walkers cay should be noreast of us and asternvery well mister fellows lewrie allowed mister ballard time to alter course lay us abeam the wind course due east aye aye sir ballard replied sounding game for anything bosun no pipes hand to the sheets and braces off belays and haul taut ready to come about two fathom the leadsman called out forward helm alee mister neill ballard commanded course due east nothing to weather ease sheets and braces mister harkin alacrity came about slowly with care her rehoisted tops yards creaking her courses rustling and mewing as the wooden balls of the hanks that bound sails luffs and boom throats to the lower mast shifted to a new angle blocks squealed aloft as the tops lift lines were run to reset the upper yards level to the sea for a more efficient use of the nightwinds power gaffs and booms gave out croaks as they bound for a moment as they tilted theyd been running before a northerly wind sailing no faster than it could blow now with wind abeam they could feel the nights close balmy tropic damp turn just the slightest bit chill as the wind soughed across the deck alacrity began to pick up a little speed as well her bow rising and dipping and then it dipped rose and stayed there one fathom christ the leadsman wailed well shit weve run her aground lewrie groaned silently he had been filled with so much tension so much dread of ripping her hull open on coral that a soft almost unfelt grounding on mud and sand was a relief and he found himself almost shivering with humor blieve we found that shoal for you mister fellows he said with a lazy drawl loud enough for everyone aft to hear and the deck exploded with nervous laughter ahem fellows grunted in the dark shit grounded gentle enough though lewrie said going to the side to peer over to leeward dark as the night was he could see or only imagined he could see a faint rippling line of disturbance lit with eery phosphorescence that ran south and east from alacritys bows as the northwardset current brushed the shoal and folded back under and over itself he walked back towards his staffs shadows mister ballard let go course sheets so she wont drive forrud flatin the jibs the wind will push the bows south and this current may be strong enough to walk the stern north to ease us off aye aye sir focsle captain flatin yer sheets mister parham whats the chip log doing lewrie asked streaming abeam to weather sir the midshipman answered from the taffrail at the very stern long as were not going anywhere for a few minutes take a cast of the log mister parham and determine the current lewrie said calmly grinning widely damme i must be getting right good at this nautical humbug he told himself i havent cursed or yelped yet with her foretopmast staysl run up and flattedin with the inner and outer flying jibs for leverage alacrity began to shuffle to slowly pivot about on her bows with the current shoving against her side helm up hard aweather lewrie ordered to assist the current knot and a quarter near as can make it sir parham told him a few minutes later thankee mister parham thatll require we steer a point or point and a half to loord to make due east mister neill aye aye sir the senior quartermaster responded stolidly there was a shudder a faint groan and a rushing noise over the side as the bows came off at last and alacrity began to sail to the south once more leaving behind a swirling eddy of mud and sand due south nothing to larboard for now sheet home courses for a run mister ballard mister fellows do you think we should let her have her head for at least a mile before we try that again aye sir fellows replied and soueast at first sir not due east just in case very good mister fellows carry on mister ballard lewrie replied oh one more thing mister ballard sir damned odd but its so dark tonight i thought i could see a trail of blue or green fire in the water where the shoal was right along the edge as our wake appears in tropic waters sometimes do you see it out there sir uhm not really sir who among the hands has remarkable eyesight mister early the quartermasters mate sir ballard replied shivering with a touch of awe post him amidships on the larboard gangway to windward facing the shoal out yonder have him sing out should we have to bear away if it gets too near summon him and ill point it out to him aye aye sir ballard gulped hed heard tales of such feats the uncanny lore of the truly great old seamen had thought he had some touch of the gifts sometimes such as in almost being able tofeel the return scend against the hull of waves rebounding from unseen land but he never thought to see them in such a casual captain as their idle devilmaycare ramcat lewrie damme but we got away with one that time did we not sirs lewrie chuckled breezy with relief and filled with good humor still aye sir hellish good fun for a time too damme if it wasnt oh aye sir mr fellows groaned fun chapter hands is eat sir galley fires doused overside an it lacks a quarterhour to proper sunrise at six bells sir the bosun harkin reported very well and thank you mister harkin lewrie replied as he hitched his swords slim baldric into a more comfortable position under his coat mister ballard hands to stations to hoist anchor and get under way aye aye sir alacrity had been anchored with her bows pointed north towards walkers cay three miles south of the island a mile short of where the southern channel narrowed they hauled her up to her bower with muscle power on the capstan and the help of the current letting out the stream hawser as they went sails were hoisted and sheeted home and as she strained to begin sailing they buoyed the bitterend of the stream cable let it slip and were under way in a twinkling the winds were more norwesterly that morning which would be a dead muzzier for any ship attempting to flee out the channel that led west from the anchorage and into walkers cay channel to shorttack in such a narrow gut would be an invitation to disaster so one escape route was effectively blocked already and whippet would have the winds large on her larboard quarter when she drove down the passage with her ninepounder carriage guns run out and loaded mister ballard beat to quarters lewrie snapped his men were ready knowing what the morning would hold they were blooded by one success and trained by constant practice to a high level of proficiency they were almost cheerful as they cast off the lashings of the artillery rolled them back to loading positions inboard and prepared their pieces for firing winds backed a piece fellows commented eyeing the commissioning pendant aloft as it swung to stream more abeam and holding might have westerlies once the suns up and hot better that than heading us and shorttacking up this damned channel lewrie agreed smiling in anticipation he felt there was something most agreeable about having rodgers in command with none of the awesome burden of decision upon his shoulders this once and a clear and subordinate role to play after his independent cruise in the caicos this was as easy as sailing with a full squadron whippet the lookout shouted from aloft four points off the larboard bows bout three mile off sir enterin the pass got em by jesus fellows cheered that puts us about four miles south of their anchorage lewrie guessed speed mister mayhew uhm the midshipman stalled as he cast the chip log in haste six knots sir half an hour to closebroadsides then lewrie calculated in his head a quarterhour if they get under way and try to fight their way out aloft there whats happening in the anchorage they be makin sail sir both ships pity there aint no prize money for captured pirate ships fellows sighed a fullrigged ship of theirsd bring a pretty penny shoals to starboard five cables one point to windward quartermaster lewrie said with a nod keep her in deep water well as you may aye aye sir shoals to larboard five cables clear water ahead center of the channel then quartermaster lewrie beamed whippet came gliding east down her channel flags flying and under all plain sail a marvelous sight against the dawn the suspect vessels were now underway having cut their cables andhoisted courses and jibs not trying to free any topsls perhaps shorthanded alan wondered with half their crews ashore for some reason the larger ship could find no escape over the southern route into the little bahama banks according to the charts south of walkers cay there were triangle rocks doublebreaster bars and the barracouta banks where the depths shoaled to ten feet or less damned fool lewrie spat as he used bis spyglass from his perch on the after shroud lines halfway up to the fighting top the fullrigged ship was turning west to challenge whippetl and a moment later he could espy ruddy blooms of gunfire from her idiot she fireda hanging offense whippet veered northerly wearing ship to bare her starboard battery before the dull bangs of the strange ships artillery had even reached them whippets side lit up orange and red in a gush of powder smoke the broadside tolling steady as a gun salute from bows to stern the unidentified ship quivered and pulsed in the round ocular of his telescope as she was hulled her main yard leapt free of all restraints and came crashing down in silence her lower mizzenmast jerked and splintered sheering off the upper masts to fall like a sawn tree and drape over her stern and leeward side she bore off to the south to seek refuge shell be on our shoal if she shaves the southern bank of the channel that close fellows was hooting in derision shell hope to get past before whippet can come about alan heard ballard state calmly but whippet wore once more this time pointing her bows toward alacrity heeling over with the press of wind as she gave her foe one more timed broadside the range could not have been half a rnile and alan could see pieces of timber bulwarks and decking flying in puffs of dust and smoke the ship bore away even steeper looking as if her master was trying to tack across the wind even as whippet bore down on her for another broadside schooner dead ahead fine on the bows sir a lookout called lewrie swiveled about and saw their particular foe about a mile away and closing downsun as alacrity was and with their attention drawn to the battle they might not yet have spotted alacrity as she came up from the lee of sunrise dark against the last of the nights horizon mister ballard broadsides to either beam lewrie shouted as he jumped down to his quarterdeck well wear across the channel to block it mister fowles your gunnersll have to hop lively for me they will sir helm up to windward to bare the larboard battery alacrity turned noreast almost running with the wind her gun ports flew open with a crash and the hands tailed on the runout tackles til the carriages butted home against the bulwarks as you bear fire sevencables range threequarters of a nautical mile and cold iron barrels tore the morning apart as the sixpounders barked and came thundering inboard to snub on the thick breechingropes shot struck fantastkrplumes of spray short of the schooner in a ragged line before her bows shoals ahead three cables deep water to larboard helm alee mister neill bear up closehauled mister ballard lewrie ordered stand by the starboard battery gun captains transferred to the starboard side while loaders and rammermen tacklemen and powder monkeys remained to larboard to complete swabbing out and reloading the expended guns to carry the full complement of five men per gun deemed necessary to serve their sixpounders would have taken fifty men out of the sixtyfive adults aboard so it was standard drill to work both sides shorthanded in preparation for moments such as this and required only thirty open yer gun ports fowles was droning on done larboard come run out starboard gun captains point cock yer locks fire as you bear sir lewrie shouted the schooner had turned away to the west almost inirons into the teeth of the wind and if she held that course would end up on that uncharted shoal of theirs fire fowles called as the deck rose up level and hung still for a moment ah yes by christ oh well shot my bully lads theyd fired individually but on the uproll which forced them to hurry in tugging the lanyards on the flintlock strikers so it was more a planned broadside this time they hit her and she shook like a piece of meat taken by a shark and paid off the wind in disarray to point her bows at alacrity again hands wear ship ready the larboard battery lewrie was zigzagging up the channel blocking any hope of escape and going wide to present all his guns fight me you poltroon lewrie screamed across the waters got no stomach for a real foe you murderin bastards the schooner fell away to run soueast dangerously close to the sand bars south of walkers cay trying to shave a passage down the channel alacrity served her another broadside then wore onceagain to run due east to block that side of the narrow passage even as the gunners got off another broadside from the larboard guns shoals ahead two cables some lookout screeched on the bow he could not hold this course a minute longer alan realized the schooners master was praying that hed have to bear away soon whilst he could continue to run south and perhaps get astern of the gun ketch that was tearing his little command to bits vast there lewrie shouted he was out of syncopation in his turnings with the schooner mister ballard lay us fullandby to weather on the larboard tack then once you have way nough tack us and wear about soueast to keep us ahead of them aye aye sir ballard grinned nodding with understanding hands to the sheets and braces hands wear ship aweather mister harkin prepare for stays alacrity swung away from the schooner almost showing her her stem but kept on turning crossing the eye of the wind and heeling over with the wind on the starboard side pointing souwest the schooners captain took the opportunity to run south and steer wide of the threatening bars and shoals then alacrity wore falling off the wind in a small circle to race back across that narrow channel on her best point of sail with a bone of foam in her teeth and her larboard battery ready once more there would be no escape as you bear fire fowles cried the schooner was smothered in spray as even the twopounder boatguns got into the act from focsle and quarterdeck at a bare twocables range she staggered under the impact of solid roundshot and swung up toward the wind as if to cut across alacritys stern shoals ahead one cable helm down mister ballard beat souwest and keep ahead of her and be ready to haul your wind should she duck back towards the shoals on the east side of the channel shes inirons a lookout called as most of the crew and the officers were busy with the maneuver and the reloading theyre all aback takin tthe boats sir the schooner was being abandoned one small launch was being led around from astern another was already filled with men and was being rowed east towards the shoals the oars worked like hummingbirds wings wear about to the soueast lewrie demanded get the guns on them before they escape but before they could fire more than two broadsides they had to turn once more to keep off the shoals themselves and their route was almost blocked by the abandoned schooner listing and drifting towards the shoals the boats with their twofoot draft got over the shoals and bars and into deeper water off grand cay cease fire lewrie shouted fuming once more pirates had outsmarted him and escaped him mister ballard secure the people from quarters send mister odrado with my coxn cony over to take charge of the schooner before she takes the ground mister harkin well fetchto ill see to this arthur you carry on very well sir helm alee lay us closehauled on the larboard tack mister neill stations for stays mister harkin focsle captain well leave the jibs on larboard tack bracetenders prepare to back the main topsl ready about helm alee alacrity rounded up as if she would cross the winds eye but stalled inirons her gaff sails trying to drive her forward on the starboard tack but her backed jibs counteracting their force like brakes so she cocked up into the wind and came to a halt slowly drifting north on the current and making a tiny leeway a neat mornings work sir fellows congratulated swiping his thinning ginger hair and looking more like a harried clerk the schooner took whippet with her foe aground in the north channel and another pirate band with their business stopped ummph lewrie commented damme the way we handled her sir sweet an fleet as some pleasure yacht my word sir twas hellish fun that they got away though lewrie glowered cant have it all sir fellows chuckled why the devil not mister fellows just why the devil not chapter its a regular treasuretrove ashore sir lieutenant ballard reported to lewrie and rodgers arms and powder of course money and plate but theres heaps of cargo covered with sailcloth and palmettos a ships chandlery and fancygoods shop in one an ocean of drink too sirs fancy wines brandies rums ive put a guard over that so the hands dont get at it yet who shall guard the guardians rodgers mused loot from a dozen ships more like lewrie commented and that ship out yonder that guineaman bungfull to her deckheads with general cargo too rodgers grinned a very happy man no manifest goods from cuba from new york an baltimore an charleston aboard goods from europe yet gentlemen yet no recent voyages in her log tany o those places like lewrie here says its loot bought from the pirates that took it well sir ballard pouted theres a civilian merchant ashore in charge of the cache a mister runyon who claims the goods are warehoused here that theyre held until the prices go up in the winter when aye just like this captain malone of guineaman claims that he was taken by buccaneers rodgers hooted in derision oh hes wily he is yet when i demanded he produce the pirates who sailed her out an fired into a kings ship he cannot swears they went over the side an escaped in a ships boat an he an his crew got free too late tsave her from groundin on the shoals not from where i was watchin they didnt and do you know who guineaman belongs to eh a bay street merchant name o john finney calico jack finney as hes better known in these parts finney lewrie exclaimed startled out of his skin but glad the next moment merciful god thats wondrous i mean ive met the man thought he wasnt straight from the very first heard he was cherrymerry with cutthroats and such and that pirate band i did for was led by a friend of his a socalled former friend why he must be in league with em well o course hes in league with em rodgers chortled always has been always will be fars i know ran an allnations an a buttockshop for em got rich off their trade made loans for em traded mis for that since he set foot in nassau he excuse me commander rodgers ballard said with a cough i did learn that this runyon fellow ashore is one of finneys agents well there you are then rodgers exulted triumphantly we have proof positive against him even if our pirates did escape us well sir this runyon claims as i said a moment ago that the goods are cached here secretly without having to pay duties or bondedwarehouse fees in nassau until hurricane season ends and the shipping trade across the atlantic or down from america ceases until spring then theyre loaded aboard his ships and sold at the peak of their scarcity when their value is highest all over sir he just came out an admitted it rodgers said going bugeyed well damme the fellows just convicted himself an his master with him thats confession o smugglin not exactly sir ballard objected in a court of law he could make it sound a plausible defense if pirates discovered his secret cache they would be tempted to raid it he might even try to prove that a consortium of other bay street members put them up to it to eliminate the competition then should the duties be paid at nassau when he declares them ah rot rodgers snorted now heres the way i see this was done sirs finney does nought of the dirty work see but his old mates pirate inbound ships and some passin near enough they have to have a method of profitin and finneys their middle man their shore agent if you will theyll keep the money jewels and plate but the dry goods and such the foodstuffs finneys agents meet em in just such a hideyhole as this un theres a deal o lonely cays in the bahamas with decent harbours safe from pry in eyes a swap is made give em a quarter o what its worthhalfcrown to the pound perhaps less they keep what takes their fancy vessels they deem faster and better armed and play the upright tradin men in public anywhere they please between voyages and they scuttle the poor ships far out at sea along with theircrews and passengers lewrie stuck in once theyve had fun with some of them damn their blood or resell some o the ships down in the west indies or over in america for even more profit aye rodgers grimaced a european oakbuilt shipd be worth two yankee ships made o thenpoor excuse for ship wood might even create new documents for em to ease the sales but aye its wholesale murder for the victims then heres the part where finney makes his money back he ships the pirated goods to new providence eleuthera great exuma over to the abacos down to long or cat island and sells em as clean goods would he not have to pay duty on them sir ballard asked land them inbond first in public so even so whats the cost to him rodgers scoffed were he to send ships across the atlantic out of season pay an honest price for a cargo an pay duty its a losin proposition or a damn thin one what with insurance and all but to get a cargo for a fourth its worth sell it dear as salvation when no one else has the fancy stuff well whats a few shillings per hundredweight matter and once landed and reshipped theyre legal lewrie grasped with bahamian authorities on hispaniola or cubaanywhere and skys the limit on what he could reap rodgers laughed oh we see his vessels settin out for england for the continent for america and we see em come back months later but do they ever really go anywhere i ask you some must sir ballard pointed out ever the keen one aye some must granted rodgers allowed but enough come to lairs like this un especially in winter only his most trusted masters and crews he probably has captains and hands who never see this part o his trade so he might undercut the other merchants only slightly lewrie exclaimed whilst the others do business at ten or fifteen percent profit lord finney must earn fifty or seventy percent exactly rodgers said but why sir lewrie asked perplexed damme the risk of being found out sooner or later he made over pounds from the war im told owns a dozen fine ships a planting and that big house in town a hero and all and partnership in a bank rodgers added heard tell he put up as his share to launch it proper fars we know he plays banker and shipshusband for his pirates too and loans to these new arrivals thats just it sir lewrie insisted mind you i dislike him as much as cold boiled mutton but why once one has that sort of blunt that sort of respectability would one risk it all just to make more if an honest profit atop his bank and his pickings from the war would buy him a small country in europe it doesnt make sense because hes a semiilliterate dog who hasnt the sense tnot feed like a starvin wolf til he spews rodgers sneered captain lewrie has a point sir ballard interjected hes not a stupid man for all his lack of publicschool letters look at how far he rose and what native intelligence it required aye he could have been as dense as his mate doyle once hed gotten a purse full of chink sir lewrie countered risen then fallen in a fortnight but he didnt sir revenge ballard commented slyly his sober countenance and his slightly sadbutobservant eyes crinkling with secret mirth oh rot rodgers snorted with disdain vengeful amusement lewrie added sharing a smile with his first officer against who pray tell rodgers demanded why against just about anyone and everyone id expect sir ballard intoned with a quirky cock of one brow society atlarge whichs ever sneered at him rot i tell you rodgers reiterated tis of no matter why what does matter is gatherin evidence among all this cargo there must be some sign it came off foreign ships that it wasnt ever his how do you come by that sir why foreign ships alan asked even hed not be so foolish as to loot a british ship commander rodgers chuckled theyd be missed but foreign ships which compete with british merchantmen and undercut every new providence merchant well theyre fair game as long as they arent carryin a bay street shopkeepers cargo those fellowsd turn a blind eye an like as not stand the pirates a round o drinks if its piracy keeps dieir prices high cuts down on finneys competition and lines his purse at the same time too we have no way of knowin how many foreignflagged ships set out or when whether they were comin to the bahamas or just passin by how long would it be before some boston shipshusband sends a letter to inquire about a missin ship and with just the one overworked american consul it might take years to answer if answered at all an the bulk of em put down as lost at sea cause unknown with their home port so far offbristol plymouth and liverpool are just as far off sir ballard stuck in unable to stop himself theres papers to look through rodgers said disgruntled at having his logic questioned theres that pirate schooner to search from keel to truck you strike me as a slyboots lieutenant ballard why not turn your hand to delvin me some answers then and listin what we seized ill salvage guineaman ill be too busy aye aye sir ballard intoned well get to the bottom of it sir lewrie promised vowing to help ballard in any way he could besides he thought there was more than one person in the bahamas who could relish revenge and when it came to vengeful amusements even he would be the first to admit to being buckofthefirsthead at it chapter god almighty lieutenant ballard sighed wearily as he and lewrie pored over the lists theyd made he rubbed his eyes with the heels of his hands and peered about the dimly lit dining coach of lewries cabins to see if the coffeepot was still simmering atop a lampbase warmer on the sideboard cony is there any of that left aye mister ballard sir polish yer brass with it by now ya could though sir i could roust cook out an fetch fresh trot that lot out cony ballard yawned the blacker the better may it be strong enough to melt a pewter spoon then it may also dissolve the dam in my poor wits dont see as how were getting anywhere lewrie carped deep in a brown study he had looked forward to harpooning john finney in a court of law even though paperwork drudgery was never his strong suit had the records theyd seized the inventories of booty theyd recorded shown any promise he might still have felt enthusiastic to continue delving but so far they could find nothing truly damning and alan envied commander rodgers who was being all nautical and tarhanded at salving guineaman we shall sir arthur ballard assured him its all circumstantial arthur alan muttered half of the goods are bulk cargoes rice flour dried beans and such in sacks or barrels we know it comes from the americas but thats all no sign or markings of seller shipper or buyer same for the iron tools and farm implements cloth and all it could be his legally yet none marked as consigned or bought by john finney sir ballard pointed out hopefully theres fancy goods from spain france and portugal with the producers names for proof theres sign they cleared foreign customs theres sign export duties were paid but no marks of who bought it or shipped it lewrie protested could be construed as looted goods from a dago merchant or could be finneys after all aye sir but no proof positive of his ownership ergo tis not his and prima facie evidence it could be booty i take no joy in mat argument alan complained he could claim ownership and produce all the sham records he wished or he could say he purchased the fancy goods in havana or santo domingo or a dozen other ports from others and brought em here and been skinned by the original importers sir ballard said with a grin no one on a court would ever believe that tale not if they were any sort of merchant or shopkeeper no one would pay that dearly no profit in it what we need is some sign that part of the trove ashore belongs to other bay street merchants well never get that sir ballard sighed if they imported wares in foreign bottoms they violate our navigation acts naturally they would not wish their cargoes marked for a customs official to see finney could say the same the other merchants do not possess a fleet of trading ships to do their carrying sir and if all goods in one of his ships are his then whos to gainsay him when he claims they needed no markings alan countered granted ballard shrugged as cony set a pewter mug before him then therere the odds and ends the pirates left behind sir no written records of their gatherings though with three out of five sailors in the fleet illiterate tis only tobe expected lewrie frowned uhm arthur excuse me but youre really going to drink that sir ballard whispered back with a tiny grin alan do you allow me to be prodigal with your personal stores i shall take it with four sugars and all evident avidity yoosh alan commented with a sourmouthed shudder ditto that opinion ballard said once hed tasted it and set it aside therere weapons watches navigational instruments clocks and such that bear the inscriptions of unknown men and some unknown vessels sir far too valuable the most of it for common seamen but we didnt capture a single pirate they all escaped us lewrie sighed and to track down the goods original owners to find the ships mentioned even if we had captured a few they could say they bought them half a world away as used got em as gifts how does one track down cock robin off the good ship barnacle outa new york all thats left of her is anonymous bosuns stores nails and a pocket watch if she was pirated probably sunk and seaman cock robin murdered and gone down with her now were we to find goodies from old barnacle aboard the pirate schooner and ashore and aboard guineaman we have your prima facie case to lay lewrie leaned back in his chair and gazed through halfshut eyelids at the overhead beams as ballard could be heard shuffling his stacks of papers over again between sips of his vile coffee that might not do it even then lewrie muttered say someone aboard guineaman one of the mates had a packet of used goods in his sea chest the pirates could have rifled the chest when they took guineaman if they ever did and it could have ended up ashore or in a pirates seabag when they went shares of their spoils so there is a fine box of manton pistols with an inscription on the case as belonging to a captain henry beard sir that were found aboard the schooner in her masters cabins ballard informed him the inscription tells us beard was master of the matilda then we have several hundred pounds of chain and ankle bands and wrist locks ashore the sort of restraints used to arrange slaves into coffies sir rusty abandoned for some time id say but they bear liverpool markings with the name matilda scratched into them on the bands there was something he urgently riffled through his papers a liverpool ship lewrie asked tipping his chair forward to take more interest damme a british vessel ah ballard said an especially fine spyglass with a brass plaque bearing the name nathaniel marriyat presented to him by his family upon becoming first mate of the matilda and damme it was rare for ballard to swear that was found aboard guineaman in the readyuse rack by the compass binnacle and the traverse board sir ballard almost shouted with joy three items from the same vessel linking together this matilda must from this scant evidence be a liverpool slaver rusty as the chains and fetters are she must have been taken at least one year ago the pistols and the chains that proves the pirates were here at walkers cay before this incident the spyglass proves that guineaman had met them before yesterday wait wait i yes ballard giggled losing all his soberness as he sorted more papers boxed set of navigational instruments brass ruler dividers compass and a sextant guineamans second mate had them but they were engraved originally as the missing captain beards sir when we questioned guineamans crew he claimed hed bought em in liverpool a year or more past matilda lewrie pondered matilda now where have i heard that name seems i have damme im sure i have a liverpool blackbirder could sell a cargo of slaves here in the bahamas sir do the middle passage dahomey to nassau with the demand for slaves increasing here now that wait arthur ssshh alan demanded raising a hand let me think it was recent he was certain of that much since arriving in the bahamas he tried to remember ships which might have lain nearby alacrity at anchor portsmouthno on the voyage out again no slavers stank to high heaven they crammed three or four hundred men and women into hard wooden racks forced them to lie backtobelly as tight as cordwood and fettered for months fed them in those racks half the time if the weather was bad puking sick incontinent from rotten hogswill victuals they fouled their own sleeping spaces and had to lie in excrement like beasts one remembered slavers close by slavers were fast ships frigatebuilt or like a razeed rd rate cut down to two decks from three were they slow the rates of mortality cut their profits to nothing the faster the ship the more slaves arrived alive for sale though twentyfive percent attrition was the norm for even the most considerate and gentle captains where had he seen such a fine frigatebuilt ship a vessel aseaman would envy foul as that line of work was in the caicos in some harbour nassau harbour cat island christ lewrie gasped he got to his feet and crossed over to the chartspace to grope through his bookshelves cony fetch a light william pitt hissed at him from the dark he had been sleeping like a tawny orangecolored plumduff on the high outboard shelf by the chart table between the chronometer and the sextant case and did not like his naps interrupted oh bugger yrself lewrie griped ah thankee cony he found the goldlettered spine of the book he was seeking les liaisons dangereuses and flipped through it to see if his memory was correct eureka arthur bloody hell read that dedication my god arthur ballard said with a bemused expression when he had completed it how the devil did you come by this sir bought it used for six shillings lewrie crowed look at the date march of its accounted so bawdy there was an order in council to ban its publication in england but some printer a liverpool printer note ran up a few hundred on speculation stead of the usual subscription matilda was at shortstays ready for a new slaving voyage with nathaniel marriyat just promoted first mate into her time enough for your chains to rust but where did you get it sir at finneys on bay street arthur aha at bloody calico jack finneys not two months past damn his eyes arthur they pissed in the font they did the unspeakable they took a british ship a ship we can ask about among the slaver captains who frequent nassau among the slave dealers who dealt with her in the past we can document one of the victims show that goods off her were aboard guineaman the schooner and piled with other loot ashore long enough ago to confirm when they took her therell be a brace or two of blackbirders in port soon with the first slaves of the summer theyll have seen matilda in africa theyll know of her people and whether she went missing and this book proves that jack finney has bought pirated goods weve got the bastard even if he doesnt do a hemp hornpipe on the gallows hes finished in these islands or im a turk in a turban vi hercules licent tonantis profuga condaris sinu petet undecumque temet haec dextra et feret though you run and hide in the thunderers bosom everwhence shall this hand seek you and hale you forth hercules furens seneca chapter but hes as guilty as homebrewed sin sir commander benjamin rodgers blurted out matilda all our evidence no ones seen her for over a year due here about july of and thats as may be commander rodgers commodore garvey shot back pacing angrily behind his desk the court said he is not but she was pirated sir lewrie ventured to interject i find the idea that her people sold off their most prized possessions ludicrous why would captain beard pawn his navigation instruments just before embarking on a voyage why would this nathaniel marriyat pawn his brandnew spyglass and his books gambling debts garvey dismissed with a savage chop of his hand to raise money for buying blacks of his own for sale in the west indies we dont know and we will never know matilda could have gone down in a storm it happens dont ya know lewrie the few items of your flimsy evidence were accounted for by documents of sale and your case confounded forgeries sir rodgers exclaimed they had over a month to concoct what was wanting i warned you when you laid this before me your supposition was weak i did everything in my power to dissuade you from pursuing this fantasy garvey sneered the prosecutor was a brainless arse sir rodgers retorted he didnt like it he was afraid of prosecuting a powerful man so he did his least and that badly he told you beforehand it wouldnt hold water and it didnt finney was absolved faster than any court ive ever seen garvey said listen to the mob out there sirs listen you fools now finneys being chaired through the streets like a sitting member of parliament on his hustings and kings justice has been made amockery the navy has been made to look stupid sire the bahamas squadron and me with it our new governor lord dunmore is most exercised over this bade me over to ask me what sort of idiots i had under my command and were there any more of em out there running roughshod what could you have been thinking rodgers therere untold tens of thousands owing finney now you shot guineaman to rags wounded some of her people put her on a shoal you deliberately torched every stick of goods on walkers cay and sank everything that wouldnt burn in the bay hell demand recompense and even should the crown uphold you i expect itll take the entire budget for governing these islands for the next year sir the next year entire she fired into me first sir and if pirates really held her as finney and captain malone claim then nothing is owed sir god damme sir i salved her afterwards didnt i set her youll not blaspheme in my presence commander rodgers do you hear me you simple dullard garvey bellowed you could have put a guard over the cache of goods we could not carry it off sir and there was too much drink to guard lewrie said wed have had to torch that or tip it into the harbour anyway or wed have lost the crew left behind as guards you do not interrupt me lewrie you do so at your peril i hold you responsible for this youre just as culpable and liable in this affair as rodgers he was following my orders sir rodgers stated finneys agent runyon told you it was private property saved for later sale in the offseason yet you persisted it was not marked as his property sir lewrie rebutted we did bring off the coins plate and all and those items we could identify as finneys the rest could have been pirate booty so we so you set fire to it with fiendish childish delight just to see it burn you pyromaniac you henheaded simpleton sir we lewrie attempted both of you going off at halfcock quick as a brace of twoshilling muskets wasnt one band of pirates enough for you eh lewrie did you get a taste for acclaim and glory had to go out to win more hey and you rodgers you were sure to be made post your next commission what need had you to gild your laurels with this this act of complete lunacy envy lewrie his crowd of backslappers feel left out or ignored did you you vaunting coxcomb ha did you sir i did my duty as best i saw it rodgers growled deep in his chest with his chin tucked back hard against his neckstock i saved a spanish merchantman and gave chase to the pirates who had taken her i tracked them down to walkers cay and i engaged them i saw no pirates fleeing guineaman and i was fired upon by her so i opened fire into her aye sir i discovered evidence which led me to believe that the goods on the island were booty and this finney neckdeep in the support of criminals sir i what pirates rodgers garvey roared you let em escape you did not arrest one person who should have been in the dock you had no captives to interrogate to determine whether it was booty or not and out of spite out of frustration that youd been bested you saw what you wanted to see learned only what you wished to hear abused the master mates and crew of guineaman brought scandal upon their good names invented a circumstantial fairy tale then laid a case against one of nassaus most illustrious merchants just so you had something to show for your swaggering antics sir i take deep grievous exception to your characterization of my actions sir rodgers said almost strangling you failed sir hear me you failed failed to capture a single pirate failed garvey almost howled you could have left a guard over the goods brought guineaman back here and discovered the truth quietly finney and the other merchants would be cheering you for saving his ship and his goods but no you demean honest men in a court of law and honest men lewrie muttered with scorn what did you speak sir garvey ranted turning on him a court says hes honest a court just said hes completely innocent he was shrewd enough to import extra and cache it until the price was high enough know whos cheering finney lewrie the same people he will skin when they buy his offseason imports they call him knacky to be the only one with their fancy goods they cannot do without and will pay his prices gladly if he undercuts the other bay streeters yet cheats them thats just the nuts to them the fools being shrewd doesnt mean he isnt guilty sir lewrie said the book sir how did he come by that if be quiet you silly clown twas you and your first officer who brewed this case out of thin air then laid it at this fools feet and convinced him he was onto something and all for jealousy sir because you were jealous i ask you sir lewrie goggledthe whole town knows finney was spooning round your little batterpudding lewrie garvey scoffed and you didnt like it did you garvey accused dropping into a nurseryroom singsong you didnt have the nutmegs to warn him off as a man should so you plotted a way to confound a rival in your wifes affections by naming him a confederate of pirates was he simply too handsome for your peace of mind sir too fearsome an opponent to confront man to man hey too fierce a foe to call out or would his hanging on false charges make you feel more sanguine about your wife while you were at sea sir damme sir that is patently unfair alan exploded and you cast foul aspersions upon my wifes good name and morals for no good reason sir if you do have any allegations about her i demand you say them straight out now or never sir you may be my superior officer but that doesnt give you the right to demean her sir oh christ alan heard rodgers grunt under his breath i am your commanding officer you insubordinate dog garvey howled jowls flapping you do not shout at me sir nor will you use foul language in any address to me and ill cast any aspersion i please an officer junior as you has no business marrying in the first instance nor in fetching his mort out to a foreign station for his comfort and pleasure in the second she has affected your skills as a sea officer prejudiced your administering of kings justice so unwitted you that you laid false charges against a man for revenge for some slight perhaps it might be best if you resign your command and commission and take both her and you home failing that put her on a ship leaving you to concentrate on the salvation of what is left of your career sir that goes beyond what a commanding officer may order any subordinate to do rodgers protested at once an officers personal life does not fall under your regulation sir and i cannot believe that i have heard a superior officer use his office to slander a fine and blameless young lady in such a callous fashion alan could not speak and thanked god for rodgers courage there was a humming in his ears a red mist before his eyes and the room swam about him he had never been so angry nor so impotent to act should he speak for himself he would explode and damn every consequence should he even move his first action would be to draw his hanger and run garvey through believe what you will rodgers garvey barked what lewrie no fine words cat got your tongue at last hey i have no doubts at all concerning my wife sir and i bitterly resent your words about her sir alan managed to drag out between clenched jaws finney traffics in stolen goods sir we had a case not the tightest case it turns out but the truth was told sir stand by my allegations i stand by my wife and i resent truth my god garvey hooted checking himself as he almost blasphemed himself you make me want to spew the two of you therell be a court of inquiry into your actions sirs therell be civil charges laid by finney to recoup lost goods and incomes your truth is a pack of fabulist slanders and hell most likely sue you both for that too until any or all of those courts convene youre to make yourselves scarce as hens teeth out of my sight so i am not tempted to relieve you of your commands and break you and will you schedule the court of inquiry preceding the civil suits sir rodgers demanded would that not be prejudicial should i be found should have considered the consequences before you acted sir garvey almost snickered you serve and you will now wait pending my pleasure and convenience commander rodgers tis coming up on whale season did you know that sir and saltraking will soon commence with hotter sunshine down south you will sail this evening sir making the best of your way and relieve aemilia as stationship in the turks sir i draw two fathoms rodgers protested i couldnt sail a tenth of my patrol area down yonder purchase a lugger or two from the fishermen then to act as tenders to whippet garvey shrugged sitting down at last in a fine leather desk chair perhaps lieutenant coltrop has one already out of admiralty funds sir rodgers asked suspiciously your stupidity leaves me with no admiralty funds rodgers i leave it to you to deal with out of your own purse if you wish to perform your duties as best you see it aye aye sir and you lewrie garvey simpered youre going south too long island cat rum cay conception and watlings will be your area should i even hear a rumour of your topsis being seen north of flamingo point on cat island until i send for you ill have you cashiered for mutiny and desertion sir aye aye sir alan nodded too numb to grasp now my fine turdbarge captains garvey glowered get out of my sight get out of my harbor and stay out and should i getword youve done something else so abysmally chuckleheaded again i promise i will have no mercy upon you go go garvey concluded shooing them away with a languid wave of his hand as if flitting off flies mine arse on a bandbox alan fumed once they had reached the streets how dare he he hissed close to tears of impotent rage he had no right no right at all no he doesnt rodgers groaned as they plodded heavily downhill towards bay street and if caroline sails will his wife his daughter or his sister and her dominee husband sail with her hey can he force her to leave alan asked fearfully no he cannot and he knows it damme what a bloody mess damn the court damn the panel damn our timid mouse of a prosecutor damn the very law we know finneys guilty but hes got clean away with it and hell keep on gettin away with it now he ought to be swingin in a noose but hes a hero all over again damn his blood and the next time itll be one of garveys anointed who lets him get away with murder damn the man damn him to hell i never knew a senior officer so lewrie raged the bastard he was wrong wasnt he rodgers was forced to ask after a long minute or two of silence as they plodded along despondently what garvey said about you dislikin finney so much you might have about you bein nettled by his attentions towards your wife hed sent invitations to his functions acted overly familiar in public at dos they attended separately alan replied as calmly as he could it was being handled quietly the mans dense and a boor but i was a long way from fronting him or calling him out about it sir lewrie lied and your dislike didnt prejudice you when you not at all sir oh i admit to being most pleasantly surprised to see him implicated but we had real evidence i invented not one whit of it sir arthur ballard came up with most of it and hes unaware of the situation so he was as objective as anyone would wish hes damned clever sir and would have dissuaded us if he didnt deem our case plausible look at the consequences sir i knew them going in and the court warned us too no matter how much i might detest a man id not risk all we face now to vent my spleen even im not that stupid sir i still dont understand it if the prosecutor thought it was too weak to present and he feared losing so much then why did he end up taking it to court why are we not being sued right now for damages instead i mean to say the charges against finney should have been dropped and then hed have turned around and sued us over his losses if he had a mind to i dont know rodgers sighed and i wish to god id never heard of calico jack or guineaman or walkers cay damme hell have my last hapenny fore hes through with me mine too lewrie commiserated no you acted under my orders lewrie its my burden to bear from now on at my court of inquiry theyll call you as a witness no more and thankfully none of commodore garveys vile assertions about our motives will see the light of day damn him if he starts slandering her in society ill call him out damme if i wont the articles of war bedamned lewrie vowed they passed in front of a popular tavern as they turned the corner to bay street several boos and catcalls from within followed them along with a few gnawed rib bones as the patrons jeered them damme im a kings officer how dare they rodgers erupted captain tom of the mob sir lewrie said restraining him i fear well have to put up with it for awhile bad as any sauceboxes in london when it comes to putting down their betters when theyre caught out best we ignore em before they summon a real mob and we end up dewitted like that dutchman got torn apart in they wouldnt dare rodgers huffed but allowed himself to be put back in motion and led at a slightly quicker pace away from their detractors the mob sir theyd dare anything until the garrison has to be called out and the riot act read and we dont want that spose not rodgers allowed well if im to sail this evening id best go aboard ship now you will not dine with me and caroline sir bring betty along for a last supper uhm betty hmm rodgers blushed tell ya the truth now lewrie im not the marryin sort like yourself and your carolines corrupted betty mustin somethin awful lately put ideas in her pate bout wedded buss an vinecovered cottages such as yours ah should i give her your respects at least then sirhmm best not rodgers frowned ive sent her a note andi im off for the turks for a long spell it seems so this might be the best thing in the long run dont ya know i see sir alan nodded sadly ah mister chatsworth mistress chatsworth rodgers said as he doffed his cocked hat to salute a couple of his acquaintance and alan did the same recognizing them from several salons delight hmmph that worthy said as he turned his head away to deliver the cutdirect his wife made of sterner stuff actually turned her gaze heavenward and out to sea the cutsublime and nudged her man in the ribs to steer them to the opposite side of the street well shit rodgers spat in bruised wonder only to be expected sir lewrie sighed heavily damme that irks though he thought shopping at finneys are you mister chatsworth lewrie could not help calling after them mixing your wine with the blood of poor murdered sailormen are you theyve a fine special on cutlasses and pistols just the thing for carving your sunday roast madam or for making mister chatsworth walk the plank lewrie for gods sake rodgers flushed half outraged yet more than half amused does nothing repress you sir im minded of your earlier statement sir about this being a funny world but no one laughs about it thought id try humour on just to see what happens cause i cant imagine things getting worse shall i see you to the dock and into your boat sir thankee captain lewrie id admire that might consider you row out with me then over to alacrity then take your own gig tland on that beach just bfore your house stead o takin the road home never know what our fine citizens hereabouts might think up aye sir ill do that very thing lewrie agreed share a bottle o champagne with me fore you go id best not sir lewrie decided carolinell be worried pity tis a damn good year rodgers chuckled ive twenty dozen stored in my lazarette ought to hold me for four months do i ration mself close an theyll be an absolute delight tdrink for they came from finneys stash on walkers cay dont ya know damned good sir take joy of them alan brightened he is a pirate lewrie rodgers spat sobering and someday well prove it proper garveys wrong ya know the crown wont make good his losses they were unbonded undutied goods just the same as smuggled the mob may think it was knacky but the courtll think it just shy o criminal and i surely cant and wont should the judgment go against me id abscond to havana fore he gets a single farthin we hurt him where it hurts him the most lewrie thousands and thousands o pounds o goods gone up in smoke might stretch him sore make him desperate and should one o his ships cross my hawse why then ill hurt him all over again chapter darling im so very sorry things turned out as they have caroline attempted to console him for a final evening before sailing it was a horrible occasion betty mustin had gotten rodgers note which severed their relationship and ended his financial support so shed run to carolines for comfort and was weeping disconsolately on one of their settees a noisy unlooked for intruder youre not the only one my love alan grimaced as he packed his shoregoing bags damn its so unfair finneys guilty we know it proving its another matter now even the imps in the road are spitting at us got bones and horse dung flung at me before i got into a boat at the docks i know love caroline nodded as near to tears as he was at this sudden separation i sponged your coat best i could he left off his packing to cross the room to her and hold her caroline love i fear the mobs anger with me will happen to you he told her best let wyonnie and daniel do the shopping for a few weeks til things quiet down she nodded her agreement against his neck and from what little i saw this afternoon therere sure to be some snubs from people we thought liked us he confessed i fear your popularity in societys to suffer sorry my faultdamn my social life alan she said fiercely and damn them who regard finney above you or me well discover who are faithless and fickle and who are our true friends then no matter how high a body be should they snub me now then they couldnt have been worth much to begin with god how much i cherish you caroline alan muttered lifting her off her feet to embrace her snugly youre so sensible so good for me when i m not which i fear is often my treasure i wont have much need for society anyway alan caroline whispered in his ear not for the next seven months anyway why afraid of running into finney id meant to tell you properly darling she whispered and leaned back a little took one of his hands and directed it down to her belly now is my last chance so she wore an impish smile well surely thisll all blow over by what and you will be back in port for the birth of our first child she said and he could feel her smile against his shoulder even if he could not see it he let her down to her feet and stood back from her his expression about as betwattled as itd ever been and saw the happy and sopleasedwithherself confirmation in her fond gaze you look shot alan does it not please you darling oh my god he yelped in cold confusion

to hold your head up high as anyone you wont quit now alan youve too much pride to slink away too stubborn too if the truth be known part of what i absolutely adore darling part of the father of our child i cherish and respect and wish for our children to possess it took everything he had not to weep with gratitude for her boundless confidence in him or for the joy he felt brief as it now could be at being so unconditionally loved this joy he was losing as the sun sank away his final hours ashore with her thank god for you caroline he muttered his eyes hot and moist bedewing her sweetsmelling hair remember how much i love you and god knows as ill remember whilst im gone slink away he did though as alacrity cupped the last of the twilight trades softparting slack harbour waters as she steered her way through the throng of shipping in the port at sunset the sun declined in almost gaudy grandeur blood red as hothouse roses as amber gold as dancing candle flames with theclouds regular wavy mottles and swirls like angels tresses lanterns were being lit ashore on the docks on the many moored vessels as twilight gathered and alacritys focsle belfry helm and taffrails glowed warm yellow as well put your helm down two points quartermaster lieutenant ballard instructed softly lay her head nornorwest for the main channel aye aye sir nornorwest mr neill echoed ready for the gun salute to the flag mister ballard lewrie asked sunk deep in the blue devils and gazing astern to see if he could espy a light on the porch of a particular house above potters cay on the beach road aye sir wonder why yon ship is dressed allover sir midshipman parham said pointing ahead to a fine threemasted lugger profuse with flags and bunting her decks were afire with lanterns in profligate array all down her gangways and about her quarterdeck railings shut yer mouth mister parham lewrie heard ballard whisper in a harsh tone as he recognized the house flag atop her mainmast sorry sir parham grunted blushing as he saw it too lewrie came to the nettings over the waist and raised his spyglass to look her over shes a new un oh one of finneys they seem to have something to celebrate yonder this evening the faint sounds of a band could be heard tootling merry tunes as the many guests danced or sang with rowdy good cheer goddamme lewrie shuddered as he read the name on the transom plate of the new ship goddamn him what is it sir ballard asked here see for yourself mister ballard alan said shivering with dread and strongly reconsidering an immediate resignation why the bastard ballard yelped in outrage there in ornate serifed letters bright with gold leaf was the new ships name caroline how dare he presume sir ballard growled repulsed by such a boorish flaunting deed his prim sense of decorum scandalized put your helm aweather mister neill lewrie decided quickly new course due west steer up yon luggers transom but be ready to come about again to due north for the channel when i call sir ballard queried coming to his side helms aweather sir comin about tdue west sir youll be using the larboard battery for the salute mister fowles lewrie called down to his master gunner in the waist below aye sir ready any time you want sir oh sir lieutenant ballard objected but not too forcefully as he got his quizzical bemused look surely not he tried to pout on their new course they would ram caroline in her very stern or pass down her starboard side at close pistolshot at best open your ports mister fowles ready with the salute at half a cables distance from a collision lewrie turned to the quartermaster helm alee mister neill norwest alacrity bore away upwind of the anchored caroline crossing her starboard quarter at a fortyfive degree angle at one hundred yards fire your salute mister fowles lewrie grinned boom if i werent a gunner i wouldnt be here number two gun fire fowles paced out the stately measure walking aft with the guns boom ive left me wife me home and all thats dear number three gun fire boom guests aboard the caroline and her mates had cringed when they saw alacrity bearing down on them theyd laughed at finneys japes against the navy as he celebrated his victory then here was the navy bearing down upon them as if to ram and board her civilians dashed about in sudden terror as the first cannon fired its reduced powder charge women screamed and the band came to a sudden gurgling halt crewmen ran for weapons sure they were being fired at or took themselves below for safety as their mates bellowed for order on the quarterdeck hot powder smoke rank with rottenegg and hellfires stench wafted over them as alacrity cruised slowly by across their quarter like vengeance ah theres our host lewrie chuckled john finney came clawing his way through his terrified darting guests to the rails to stand headtaller than the rest gaudy in pale silks and satins his whitepowdered tiewig askew on his head as he shook his fist at them and mouthed curses lost in the shouting the screams and the deafening gunfire helm down mister neill north for the channel lewrie said as the last shot of the salute belched forth and echoed off carolines hull haul taut forrud brace up sheet home give us a tune you men the ships idlers who played fiddle and fifes lurched into life playing a gay pulleyhauley chantey portsmouth lass the onlyone allowed in the fleet as alacrity turned her stern to caroline and steered away for the sea her flags flying and her commissioning pendant streaming as saucily as some teasing taunting coquette salutes done sir fowles said after carefully counting his shots i should certainly say it is mister fowles alan laughed finney could be seen tearing the tiewig from his head to throw it after them screaming imprecations that were only thin howls under the chanteytune the hulls creaking and the wakes bustling swash he may play the hoary seaman but hes a shopkeeper mister ballard lewrie said loud enough for the afterguard to hear just a jumpedup purser and a nipcheese un at that take that you bastard well have you yet for a final fillip alan raised his right hand and presented an upright middle finger to finney a very english gesture of long usage to alans amazement lieutenant arthur ballard stepped to his side at the rails and did the same as did the midshipmen and mister fellows the sailing master the last finney saw of alacrity as all but her lights faded into the rosy dusk was her entire crew standing to attention as taut as sunday divisions hands raised in scornful salute chapter damme mister keyhoe there must be some correspondence he barked at his round little purser only pay vouchers i fear captain keyhoe sighed shrinking into his dark blue coat to escape lewries wrath the paperwork that comes with admiralty stores shipped down from nassau in the packet did they at least send money for the hands then alan asked uh nossir the usual certificates and those six months in arrears as usual keyhoe had to confess so the jobbers ashorell buy em up and the handsll have a quarter to a half their true pay aye lewrie almost kicked furniture in his anger hardly any pay sir once they settle their previous debts keyhoe muttered on half of it pledged to me for slopgoods tobacco and sundries the rest with brothels and taverns ashore on every island hereabouts damme this goes beyond punishment alan fussed this now begins to sound very much like vindictiveness bosuns stores none sir keyhoe confessed powder and shot again none sir just rum wine small beer biscuit and saltmeat captain enough for another two months at full rations and what about officers pay mister keyhoe lieutenant ballard inquired certificates too aye sir keyhoe huffed had i a way to communicate with my agent in nassau i could offer twothirds value on the certificates so those vultures ashore dont skin em so bad but ive no coin so youre the kingvulture and pocket it all when the ship pays off in lewrie thought sourly there was only one ships purser hed ever liked mr cheatham aboard the desperate frigate during the war and hed kept a chary eye on him too well therell be drink enough to keep our ships people easy and groggy lewrie stated with a sadly bemused snort theyll not starve but its issue rations and nothing fresh less we continue to purchase for em when we buy wardroom stores damn garvey aye sir ballard said but none of us i know mister ballard were skint too lewrie nodded in total frustration very well working party mister ballard warp the packet brig alongside and transfer cargo aye aye sir and call away my gig im going ashore lewrie decided of a sudden feeling imprisoned on his own decks alacrity had been in her new patrol area for six months long island rum cay conception and watlings were sparsely settled if at all and the principal settlements were on cat island in that remote corner of the southeast bahamas packet ships cameirregularly most often quarterly for alacrity they brought provisions and vouchers but no mail and no replies to lewries letters to the bahamas squadron as indolent and handtomouth as life was in these islands it sometimes felt as if the rest of the world had somehow ceased to be since they had attained them as if all civilization had fallen and hadnt bothered to tell them about it there had been no summons to a court of inquiry into walkers cay there had been no notice of a civil trial for damages laid by john finney and no answer to lewries urgent requests for powder and shot sailcloth rope tar paint and nails with which to keep alacrity in fighting trim and able to keep the sea livefirings to maintain the gunners accuracy were a thing of the past as was drill at small arms beyond swords and pikes since dryfiring shattered the flints in their muskets and firelocks on the carriage guns there didnt seem to be much point in patrolling the area either there was very little sea traffic except for fishing boats and the rare interisland packet there was no foe to fight no trade worth the name to protect and hence no piracy to defend against it was rare to see a deepdraught seagoing ship pass by since most of the trade headed for nassau eleuthera or the exumas up north or down south to the salt isles of the turks and caicos in season alacrity made a nuisance of herself by stopping every ship she could catch to inspect cargoes and manifests to enforce the navigation acts and plead for their personal letters to be forwarded to nassau should a ship be going there yet most mysufyingly there had not been one article of mail from the outside world received in the entire six months and with the lack of personal correspondence the hands had gone sullen and slack as had the warrants and officers try as they might to keep the men active with hydrographic work with the erection of nightbeacons and daymarks to aid navigation it was a halfhearted endeavor as weeks wore by with little pay few amusements and dulling drudgery to face with no hope of novelty or relief with no admiralty funds with which to purchase fresh meat and vegetables lewrie had resorted to many refreshing shore expeditions they would land and hunt wild goats pigs or iguanas they would lay at anchor for a day or two and let the hands fish or gather conch from the shallows then stage maroons with music singing dancing and drink enough to at least mellow the men as their food cooked by nighttime beach campfires by day theyd extemporize the means to play village games like football or cricket endless bestofseven tournaments of watch against watch even that had palled lately turtle races cockroach races ratcatching theyd tried it all on theyd allowed the hands to keep parrots they caught ashore wild kittens and puppies they tried to capture wild pigs and temper them to abide being penned in the manger forward by the break of the forecastle for later consumption lately only william pitt was fond of the menagerie licking his chops in drooling expectation over the fractious shoats and attempting to creep up on unsuspecting parrots on almost uninhabited rum cay lewrie had rented a small piece of white land and had hired an older man to watch it for them with hopes of fresh vegetables and melons buying the seeds out of his own pocket as he had several other small lots of supplies but now he was down to his last thirty pounds and was practically living on the ships rations himself most of the time with no replies from nassau requesting funds from his personal accounts every officer or warrant with a shore agent was similarly cut off and he had no idea if he was now a father or a widower there had been no letters from caroline not one childbearing the ordeal of childbirth was the scourge of women no matter how healthy childbed fever they called it and even back home in civilized london the annual bills of mortality bore thousands and thousands of victims what could be expected in such a rude climate as the bahamas with so few skilled physicians he could not force himself to contemplate any longer and half of those hopeless drunkards he thought miserably he threw himself into anything if only so he could cease his frantic brooding for a few hours swordplay until he frothed with sweat practice upon the flageolet until he could carry a tune from start to finish at a regular meter hunting and fishing amusing william pitt with a cork on a piece of string for hours and sulking and morose imaginings of caroline dead until his lack of news for good or ill his hours of staring raptly at her portrait his fretful sleep and vivid nightmarish dreams had sunk him into a deep despondency a surreal resignation clarence town on long island was a dreadfully boresome place worse than anglesgreen on sunday and this was a market day he took a table in the shade of a veranda at the one inn the settlementcould boast and ordered rum lime juice sugar and water for a cold punch he put his feet up in a rickety chair removed his hat undid his neckstock and settled in for an afternoon of drinking an activity which was beginning to figure more prominently in his life lately there was a london paper nine months old to read what was left of it after being pawed over by countless other patrons so he was in for the day if he read all eight pages slowly ho dere navy mon a fetching black girl said from the railing overlooking the sandy street got nothin bettah tdo on ya run asho now an you a honsome young feller lord did i bring my condom with me he asked himself no ill not theres caroline now well would it hurt to sit and at least talk with a woman six months its been cat got ya tongue fine sah she teased she wasnt as dark as most tarted up in a decent sack gown shed altered so it fell low off her shoulders and bared a darkly shadowed cleft between heavy breasts that swelled her bodice far beyond the original owners design she sported a widebrimmed straw hat tied beneath her chin with a yellow ribbon and to keep off the august sun a small parasol which she twirled fetchingly damned handsome wench lewrie appraised silently more coffeemilk than black huge brown eyes that pouty mouth and christ just taking my ease for the day he said at last dot rum punch be bettah wit de pineopple in it sah ya let me show ya how sah an do i get a glass i be

other in total wanton abandon her legs were strong and muscular and wyannie bucked and thrust back at him with equal vigor enfolding him with all her limbs writhing and shoving to meet him hard enough to lift him in the air off the crackling straw mattress and creaking bedropes she squalled and grunted panted and lowed like a cow cursed and groaned and shuddered then ended each time in hissing screams there was more rum punch between bouts mutual spongedowns with a pitcher of water and a mildewed handcloth which renewed their heat shed roll a firm thigh across him to ride st george as he squeezed those heavy breasts or teased large dark rockhard nipples with his thumbs once she romped atop him facing away toward his feet which led to her bent forward kneeling on the side of the rickety low cot and him standing behind her with a death grip on her madly rocking hips as he thrust deep into her as frantic as a hound sweat rolling off his chest and belly off her solidly firm buttocks to mingle with their juices theyd bellowed like bulls and had fallen almost senseless in an exhausted swoon after that one alans mind areel with her cheap perfume a womans odors and her

a sudden rapping on the flimsy door damn my eyes he muttered under his breath who is it lieutenant ballard sir oh shit alan started uhm a moment get dressed girl he got to his feet fuddled with rum punch and weakkneed from past exertions and staggered into stockings breeches and shirt gave up a search for his shoes and went to open the door he tried to step out into the rude hall and close the door behind him so ballard would not see his companion but wyannie had walked into plain sight to bend over and retrieve her shift and stood there splendidly provocatively nude arthur ballards brows lifted his wary eyes flew open and for a fleeting moment of shock he lost his usual calm composure his jaw sagged until he swallowed and shut his mouth into a prim set his lower lip even more pouted than usual what is it mister ballard something amiss aboard ah no sir ballard replied still flustered and blushing like a schoolboy but theres a note come aboard sir from the local magistrate said theres a letter in his possession for us from cat island been held by him for a month or more sir hallelujah alan whooped with joy after six months of silence any missive at all was nothing short of miraculous give me a moment to dress and ill be right with you aye sir id wait on the veranda ballard blushed again do me buttons up luvahmon she asked him dressed but for the back of her gown sorry

widow in need ya sweet she warmed to him and accepted the coin she gave him one last fervid embrace one last series of openmouthed and moist kisses walk me tde road like a genmun hey capum he saw her down the hall onto the veranda where she retrieved her straw baskets and produce bags doffed his hat and gave her a bow which made her smile so widely that she dimpled as she curtsied to him and watched her stroll away loosehipped and proud with a profound sense of relief yet a smile of pleasant reverie on his face even if arthur ballard was watching his antics well shall we stroll over to the magistrates arthur aye sir they set off down the single street clarence town could boast the afternoon swelter of a late august day only slightly tempered by the seas breeze kicking up small clouds of sandy dust with each step uhm alan arthur said at last sir i uhm yes arthur alan asked certain that this was not to be an official matter damme sir ballard cursed for the second time in alans recollection i know its not my place or concern how you conduct your personal affairs sir no it isnt arthur alan replied yet i mean to say though sir well therere you are married sir therere vows and such ballard strangled out and to such a fine young lady as your dear caroline sir were the uhm had you been with a white woman sir dash it all alan it seems such an incomprehensible slip for you to make sir with caroline waiting for you in nassau with child and to lay with a cuffy slatterna handsome young widow arthur with children of her own lewrie stated calmly damme but hes a priggish young swine he thought not a year over twenty she is proud free and independent for your information she did it for free arthur and she was damn good let me tell you lewrie said his perverse streak standing up on both hind legs and baying the moon down shes a lonely widow and i am a weak and foolish man we crossed hawses once and like as not well never come bulwarktobulwark again i understand your loneliness alan ballard stuttered how worried youve been without news from from nassau dont you ever get lonely arthur alan inquired doesnt a craving for abandon come over you so powerful of a sudden that any old drab doxyd do you dont you ache to put the leg over i hope to set my aim a bit higher than mere rutting sir lieutenant ballard rejoined primly id wish someday for well sir for some bright and lovely young lady as fine as your wife sir yet you turned your nose up at elizabeth mustin a bit too frippish and flibbertigibbet for my lights sir i hope you do not take that the wrong way seeing as how you and your wife set such store by her company sir but he shrugged i dont know why i care for you as much as i do arthur alan chuckled clapping him on the back youre shy as a spanked puppy in womens company youd lie like a butchers dog next to a handsome bit of quim as yon wyannie and never sniff the beef you dont drink but a bottle a day bad days or good and youre as stiffarsed as a parson in a poor parish true sir ballard grimaced rueful at the truth but youve wit and youve sense and damme if youre not right about most things alan allowed laughing out loud iuse mine for jollities and id go dashing off on a tear without your advice half the time begrudge me my faults arthur mind you im not asking you for forgiveness reverend ballard thats between me and our lords commissioners for the execution of the office of lord high admiral of this world and the next takes all kinds i am most often one of the sorry kind and when it comes to caroline damned fortunate made me feel good wyannie did she and this mysterious note of yours have put me in a fettle such as ive not felt in months sir as my old captain lilycrop would say feagued me so well as a lump o ginger up a prads rump ought to issue girls like her good for morale i see sir no you dont youre only making noises like you do lewrie cajoled him wish to god you did damme but you take life serious arthur god knows sailors dont mean much by their sins when they do get the opportunity precarious as we get life were a pack o hymnsingin castrati compared to landsmen try putting a foot wrong now and again arthur go on a tear why dont you takes all kinds as you say sir ballard replied grinning shyly in spite of himself ill not meddle again sir sorry the devil you wont alan chortled and i may bark to pin your ears back but remember i mean nothing by it and if you care enough about me to warn me when im about to do something lunatic then thats what friends are for as oddly matched as they sometimes are aye aye sir ballard nodded now pray god weve good news at last chapter the letter was from col andrew deveaux one of the major planters on cat island informing them that he held mail for them at his mansion near port howe on the southern coast mail sent directly to him from nassau by his old friend from south carolina mr peyton boudreau upon that elating news alacrity was upanchor and out of the harbour at clarence town by dawn the next morning beating into the noreast trades for port howe there was one narrow break in the coral reefs surrounding port howe with breakers lazily spuming on either hand and behind the reef was a shallow port illsuited for anything much larger than alacritythey ought to drop the e lewrie commented once they were come to anchor with the courses handed and being lashed secure sir ballard smiled call port howe how alan grimaced how the devil a ship may enter without wrecking herself is beyond me and where are the daymarks and the warning beacon we erected in may i ask you i have no idea sir carry on mister ballard im going ashore he was rowed to the towns one long pier debarked onto a lower landing stage atop a catamaran work platform and almost ran down the pier for the tiny village a man on horseback waited for him at the shore end with another mount held by a groom near at hand lieutenant alan lewrie the man asked that is the alacrity yonder sir she is and i am sir and you are andrew deveaux sir delighted to make your acquaintance he said springing down from his saddle as lithe as a cavalryman deveaux was a rather small and lean fellow shorter than alan his face was foxlean with a pointy patrician nose almost a womans soft mouth large liquid brown eyes and a smallish tapering ball of a chin he wore twotone black and tan top boots white sailcloth breeches and a loosely flowing silk shirt his face shaded by a very widebrimmed woven straw hat they shook hands muttering the expected your servant sir and thats when alan discovered the steel in the man for his grip was stronger than a fencing masters didnt think youd come to port howe deveaux commented i was prepared to ride to the bight on the western coast if necessary alacrity is shallowdraught enough to enter sir so i thought this would save time youve been watching for me for nigh a month sir here sir do you ride my groom has a mount for you and my coach can be fetched if you do not i ride sir thankee a black servant brought a fine gelding forward and held reins while alan got aboard they set off down a sandy track between thick clusters of seagrape trees for his plantation house to the west alan was struck by how young deveaux was how unremarkable this is quite an honour colonel deveaux alan said to meet you a hero of the revolution and the man who recaptured nassau from the dons another of those frail but game scrappers he wondered neckornothing deveaux shrugged but bloodless people do make much more of it than it really was i am quite honoured to meet you sir i heard in the nassau paper of your feats at conch bar and walkers cay well walkers cay sir alan grumbled sadly then sat up and looked back towards the harbour sir we put up daymarks and some warning beacons earlier theyre gone now do you have any oh those deveaux hooted throwing his head back in delight damme sir do you not know that before the war a third of bahamian revenues came from shipwrecking and salvage blackbeard henry morgan port howe was one of their old haunts so the locals tore down your marks the minute you were out of sight and moved em ashore for lures to make the town look bigger at night needed the timber for buildings too they light the place up like a major city put lights in the harbour so it appears deepdraught ships are anchored in port howe in hopes of luring the foolhardy onto the reefs so they may strip the wreck you got off easy sir im told a navy officer formerly in these islands was almost lynched for even suggesting hed erect a lighthouse on great exuma worse than cornishmen i do declare lewrie smiled surprised all over again in spite of his supposed worldliness indeed we get so little news here on cat island what about walkers cay sir peyton writes that all talk of suits and such have been dropped long ago did you dropped alan cried i had no idea sir ive not had even a single word from nassau in six months not even from your wife deveaux frowned pardon me but he also wrote that she was most greatly upset that she had not heard from you lieutenant lewrie she is well colonel deveaux alan demanded with alarm did he say more shes with child and ive been beside myself with fear he did state she was expecting and that he and his wife were perturbed that her worries about your silence would affect her health but she is well lieutenant lewrie he did assure me of that she had begged him to discover what had happened to you and why you hadnt responded to her lettersdamme sir i got no letters nothing alan shouted no one aboard alacritys had a single thing except for our purser and only inventories of supplies sent out to sustain us which do not require an answer ive sent request after request to my squadron commander and dozens of letters to caroline and its like dropping a stone down a wellshaft and never hearing even a splash i feared you cannot imagine what i have feared sir well rest easy deveaux assured him theres a small bag of correspondence for you and your ship sir and a thick packet of letters from your wife peyton could not believe you would ignore her so callously he stated in his note to me that he suspects your superiors are withholding your mail to and fro i know commodore garvey was wroth with me over walkers cay and john finneys trial he sent us down here out of anger but i never thought hed be that vindictive to me youve written him often then deveaux demanded weekly sir were running out of all manner of stores except for food and drink sir if this goes on my shipll be crippled for lack of new spars rope and sailcloth yet without specific orders i am barred from returning to the navy dockyard at nassau and i trust youve saved a fair copy of your every plea sir deveaux hinted slyly as a precaution for the future aye sir thats customary and in black ink too alan had to grin as he said it but why would he interrupt my mail how can a man be so spiteful well discuss that later colonel deveaux told him once we get to my house you read your letters and fill yourself in on what has been happening in nassau in your absence then well talk more caroline was alive and well he went to her letters first reading the one with the most recent date to assure himself of her existence and her safety she wrote that she was blooming big as a mare about to foal the baby was kicking lustily and that she carried low which the physician and midwife she had engaged considered signs of a manchild except for the usual complaints and pains the clumsiness and heaviness she reassured him that her confinement was not too hard although she missed the pleasures of riding gardening and doing her own cooking yet between betty mustin and wyonnie lewrie flushed with remorse as that similar name appeared she had no difficulties after that joyous news though there was a plaint that brought tears to his eyes as he read of her tightly denied fears that he and alacrity had been sunk or wrecked that he had died of some fever that hed fallen out of love with her and now spurned her that he did not really desire children and had turned his back on her as a rich man might discard an inconveniently pregnant mistress who was no longer as attractive or slim i try and try to imagine you being so involved in some stern duty that even our love must be relegated a poor second for the nonce but dearest alan it has been so long since you sailed away and not one word from you have i received nor any hearsay as to oh caroline christ he whispered through a throat constricted by his weeping goddamme no its not like that he would sail at once to nassau he vowed damn the threats or the consequences let them courtmartial him for anything they damned well pleased just so long as he could see her one more time and tell her that her fears had no substance and goddamn the bastard who did this to me he raged cruel malicious bastard how could anyone dozens and dozens of letters and theyve kept em all damme do they read em do they gloat over her pain by christ ill have their hearts blood for thisl on the patio andrew deveaux and his wife sat in the shade and winced as they heard the strangled howl from within their drawing room that poor young man mrs deveaux shuddered and his terrified young wife andrew do you truly believe that his commodore keeps his letters deliberately dear i do deveaux scowled running his hands through his thick and unruly long blond hair that and a lot worse oh its foul i youre dead swear to jesus youre a dead man lewrie wailed id not wish to walk on lieutenant lewries bad side dear mrs deveaux frowned not even were i the king of france it took an hour for lewrie to collect himself enough to join them on the patio for tea though he was still fretful and jerking at inability to be in action at that instant he could not keep his handsstill and one crossed leg juddered upon the other as he rocked irately on his chair i trust your wife is well lieutenant lewrie deveaux asked aye sir alan said trying to be as gracious as his hosts the physician and midwife are confident the childs due late this month a boy they believe why i could be a father now even as we speak and your other letters are reassuring as well from my shore agent courts co my bank back home my grandmother in devon even one from my father in india caroline had saved them no longer he gulped down a threatening spasm of raw emotion no longer believing i could or would respond to her until i returned to nassau sore as he hurt he had to grin slightly remembering what his father sir hugo had penned it had begun you silly rantipoling dog sir have i not drummed into you one should rent not purchase quim that smile however was just as quickly gone god its so petty so base so cruel to her its jack finney deveaux declared bluntly sugar finney how could he get at fleet mail sir alan gaped not finney directly deveaux allowed i doubt he has interests in your personal letters but you did anger him when you caught his ship trading in pirated goods and you stung him upon his sorest spot when you burned the cache and hauled him into court he has powerful friends sir and money enough to buy anyone he desires so even you believe hes a pirate sir alan hoped aloud im certain of it deveaux stated firmly so hes bought himself a clerk in the commodores office then that way hed know where our patrols would be so he might tell his piratical confederates alan realized and he never sued us because he would have been exposed as a smuggler at the least those goods we burned were never landed or bonded and all this time rodgers and i were fearing hed end up making us jump through his lawyers hoops i expect it cost him considerable to stay out of court on any smuggling charges to boot deveaux smiled thinly the assembly in which i sit sir the courts the governors council see here sir nassau is an offalditch an open sewer a cesspit of corruption and all is for sale when i was awarded my grant of land for what little i did to retake new providence i was more than happy to settle on cat island did you know even this salubrious isle was named long ago for an arthur catt a pirate and does that not tell you something about the bahamas sir most of the year i am quite content to avoid nassau with all its backstabbing moneygrubbing squalor and limit my visits to assembly sessions even so this far happily removed we still get a whiff of its corruption like an ill wind from an abbatoir i have heard rumours peyton did not speak of them in his letter to you some vague hints sir but i took them to involve my letters and my exile he wasnt sure what had happened to me either he had written before demanding me to answer him to answer caroline or tell him why i would not but how could i i never got those either and thought to use me as intermediary after he no longer could trust the navy to forward mail or trust the navy at all sir colonel deveaux said grimly hes begun to suspect something foul in our government and said to me hed also begun to nose about to make discreet inquiries i only pray to god they are discreet therere thousands at stake in this and the men involved are not above murder to keep their doings quiet and to ask about john finneys doings though a power of talk about him is common coin people love to gossip about calico jack hes the sort who gets talked about and loves it do you know him well sir alan inquired well enough only as an acquaintance mind deveaux smirked hes not the sort one has for a firm or trustworthy friend i hear a lot of people say the same colonel deveaux nodding acquaintances before the dons landed and allies when i mustered the volunteers he helped arm them you see and brought his battleworthy bully bucks along deveaux chuckled in such need as we were beggars cant be choosers back to those suspicions and the rumours though drunk sailors will brag and the brag in taverns on the docks and in overthehill is that some of finneys old hands were up to their old games once their wartime prize money ran out as you and commander rodgers believed too smart to take british ships but assured that no oned cry over foreign vessels if they got taken not only was finney profiting from the cargoes he bought up cheap but he was selling arms and powder to support them out of his chandlery and brokering the best ships they took after they were repainted and renamed and all marks of their former identity erased just as you thought in the beginning and i wish wed caught just one of em who could have been made to swear to that at his trial sir alan growledfaint hopes of that lieutenant lewrie deveaux smiled look at how quietly doyles men went to the gallows i suspect finney was no longer dealing with doyle just too untrustworthy and wild but hed done so in the past and they could have exposed it all to save their lives were it not for the certain knowledge of what finney would have done to their wives sweethearts and parents their children i find it hard to remember that murderous buccaneers have such sir alan responded now who stands to profit most from their depredations deveaux prodded who gains who loses if it ends finney of course sir alan said quickly hes reaping a bumper harvest from it and undercutting the other bay street traders something sinful im surprised they havent done for him long ago ah but he only undercuts them by a few pence overall so as long as their prices stay high they have no complaints deveaux said with a crafty glint in his eyes british ships are not bothered so their insurance rates stay low foreign traders are discouraged also keeping cheaper goods off the market to compete with theirs most of the time at least now who else might profit by this well the shipshusbands in england the shipowners here in the bahamas alan pondered insurance companies and mercantile interests in england stap me i spose that pleases parliament too if they own commercial interests or members who are owned by merchants parliament is pleased brokers and bankers in the city colonel deveaux chanted the privy council is pleased and so do i assume is his majesty king george revenues are up insurance is low trade flows freely and piracy is a minor inconvenience for foreign competitors only just the thing for dons frogs and crude rebel yankees and not so much piracy that anyone has to really do anything about it until you came along that is and quashed doyles band like so many noxious bugs you even made our royal governor look good surely not the governor sir alan frowned you cannot mean that finney could purchase a royal governor were the bahamas still owned by the old proprietors but were a crown colony now and oh not maxwell deveaux barked in sour humour our previous governor was decent enough and certainly not this new clown our third earl of dunmore hes too rich to bribe and so arrogant hed be insulted if one tried lord dunmore was royal governor of virginia before the revolution you know and i do think he started it all by himself had he not been such a venal greedy lofty pustulant toad as to set off patrick henry and thomas jefferson we deveaux had to sip his tea to calm down no lewrie lord dunmore was born without a jot of brains and hes lost ground as hes aged while he may be grasping and greedy hed never scruple piracy i was thinking of someone a trifle lower down someone nautical perhaps you cant mean lewrie almost choked on his tea damme but your pardons mistress deveaux commodore garvey sir what possible motive could he have beyond money deveaux snorted think how does one enforce the navigation acts how does one succeed in command of a foreign squadron and prosper suppressing piracyd suit lewrie said rankled by deveauxs impatient tone keep down smuggling keep the sea lanes safe seize ships and goods not british and oh and avoid getting sued to his hairline for false arrest christ pardons again maam as long as finney and his crowd pillage only foreign ships hes every bay street merchants darling the competition is frightened off so he doesnt have an armada of interlopers to deal with so our weak squadron isnt overrun and if finney does garveys dirty work the navy isnt sued so often and money of course and money of course deveaux echoed and how is it done were too few already sir to really patrol the bahamas alan said shutting his eyes in thought for a moment finney would be told which areas are unpatrolled maybe finney asks him to keep warships away from certain cays or he could send our worst officers knowing which ones are just too bonelazy stupid or fearful to intervene to certain areas in like manner once you and commander rodgers are perceived as energetic officers you are sent very far away deveaux added to isolate you from this years playing field so there will not be any court of inquiry at which any dangerous discoveries might appear that would harm either garvey or finney and your evidence from walkers cay is lost forever peyton boudreau has heard some whisperings about that some very guarded rumours so far one goes we wont have no more trouble from those sods any longercalico jacks stopped their business for us he overheard that one personally captain lewrie which sent him to digging and suspecting well im damned sir alan breathed despise garvey though i may and youd best believe i do still hes a commission sea officer sir and a senior one a man sworn and an english gentleman to condone piracy for a price thats lewrie spluttered i know you must consider me hopelessly naive colonel deveaux but condoning finneys piracy is condoning wholesale murder peyton boudreau is a toplofty aristocratic cynic lieutenant lewrie deveaux said with wistful amusement or at least he poses as one a hard man to shock yet even he found it hard to dismiss after a time there were too many rumours too much muttered gossip to ignore theres a toast thats heard in overthehill that finneys old mates and sailors enjoy to our navyour own and the one we rent dya see hes learned enough to lay evidence with the solicitorgeneral william wylly hes another loyalist not so long in these islands that hes been corrupted nor will ever be if his repute is as good as ive heard they were going to peek into garveys finances stap me sir should finney get wind of it though alan said i know thank god he had enough sense to see wylly instead of proceeding further on his own i fear for him we like him very much sir and theres too much at stake for them to go gentle with him if his investigation was exposed as do i and caroline sir alan assured them remote as you are here on cat island how do you converse so easily with nassau ive a small schooner i know nothing of the sea myself you know deveaux confessed with a small laugh but with packet boats so rare or irregular i thought to establish a mailboat service for my own use and the use of my neighbors it breaks even just i must get a letter to caroline alan exclaimed and one to mister boudreau as well warning him tell me your schooner is here anchored in the bight due to sail two days hence deveaux was quick to reassure him your wife will be overjoyed to hear from you at last instruct her to send future letters here addressed to me better yet have her give them to peyton so shes not seen with my mailboat captain and we will have to pray no one will suspect him sending mail to me an old friend from south carolina the fewer who know youre in communication with nassau again the better for a lot of people you dont think finney or his mates might harm caroline do you sir alan paled i told you there were thousands at stake in this captain lewrie deveaux cautioned sternly theres no telling what they might do to protect their reputations and their profits it might be best if she could give no sign to anyone that she had heard from you i understand sir ill tell her alan said rising with your permission colonel deveaux ill go back aboard alacrity with mail to cheer my people and letters to write lord thank you for everything colonel deveaux i cannot begin to express my gratitude even if my exile was mere spite f m forever in your debt for being able to exchange letters with my caroline again he pumped deveauxs hand energetically before i sail though sir alan added could i have a fair copy of all that you and mister boudreau suspect before we had no way to prove finney guilty none a court would accept this time we just might have a chance of having his head on a plate and nailing commodore garveys hide to my mainmast into the bargain you will have everything captain lewrie deveaux promised but sail sir for where not nassau i beg you its too early to tip your hand before mr wylly finishes his secret investigation nay sir tis far too late im thinking alan countered in a fever to be on his way but not nassau good lord sir im banned from going there am i not but he concluded with a crafty smile i dont recall commodore garvey saying a blessed thing to keep me from sailing south south sir deveaux was forced to query with a frown to put my wits together with commander rodgers sir lewrie told him gaily and after that why one never knows sir chapter abeam the trades on a soldiers wind alacrity flew like some mythical courier threading between rum cay and watlings and out to deep ocean taking the outside passage noreast of samana cay a days run of nautical miles from one noon to the next when they shot the sun theyd gained west and north another days runll put us in turks passage sir lieutenant ballard nodded happily as he stowed his sextant away after taking noon sights wish to god wed done this months ago lewrie paced restless and impatient garvey might have relented whippet may no longer be in the caicos he hadnt relented against us sir so why should he spare her before alacrity ballard shrugged i still cant absorb the fact our commodore is up to his neck in collusion with finney and his pirates money lewrie snapped scanning his masts to see if there was one more place where stunsls or staysls could be deployed that wasnt already being used it all boils down to money what happens to the crews of the pirated ships he never sees and its no concern of his even if he did sometimes wonder bout it then money is a great salve to ones conscience god knows when i stole that french commissary gold in it did a power o good for mine alan confessed to himself with a rueful grin sails ho the mainmast lookout called from the crosstrees of the upper mast deck there two ships beatin norwest fine on the bows whats showing ballard hallooed back in that deep carrying voice which was a surprise for most to hear coming from such a small man topsls bove the horizon sir courses a corner under all plain sail the answer came wailing back no ones running from pirates then theyd have their royals and tgallants flying else lewrie speculated damme as much as i hate to well have to close em and speak em they might be yankee interlopers shall we board them if they are sir ballard queried alan tried to imagine how long a delay that would behours a whole day if they had to inspect cargoes and manifests fetchedto no mister ballard well close em and see if they frighten off with a stern warning he announced we cant spare the time sir the lookout said after skinning down a stay to the deck captn sir i seen those ships afore ones whippet sir and the others that yankee merchantman we saved last year the sarah and jane whippet by god lewrie whooped with sudden delight thankee lord thankee kindly mister ballard did you hear sir wear us hard on the wind get us up to windward of em so we may take station on em as they fetch us and get my gig down and ready aye aye sir it was whippet shepherding the dowdy sarah and jane of the year before off west caicos as they came hullup over the horizon and the distance between them shrank lewrie could make out a yankee flag flying beneath the red ensign aboard sarah and jane as a prize alacrity reduced sail and as they came abeam hauled her wind to leeward and rounded up a quartermile off whippets starboard side all three vessels then fetched up into the winds and lewrie was in his gig and off towards whippet before rodgers could hoist captain repair on board damn my eyes what the devilre you doin down here lewrie rodgers shouted pumping his hand energetically after the salutes were done youd not be poachin in my own game park would ya now theres been wondrous news from nassau sir so i news from nassau rodgers gawped getting keener then youre leagues ahead o me lewrie i havent gotten letter onefrom anybody since i fetched turks island thank god i stumbled over this yankee clown buyin an sellin bold as brass in hawks nest harbour which gives me a legitimate excuse tsail back to new providence aye sir but lewrie tried to interject but rodgers was on one of his tears damme sir whippets ready tdrop her quickwork same as the royal george an sink at her moorins rodgers ranted on copperin or no she leaks like a sieve theres a forest o weed on her and i suspect im teredowormed thank christ here comes an interloper for me to arrest an take back to admiralty court so i may get her into a dockyard fore we keel over an go under sir if you would but listen to me well if it aint young captain lewrie sarah and janes captain said coming on deck to join them now youre here young sir i trust youll tell commander rodgers how i aided the royal navy and let me go bout me innocent occasions as you did last year sir ive already give him enough threats bout false arrest and all but will he heed me sir he will not ive noticed alan snapped in exasperation captain grant i recall delighted to make your acquaintance again sir i did warn you did i not sir that you should not return to bahamian waters im but a poor merchant skipper sir and later perhaps sir lewrie cut him off commander rodgers ive abandoned my patrol area theres news from nassau and we have to talk its urgent sir signal ballard to get underway rodgers nodded and let us go below mister cargyle get sail on her and resume our course good christ rodgers sighed when lewrie had finished hehad cut his hair much shorter for summer close to the scalp as an urchin infested with lice and fleas and he rubbed his stubble with two hands the bastard the son of a bitch no moren a bastard hes a bastardly gullion in league with finney an his pirates i always wondered how he could afford that palacio of his damn near good as the governors mansion an filled with fine plate an furnishins a commodore wont draw more a yearn a postcaptain of a st rate an ј or so wont cover half his expenses highs hes been livin him an that chickabiddy wife o his that semiugly daughter an good chaplain townsley an his lawful blanketre sure to be expensive to keep as well whatd ya wager lewrie he banks with finneys private merchant bank an therell be no way your mr boudreau and solicitorgeneral wyllyd ever smoke him out i hadnt thought of that sir lewrie deflated as he poured them more claret from rodgers muchdepleted final stock surely though there must be something we can do if the investigation cant convict them im tempted tsail into nassau harbour all guns blazin myself rodgers gloomed knocking back half a glass nother reason for action damme but im outa champagne wish we knew which ships were patrolling where that might give us a clue as to where to go banned though we are from going north lewrie commented with a sneer weve this interloper grant as a fine excuse rodgers perked up leaning his elbows on the table they shared he has tface the admiralty court for violatin the navigation acts not both of us sir lewrie counseled you and whippet for certain and the governors council and the bahamian assembly were kicking round the idea of turning nassau into a free port if they vote that in finneys undutied goods are safe as houses from here on out might as well void the navigation acts too i suppose did you really let him off last year rodgers grinned needed his testimony hellish bad sir lewrie blushed only way i knew to have evidence the pirates were caught in the act but i thought he was smart enough to take my warning to heart what was captain grant up to sellin bricks an timber buyin salt so the yankee fisheries can preserve their stockfish for export rodgers sniffed hell name a good he wasnt sellin so hes bung to his deckheads in salt now sirlewrie asked aye takin it north as evidence against him hmm sir lewrie grinned what sir rodgers grinned in reply expectantly i was thinking sir that bagged salt is just as good as dirtfilled gabions to absorb roundshot and musketry lewrie mused whatever are ya drivin at rodgers asked sitting up bait sir lewrie explained were we to find where pirates are operating we could trail sarah and jane under yankee colours as a tempting bit of bait with a navy crew armed and ready for anything and just whered we do the trailin lewrie rodgers demanded we havent more of a clue than we did last year walkers cay was a fluke o fortune he winced of a rough sort mindmy lieutenant ballard suggested that one of us put into harbour island or spanish wells on eleuthera lewrie went on quickly theyre major ports and a man o war from the squadron should be in the area or at anchor they could inform us where our ships are operating sir now we know finneys a pirate for certain now we almost have it as gospel our commodores involved where our ships are would point the way or more to the point where our ships are not or where fools such as your lieutenant courtney cowflop hangs his hat rodgers grinned briefly then scowled lieutenant ballard god hes the one got us banished when you get right down to it all that talk o his bout irrefutable evidence and that missin slaver matilda damme sir but wasnt he right lewrie pointed out matilda was pirated and her people slaughtered theres a knacky wit churning in that head of his sir clickclack like some german clockwork i know hes right about this too sir pray god peyton boudreau was wrong for once lewrie cautioned his eagerness dont let him be a slender reed one couldnt count on and alan also warned himself keep your bloody mouth quiet for once i cant urge him any harder or hell balk like a hunter at the high fence we either pull this off successfully or we get cashiered at the easiestor hanged for mutineers rodgers twisted and turned for many long minutes like a corpse on the gibbet shifting restless and frightened on his chair trying to decide what to do that wouldnt ruin his career if they failed theres captain childs in guardian rodgers said at last i think he should be informed lewrie about the commodore that is shit lewrie thought the more who know the more who talk sir and word gets back to garvey and finney and then well have abandoned our patrol areas for nought alan shrugged taking the softest approach he could if coltrops in an eleutheran port wordll get back to them you can wager a rouleau o guineas ont rodgers spat lips pursed in a sour pucker dammit thell dammit thell though if they get away a second time if we end up with nothing to show for it not if they take the bait sir lewrie promised hmm rodgers stalled he slapped the table top hard with the flat of one hand damme lets do it then this yankeedoodle captain grant i spose ill have tlet him off same as you did once we find our pirates i fear so sir lewrie nodded all but turning st catherine wheels with barely repressed glee a small price to pay after all best it be whippet stands into port to water lets say commander rodgers schemed you take over escort for sarah and jane make what arrangements you will aboard her and stand offandon topsl down over the horizon tthe eastrd pray god childs an guardian be the ship in port not that lieutenant cowflop he may be as out of touch with nassau as we were sir lewrie hoped out loud and that somnolent arse wouldnt stir up his bones to see the second coming somnolent sir rodgers laughed rising and fetching his hat damme but youve been readin again aint ya after i told ya it was bad for ya for shame well it was only the one book sir lewrie chuckled getting to his feet to drain his glass and a damn thin un at that lets go on deck then and beard our captain grant sir and then lay a course for eleuthera chapter sewallis alan lewrie lay sleeping in his cradle at last after a noisy afternoon of colic and wailing that had quite worn his young mother to a frazzle caroline sat at the side of the cradle formed in the shape of a miniature dory that a new england loyalist joiner had made for her months before feeling vaguely disloyal women were supposed to adore children she thought wearily it was a given that all a young woman could wish for in this life was a brood of offspring to tend but so far one was more man enough to deal with and after six weeks of maternal devotion following the boys birth she wasnt so sure she cared to experiencethe terror and pain again the physician had rated her labor easy a mere nine hours to hold her firstborn like a tightly swaddled roast at the end of it to peer into those grave little eyes had not seemed worthy enough reward then had come the interrupted nights at the mercy of his cries the shambling sham of wakefulness between precious naps to brave his supping at her breasts with the frantic lustiness of his absent father almost dreading the aching until heloise and betty had suggested a wet nurse to spare her to let wyonnie tend him for a few hours her body felt destroyed where was the lissome figure shed had she wondered when she bathed there was still a heaviness a gravid and palpable puffiness that only now was departing as she began to take rides and putter in her gardens her kitchen and pantry and the stretch marks which traversed her formerly alabaster flesh like fault lines or desert tributaries of a failed river would alan be repulsed by the sight of her when he returned she could no longer claim to feel like the lithe girl shed beenand she had yet to feel comfortable accepting a role of young matron it was surreal yet she looked down at the puffy little face screwed up into a puckered repose and had to fight the urge to pick him up to hold him close to her to carry him out to the dogrun and croon to him as she sat and rocked in the clean air instead of the humid stuffiness of the bedroom permeated with the smells of incontinent infancy sewallis alan lewrie had been powdered and changed and she bent down fearful of waking him to inhale the aroma of his skin and of the milky cornsilk smells he bore like a hungary water she kissed him lightly brushed his little tuft of hair and sat back in her straightbacked chair with a fond smile in spite of all yes he was a darling baby most of the time with his fathers gray blue eyes but with her nose her paler hair and her mouth it felt more than odd to feel his tiny demanding lips at her nipples yet it was her mouth not alans you take a rest missus wyonnie offered entering the room i watch im fo awhile po chile cry hissef right out but he be bettah when e wakes dot obeahmons yarbs get rid de colic jus as i tole ya un de cornmeal fo dot rashll ease im and i expect hell wake up hungry caroline grinned with a wry lift to a brow god save womankind wyonnie from mens hungers all de mo reason ya naps a spell missus wyonnie chuckled in reply as she sat down opposite caroline and began to fan him i will and thank you wyonnie caroline said she left the room on tiptoe darling or not sewallis lewrie showed signs of a light sleeper and she felt shed more than earned this brief respite she paused in the parlor to open her stationery box and take out her letter from alan before going to the dogrun even though she had devoured it fifty times at least in the week since it had arrived it was forever new and reassuring hugging it to her bosom she went out onto the dogrun terrace where a fair wind was blowing and the air was so much cooler and fresher she took a seat in her rocker put up her feet on an embroidered padded footstool and began to read it all over again between small sips from a glass of rhenish all over again she savored his protestations of love his fear for her and the babys life his anguish at being separated so long and his inability to communicate with her once again caroline seethed with outrage at the injustice of their mail being cut off by how base commodore garvey could be she blushed as she read alans curses called down on finney and garvey knowing that she had used similar curses directed at him in the bleakest moments of her despair during his hellish silence or what shed called him during her labor she snickered two months i fretted she whispered damn peyton and heloise i know they didnt want me worried but they could have told me their suspicions to ease me but all was right again alan still loved her and with her harshest memories of pain and fear subsiding she was once more as much in love with him as the first moment she saw him and surely he would come back soon do something about finney and garvey hold her again and there would be no more cause for longing and dread the late afternoon heat was ebbing and a cool wind rushed into the dogrun alans noreast trades which might waft him home at last she finished her wine folded up the letter and slipped it onto the table under the wine glass then put her head back on the small lashedon pad to take wyonnies advice about a nap she eased the ache of her neck and shoulders with a shrug and a stretch closed her eyes took a deep breath and with a wistful smile fell asleep she woke in the twilight of another spectacular sundown rummy with barely eased exhaustion rocking forward with a start andlistening close for her babys waking cry which was what she thought had stirred her but it was a carriage bay street a narrow sandy track ran in front of their house and a second narrower sandandshell lane forked off southeast from the coast road parallel to the front porch for awhile before winding south along the garden to the great house a coach had turned in at the gate and now stood in the lane half hidden behind the tops of her palmetto hedge a man was walking towards her through the gate in the tabby wall and up the crushedshell path to the front porch caroline stood and peered to see who it was the hat was laced with gold and for a fleeting moment she thought it was alan returned hello the house a voice called anyone to home be they good god she whispered in alarm putting a hand to her mouth it was john finney ah there you be mistress lewrie finney said stepping upon the deep front porch and coming to her in the mouth of the dogrun a very good evenin to you mistress he took off his cocked hat laid it upon his chest and performed a deep formal bow one leg extended mister finney she replied trembling a little with fear that hed dare appear so boldly and to what do i owe this unasked visit why tis concern good lady finney replied stepping closer and making caroline wish to shy back though she stood her ground we heard youd birthed a fine manchild spittin image of his beautiful mother so tis said in the town yet never hide nor hair tbe seen of him nor your fine self since finney had a smile playing at the corners of his mouth and his eyes sparkled with secret merriment call it curiosity mistress caroline finney went on worry about how ye fare im that fond o children ya know and i wish tsatisfy meself that you were recovered an all and tgain a peek at the little lad if i be so bold now he is sleeping and its best hes not disturbed caroline rejoined losing her fear as her outrage took over and the crease in her forehead deepened he is quite well as am i sir but i am not yet receiving callers mister finney its not seemly for you to be here im not so polished as most ill tell ya mistress caroline finney shrugged with a fetching smile tis my lack o manners i most regret maam but i meant to assure meself o your good health and yer contentment i brought a few things for the little lad dya see gewgaws from me stores toys and pretties hope ya wont begrudge a feller bein so bold as to be offerin a fine young lady such as yer sweet self a few trifles t start the lad in life tis rough i come up

ought i could not accept any gift from you mister finney been a hot one tday mistress finney said fanning himself with his cocked hat and stepping even closer to her he picked up the wine bottle peered at the label and poured himself a glass of rhenish spilling a few drops on alans letter which was still on the table a glass o somethin coold be appreciated with yer permission ya got compny missus wyonnie said coming from the parlor side onto the dogrun oh company aye finney said taking a seat in one of the wooden chairs as if he owned the place praps mistress carolined be needin another glass woman fetch it i will not be needing another glass wyonnie and mister finney will be leaving caroline snapped really sir her eyes went to the letter and she almost gasped aloud at the idea of finney knowing that shed heard from alan of knowing what the boudreaus suspected and were investigating on the sly did he already know she wondered was that why hed come oh ill be on me way quick as a wink finney promised taking a tiny sip of the wine soons ive finished me drink i know how it is maam im the great bogeyman yeve heard smuch bad about an youre a proper lady but i do wish ttalk to ye mistress caroline an seemly or no i did bring presents fer the litlun wot you from the carolinasd call an injuns pipe o peace do sit an be mannerly just fer a bit very well mister finney caroline nodded sitting down in her rocker once more and reaching out for the letter to fold it up and put it deep in a sidepocket of her childtending apron a letter from home is it finney asked with a twinkle an do yer parents know o the blessed event yet maam i have written them sir but my post will not reach them for at least three months more caroline said relieved hed not seen it most tasty wine ya have mistress caroline finney saidone o me best imports i declare and does yer husband know sure an its that proud he must be tbe the father of a fine boy yell not have a glass with me no thank you mister finney caroline replied coolly raging though she was as finney played his cruel game with her like a cat at a house lizard i must keep my wits about me damme if i dont she thought with fear my son will awaken soon and want his supper and i must begin my own speaking of wyonnie do go up to the boudreaus and inform miss mustin well dine in one hour will you should sewallis wake up i can go in to him yes missus wyonnie replied and spun about to depart sewallis thatd be yer own fathers name now finney said how do you know that sir caroline frowned a terror growing ah call it me curiosity again wot killed the cat soons i saw you mistress caroline ive been that curious i have about you wot yer poets call worshippin from afar such a fine an handsome lady so refined an all here in our scruffy little islands like a goddess fell from heaven fergive me but ive asked about twas easy after all ye bein so well received at parties an such an so many people as impressed as i gossipin about ya an praisin ya to the skies and did that involve caroline began to blurt in accusation about her intercepted letters did that force you to name your new ship after me sir that was most rude and overassuming on your part i would never have given you that license mister finney she caught herself quickly and picked another complaint instead ships is ships are lovely creations caroline finney said with an almost mawkish rapture i but thought to name the handsomest o my vessels for the handsomest and finest lady o my acquaintance i know i shoulda asked but like i said im newcome tfine manners o the quality i was tryin to honour you thets all i wish you would change her name then sir caroline replied turning to see if wyonnie had fetched peyton boudreau from the great house to aid her yet people assume i did give my permission and i will brook no loose talk naturally im sure it is an honour but it was not one of my choosing ya dont choose honours mistress caroline they just come to ya finney laughed softly an tis the devils own bad cess tname a ship then change it think of it as a foolish gesture from a man o deep respeck respect for you i thought tcheer you abandoned as youve been a young wife with a child tcare for all alone in a hard world so far from home an all i am hardly abandoned sir caroline retorted getting to her feet if you ve quite finished i must insist you leave sir and i do not think it proper to take any presents from you she almost screamed as he seized her hands and held them harshly in rough but beringed bearpaw fists tell ya the truth now caroline he said losing his teasing bantering tone and looking up at her in part triumph part gruff shyness first night i saw ya dinin yer first night ashore i thought id seen an angel from heaven but there ya were with yer man such as e is a fine an proper young lady o the most refined ways wasted on a rantipolin rogue know what his nickname is caroline people call im the ramcat now hes sailed off an left ya joyless with a newborn babe tcare for an spurned ya fer another theres talk he wont even answer ya now yave had his child oh i seen ive seen you traipsin back from town so forlorn achin fer news o him an niver a letter did ya get more people gossiped the more me heart went out tya dear jesus is that why you did this to us caroline wanted to shout in his face you read them so youd know best how to play on my fears so you could have me it was all she could do to keep her face composed for fear of revealing too much tis a hard world it is with men like that in it caroline he went on with what she thought a wellrehearsed oration yere now a widow as much as if he died and good riddance tbad rubbish yer best shed o thet caterwauler but yer alone now now i know tis maybe a bad time tmention it an i niver was good with words like a proper feller o yer upbringin but i worship the ground ya walk on an thets the gospel truth caroline im a man with a whole heart an its yours tcommand with thoughts for none but you these many months past ive means tcare for ya tkeep ya in style an ease an you can trim my rough edges as ya get tknow me better as ya may come tlove me as much as i love you lass i mean tmake ya happy me girl i mean tdo right by ya caroline as none other can terrified as she was held prisoner with easy force no matter her attempts to pull away his words held her pinioned like a rabbit might be hypnotized by a rattlesnakes weavings yet finneys plaint of love presented in such a clumsy lugubrious and tearyeyed way was amusing to her as if she were watching an incredibly poor player in a french farce hawking up highflown sentiment she could not stifle a giggle escaping her lips nor a smile of cruel humour ah shes smilin she is finney cajoled misinterpreting sprised ya may be bein spooned ssoon by a rough un such as me but yer thinkin on it arent ya now now yer babes bom yer able tget out an about more we could spend time with each other let ya get accustomed tthe idea accustomed tme dearest caroline an let go of me sir she hissed back pronouncing each word in arch contempt let go of me and leave this house and never come here again even as she said it she knew she should have played along to delude him until alan could come back until mr boudreau could gather enough evidence to hang this rogue but her grievance against finney was too great and her utter revulsion too quick to contain longer theres fine things i could buy ya things i wish flay at yer feet me town house where yad be the finest lady he pleaded never she shouted back struggling against his grip i am a married woman most happily married sir your suit is not only rude and unseemly its odious to me let me go sir now she was amazed that he did in shock perhaps release her hands to sit back in stupefied hurt all his hopes confounded she turned and sprinted for the side door to the parlour slamming it shut behind her and dropping the latchbar she rushed to her bedroom scything herself for being a fool for not being able to play him along until he was ruined she massaged her wrists where hed held her and felt soiled she heard a noise and froze dear god the latchstring she cringed it wasnt pulled and he could get in the keylock she hadnt thought to turn she opened her chifforobe and took out a large walnut box and set it on the bed peyton boudreau had wished to give her some pistols the week before after alans letter had come and she had accepted never thinking things would become so desperate this pair were twinbarreled heavy as fireplace andirons but already loaded dear god save us she whispered as she heard the latchbar rise and fall with a creak heard the squeak of door hinges wheres wyonnie why havent they come in desperation she picked up the first pistol and drew back both hammers to fullcock then did the same with the second she took a deep breath to steady herself thinking of earlier times in north carolina and flipped up the frizzens on the pans to check her primings as her brothers had shown her caroline finney said no longer mocking no longer pleading she whirled the pistols hidden behind her skirts behind her thighs and came to the door of the bedroom to deny him entrance taking one moment to assure herself that her son was still safe no further mister finney she warned him therere people me coachman liams got yer nigger wench so we got all the time in the world girl finney smirked an i know fer a fack yer betty mustins off tdine with others so that wont wash either listen tme good now an heed me he said advancing on her slowly yer fine man left ya tfounder you an the babe caroline an he aint niver comin back tya his sort dont they takes their pleasure then when things get inconvenient for em why divil a care do they have fer the poor sad objeck o their lusts twenty pound an out o the parish girl fore the magistrate sics is hounds on ya i had me a sister she went thet way all starryeyed over a feller thought hed do right by her that rich mans boy but back she come half dead from havin his git and rooned fer life an us too poor thelp her dya see now wot ya want with a life like that when i kin offer ya he crooned slowly advancing upon her no closer caroline swore raising the first pistol out of my house now finney checked for one brief moment of openmouthed surprise then put his hands on his hips flaring out the skirts of his coat and rocked on the balls of his feet oh tis a crackin great barker ya got there miss finney chuckled girl as delicate an refined as yer sweet self has no business messin with such brutes thats a mans thing girl put that down now an lets be easy with each other sewallis alan lewrie took that moment to wake up and begin to fret and wail see there caroline finney japed even yer babe knows yer doin wrong put that down girl tend yer babe ill pour us some wine an well sit an get acquainted i said get out mister finney caroline shouted caroline darlin girl finney cooed stepping closer with no sign of fear arms out as though to cosset her out of a pet my she pulled the trigger of the righthand barrel and the heavypistol leapt and bucked in her hand near enough to tear away from her jaysis finney yelped and backpedaled quickly six paces to the door there was a fresh hole in the left breast of his coat level with his heart having passed through front and back as it had been held out away from his body that was not a lucky shot mister finney caroline glowered as she took aim with the gun going for his groin with one eye shut my brothers burgess and governour taught me to shoot before they went off with their volunteer regiment to fight for their king you you bitch he fumed he started to rush forward but she fired the lefthand barrel and he stopped short turning pale as a corpses belly as the lead ball stung the flesh between his thighs inches below his genitals and before he could rise or even speak caroline brought up the second pistol in her left hand no more teasing sir the next ones for your black heart she shouted over her babys screams get out of here you beaunasty bogtrotter run you son of a whore buy yourself a fetching drab in town and pledge your love to her go roll in the muck like the irish hog you are sir but i warn you if you do not leave my house this instant youll be a dead bogtrotter as god is my judge teeth almost chattering in her head hand sweaty and slick on the curved butt of the pistol and her vision tunneling she was just about at the end of her tether but the twin barrels never wavered and then thankfully there came the sound of running feet thudding through her garden and onto the stone of the dogrun drawn by her shots what the devil peyton boudreau shouted dashing inside with a smallsword in one hand and a bellmouthed coachmans shotgun in the other his freedman black majordomo was behind him with a musket and daniel wyonnies husband backed them up with a cutlass you dog sir id have the bailiffs on you dammef i wont sir for visiting a lady o my acquaintance boudreau finney attempted to bluster for frightenin a lady enough to have her shoot you peyton sneered in reply something at which he was awfully good trying to rape a married lady were you you scurrilous illbred scum damme thatll make a merry tune for the town criers tomorrow thatll be a fine topic for a broadside sheet to be handed about in every tavern calico jack not only spurned but nigh debollocked by a woman defending herself with a pistol haw haw get out of here you wouldnt dare finney shot back i would caroline vowed i will i promise you ephraim take his sword pat him down for a knife or pistol boudreau instructed his majordomo pressing the muzzle of the shotgun to finneys breast tell your brute outside to let go daniels wife or ill have your hearts blood do it or its your life sir and worm no more to me than gnats piss at this moment i most heartily assure you haw come near my house again come near mistress lewrie one more time anywhere on new providence and youre a dead man do you even dare to ride past my property ill shoot you dead in the road as i would a rabid cur sir that all of it ephraim good now begone hear me begone you son of a bitch haw haw with finney disarmed caroline at last lowered the pistol and carefully rode the hammers forward one at a time almost blind to the task through tears of relief her hands now trembling like sparrows wings now that the threat was ended she was in horror of what she had almost done shed never aimed at anything but stationary gourds or bottles in her life and here shed almost taken a mans life she wanted to throw up to scream to fall to the floor and let her shuddering wails loose at last but now that finney was being herded out the door and off the property she went instead to her baby to pick him up and try to comfort him as he squalled in terror she held him snug to her chest and shoulder patting his back and stroking him dandling him up and down as she paced the bedroom in a small circle and commanding herself not to faint as long as he needed her much as she wished for a ladylike spell of the vapors there there little man she wept trying to smile for him there there its all over bad mans gone and wont be coming to hurt you mommas here and she wont ever let anyone scare you ever again sewallis swear to god baby swear to god and your daddyll be home soon your daddys coming and hell make everything better youll see and pray god make it soon she thought as she paced chapter its walkers cay sir lewrie said at last again commander rodgers scoffed they wouldnt dare oh theyd dare sir lewrie replied grimly and think it a knacky jest its perfect as a hideout as we already know and why would anyone ever suspect them to return to it after we scoured it so well before sir added to that meres no navy patrol stationed in the abacos except for a visit now and then by a cutter and never to the north of pelican harbour marsh harbour or carleton settlement finally sir theres that portuguese captain we spoke to lieutenant ballard stuck in a hopeful note in his voice on his passage south past walkers cay he reported seeing masts and lights ashore as it grew dark there should be no one there sir he wasnt chased rodgers muttered he saw no pirates they didnt see him at twilight sir to the eastrd of the island lewrie suggested he got lucky god i wish youd never talked me into this commander rodgers sighed heavily rubbing his face in puzzlement god almighty ive half a mind to could be finneys guineaman sir lewrie added still caching undutied goods there still smuggling we could burn him out hurt him sore as we did the last time and then be off for nassau with evidence enough this time to prosecute him for smuggling if nothing else come on you dithering twit lewrie thought dont whiffle out on us now there is that rodgers allowed grudgingly sarah and janes ready sir alan pressed do you transfer your marines into her lieutenant ballard can be off walkers cay by dawn to see whats what if no pirates come out to pursue him he could sail in anyway and how would they know he wasnt there to deliver goods sir ill give up thirty hands to help and take captain grant and his crew aboard alacrity to guard em whilst you keep whippet fully manned and if its arthur doin it theres less involvement for you to fear you henhearted dog alan thought upon my head be it oh very well then rodgers said at last permission to go wrung from him like a dishclout in a mangle right sir ballard said quickly ill go aboard sarah and jane at once with your leave sir with your marines well soon make hash ofem if you will excuse me sir ill see mister ballard over the side and transfer my spare hands over to the merchantman alan said rising to gather his hat and sword and they left the greatcabins before commander rodgers could change his mind christ i thought he was going to back out lewrie complained in a soft voice as the sideparty mustered to see them off he is a damned good seaman though ballard assayed with a wry expression if not he shrugged in conclusion well here you are then arthur lewrie said clasping him by the shoulders at arms length an independent action of your very own at last take joy of it thank you for getting it for me sir think hed want his first lieutenant that involved alan japed in a whisper if it all goes bust then its less risk for him and lord i owe you after conch bar dont i should have given you charge of the landing and i could have gone into aemilia to put some bottom in fool coltrop hindsights better than no sight at all i guess but i know youll do us proud just take care of yourself mind as stiff as you are me lad id miss you should anything happen be your knacky self but not too bold arthur coming from you alan thats a wry un ballard snorted do but listen to yourself gainsaying bold sir god speed then arthur lewrie smiled stepping back to doff his hat to him mister ballard now go catch me some pirates for my breakfast sarah and jane stood westnorwest loafing along under all plain sail the striped flag of the united states flying from her mizzenmast truck marine lieutenant pomeroys thirtyfive privates one corporal and sergeant were sprawled on the deck in what shade they could find dressed in their usual slopclothing for workingparties though with their brown bess muskets hangers and bayonets close by ballard was showing only ten seamen on deck or aloft what would be expected of a skinflint yankee shipmaster with the others napping below or resting beside the greatguns sarah and jane mounted only twelve sixpounders little better than alacritys batteries with two of those disposed in the mates wardroom below facing aft or up on the forecastle for chase guns the rest were spaced out to either beam at every second gun port so that sarah and jane designed for a stronger armament sailed en flute like a piccolo with open holes huge bags of white gold had been hauled up from her holds to line either beam between the guns piled up three deep to make breastworks on the gun deck on the sailtending gangways above to absorb the expected musketry and the impact of a pirateships guns there was a low breastwork around the quarterdeck and focsle as well with a final redoubt of bagged salt around the double wheel and binnacle to shelter the helmsmen dawn for fair sir midshipman parham said looking at his pocket watch and my watch is accurate for once theres a wonder reefs an breakers tlarboard the masthead lookout sang out on the orizon sir that should be about six miles to leeward ballard told mem muttering half to himself close enough to prance past walkers cay and see what comes out but not so close that they think were stupid mister parham go aloft youve seen these isles beforefrom the sea tell me which were closest to walkers cay grand cay or romers aye aye sir schooner to loord sir the lookout called suddenly hull down an bows on two points off the larboard bows belay mister parham ballard said with only a slight twitch of his mouth to indicate any excitement or notice it no longer matters he paced aft to the taffrails savoring the windward side which was a captains by right then back to the railings overlooking sarah and janes waist and gun deck hands clasped on his rump fingers not even twining upon each other as much as he wished to do so arthur ballard had a firm grip on his emotions as a man who aspired to the status of gentleman should as a taciturn selfcontrolied navy man should he envied lewrie his boyish lack of control his ability to enthuse or show anger sorrow or frustration so easily and lewries ability to command and keep the hands respect even if he did let go but it was not his style it was not for him so ballard paced and the sun rose in the sky as the schooner stood out from the islands seeming as if to pass ahead of the trading ship in all innocence and sarah and jane kept her course and her somnolent lack of notice schooners crossin ahead fine on the bows an two mile off hell haul his wind keeping the wind gauge and fall down upon our starboard side ballard announced as he paused in his pacing near the wheel see he tacks as if hes cleared ahead of us soon sir parham inquired all but wriggling like a puppy on his first hunt in excitement time for quarters sir calmly mister parham calmly you are never to show fear or excitement to the people ballard instructed theyre steadier for your being steady aye aye sir parham grimaced as if his bladder were full and ballard were detaining him from dashing forrud to the head hmm arthur ballard sighed peering at the schooner which was then a point or two off their starboard bows sailing off soueasterly closehauled i should think now mister parham beat to quarters but keep them down and out of sight lieutenant pomeroy your men to arms if you please on the gun deck still stay away from the gangways until theyre closeaboard bearin up sir the lookout announced hes tackin cross the wind to the starboard tack about threequarters of a mile off the starboard bows ballard muttered very nicely done even better than wearing off the wind to fall down on us and round up alongside on the same course saves sparing hands on the sheets and braces to continually adjust on a rounding course to come closeaboard us do you see mister parham that means more men free to serve his guns and make up a boarding party i see sir and all settled down and ready for it when it comes ballard went on with his praise one may learn a lesson or two even from a pirate once tacked to a parallel course with sarah and jane the schooner hauled her wind almost at once and began to fall down on them fast giving them little warning and pinning their ship between threatened gunfire and the jagged teeth of the coral reefs to south and west if they chose to loose sail and run they couldnot find enough searoom for an escape nor could they tack and flee soueast as long as their foe lay off their starboard bows panic party mister odrado ballard shouted designated men ran to the shrouds to scale them as if going aloft to cast off reefs and make sail others rushed to the gangways for the braces to their squaresails to adjust their angle for a new course and more speed hands at quarters sir early the quartermasters mate said guns run out to the portsills an port lashings cast off swivels loaded tompions out an manned larboard gun crews shifted to starboard an that lieutenant pomeroy is ready to mount his men on the starboard gangway very well mister early ballard nodded quickly then smirked just a trifle i wonder mister early do you think they will run up the jolly roger or is such a convention out of date these days well i don know sir it early began then paused ah thats a little joke isnt it mister ballard sir aye mister early ballard said with a sober face but a feeble joke away with you now and stand ready the schooner was sidling up to them quickly closing the range to about a cable she was as gaudy as a spanish royal galley tricked out with gold leaf on bow and stern down her upper bulwark rails and around her entry ports there had to be at least seventy men in her crew making ballard wonder how they got out of each others way when working the ship he could espy a larboard battery of five ninepounder cannon and at least half a dozen swivel guns on either beam lets not look too easy ballard called mister woods do you fire the forrud chase guns make it look clumsy one sixpounder fired raising a splash near the enemys bows a moment later the schooner fired in reply everybody down ballard called though he kept his feet and his calm composure as the heavy balls droned in sarah and jane leapt and cried in protest as roundshot tore through her thin scantlings and bulged the bulwarks inwards bagged salt thumped and tumbled and some bags burst apart spilling white crystals about like snow ahoy there came a call from across the narrowing channel between them strike yer colours cut yer braces an sheets and letflyall or ill let ya have another broadside gimme no resistance and youll still be alive when this is over show me fight though letflyall mister odrado ballard shouted putting a panicky edge to his voice then turned to shout to the pirate schooner with his brass speaking trumpet hold your fire for gods sake well strike to you mercy in the name of god hold your fire the american flag came tumbling down to trail astern as its halyard was cut and the sails began to luff and thunder in disarray now sir parham insisted not yet mister parham ballard said calmly now remember well do it the way our captain said he served a french privateer during the late war close enough to smell em first but do you extend to lieutenant pomeroy my compliments and tell him its time he posted his men on the starboard gangway below the bulwarks and be ready to volley at close range aye aye sir parham replied dashing off in haste in spite of ballards cautions the schooner was now a quartercable off not fifty yards away and almost at decent musketshot her boarding party was already up on the bulwarks with liftlines and parrel lines dangling so they could swing over to board once they got hull to hull others poised at bow and stern with grappling irons and she fired another lying broadside sarah and jane was shaken hard ballard could hear her timbers wail as they were shattered below hear scantlings and bulwarks starred open with ragged holes as roundshot ripped into her but the bags of salt kept deadly wood splinters from flying to scythe her crew down close pistolshot ballard muttered smiling thinly at last open your ports as you bear fire doubleshotted guns erupted in smoke and flames chainshot to take rigging down the halves of the balls flying apart as they left the muzzles and whining through the short space between them linked with chain that made them whirl like birds wings canister on top of that bags crammed with musket balls that spread out like gigantic shotgun pellets in a cloud of deadly lead all aimed at the upper bulwarks all designed to take down people instead of rigging marines ballard screamed as the smoke ragged away enough to see what was what swivels the panic parties that had gone aloft fired swivels down onto the schooners decks more canistershot to erase the pirates about the wheel on the schooners quarterdeck forecastle and rails cock your locks pomeroy shouted level by volleyfire the schooners decks were about six feet below sarah and jane so pirates trying to find a hiding place anywhere but close upto the larboard bulwarks were wideopen to the shattering volley of musketry there was a concerted groan of terror at the sight of those muskets then screams as the volley rattled out like a short roll on a drum grapnels away ballard shouted drawing his sword boarders remember we want prisoners away boarders seamen and marines went over the side as the hulls crashed into each other grapnels flew and lodged deep in wood as both vessels rebounded and threatened to part upwind as she was though the schooner could not slip away pressed to sarah and jane by the trades the boarding party surged over the schooners decks meeting light resistance and beating that aside quickly these pirates were used to having their own way by dint of terror and confusion few of them were used to a hard fight against disciplined opponents so the survivors threw up their hands and dropped their weapons while their comrades lay bloody and still or shrieking with pain not much to em hey sir pomeroy sniffed disgusted that he hadnt even had a chance to bloody his sword my lads didnt even get up a good sweat make sure theyve no hidden weapons and herd them forrud if you please lieutenant pomeroy ballard said sheathing his own blade and ill have those survivors from the afterguard brought here aye sir half a dozen men were brought to him by the marines at bayonet or cutlass point and were forced to kneel hands already bound behind their backs now who is captain of this vessel ballard inquired well speak up wheres the dog in charge of you es dead zur a surly little fellow replied in a grunt how convenient ballard simpered what was his name anastario ruiz another volunteered in a painful whimper and the mates oh they be dead too zur the little fellow added speaking from a mouth almost devoid of teeth he had the gall to smirk dear god ballard said drawing a pistol he had simply been appalled by what lewrie had done at conch bar but he had to admit it had been effective tell you men what im going to do i am going to start shooting you one at a time until i get some answers for your information i am from his majestys sloop alacrity does that name ring a bell hey the same as did for billy bones doyle down in the caicos last year ye caint be shes sposed tbe posted tcat island one of the younger survivors exploded almost indignantly she aint got no marines so he shut his mouth and gulped as ballard cocked the pistol and laid it against his temple the marines are from whippet ballard said coldly remember whippet from walkers cay and no we are not supposed to be here but we are by god and if one of you doesnt start talking this very instant then god save you oh god sweet jesus holy saviour the threatened sailor wept all but fouling himself in sudden terror dont sir please dont shoot me like yer capn done ramirez i know ya sir yer that ballard feller they say yer meek an mild a true christian sir an a true christiand not sir stop yer snivelin the surly one warned die game damn ye at the count of three lad i send you to hell for your sins ballard assured him want to die game for this bastard one two jesus no dont do it ill tell ya ill tell ya the young man screamed as he fell to the deck to writhe and wriggle away from his compatriots es laidlaw es first mate e knows christ i wuz just aboard a year sir i dont know much please dont shoot me when i tells ya i dont know somethin please the man who tells me all will live to see the sunset ballard promised them and if he testifies in court he doesnt hang the ones who dont cooperate with me ballard paused dramatically as the thought came to him and he smiled as he concluded the ones who dont tell me the truth who dont lay it all out for us ill give to my captain ramcat lewrie he doesnt like pirates much ya know several of them turned quite pale at that threat throats went dry and they gulped saliva to ease themselves before they began to bay a chorus of expostulation in noisy competition with each other guineaman and another of finneys ships waiting at walkers cay his agent runyon ashore serving up free rum to all to keep them hot nassau whores at bargain prices for those with money cargoes piled up waiting to be smuggled into ports all across the caribbean finney yes it was finney it was always calico jack finney mister parham mister early mister woods ballard beckoned to bis more literate fellows who had good handwriting skillsdry work for us i fear well separate those that sound eager to talk and get it all down on paper with their signatures or marks made against their confessions before we rejoin alacrity mister odrado do you go into sarah and jane and get her underway out to sea soon as we have this vessel squared away well follow you and to the amazement of all who were familiar with the taciturn first officer arthur ballard actually cackled out loud with glee chapter whippet and alacrity fell upon the anchorage just at the break of dawn the next morning souwest down walkers cay channel east through the upper passage above the shoal whippet taking position to block the southern pass this time much closer to the island and alacrity given the task of scouring the moored vessels after she had landed lieutenant pomeroy and his marines in the twentyonefootdeep oval tongue of water to the east between walkers cay and grand cay with most of the ships boats used they landed on the eastern tip in the dark after a twomile row in from the hasty anchorage and a slow march down the threequartermile length of the isle to take the camp unawares from an unexpected quarter theres guineaman lewrie spat anyone know the other ship by those white upper bulwarks id say she must be the dublin lass sir sailing master fellows opined seen her in nassau one of finneys ships for certain sir i know that house flag better and better mister fellows lewrie exulted rubbing his hands together no schooners present which might escape us into shoalwater this time we did for her yesterday and most of their boats on the beach not gathered round the anchored ships bulk of their crews ashore most like still roistering sir ballard commented or sleeping it off well heres a rough awakening then lewrie grinned mister fowles well close yon farthest ship the guineaman ready the starboard battery hullo theyre up and awake some of them sir ballard warned on dublin lass theres a gun port opening mister fowles stand ready well rake this one in passing ready sir fowles shouted back after fussing over his guncaptains aim with a tug or two at the quoin blocks to suit himself about the proper elevation as you bear fire the range was half a cable yardsas they grazed past the anchored and sleeping ship the threatening gun port was open but all they could see poised over the grim black muzzle of a cannon behind the port was the white face of some poor wretch who had opened it so he could spew his load of rum and supper over the side who took one look in his misery made his mouth a perfect o and went parchment pale as the artillery blasted him away dublin lass shuddered as sixpounder balls ripped into her punching clear through her thin planking shattering timbers and deck beams making her leap and froth a hullshaped spreading ripple around her as she rose and dropped back into the still waters of the harbour serve her another mister fowles in the guts this time alan demanded sink her as alacrity cruised by dublin lass her guns rapped out again quoin blocks inserted and barrels aimed low to riven her waterline and the trim little threemasted ship heeled over with each crashing roundshot rocking as ragged gashes were shot through her scantlings then rolling back to starboard so those holes could suck and froth with seawater the few crewmen left aboard as an anchor party came running up from below where theyd been napping to find their ship sinking beneath their feet i can see the marines ashore sir midshipman mayhew shouted therere red coats among the sheds on the far side of the camp angles gone sir guns wont bear in the ports fowles reported at last cease fire mister fowles wait for the guineaman lewrie ordered mark that gentlemen dublin lass opened her gun portsto fire into a kings ship to take arms against the royal navy think you thats another compelling proof of piracy he smiled well more like to puke on us sir ballard whispered at his side compelling none the less i suppose if contempt counts itll sound good in testimony lewrie scowled and damme if ill give finney and his captains one chance to wriggle out this time once clear of the dublin lass alacrity faced the open waters between the two anchored ships for a minute or two so they could see what was happening on the beach pirates and merchant crews were all running in terror from the dripping bayonets of the marines some few trying to make a fight of it with muskets and pistols the morning erupted in heavy gunfire once more as whippet came even with the tortured dublin lass astern of them and gave her broadsides with her ninepounders rigging and spars upper masts and yards came tumbling down in ruin to churn thd water alongside and dublin lass canted over even farther until her starboard railings were in the sea she bubbled and groaned as she filled and began to go down chase gun forrud mister fowles lewrie shouted wake those buggers up yonder the starboard chase gun on the forecastle one of the portable twopounders barked as sharp as a terrier its light ball hit guineaman astern shattering the ladder from quarterdeck to poop barely making her judder men could be seen though running up from below waking from their swaying hammocks on the upper decks where it was cooler to the waist of the ship by god i mink theyre going to man their guns fellows gaped that captain malone must be desperate as hell sir he mounts twelvepounders sir ballard intoned if you recall warm work in the next few minutes then lewrie sighed as he steeled himself for a slaughter on his own decks mister fellows is there depth enough on guineamans larboard side for us god only knows sir fellows muttered eyeing the ship which was anchored bowson to them i doubt hed be anchored that close up to shoals though anyone see a kedge anchor from her stern if she were swinging on just her best bower to wind and tide ready on the gun deck sir fowles reported from the waist mister fowles well bear off and give her starboard then be ready with your larboard battery quick as you can at close range aye aye sir fowles replied quizzically taking off his hat to scratch his grizzled head so hard his tarry queue of hair which hung as low as his waist twitched at his mercurial captains orders helm alee mister neill lewrie said steer three points to larboard mister ballard prepare the hands to wear ship so we cross guineamans bows once weve fired and fall onto her disengaged side aye aye sir ballard replied crisp and efficient guns bear sir fowles warned fire mister fowles as the first limb of the rising sun peeked over the horizon at last the artillery came to life tolling rage down the starboard side from bow to stern guineaman screamed as she was hulled like a steer might bellow and jerk shivering with terror and anger as it was bound for the approach of the butcher with the poleaxe helm up hard up mister neill wear ship lewrie cried as the last gun went off alacrity came wheeling about in her own dense pall of gunsmoke as it was blown down onto guineaman sailors dashed to sheets and braces in the confusion as gunners below them abandoned starboard guns to run out the larboard cannon and open the ports ballard kept yelling orders into the bedlam and drilled and trained to boresome perfection as the crew was order was never lost not one second was lost artillery could be heard ahead and to port as alacrity sailed off noreast for the beach guineaman firing at last at where they thought her to be alacrity trembled with a sharp slam a shuffling judder of her stern as she was struck aft mr burke on the tiller with his mate neill gave a soft curse as he fell to his knees in a welter of blood a long jagged splinter of bulwark driven through his midsection midshipman mayhew was lifted off his feet and flung halfway across the quarterdeck to the starboard side by a chunk of redhot roundshot as the twelvepounder ball shattered he skidded on his back to fetch up against the after mooring bitts his left arm and shoulder almost gone awash in his own gore and gasping hard alacrity almost felt as if shed tripped over something her forward progress arrested the deck canting over to starboard her anchor cable ballard intuited helm up mister neill steer due north lewrie called aye aye sir neill replied stepping over the body of his dying friend his tears almost blinding him to put the tiller oversurgeons mate ballard snapped mister maclntyre loblolly boys aft the smoke wafted noreast on the dying winds clearing the view at last as alacrity rumbled and slithered down the anchor cable that scrubbed her larboard underbody and there was guineaman not twenty yards off her larboard gun ports closed ready grapnels mister ballard mister harkin mister warwick well be boarding her after the broadside lewrie instructed starboard your helm mister neill and lay us hull to hull aye aye sir ready lewrie shouted to his gunners as guineaman came abeam on the uprollfire guineaman heeled over to starboard under the weight of the iron hailstorm her bulwarks turning into kindling and whirling in the air thick as an uprooted pine forest in a hurricane gun ports and thin planking caved in and a portion of the larboard sailtending gangway went flying in one long ladderlike piece grapple to her mister ballard lewrie said in a normal tone once the echoes had ceased and away boarders aye aye sir ballard snapped sounding almost enthusiastic lewrie jumped to the top of the bulwarks drew pistol and sword and leapt for guineamans forechain platform to scramble alongside his men to the forward gangway christ he shuddered seeing the devastation that his cannon had wrought the waist was filled with dying men half lost in scraps of wood in a maze of broken timbers several of the larboard cannon had come loose from the shattered bulwarks and had rolled down on the men serving the starboard battery crushing them like millwheels those who could were already raising their hands in surrender the urge to fight shot out of them lewrie went over to the starboard side to make his way aft to the quarterdeck where some of guineaman mates stood or sat around the butt of the mizzenmast you captain malone growled half in shock at the ruin of his ship he brought up the tip of his sword while the others got out of their way ostentatiously emptyhanded as alacritys boarding party came to back lewrie up what are you doin here we thought maybe calico jack couldnt afford to bribe commodore garvey any longer malone lewrie offered thinking fast and hoping for a confirmation now weve a new royal governor the price went up too high you and finney are on your own lewrie reached out with the tip of his hanger to ring steel on steel one beat two beats tip to tip on malones sword malone went backwards crouched over more like a knifefighter body squareon either drop that sword or do something real with it malone lewrie snarled fight me you coward got the nutmegs for it hey malone allowed the next beat to slap his blade low and away as he let go the hilt and dropped it on the deck oh no ya dont yave put yer foot in it this time for fair lewrie aye ill strike to ya but soon as were in nassau harbour itll be you up on charges again an this time yer really finished firn on peaceful merchantmen john laidlaw of the fortune schooner says different lewrie told him with a laugh a laugh which was reinforced by the shock that malone displayed as if hed just seen his own corpse swaying from the gibbet lewrie stepped forward and put the tip of his sword to malones throat jesus easy sir cony gulped from behind him dont john laidlaw tells me guineaman branched out on her own did a little piracy on her way here to the rendezvous in was finney upset with you malone when you took the matilda remember her the liverpool slaver laidlaw tells my lieutenant that if we dig in the right spot well find the bones of her officers and crew here on the island and the bones of over an hundred sick slaves you slaughtered cause you didnt want the time or trouble to heal em up before you tried to sell em off men and women slaves malone care if i and my hands do some digging do you now look here mebbe we kin deal sir if malone gasped still have the stuff from matilda do you lewrie sneered at him pressing a little deeper with the point sure you do youre the sort that keeps his mementoes of good times and thats more than enough to hang you for piracy and murder this time youre done for malone you and finney damn your eyes youll never get calico jack ya bugger malone attempted to swagger think not lewrie laughed again cold comfort to you the moment the hangman turns you off but i promise you hell have a noose right next to yours lewrie stepped back and sheathed his sword john canoe he shouted for the huge escaped slave aye capum sah hes yours to guard lewrie grinned special aye sah canoe growled deep in his throat taking malone by the upper arm and hauling the heavyset man into his custody as easily as lifting a child captain malone youre under arrest lewrie called in a loud voice turning to face the other disarmed pirates all of you damned hounds i arrest you in the kings name damme sir look what yave done with me poor ship captain grant bemoaned as lewrie came aboard after funeral services for burke and midshipman mayhew scantlins shot through bulwarks all chewed up itll use most of me spare timber patchin hull shots and what i ask ye will the royal navy do to compensate me let you go free sir lewrie told him in no mood for dealing with the shifty merchantman go sing oh be thankful for all mat i care last of your crews coming aboard now id set a course for home were i you and get out of bahamian jurisdiction before we change our minds she rides light grant commented as sarah and jane bobbed and rolled beneath him how mucha me cargo did ye use for breastworks rather a lot i fear captain grant lewrie told him weve dumped that over the side youll find enough salt left to keep you ballasted and trimmed proper on your voyage might even be enough to pay for your repairs and break even once you pay off your crew back in your philadelphia no profit sir grant wheezed damme sir a whole sailing season a whole voyage wasted thats the risks you take for money lewrie shrugged then turned to leave to go back to his alacrity and escort their prizes and their captives home stay out of our seas captain grant ill write the consul grant warned following him to the entry port ill complain to congress to the president if i have to and i will be back ye know ye pass that free port act and ill be moren welcome in the bahamas again me and every american ship captain grant lewrie said turning to face him ive no more time to play this sly little game with you aye they may pass free port acts aye you may be welcome someday in the future and you may cock your nose at me all you wish just remember though that a very good mariner and a promising young midshipman died this day making it safe for you and your ship to sail bahamian waters dont make me dislike you theres no future in it ask those pirates point taken sir grant replied leaning back a little from the intensity of lieutenant lewries grim expression point taken indeed he reiterated as he doffed his hat to him as lewrie descended to his gig chapter john finney was having a rather bad evening he had stayed in that night ostensibly to go over his books but mostly to avoid the sneers hed been getting on the streets since the mocking broadside sheet had appeared days before tale of the debollocked bumpkin it was titled in large block letters there was an engraving a satirical cartoon below that which featured a slim young woman holding both baby and pistols shooting at an overdressed lumpfaced churl in a hugely unfashionable wig tiny hat and flaring coat like a macaroni of a previous decade the suiting portrayed as checkered calico and the male figure leaping legs widespread like some damned molly in an italian toedance company to avoid losing his wedding tackle a long stringy caption above the female read in his abfence my dear hufbands piftols shall defend mine honour cur whilst over the leaping male figure a caption read oy means ter have yer niver a care have oy fer any damnd marriage vow oicks there was printed below a short narration a titillating story of caution to all lusting bachelors who pursued happily married women too hotly no names were namedbut then none were necessary as it stated as one here in nassau did quite latelyill murder augustus fiimey swore tearing the sheet into tiny bits it was only the fourth hed gotten in anonymous mail so far he was certain augustus hedley was the artist peyton boudreau the author and sponsor and caroline thet bitch oh thet bitch ill make her sorry she wuz iver born i will wipe thet sneer off er face take er an have me way with er make er beg fer it he instead took another full glass of claret in two gulps and filled his crystal stem with more for the moment he had more pressing worries he returned to his ledgers both the legitimate ones his clerk prepared and the illicit ones kept in his own scrawls which he himself had trouble reading a month later it was not a good year after conch bar and the wholesale hangings which had followed half the old lads had gone off for easier pickings deeper in the caribbean or up to the american coast where congress was too cheap to keep a navy or a coast guard worth the name walkers cay had run more away to waters less well patrolled finney had had to increase the import of legitimate goods as stolen wares reduced in quantity so his profit margin had fallen to only a little better than his bay street competitors hed lost huge sums too in all the goods that rodgers and that damned lieutenant lewrie had burned at walkers cay the pirated and the hoarded true imports those staples those delicacies all gone up in flames depriving him of his expected large markups and there had been the import duties the cynical greedy searcher of customs had imposed on goods hed never be able to land and sell and the bribes demanded to keep him out of court on smuggling charges to boot there wasnt much better news from his grandiose plantings on eleuthera his overseer had written that both the coastal white lands and the red lands farther inland were failing bahamian soil was like a lying whore rich and beguiling to start with but too thin to turn under and hope it would revive after a fallow year its nutrients sucked out by the first lush crops and with so few animals in the bahamas and lack of grazing land for big herds costly to manure and fertilize unless he shipped in tons of manure his overseer wasnt confident cotton sisal hemp sugar cane even indigo and aloesnone of it prospered and the overseer had ended on a dismal note the georgia tidewater and sea isle cotton nurslings might be infected with the dreaded chenille bug hed be forced to sell before the fine plantation house could be completed as fine a mansion as any in the bahamas grander than the one col andrew deveaux had erected on cat island the only value hed get back from the sale would be the slaves the ones hed gotten for so little from malone the foolish greedy bastard after hed taken the matilda finney took another sip of claret and made a face try as hard as he might hed never developed a palate for it petulantly it went into the fireplace to shatter in a shower of wine across the imported turkey carpet fireplace he gloomed at that extravagance a gaudy useless showpiece in a climate that never got close to freezing he went over to his sideboard to pour himself a cutcrystal glass of demerara rum excuse me captain finney sir his butler said opening the wide double doors to the entry hall clean it up finney snorted putting his feet on his desk i will captain sir the butler agreed secretly amused by his plebeian employer and his demand to be addressed with a title he never really hadcaptain in the meantime sir this letter came for you from commodore garvey sir fetch it here then damn yer eyes finney sulked finding no joy this evening in the obsequiousness of his hired help finney tore the wax seal off and unfolded the letter damn is blood another of the broadside sheets finney wondered just how much he had to pay the bastard to at least be civil to him they acted as strangers in public no matter their agreement or the sums he shoved into garveys accounts by the side door at the bank now he was down garveyd shoved the knife in sarcastic and sneering as was his way finney dreaded garvey might demand even more than the princely three hundred pounds a month he already cost him shit shit my dear sir have you seen one of these i was not aware your interest in interrupting alacritys mail had an intimate raison detre was the inscription penned in the left margin the enfolding larger foliosized sheet of paper had a hastily written note which quite took his mind from the curses he was about to hurl at the uppity cur whod sprinkle his notes with latin french or even greek just to finney swore gall him over his lack of schoolinglt coltrop s aemilia cutter is just returned from spanish wells in some haste he informs me that whippet put into port there four days past inquired of lt blair of the barracouta sloop as to the nature of my patrol assignments and was last seen heading north towards great abaco a ketchrigged warship and a merchant ship were seen to be in company with her by a fishing lugger who put into spanish wells aware of my stringent requirements for whippet and alacrity to stay far south lt coltrop came to me at once sure that rodgers and lewrie may be staging some immense mutiny against me sir the only cause for hope they may have to redeem themselves would be as you know a sudden revelation about a certain matter do what you think best as shall i from this moment forward jesus an mary finney shivered its all up aint it sir his butler inquired distantly get out i said get out leave it finney shouted as he got to his feet he shoved the broadside sheet and the letter into one of his private ledgers tucked them under his arm and began to pace his palatial parlour and receiving rooms he took inventory of his fineries as if seeing them for the first time a visitor to his town house the inventory took him through the dining room into the large salon on the other side of the entrance hall through stillrooms and butlers pantries through wine cellar and library up the stairs to peek into all four huge bedrooms marveling again how well furnished they were sumptuous some said bordello flash others cruelly whispered behind his backafter theyd had his meats wines and music after theyd fawned to his face and simpered at his japes its all up he told himself again halfway between tears and rage dont want me thave nothin wont let me have nothin niver in this life the bastards build all this they find a way ttake it from me they do wisht tgod ida had time tkill boudreau an do fer that uppity bitch an her rogue ah well me curses on em tis the best yell do jack me lad its all up ye had a good run did ya not not only would he lose the plantation but hed lose the slaves his house and all its lovely pretties the best mat money could buy his stores his ships his chandlery his ah shame of it now but there was money in the house and money in his stores and in the bank enough to start over somewhere else and he still had a fine little ship in the harbour ready to take him anywhere in the wide world he wished he ripped open the chifforobe in his own bedroom took out a leather traveling case and set the ledgers inside it then began to pack bom it and an ornate seachest his mind already calculating the best of the tide chapter damme what a rotten business lord dunmore grunted after he had read the confessions all this happenin right under my predecessor maxwells nose and him ignorant as sheep ha ha thatll make intrestin readin in london but its over now weve bagged the miscreants and theyll hang in tar and chains til their bones fall apart damme if they wont finney did escape us milord solicitorgeneral william wylly informed him wylly had not known lord dunmore but a few months but he had already developed a blazing dislike for the new governor and had been heard to call him obstinate and violent by nature with a capacity below mediocrity little cultivated by education ignorant of the constitution ofengland the lordly despot of a petty clan best rid of him then lord dunmore shrugged as he poured a round of brandy for them all those he had to cultivate at least lewrie rodgers and some other minor officials were not included in that category while wylly garvey and peyton boudreau were once hes proved guilty in court all his goodsll be liable to seizure bound to be a pretty penny in all that hey might even help defray the cost of me new fortifications id planned for the western side of the town fort charlotte i think to name it for our queen there is the matter of the bank milord chief justice matson put in finney and several ahum of the finer and wealthier of the colony had formed a private merchant bank there werehundreds of depositors milord its been looted i fear and gone with finney to god knows where many of your privy council had their accounts there milord i did more to the point well send a ship after him and get it back lord dunmore told them with an impatient arrogance thatd be easy enough hey what we have the royal navy for if you cant go seize a ship when you wish to what how longs he been gone two hours three garvey there is the problem of where hes gone milord the commodore muttered looking most unwell since hed seen whippet and alacrity come into port with guineaman and fortune as captures that morning i have three ships in harbour at the moment but theyll not be enough and whippet the sloop of war is wormed and weeded she would not be swift enough to catch him even if we did know his direction excuse me milord lewrie spoke up who the devil are you sir lord dunmore scowled at him lieutenant lewrie of the alacrity milord finney did not use the noreast providence channel else hed of had to sail past us to get out to sea hed be going west or south milord south down tongue of the ocean to the eastrd of andros to cuba or he went up the norwest providence channel to pick up the gulf stream and sail north that would be the fastest escape sir wherever those are lord dunmore laughed his round fleshy moon of a face broken only by a huge overhanging beak of a nose wobbling with incomprehending humour ill send lieutenant coltrop and aemilia north then milord garvey decided and lewrie down tongue of the ocean excuse me again milord but if the swiftest and most logical course hed steer would be north then alacrity has a longer hull more sail area and more and heavier guns lewrie countered i stand the better chance to catch him and bring him to book that make the slightest bit o sense to you matson dunmore japed at his chief justice sounds like greek to me tarpaulins and only if lieutenant lewrie is ordered to sea at once milord rodgers added quickly and with your permission commodore garvey i will turn whippet over to my first officer so she may get her longdelayed docking and breaming he could not resist the urge to put his own knife in and sail with lewrie sir that sounds and you will pardon the play on words milord i trustlike the best course haw haw peyton boudreau said with a lazy aristocratic air as if it were just between you and me of the better sort to lord dunmore who was already under boudreaus lofty spell rodgers and lewrie are to my limited knowledge two of the most energetic officers in the bahamas squadron as i am certain that commodore garvey will agree damn my soul have they not proved that today milord best let em be in for the kill bless me dya think so mister boudreau lord dunmore asked with a wry cock of his head should they seize finney and recover the funds theres sure to be finneys money as well liable to condemnation as droits of the crown i trust more funds to support the construction of your fort charlotte and to support the administration of the bahamas colony milord boudreau concluded with a broad wink zounds damme if that dont sound right to me mister boudreau the governor agreed heartily his eyes piggish with greed well go be about it you seadogs go get him sic im boys sic im hey i say commodore youre lookin a touch peaked not coming down with something tropical are you got out on the first of the rising tide mis morning lewrie speculated as they left the governors mansion and began to trot down to the quays four hours just about damme thats a hellish long lead and that threemasted lugger of his is bound to be fast lewrie could not bear to name finneys ship the caroline theres a chance rodgers puffed trying to keep up with him hes no longer on the waterline than your alacrity and he couldnt have known were only hours behind his sailin id wager hell take deep water up the norwest providence channel with your shoal depth we might try cuttin closer to the berry islands and gain the current of the gulf stream afore him gentlemen please peyton boudreau insisted blowing with the effort to maintain their pace the refined gentlemen or ladies never went faster than an idle strolling pace the richer and more refined they were the more languid this haste is unseemly lewrie i must speak to you before you sail about caroline what about her lewrie snapped coming to an abrupt stop ill go on rodgers decided join me soon as youre able aye aye sir lewrie responded perfunctorily before wheeling on boudreau again is anything wrong with her or the baby theyre fine boudreau assured him i meant but to show you this finney came to your home he attempted to woo her with a tale of you abandoning her so it was not commodore garvey interrupting my mails it was but at finneys behest boudreau said i believe he took your letters back and forth so he might discover what would work best upon her insecurities when his time was right last week before you arrived at spanish wells i should think he made his move the bastard lewrie screeched clutching the hilt of his sword this was the result sir boudreau said proudly producing a copy of the broadside sheet this was what calico jack received as reward for his scheme well damme lewrie exulted as he took in the title and the engraved scene good lord but shes got bottom i told you to trust her loyalty and her good sense peyton praised her enough to put a bumptious clown such as finney to shame even in what passes for bahamian society haw haw he went into our house though lewrie frowned suddenly when he saw his plans had gone for nought he did and she he persisted lewrie shouted he attempted force after she spurned him force enough for her to shoot at him i fear he did i ran him off at gunpoint ill have his hearts blood swear to god lewrie said with a sincerity that gave the pacific and elegant peyton boudreau chills lets go mister boudreau i have to sail theres not a single minute to waste now he said setting off at a faster trot once more but there was for at the foot of the hill at the landing quay on bay street by the vendue house sat a carriage which contained mrs heloise boudreau and caroline she alit from the equipage and ran to him holding up her long skirts with one hand hair flying behind her beneath a sunbonnet he turned his course and met her shouting her name as he lifted her into his arms and twirled her around as she collided with him so fierce was her greeting snickering watchers bedamned he kissed her in public she returned his kisses just as ardently oh god at last she breathed against his cheek damned right he growled laughing as he trembled with relief to see her well not only well but as slim as he remembered her just as lovely as before and alive and hale lord youre beautiful i missed you so much i love you so much she echoed alan come see our son he went to the carriage where heloise boudreau held up a baby in swaddling clothes for him to see caroline took him and turned to show him off cradled in her arms sewallis alan lewrie this is your father she said proudly poor little bastard alan thought what a horrid name well he aint rightly a bastard is he not like i was he has a father and a mother godparents and grandparents and all ugly though i must admit spose all babies are hullo little man alan crooned putting out a hand to touch the child on the cheek to stroke the incredibly soft flesh with one tentative finger by god this was reality and a damned awesome one he stroked the back of one tiny hand and felt wee fingers grasp his well im damned alan breathed out with awe as little sewallis gave him a grave going over with his tiny eyes he chucked him under the chubby chin sewallis im your father what think you of that sewallis alan lewrie screwed up bis face and began to wail damned right lewrie thought i would too early days lewrie shrugged helplessly lets go home this instant caroline invited dearest i cant were off after finney oh god she gasped alan must you i thought i care to be no other place but with you love but weve been ordered to hunt him down if we can i have to sail at once but i will be back i swear soon darling ill take him caroline heloise offered holding out her arms to receive the child arm in arm caroline strolled with him down to the quay where his gig rocked on the tide peyton showed me the broadside dear alan tried to cajole her youre the bravest stoutest girl i know that took courage and im that proud of you for fending off his vile advances youll have to fight him she shuddered head buried against his shoulder therell be a battle i know there will god alan i have this fear of a sudden youre barely back at all and gone ill be back caroline he insisted i love you now weve a real family now ive a son to raise ill not do anything stupid i swear once im back well have all the time in the world together promise me youll do nothing too rash alan please ill do my duty caroline he vowed and nothing rash and hes a good head start on us we may not catch him up at all you will though she sighed on the verge of tears i know you will she looked up at him intently as if trying to memorizehis face for a final time to last her through the rest of a long life without him i love you alan i will always love you and i love you caroline he replied getting a fey feeling he bent down and kissed her im sorry but i have to go be brave for me dearest girl ill fetch finney back in chains and we may add attempted rape to his crimes though weve enough to hang him a dozen times over already goodbye love just for a week or two a month on the outside i promise ill be waiting she told him attempting to smile holding back her tears as he stepped away from her he walked to the dock and stepped into the sternsheets of the gig the bowman shoved off and cony snapped out his orders to backwater away from the pier caroline watched as alan was rowed out to his ship stayed rigid on the dock as he mounted to the entry port to take his salute stayed to wave to him as he doffed his hat to her and stayed unmovirig as alacritys crew began to draw her up to shortstays to upanchor drumming round the capstan though the gun ketch swam in her watery vision she could hear the canvas rustle the sheaves shriek as alacrity made sail even before the anchor was catted as fiddles and fifes played a hauling chantey gay but insistent she stayed on the dock until alacrity cleared the harbour and receded to hulldown over the horizon only then did she go back to the carriage to stand inside to keep the ship in sight for a little longer we should get home caroline heloise boudreau offered at last little sewallis needs his sup soon shes almost out of sight i know maam caroline nodded wiping her eyes hell be back you know he will i pray so we will all pray for his quick return then let me have him caroline requested and heloise handed her her baby who at last was napping shaded from the tropic sun by the parasol heloise held once were home i have to talk to wyonnie caroline added after shed settled sewallis in her arms there is something she must do for me home driver heloise ordered the coachee and what is that my dear i wish to see the obeahman caroline replied oh caroline heloise gasped those are but fancy stories i know his herbs helped sewalliss colic but were both from the carolinas maam caroline intoned and we know what our mammies told us growing up about hexes i wish to lay a hex she said looking straight ahead at the road determined and grave two one of protection for alan and one a curse chapter nornorwest for the berrys then north of west through the shallows of the great bahama bank to great isaac alacrity bowled along off the wind stunsls rode at either end of the topsl yards doubling her sail area aloft and a stays flew in the space between her masts on a juryrigged jumper stay eightandaquarter knots she made eight and a half toward evening racing for the gulf stream and its relentless northward currents by five am of the next morning they had found the darker waters of the gulf stream and bent north riding the mighty river that added another fourandahalf knots made good to their forward progress no sign of him rodgers gloomed as he ate lewries food and took liberal sips of lewries dwindling wine supply and had slept in lewries double hangingcot in lewries stead he stayed in the middle of the providence channel alan said we may even be slightly ahead of him to the gulf stream if he sailed more northrd of us closer to the west end of grand bahama perhaps tomorrows dawn will tell sir were drivin hard ill give us that rodgers shrugged do you think she rides a mite bowslow thatll make her crank for close maneuverin light as she is aft were shifting supplies aft into the stern sir alan replied and it might not hurt to shift the number one cannon from each battery aft as well sirs ballard suggested alacrity used to mount sixteen side guns as a bomb ketch in addition to her deck mortarsaye theres ring bolts sidetackle bolts and gun ports being wasted lewrie agreed two guns all the way aft into the greatcabin here just forrud of the quartergalleries thats over eighteen hundredweight each or more just enough to lift her bows six inches while lewrie was a dabhand navigator physics was beyond him about that sir ballard said solemnly furrowing his brows as he calculated the proposition in his head perhaps an inch less run out the starboard battery too and draw the larboard close to her centerline lewrie plotted on chock the trucks with old shotgarland rope to keep them steady alacritys flatrun on her bottom and hardchined aft the more upright she sails the faster shell be ill attend to it sir soon as the forrudmost guns may be shifted ballard replied jotting notes to himself about the order in which chores had best be performed four hours lead though sirs rodgers sighed sadly even if finney took a longer northern route more like five if ya count the time it took us to upanchor an clear harbour he could be over on andros laid up til any pursuitd passed him by damn him but hes a clever un next dawn may tell sir ballard offered hopefully dawn will tell dammit all lewrie insisted slapping at the table top dawn will tell the sun rose next morning bloodred and threatening above a horizon of gunmetal gray the gulf stream waters rolled and heaved to either beam heaping high enough to smother alacrity in the troughs between each longset rolling wavecrest and set her canvas luffing before she could rise up to clear air and crack sails full of wind one hundred and sixty miles shed made on her night passage up the american coast lewrie had not slept a single seamile of it but had lain tossing in a chartspace berth honing his anger finney had violated his home frightened his wife and son and however hed gotten word to fleeif he hadnt fled lewrie thought miserably hed have taken some revenge on caroline for spurning him he knew enough about the brute to not doubt that she might have been dead by then because of the broadside sheet her and peyton both he had taken the deck at eight bells of the midwatch at four of the clock in a chilly dark morning as the hands surged up to stow their hammocks in the nettings wash down the decks and stand to dawn quarters before their breakfast to fret and pace as the stars paled from the gloomy skies to see details in the clouds in the falsedawn and watch the last of the moon sink below the horizon aloft there he shouted to the lookouts notnin sir clear orizons damn he spat sir its ballard attempted to console oh the devil take you mister ballard alan snarled he took a deep breath to calm himself and paced off his disappointment back to the taffrails before returning very well secure from quarters and release the people to breakfast aye aye sir ballard replied not in the slightest miffed by lewries petulant outburst after a year and a half together sorry arthur lewrie muttered smiling sheepishly its just your way sir ballard smiled in return soon as the galleys hot ill send cony up with coffee for you i assume you will keep the deck that was not a question aye i will and thankee lewrie nodded more of my bloody way distressed as he was lewrie could not help smiling at himself say finneys lugger made sevenandahalf knots though alan calculated in moody silence five hours lead to start with and seamiles to the stream whilst we fetched it in miles god we might have cut three hours off his lead and were a knot faster say all last night and all day today with the current now he thinks hes clear of pursuit well make twentyfour more miles a day than he so if his original lead was only thirtyseven mileschrist what if he did put into andros the berrys inshore of the gulf stream down at bimini to wait it out or he could be flying everything aloft but his laundry all this time well never catch him up coffee sir cony announced half an hour later hmmph lewrie growled startled from his musings yer coffee sir cony offered an wotll ya ave fer yer breakfast sir thisll do cony thisll do for now he grumped thankee aye aye sir cony nodded sorrowfully bounding swooping rolling at the top of a wave alacrity was driven on her course due north foam creamed down her flanks to lay roiled astern quarterwaves sucking low at her after hull as thesea made a perfect shallow s horizontally from bow to stern frothing in a millrace under her transom eightandthreequarter knots now as enough cargo and artillery had been shifted aft to lift her bows on steeper rollers she surfed forward and sometimes defied the ocean a hold on her the bowwave breaking aft of her cutwater and her whole hull lifting from the sea in her haste as if she would take wings and fly in those moments when wind and sea conjoined before falling away to snuffle deep and plow the water again with a disappointed soughing sail ho the lookout screamed at last from the crosstrees where away commander rodgers shouted back wakened from his nap in alans sybaritic canvas sling chair two points off the larboard bows a little inshore nought but topsls an royals whats to loord lewrie asked rubbing sleep from his own eyes his skin tingling from too long in the sun in a restless nod almost due west by now sir tis savannah fellows reported norwest is charleston little over an hundred mile to either and were to windward of her whoever she is lewrie crowed fully awake she carries on north shell ram herself into the sand shoals off wilmington but shell not weather the outer banks not if i have a say in it mister ballard you have the deck im going to spy out our little mystery ship he slung a telescope over his shoulder leapt for the shrouds and went aloft aching to see for himself there she be sir the lookout said once he d found a perch on the narrow slats of the crosstrees look like a lugger to you alan demanded extending the tube of his glass hard tsay from ere sir jus topsls so far the lookout opined funny angle though capn sir like levanter lateens or somen aint got er liftlines set proper to er royals alacrity lifted on a swell as lewrie laid the spyglass level on the tiny tan imperfections that marred the even horizon miles off the other ship was lifted upwards as well for a long breath or two but dropped almost from view as alacrity settled in a deep trough id almost he sighed lowering the heavy tube for awhile he stood precariously on the crosstree braces wrapping one arm to the upper mast inside taut halyards and liftlines braced securely he raised the telescope again the distant sails swam into focus threemasted he grunted aye like lateeners or woooo he whooped loud enough to startle people on the decks below theyre gaff topmast staysls shes a threemasted lugger a lugger would mount small oddly shaped sails between the tip of the upper masts and the gaff boom at the top of her mainsails and that was what he had seen it was a lugger sure but whose keep a sharp eye on her he told his lookout sing out if she alters course or changes the slightest bit aye aye sir lewrie took a stay to the deck tar and slush on his clothing bedamned to join the curious on the quarterdeck its a lugger mister neill steer us a point free larboard well close her slow i make her twelve miles off now by the end of the first dog watch well have her at less than ten miles so we may figure out if shes the car if shes finneys if she wishes to keep to the gulf stream shes going to have to harden up and go closerhauled sir fellows suggested allow me to suggest we stand on north sir well close her even so another two hours and well lose the current ourselves inshore and so will she if she cant get to windward of us alan said and she wont he vowed chase is goin closehauled sir the lookout hallooed belay mister neill mister ballard lay us hard on the wind aye aye sir whatever she was whoever the lugger belonged to she was trying to flee to get up to windward and keep the advantage of the current of the gulf stream to weather cape hatteras and the outer banks one more confirming sign that it most likely was jack finney awakened to the fact of a pursuit no longer a mystery lewrie thought with satisfaction now she was a chase the afternoon wore on with both vessels clawing up to windward alacrity was already the possessor of the wind gauge weatherly as a lugger was she could attain perhaps a full point closer to the winds but alacrity was just the slightest bit faster making leeway as she did she still headreached her chase and closed the range to eleven miles to ten to nine bringing the lugger almost hullup as alacrity sailed the shorter closing angle were gaining on her by christ rodgers chortled with glee the caroline was new providencebuilt sir lieutenant ballard told him coolly blushing a bit as he pronounced her nameas flatran and shoaldraught as alacrity perhaps more so but she makes just as much leeway as we do with so little below the waterline for the sea to bite on long as we hold the weather gauge and damme if we might just be half a knot faster lewrie added with joy a full knot off the wind in the gulf stream shell be within range of random shot in six hours hell try to slip away once its dark rodgers snorted no lights showin they could tack an pass astern weve moon enough to see that sir lewrie countered and to expect to beat against the gulf stream no chase is aulin er wind there the lookout interrupted turnin west an runnin free dye hear there by god heres another angle to cut short lewrie laughed as he grabbed ballard by the arm arthur haul our wind now we might gain a mile on him if were quick enough come about to westnorwest aye aye sir mister harkin all hands ready to come about rodgers and lewrie got out of ballards way taking a corner of the quarterdeck free of tumult to inspect their chase with telescopes runnin for charleston it appears into neutral waters com mander rodgers decided damn him he has too much sail aloft lewrie stated inshore hed pick up a land breeze later today see how she heels sir thats too much heel for a flatrun hull even off the wind as she is now shes sailing on her shoulder not her bottom if he doesnt reef in those lateener topmast staysls shes working too hard bowsdown by god hes no real sailor is he lewrie rodgers hooted had you some champagne id pop it now to celebrate well have him by god well have the bugger yet many a slip twixt the cup and the up sir lewrie smiled aye he may not be as tarry as he boasted but hes running us one merry little chase and when it comes to it hell fight like some cornered rat now to keep him out of american jurisdiction we have to overtake him take the lee position to block him well have him rodgers insisted stubbornly well have him chapter by sunset alacrity left the gulf stream inshore into waters that chopped instead of rolled caroline was still an hour ahead at the least out of the stream first and making a more direct course with less leeway even as the land breeze found her try as they might to counter the last of the powerful current alacrity ended up dead astern of the chase beating against the land breeze lumping and booming against the chop and the short rollers of the returning scend of waves breaking over the horizon against the carolina coast she still makes too much heel lewrie decided after pondering the dark spectre in his telescope so do we he added comparing the angle of his decks against the chases nighttime land breezes will be gentler sir not as strong ballard speculated thatll ease her topmen of the watch aloft mister ballard well take first reef in the foretopsl lewrie ordered are ya daft lewrie rodgers hissed from the gloom of sunset by his elbow i thought ya wanted tcatch the bastard i do sir but the foretopsl depresses the bows and heels us too much even going closehauled as we are letting the foreandaft sails do the work lets us pinch up to windward half a point you are captain sir but im your superior rodgers grunted do but let me try it sir lewrie begged two hours theres moon enough to see her and a sextant tell us if shes gaining by the height of her masttrucks bove the horizon were even in speed for now perhaps a quarterknot or halfknot faster and thats not enough to intercept her before shes in american waters two hours then rodgers allowed at last but should we fall too far behind itll be your fault lewrie your fault hear me aye aye sir eased just the slightest bit though sailing more upright on her natter bottom alacrity closed the range six miles off five and then four with more of finneys caroline visible above the horizon at each chiming of the watch bells satisfied that his solution had worked lewrie slumped down for a nap far aft on the signalflag lockers muffled against the seawinds chill in a grogram boatcloak with his head lolled against the taffrail he nodded off at last his last waking sight the dark creaming wake alongside cony came to wake him just before eight bells of the middle a few minutes before four am with a mug of black coffee alan took one sip to sluice foul sleep from his mouth spat it over the side then drank deep before handing the mug back to his servant he walked forward for his telescope and a view ahead to assure himself that their chase was still there caroline loomed even taller above the horizon of falsedawn a slanted black semicolon on the glittering silvery trough of the last of the moon astern using a sextant and a slate lewrie determined assuming carolines masts stood seventy feet above her decks that she was still being slowly overtaken and was now a little less than three miles off no matter how much sail she flew which course she steered and she was still heeled over too far he said hed made third mate lewrie muttered to himself as he stowed the sextant away in the binnacle cabinet surely he must know to ease her aloft sir sailing master fellows queried his grunts two hours i make it to good practice for our guns sir he substituted but by dead reckoning captain sir fellows countered wearily three hours to the charleston bar and within range of the forts we will be cutting it exceeding fine sir i doubt our rebellious cousins would appreciate us taking her right on their front stoop i doubt the united states of america would shelter pirates all the more reason to catch her up before we reach their waters aye sir fellows nodded in agreement excuse me sir but i do believe the seawind is returning a puff or two from the southrd so far but it is veering sir well have stern winds in an hour i believe on our larboard quarter from the soueast my respects to the first lieutenant mister fellows and im here sir ballard announced from lewries offside just at his elbow which made alan almost leap in surprise ah good morning mister ballard hands to the sheets and the braces sir and shake out that reef in the foretopsl aye aye sir land ho a bow lookout shouted aft charleston light fine on the bows less than three hours to yankee jurisdiction then fellows sighed sorry sir it seems my dead reckonings off a mite time enough lewrie insisted just barely i hope true sunrise came and with it steady offshore winds out of the eastsoueast laden with the smell of storm and rain later in the day the dawn a gray and gloomy beast that dingied the whitecaps and stained the seas irongray as spilled washwater and suds two miles astern of caroline they approached relentlessly gaining then only one mile the range of random shot for their sixpounders even as the coast appeared to the west a thin dark green and blue thread and the tall spire of st michaels church rose skyward above the beacon and the charleston light caroline wore off the wind a little to the norwest and alacrity surged directly up her wake following the leads and the sea marks for fivefathom hole inside the charleston bar south of the ship channel it would be cut exceedingly fine as mr fellows had predicted half an hour would spell the difference between finneys escape or his ruin of being brought to battle or his gaining american waters seven cables sir ballard estimated hopefully about fourteen hundred yards we could try shots from the bow chase guns its no good lewrie commander rodgers griped all but wringing his hands to fetch him to closebroadsides well have to sail within range of fort johnston an fort moultrie damme if we aint but two miles off the charleston light now sir they do not have a battery to enforce their jurisdiction there sir lewrie countered drawn from dire musings about something aloft carrying away of some structural failure which would rob them of the prize at the last second we can chase her another two miles farther out of fivefathom hole right to the bar sir thats what their guns cover sir he must bear off more northerly out of fivefathom holesir ballard suggested slyly might we not wear ship now and cut the angle to close even more splendid mister ballard lewrie grinned and begin firing with the larboard battery id admire did you beat to quarters sir chase gun midshipman parham shouted spotting a puff of gunsmoke on carolines stern the light ball moaned past the starboard side to skip twice until it buried itself astern she has opened her fire upon us sir mister harkin hands wear ship mister neill larboard your helm steer nornorwest ballard called as another ball soared by to strike closer to the starboard side alacrity went tearing past a local fishing boat busy with her nets the americans aboard shaking fists at them and the black slaves gaping widemouthed at the sight of a british warship with all her colours flying beat to quarters alacritys crew boiled into action casting off the lashings of the greatguns fetching handspikes and crows removing tompions from the muzzles of both batteries and opening the gun ports charges came up from the magazine shot was selected and rammed home flintlocks were primed and cocked ready for battle sir ballard reported at last well bear off a little more to starboard to give the gunners a better angle lewrie decided oh with your permission commander of course ahum rodgers pondered heavily sir weve come this far lewrie groaned in a soft voice a half a mile more with roundshot the repercussions lewrie rodgers whispered well never hear the end of it from the damned foreign office the admiralty please sir theres time enough youll not violate american waters rodgers wheedled open fire mister ballard lewrie snapped before rodgers had a chance to change his mind interpreting that for a yes larboard yer helm mister fowles as you bear sir fire ballard shouted at once the forward twopounder chaseguns rapped out first followed by the deeper voices of the sixpounders angled in the portsills as far forward as they might bear the range was six cables twelvehundred yards with caroline sternon to them a difficult and narrow target shot tore the sea around her close to her waterline raising towering pillars of spray twice as high as her rails her mizzenmast jerked to a hit and the aftermost lugsail folded in on itself as it was pierced by a ball before ripping in twain from leech to luff a ball struck her right on the stern low on her transom near the rudder and made it twitch once like a dogs ear pestered by a fly chainshot and barshot mister fowles lewrie shouted to his grizzled old gunner who was pacing the gun deck bareheaded play a frog and aim high to take his rigging down sir it was french practice to open fire at long range with expanding barshot two halves of a roundshot connected by sliding lugs on iron bars to tear rigging and sails and shatter yards and spars chainshot was two lighter balls connected by a stout length of links designed to whirl end over end british practice was to close beam to beam and aim twixt wind and water to smash hulls overturn guns and shoot crews to rags to slay not cripple to sink not capture caroline lengthened as she turned off north in the narrow and shoallined channel her gun ports flew open inexplicably instead of running finney was going to fight it out eight side guns to our five i make it sir ballard pointed out after studying their foe with a spyglass ninepounders no less for what were about to receive lewrie nodded muttering me old saw may the good lord make us grateful caroline opened fire her starboard side erupting in a gush of brownishgray powder smoke shot through with stabs of quick hot flame alacrity seemed to shudder in fear to the rising moan of roundshot on the air before she was struck and rose a little on the scend of the sea as if holding her breath in dread anticipation a ninepounder ball struck forward near the larboard anchor cathead turning part of the bulwarks to flying splinters another fell short but skipped over the water to thud home deep in her lower hull amidships and the sea around her was flayed with close misses crashing up spray like the breaching of whales on the uproll fire fowles screamed the broadside roared out and carolines rigging jerked and twitched her foremast and jibs collapsed broken off twenty feet above the deck and she ploughed up a furrow of foam as she lost speed in the blink of an eye got him dammit lewrie hooted solid shot mister fowles they were out of fivefathom hole running hard due north for the inner side of the charleston bar with charleston light and the beacon abeam and to leeward caroline just a little ahead ofalacrity and not four cables range yards away and in the best killing zone for sixpounders caroline fired again her second broadside more ragged than the first unable to match the taut discipline of naval gunnery alacrity leapt under their feet as another shot hulled her as a ball struck her forward on the gunwale with shrieks two more sailed overhead close to the deck stunning people with their shock waves hull her mister fowles lewrie shouted feeling the lust for blood rising in his veins serve her hot and fast lads god help me but this is bloody marvelous he thought rejoicing in the hot satanic reek of powder smoke the ringing thunder of guns i must be daft but this is what i do truly love as much as life the broadside crashed out roundshot hammering home into the soft abaco pine of carolines hull lighter and less forgiving than good kentish oak they punched great ragged holes into her her timbers and scantling planking screaming and winging away from each strike even as she continued to fire her guns lighting up throughout her masts and remaining sails wiggling in pain above the smoke clouds iron crashed into alacrity men screamed as they were plucked backwards by splinters of wood or broken metal seamen writhed about on the deck suddenly legless pierced by jagged arrows of oak blood reeking in the morning like liquid copper loblolly boys tried to tend them even as fowles woods the gunners mate and the captains of each artillery piece thumped and lashed the lucky to keep firing to keep swabbing out to keep covering the vents while swabbing so the touchhole did not burn out for the powder monkeys to keep arriving with their fireproof cylinders of powder bags to keep ramming powder and shot down the hungry barrels to stand it like men and strain on the tackles to run out aim and fire back the guns leapt carriages hopping like crippled toads in the air to stutter on their trucks the decks shuddering with every cruel impact the guns slewing at the extent of the breeching ropes belching explosions of powder gushed from the muzzles and ears ached with so much noise ears bled with so much torture ears would sing for days afterwards and some hands would be deafened for life yet think themselves lucky if that was all they suffered this day cover yer vents sponge out overhaul the runout tackle caroline stood on north with alacrity directly abeam of her now as her rigging draped in tatters about her almost lost in powder smoke rolling down onto her like a channel fog shot howled in the air like witches raised great feathers of spray alongside thudded into her side one passed just over the larboard bulwarks and flew out to sea not touching a thing a black streak at the corner of the eye and two waisters on the gangway fell dead their hearts stopped by the shock of its passage charge yer guns shot yer guns grape atop ball run out yer guns and overhaul them tackles prime yer locks keep pinching us up mister neill lewrie told his helmsmen keep closing the range aye aye sir neill replied and shared a look with mr early the quartermasters mate who had been promoted to replace mr burke early took a look at the compass binnacle for the new course then at the faint smudges on the deck where burke had bled to death which had yet to come up in two weeks holystoning and almost swallowed his cud of tobacco cock yer locks twixt wind an water lads on the uproll fire fowles howled looking like an angry moses come down with the tablets his mouth open in a rictus of a smile the broadside exploded outwards long tongues of quick pink and amber flames and sparks following the smoke and the iron and caroline wailed in torment as the weight of roundshot ripped her vitals were almost on the charleston bar sir fellows shouted in lewries ear well be aground the very next minute so will she mister fellows alan shouted back but are we yet within range of fort johnston or moultrie no way to say sir in all this smoke then maybe theres no way for their gunners to say if we are or not either for all this smoke lewrie grinned wear ship to larboard steer due west to miss the bar mister ballard starboard battery well bear off west and rake her alacrity delivered one more smashing broadside at less than two cables range then spun about on her heels to sail away from danger pointing her jib boom due west at fort johnston once in clear air they could see the flags flying on the fort and the thin trails of smoke from the furnaces where shot was being heated for the heavy thirtytwo and fortytwopounder artillery should they get within range well damme look at that rodgers exclaimed pointing at caroline just do look at that the clever lying hound upon carolines mizzen nailed to the mast above the gaff asthe halyards had been shot away was the striped red and white banner with the starred blue canton of an american flag as you bear fire fowles called to his starboard gunners delirious and uncaring drunk on the power of his artillery alacrity heeled over to the broadside the range was a little over a cable and caroline came apart under the shock of their fire her elegantly oval transom caved in the transom plate below her taffrails which bore her name was shattered to matchwood and gilt the mizzenmast bearing the false flag was shot clean off just above the quarterdeck by shot one which slew everyone on the tiller in passing it stumped forward as it fell off the quarterdeck and onto the lower deck then cried over the larboard side and a moment later caroline ran aground on charleston bar her bows leaping upwards like a dolphin heeling over so far on her starboard side she put her gun ports in the water and her last middlemast fracturing and falling forward and to starboard cease fire mister fowles drop it shes a dead un lewrie called out mister ballard put us about quick as you can back out to sea fetchto soon as mister fellows determines were legally outside the yankee gunrange mister harkin ships boats over the side we will board the wreck mister odrado and warwick to lead the boarding party uhm they both be dead sir harkin had to report christ lewrie spat damme well miss em select whom you will then mister harkin aye aye sir well well miss odrado him and his guitar alan thought ships corporals were never lovedfeared damn right but never loved and warwick was half a brute kept good order though sir parham called pointing over the side sir theres a cutter putting out for us from shore from fort moultrie sir flag of truce in the sternsheets uhm commander rodgers as senior officer present perhaps you might be best in dealing with the yankee officials sir alan hinted ill go aboard the wreck and arrest the survivors thankee lieutenant lewrie rodgers sneered heavily

seaman in his majestys royal navy canoe lewrie promised no ones taking you anywhere oh sit down cony shove off thankee sah canoe grunted taking a place on a midship seat between oarsmen thankee caroline was a total ruin rigging sails halyards and sheets lay in messy profusion on her decks decks quilled with splinters and bulging upwards in starshaped cavities where masts had spiraled out of the keelwedges where entering shot had ruptured her thin smoke rose from smouldering canvas where powder charges had burst or burned where hot metal barrels had seared sails her artillery had been shot free to roll down to the starboard side crushing gunners into pasty broken mannequins splashed with gore so freely it looked as if some lunatic had run amok with barricoes of red lead paint bodies lay sprawled on every hand broken quilled dismembered disemboweled wounded cried piteously dragging themselves over the decks and leaving slugtracks of blood those hale were busy binding up those they could or drinking with singleminded purpose from scuttled kegs of rum dozens of wine bottles rolled in the scuppers already empty and a buccaneer sat on the midships cargo hatchway gratings shouting and weaving with a bottle in each hand drunk as a lord with the stump of his shattered leg sticking straight out in front of him wheres finney lewrie asked woy iz lordships aft admiral the wounded buccaneer cackled and hawked up phlegm to spit an bad cess tthe brainless bugger sez oy haw aft in iz greatcabins tend to that man lewrie ordered lets go cony canoehe stepped down into the well which held the short ladder into the greatcabin hatchway the door had been shot away by ball lewrie drew his sword and canoe and cony backed him up with cutlasses and a pistol each aft past the first mates cabin the chartspace and into the masters cabins pushing the door open with the tip of his blade to peer inside and gasp in awe finneys cabins were lush beyond imagining cream bulkheads all picked out with gold leaf polished wooden deck almost completely covered with turkey carpets and the furnishings rich and gleaming or they had been now the transom lay open to the wind and sea and it had all been scattered like a rummage sale in a secondhand shop the chairs dining table and desk shattered and overturned in a sea of fine clothes drapes and bedclothes lewrie sucked in bis breath as he espied a corpse buried in a pile of clothing and spilt seachest items he used his sword tip to lift the cloth aside well damme he shuddered with disgust it was not finney but a woman a tartedup doxy with bright blonde hair overdone with rouge and paints one sightless blue eye was fixed on the rich carpet the other and half of the back of her skull had been hacked away by grapeshot im over here ye bastard finney growled from the shadows by the starboard quartergallery making lewrie jump thet wuz jus molly decent enough trull she wuz fer a overthehill dramshop whore dig him out lewrie ordered and cony and canoe hefted a few crates and chests out of the way so he could face his foe at last he could not help hissing in his breath again when finney became visible lumped up against the bulwarks like a broken doll one arm shattered and bleeding his silk shirt red from wrist to collarbone and another gory stain in the lap of his fine ecru silk breeches a trickle of blood oozed from finneys lips and from his nose making him hawk and cough to clear his throat to breathe an thankee finney smiled through his certain pain thet last broadside done fer me lewrie an fer poor molly figgered i could use a womans comforts so i fetched her along shed niver seen charleston an had a hankerin tcome away with me an niver will now by christ werent fer yer meddlin peyton boudreau keepin sich a wary watch coulda been yer caroline alayin there dead now an by her own dear husbands hand what the devil are you talking about lewrie growled woulda took her if id had a mite more time tspare

held yer fire an id be strollin flash on the battery this minute lets get him on deck lewrie decided this ships going to break up the way shes pounding john canoe pushed his way along the outer bulkhead over wreckage and trash to put his arms under the pirate though finney begged him not to touch him no dont jaysis no finney howled as canoe began to lift he gave out a shrill scream as terrifying as a rabbit in a foxs jaws put me down jaysis joseph an mary love o god put me down will ye leave me be man think me backs shot plumb in half i caint feel nothin below me waist but atop aye jaysis let me die in peace willya now me arms broke tflinders mink these chests o mine stove in me ribs lewries eyes lit up with pleasure as he saw that part of the cargo that had shifted and crushed finney as caroline ran aground were the chests of gold and silver coin looted from the bank part of jack finneys personal hoard mixed among spilled coins were certificates of exchange and ledgers lookee here lewrie finney cajoled once the worst of pain had subsided theres a bottle o brandy yonder in my wine cabinet i see as hasnt been smashed been studyin it somethin fierce the last few minutes have a heart an fetch it willya lewrie let a sailin man go to his maker with a reason tsmile hey lemme have one taste fore i pass over wont be long fer either of us cony fetch the devil his brandy lewrie frowned pacing up the steep slant of the deck to larboard he could feel the caroline dying could feel her shift and shamble as the morning tide and the current played with her as waves made her pound on the charleston bar timbers groaned deep within planks sprung with sharp cries and now and again something in her hold thumped and drummed or gave way with a sharp crack wont be long before she breaks up lewrie thought well have to get all this stolen loot aboard alacrity before then john canoe he said fetch mister woods the gunners mate and a working party to pack up this loot and get it aboard our ship aye aye sah now tell me about commodore garvey finney lewrie demanded once canoe was goneright tasty this finney replied leering back at him between deep gulps from the neck of the bottle one o me one of my finest imports i do declare sir we dont have much time finney lewrie pressed coming down to starboard again you do dont ye now finney snapped then cried out with the vehemence of his accusation that had caused fresh waves of agony ah jaysis tis a hard life ive had but a few good years in the bahamas an now yeve ruined that doesnt seem fair it dont you to goon livin with a wife handsome as yer caroline a boybaby an all an i tbe dyin mint an broke my god you lewrie spluttered in amazement thinking of all of jack finneys victims seems damned fair to me after causing all that misery and murder now what about commodore garvey i want to know for certain tell me how he helped you and how much he cost you ye dont get it do ye lewrie finney laughed softly god how much i hate ye lewrie iver since thet night in the inn when ye turned yer nose up at me invitation looked me over like a muddy pig an spite me willya sneer at me willya well tis only fair i get a

beat ye after all lewrie now why dont ye shit in yer fine hat there clap it on yer head an call it a brown tiewig woods men arrived and began to fetch out the crates and chests scooping up loose coins to cram back into the boxes and lewrie knew their own pockets if someone didnt look sharp after them there would be no prize money no head bounty and all that they recovered would be droits of the crown instead of droits of the admiralty so his men would have nothing to show for death or wounds lewrie decided to ignore the litde they could get away with this time theyd earned it take all o this sir woods inquired waving about the cabin aye all of it there may be some evidence hidden away in the odd chest or bag lewrie nodded leave the bastard nothing we be leavin him sir woods asked beg pardon for me to be suggestin captain but the seasre gettin up wed best be quick about it sir mister ballards sent our other boats over aye we will be lewrie nodded scuffing about the cabins in frustration over finneys hateful mocking silence about garvey uhm youll be wantin us to take this too sir woods said gesturing to the shadowed forward bulkhead where the dining space had been this pitcher sir christ alan rasped in shock on the bulkhead hung a portrait now askew and gnawed in a lower corner by grapeshot in canvas and the frame it was a copy of his own portrait of caroline not an oval as was his but rectangular copied closer about her face to eliminate the gardens and east bay augustus hedley had done it himself for in the lower right corner was his florid signature wot a bastard woods grunted namin this lugger o his after your good lady sir an now this take it to the boat sir aye mister woods ill not have her go down with him or give him any comfort to look upon thankee mister woods aye aye sir finney you miserable shit lewrie shouted wheeling about to walk back to the man flexing his hand on his swords hilt pondering hard on whether to kill him that instant or let him groan in agony and drown as the best and most painful death for him manys the nights i wuz inspired tgaze upon her lewrie finney boasted rattlin a whore an lookin at her an wishin almost had her dammef i didnt though dont sir cony said stepping between to block lewrie from drawing his sword es agoadin ya sir so e kin die quick god o mercy sir let im drown es aspittin up blood arready drown in gorer seawater sir evry rock o this wrecks apainin im good as the fires o hell sir tis best e suffers so mister lewrie lewrie panted hard affronted to be held in check and lookee this sir cony whispered pointing with his chin to a cylindrical traveling bag on the deck from beneath a pile of hastily crammed in silk shirts and neckstocks peeked a stack of old ledgers lookee this un sir in is own and sir lewrie fought down his rage and opened the ledger cony offered him it was in finneys nearillegible scrawl not so much an account of debits and credits but a log such as a mate would keep more like a diary there were entries of ships taken by whom how many shares the crew got who had died and would require settlements for wives or girls expenditures of powder and shot values of goods taken of how much pirated ships sold for in havana or cartagena along with such dry accountings of mayhem and murder finney made his comments about his illegal business wrote his screeds about the high cost of bribing government officials listedoh my god lewrie smiled suddenly bless you will cony thankee sir cony grinned shyly ah twas a lovely brandy finney groaned blissfully tossing the empty bottle aside given enough warnin tis right a man gets a chance tdie dead drunk lewrie took the ledger with him as he walked down the deck to finney for the last time me curses pon ye lewrie finney beamed coughing on blood in his mouth trying to spit some at lewrie who stood just a little too far away to hit bad cess tye yer handsome bitch yer brat an all yer kin bad cess fer the rest o yerlives lewrie held up the book opened it so finney could see and recognize his own hand and know it for what it was ah no finney groaned screwing up his ruggedly handsome face like a petulant child caroline was swept by a breaking wave making her thump and pound on the bar harder than before and shift with the sound of sliding sands wood croaked and screamed id tell you to go to the devil calico jack but then we both know thats where youre bound dont we lewrie chuckled as he put the ledger under his arm how did it go calico calico who will buy my calico tis jack jack the calico man oh ye brute oh ya bastard finney raved as water began to seep into the cabins to froth in through loosened plankings know how to swim calico jack lewrie taunted that might keep you alive a minute longer itll hurt like hell of course youuu finney screamed lets go cony we have what we came for epilogue any nation that won t support a navy to protect its interests cant have much objection to make now can they captain childs said with a guffaw as he dined rodgers and lewrie in in the greatcabins of his frigate guardian the point was made sir rodgers snickered back diplomatic though not quite so pointed as you couch it an after they learned finney was a british master in a britishflagged ship that shut them up well tis all settled now childs went on happily finneys dead his enterprises foundered and his pirates all scattered hell to huttersfield bank funds recovered all of finneys illgotten gains property of the crown a neat bit o business in the end what about his commercial interests sir lewrie was forced to ask his legitimate interests that is and surely sir i found many names in his ledgers of civilians who turned a blind eye or did his bidding for a price government officials ahem childs sobered the uhm our royal governor is now in possession of those ledgers lieutenant lewrie i would imagine that some investigation is proceeding and that someday they will be brought to book civilian doings no matter to the fleet finneys storesre already taken over by the other bay street merchants lock stock and barrel commander rodgers added reaching for the wine bottle on the sideboard stock bought up at pence to a pound at auction though devil a hope we have o lower prices in our lifetimes amen to that sir childs chimed in eyeing rodgers liberality with his wine might pass that down once youre done sir and the commodore sir lewrie presumed to question ah well childs scowled hmm pity bout that tropical ague that took him of a sudden didnt look that sick for so long as they say he was no tis best hes off home to recover in milder climes with nothing but his navy pay in the end rodgers laughed as he passed the bottle down and that in arrears for all his high living the admiraltyd probably send someone else out next spring to command the bahamas squadron childs sighed cant have a mere frigate captain such as myself in charge for long with so many senior men with impeccable connections sitting around on halfpay but copies of the allegations did go to the admiralty sir lewrie pressed harder after all i would assume commodore garvey had impeccable connections mat could well preserve his career aye i sent em lewrie if thats what youre wondering sir childs glowered at him all we may do is but hope that our lords commissioners will take them into account for next time hope he makes bloody admiral rodgers snorted well into his cups at their very private supper sir gentlemen allow me to propose a toast to commodore horace garvey may he attain the rank of rear admiral in his majesty king george the thirds royal navy bloody hell lewrie muttered but forced to raise his glass of the permanently retired yellow squadron commander rodgers concluded with a bark of a laugh and tipped his glass up to drain it right down to heeltaps theres the fine little fellow lewrie cooed to his son who had at last warmed to his presence and didnt bawl when he saw him any longer lewrie sat rocking on the dogrun terrace young sewallis a tightly swaddled bundle in the crook of one arm entertaining him as he would william pitt the cat with a length of smallstuff tied in a bowline dangled for tiny fingers to grasp every time he succeeded in getting hold of the loop in the line he gurgled his pleasure and lit up his features with a radiant cockeyed smile lewrie rewarded him with a dandle on his knee which made seawallis even more ecstatic lucky fellow you are seawallis alan assured him first son bound for the law oxford or cambridge youll never have to go to sea like your daddy does tis a miserable bloody life dont teach him bad words alan caroline said coming out to sit by him and deliver two glasses of wine hell learn them soon enough yes e will pretty baby ooh lil man seawallis yes your daddy i like to have daddy play with oo yes oo do mommy knows oo do mommy can speak the kings enghsh seawallis alan snickered daddy knows she can and someday oo will too aint that a bloo wont that be a wonder he turned to look at caroline she looked at him and they both laughed at themselves for a fond moment until alan wriggled his nose and looked down at his lap young seawallis had become so delighted he had fouled himself and quickly soaked through his swaddlings to turn lewries breeches both wet and pale brown oh bugger ill take him sah wyonnie offered coming out to the dogrun time fo his nap fo suppah anyhow sah thankee wyonnie lewrie said thank god its my worst and oldest breeches i fetch ya a towel sah fatherhood lewrie thought hmmm it must get better as they become continent surely how long will alacrity be in dock caroline asked sipping her wine putting her feet up on her hassock and enjoying the sunset about a week to ten days alan replied taking his own wine in hand little more than a year in bahamian waters and her bottom is foul as the forest of dean copper or no least she wasnt eaten with teredo worms like whippet was tis a miracle to me we made the speed we did catching finney with that much growth on the bottom or him being foolish enough to break off his flight to fight us just within sight of safety carrying too much sail loafing along perhaps a higher power aided you dear carohne said with a secret smile a higher power with a strong sense of justice i would suppose so alan allowed so we have two blessed weeks to look forward to then she said you at home every evening she scooted her chair over closer to his so they could lean together and put their arms about each others shoulders companionably sleep in the same bed each night wake together so close and snug alan suggested alan she said after a meaningful purring noise he looked for the tiny vertical line between her brows and found it oh shit he thought with trepidation what now when finney was here that eveningthe bastard yes but caroline agreed taking a sip of wine and gazing out towards potters cay among his blandishments to win me he told me or he strongly suggested that is that you were known in the navy by a nickname that you were awfully young to have gained one but that in the fleet you were known as the ramcat he as much as said right out that it alluded to faithless amorous where did he come by that dear she concluded looking at him closely oh god alan smiled hiding his panic damned well even if he did say so himself he threw in a tiny chuckle caroline love i suppose it came aboard the shrike brig under old lieutenant lilycrop i ended up with william pitt and half a dozen other cats hed make me a present of one from every litter and we had so many utters we were ankledeep in kittens fobbed em off on every passing ship we spoke and it was me that had to make the offers half the time and well navy blue coats and cat hair dont mix dont ya know every time i reported somewhere i was constantly brushing myself down and having william pitt in london with me i believe admiral hood named me that in jest before i went out to the far east with burgess when i reported to him pitt had been at my coat i expect thats where it comes from darling you went to sir samuel hoods with cat hair on your coat she giggled and the smell of his blessings on me too most like alan tried to giggle back oh god what a picture no wonder he called you ramcat he could smell it on you and see it darling its a wonder at all he gave you an active commission she laughed out loud better than herding swine on halfpay and facing him in straw and pig shit lewrie agreed promise youll never tell that on me oh ill not ever she told him leaning closer to hug and kiss him but i cant help thinking about it just between us itll make a fine tele to tell sewallis when hes older yes it will caroline agreed and its not a bad sobriquet for you to have youll always go after your foe like william pitt like an angry ramcat that i will he said and thank bloody christ she bought that he thought gratefully afterword john murray fourth earl of dunmore royal governor to the bahamas from to was just about as bad as i portrayed him and as the estimable william wylly cited further writes nor was the immorality of his private life any less reprehensible than the defects of his public character fort charlotte familiar to all visitors to nassau was started at an estimate of ј and ended up costing the government ј he was more interested in his own mansion and a magnificent estate and house at harbour island which is officially named dunmore town but never by the longsuffering inhabitants who ever had anything to do with him or paid his exorbitant rents his administration was as corrupt as they come his appointments termed by another writer bankrupts beggars blackguards and the husbands of his whores for one his searcher of customs whose wife bore him a child during his tenure for anyone interested in delving further into the history of the bahamas let me recommend a history of the bahamas by michael craton did carolines obeahman cause jack finneys downfall to get to him at long range after he sailed she would have needed the power of an expensive witch far beyond the powers of an average whitemagic obeah practitioner an obeah doctor would need a snakewitch an animal that could swim long distances to fix people far away witch in this instance is the curse itself as in what an oldtimer in the islands would say when he or she threatens to work witch on ya theres a good chapter on obeah in insight guides bahamas rd edition available in most tourguide sections in your local bookstore or dr timothy mccartneys book ten ten the bible tenobeah in the bahamas should you visit nassau take a sidetrip to fox hill and ask aroundrespectfully lastly i hope the citizens of the bahamas will forgive me for making john canoe even briefly a seaman in the royal navy he was reputed to be an escaped slave a mythic figure of hope to those still in slavery a strong proud man who stole a boat and paddled away from chains and whips still honoured every year in the bahamas whether he was a real man or a hopedfor hero of cleverness and power who could surmount contemporary problems like anglosaxon jack tales or the stories about brer rabbit who always won indirectly by wits besides doesnt it make a better story than the yoruba word of the egungun cult gensinconnu meaning wearers of masks to name the annual festival junkanoo for the man john canoe finally what further lies in store for alan lewrie the peaceful end of an active commission in the bahamas of course which takes him to but just a few years later there was war with france a naval war which dragged on until the highest fruition of sailing ships and squarerigger warfarethe great age of sail would the admiralty not consider themselves fortunate to have the services of such a splendid on paper at least seadog or in this case ramcat will he ever live that sobriquet down will caroline ever suspect its true origin will arthur ballard influence alan lewrie or will lewrie corrupt ballard when next they cross each others hawse as we used to say down in memphis to tease the pm report on action news stay tuned
