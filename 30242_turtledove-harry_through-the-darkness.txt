through the darkness harry turtledove volume of the darkness sextet the derlavai war into the darkness darkness descending through the darkness rulers of the darkness jaws of darkness out of the darkness one ealstan was still shaky on his feet the young forthwegian gauged how sick hed been by how long he was taking to get better he also gauged how sick hed been by the medicine with which vanai had helped him break his fever when his wits came back he scolded her you went out you shouldnt have done that you shouldnt have taken the chance the algarvians might have grabbed you and he didnt want to go on vanai glared at him her grayblue eyes flashed people said kaunians didnt get so excited as forthwegians living with vanai had proved to ealstan that people didnt know what they were talking about what should i have done she demanded stayed here and watched you die and then tried to go out i wasnt going to die but ealstans comeback wasnt so persuasive as he would have wanted even to himself he couldnt remember the last time hed been so sick when he looked at himself in the mirror he saw how the flesh had melted from his swarthy hooknosed face circles almost as dark as his eyes lay under them anyhow it worked out all right vanai said i went out i found an apothecary i got what you needed and i came back nothing else happened no ealstan said and now she had trouble meeting his gaze he pointed at her what was it how bad was it nothing else happened she repeated and slamming doors and falling bars were in her voice a long time before when theyd first got to know each other hed decided he would be wise not to ask her what shed gone through in oyngestun this was liable to be another time when trying to force truth from her would do more harm than good let it go then he said with a weary nod he was still weary all the time he was so weary a couple of days could go by without his having any interest in making love before he got sick he wouldnt have believed such a thing possible but weary or not he had to go out to buy food for the cupboards in the flat were nearly empty if he didnt go out vanai would have to shed done it once he didnt want her to have to do it twice not when the redheaded occupiers of forthweg had made her kind fair game moving like a man four times his age he walked to the market square to buy beans and dried peas and barley and lentils as long as he and vanai had enough of those they wouldnt starve the trouble was he couldnt carry so much as he had before either that meant he had to make two trips to bring back the food he should have been able to take in one by the time he finally got through he felt ready for the knackers yard vanai fixed him a cup of mint tea after hed drunk it she half dragged him to the bedroom peeled his shoes off him and made him lie down he hoped she would lie down beside him or on top of him or however she chose instead she said go to sleep he did when he woke he felt much more like himself by then vanai did lie curled beside him her mouth had fallen open she was snoring a little he looked over at her and smiled she didnt just know what he wanted she knew what he needed too and that was liable to be more important a couple of days later he started going out and about through eoforwic seeing the people for whom he cast accounts he discovered hed lost a couple of them to other bookkeepers inevitable he supposed when he hadnt been able to let them know why he wasnt showing up that hed kept as many clients as he had pleased him very much ethelhelm the singer and drummer wasnt in his flat when ealstan came to call the doorman for the building said the gentleman has taken his band on tour sir he did give me an envelope to give you if you returned while he and his colleagues were away thanks ealstan said and then had to hand the fellow a coin for doing what he should have done for nothing ealstan took the envelope and went off before opening it whatever it held he didnt want the doorman knowing it hello the note read im hoping youve come down with something if you havent the algarvians have probably come down on you and your lady you can get over the one easier than the other i think the way things are these days if you re reading this everything is probably all right if you re not then i wish you were take care of yourself the band leader had scrawled his name below the last sentence ealstan smiled as he refolded the note and put it in his belt pouch ethelhelm enjoyed speaking in riddles and paradoxes and ealstan could hardly find fault with this one better to have any natural sickness than to let the algarvians know he was harboring vanai that point got driven home when he came back to his own sorry little street a couple of overage overweight algarvian constables were standing in front of the block of flats next to his one of them turned to him and asked you knowing any kaunian bitch living in this street here no sir ealstan answered i dont think any of the stinking blonds are left in this part of town he did his best to sound like an ordinary forthwegian a forthwegian who hated kaunians as much as king mezentios men did the other algarvian spoke in his own language oh leave it alone by the powers above so we didnt get to have her the world wont end she paid us off bah the first constable said even if all these buggers say they never saw her we both know shes around here somewhere after king mezentios men took gromheort ealstans home town in eastern forthweg theyd made academy students start learning algarvian instead of classical kaunian that no doubt helped make the students better subjects it also sometimes had other uses ealstan made a point of looking as dull and uninterested as he could digging her out is more trouble than its worth the second constable insisted and if we try digging her out and dont come up with her well be walking the beat around the city dump till the end of time come on lets go though he kept grumbling the constable whod spoken forthwegian let himself be persuaded off he went with his pal ealstan stared after them if they were talking about anyone but vanai he would have been amazed but they werent going to call in their pals and try to unearth her ealstan clung to that as he walked upstairs he wondered if he ought to mention what hed overheard he decided that was a bad idea when vanai let him in after his coded knock she clicked her tongue between her teeth in dismay sit down she said in tones that brooked no argument youre worn to a nub let me get you some wine you shouldnt have gone out i have to keep my business going or else we wont be able to buy food he said but he was glad to sit down on the shabby sofa and stretch his feet out in front of him vanai fetched him the wine clucking all the while and sat down beside him he cocked his head to one side you dont need to make such a fuss over me no she raised an eyebrow if i dont who will ealstan opened his mouth then closed it again he had no good answer and was smart enough to realize as much if they didnt take care of each other here in eoforwic no one else would things werent as they had been back in gromheort for him with his mother and father and sister to worry about him and his big brother to flatten any nuisances he couldnt handle himself and having vanai fuss over him wasnt like having his mother fuss he had trouble defining how and why it wasnt but the difference remained after another sip of wine he decided that vanai even though she fussed didnt treat him as if he were two years old while she was doing it as far as his mother was concerned he would never be anything but a child he took one more sip of wine then nodded to vanai thank you he told her this is good its what i needed youre welcome she said and laughed though not as if she were merry and carefree i sound silly dont i but i hardly know what to do when somebody tells me that my grandfather didnt or not very often and the things i had to do for him she laughed again even more grimly than before maybe brivibas had trouble figuring out you werent a baby anymore ealstan said if that was true for his parentsespecially his motherwhy not for vanais grandfather too but she shook her head no he had an easier time with me when i was small he could count on me to do as i was told then later on now her eyes twinkled later on he never could be sure i wouldnt do something outrageous and disgracefulsay falling in love with a forthwegian well if you had to pick something outrageous and disgraceful im glad you picked that ealstan said so am i vanai answered a lot of my other choices were worse she looked bleak again but with what seemed a distinct effort of will put aside the expression her voice thoughtful she went on you know i didnt fall in love with you not really till wed been in this flat for a while no ealstan said in no small surprise hed fallen head over heels in love with her from the moment shed given him her body that was how he thought of it anyway she shook her head again no i always liked you from the first time we met hunting mushrooms i wouldnt have done what i did there in the woods last fall if i hadnt but you were a way out for me when i didnt think i could have one i needed a while to see to be sure how much more you were for a moment his feelings were hurt then he realized shed paid him no small compliment i wont let you down he said vanai leaned over and gave him a quick kiss i know you wont she answered dont you see thats one of the reasons i love you no one else has ever been like that for me i suppose my mother and father would have been but i can hardly even remember them ealstan had always known he could count on his family hed taken that as much for granted as the shape of his hand he said im sorry that must have been hard it must have been even harder because youre a kaunian in a mostly forthwegian kingdom you might say so aye you just might say so vanais voice went harsh and ragged and do you know what the worst part of that is ealstan shook his head he wasnt sure she noticed she was staring at nothing in particular as she went on the worst part of it is we didnt know when we were well off in forthweg we kaunians were well off would you have believed that i wouldnt have believed it but it was true all we needed was the algarvians to prove it and they did ealstan put his arm around her he thought of those two chubby constables in kilts and hoped the powers above would keep them away even if he hadnt been feeling so feeble he feared that encircling arm wouldnt be so much protection as vanai was liable to need but it was what he could give it was what she had she seemed to sense as much for she moved closer to him well get through it he said somehow or other well get through it they cant win vanai said i cant stay hidden forever and theres nowhere i can go either not if they win but the algarvians could win as ealstan knew all too well maybe not in forthweg he admitted but forthweg isnt the only kingdom in the world either vanai looked at him as if hed taken leave of his senses maybe i have he thought but then again maybe i havent hajjaj stared down at the papers his secretary handed him well well he said this is a pretty pickle isnt it aye your excellency qutuz answered how do you propose to handle it carefully the zuwayzi foreign minister said which won a smile from qutuz hajjaj went on and by that i mean not least not letting the algarvians know im doing anything at all theyre our allies after all how long do you suppose you can keep this business secret qutuz asked a while hajjaj replied not indefinitely and before it is secret no more i had better get king shazlis views on the matter i had better see if i can bring king shazlis views around to my own if they happen to differ now i dont think that will wait please let his majestys servitors know that i seek audience with him at his earliest convenience his secretary bowed i shall attend to it directly your excellency he said and hurried away hajjaj nodded at his bare brown departing backside like all zuwayzin qutuz wore clothes only when dealing with important foreigners hajjajs secretary was diligent no doubt about it when he said directly he meant it and only a couple of hours later that afternoon hajjaj bowed low before the king i gather this is a matter of some urgency shazli said he was a bright enough lad or so hajjaj thought of himthe late sixties looking back at the early thirties shall we dispense with the rituals of hospitality then if your majesty would be so kind hajjaj replied and the king inclined his head thus encouraged hajjaj continued you need to declare your policy on a matter of both some delicacy and some importance to the kingdom say on shazli told him i shall hajjaj brandished the papers qutuz had given him in the past couple of weeks we have had no fewer than three small boats reach our eastern coastline from forthweg all three were packed almost to the sinking point with kaunians and all the kaunians alive when they came ashore have begged asylum of us sometimes to flavor a dish zuwayzi chefs would fill a little cheesecloth bag with spices and put it in the pot they were supposed to take it out when the meal was cooked but every once in a while they forgot shazli looked like a man who had just bitten down on one of those bags thinking it a lump of meat they beg asylum from us because of what our allies are doing to their folk back in forthweg even so your majesty hajjaj agreed if we send them back we send them to certain death if we grant them asylum we offend the algarvians as soon as they learn of it and we run the risk that everything in forthweg that floats will put to sea and head straight for zuwayza what algarve is doing to the kaunians in forthweg offends me shazli said he needed only the royal we to sound as imperious as king swemmel of unkerlant hajjaj had never felt prouder of him the king went on and any kaunians who escape will be a cut above the common crowdis it not so its likely at any rate your majesty the foreign minister answered asylum they shall have then shazli declared hajjaj bowed as deeply as his agestiffened body would let him i am honored to serve you but what shall we say to marquis balastro when he learns of it as he surely will before long king shazli smiled a warm confident smile hajjaj knew what that sort of smile had to mean even before the king said that i leave to you your excellency i am sure you will find a way to let us do what is right while at the same time not enraging our allys minister i wish i were so sure your majesty hajjaj said i do remind you i am only a man not one of the powers above i can do one of those things or the other i have no idea how to do both at once youve been managing the impossible now for as long as zuwayza has had her freedom back from unkerlant shazli said do you wonder when i tell you i think you can do it again your majesty may i have your leave to go hajjaj asked that was as close as hed ever come to being rude to his sovereign he softened it at once by adding if i am to do thisif i am to try to do thisi shall need to lay a groundwork for it if i possibly can you may go of course shazli said and good fortune attend your groundlaying but hed heard the edge in his foreign ministers voice by his sour expression he didnt care for it bowing his way out hajjaj didnt care for being put in a position where he had to snap at the king when the foreign minister got back to his office qutuz raised an inquiring eyebrow they will stay hajjaj said all i have to do now is devise a convincing explanation for marquis balastro as to why they may stay no small order his secretary observed if anyone can do it though you are the man again hajjaj was bemused that others had so much more faith in him than he had in himself since shazli had given him the task though he had to try to do it bring me a city directory for bishah if you would be so kind he said qutuzs eyebrows climbed again a city directory he echoed hajjaj nodded and offered not a word of explanation his secretary mumbled something under his breath now hajjajs eyebrow rose in challenge qutuz had no choice but to go fetch a directory but he was still mumbling as he went even though hajjaj donned his spectacles reading the small print in the directory was a trial fortunately he had a good notion of the kinds of names he was looking for whenever he came across one he underlined it in red ink and dogeared the page so he could find it again in a hurry he nodded at a couple of the names they belonged to men hed known for years when he was done he put the directory in his desk and hoped he wouldnt have to pull it out again that that was a forlorn hope he knew perfectly well and sure enough less than a week later qutuz came in and told him marquis balastro is waiting in the outer office he came without seeking an appointment first and he says he couldnt care less whether you bother putting on clothes or not balastro no doubt meant it he came closer to conforming to zuwayzi usages than any other minister nevertheless hajjaj said tell him that for the sake of my kingdoms dignity i prefer to dress before receiving him getting into those ridiculous wrappings will also give me time to think but you need not tell him that be sure to bring in tea and wine and cakes as quick as you can just as you say your excellency qutuz promised first though the algarvian balastro usually had the hailfellowwellmet air so many of his countrymen could don with ease not today today he was furious and making no effort to hide it or perhaps today he donned a mask of fury with as much skill as he usually used while wearing a mask of affability before balastro could do much in the way in the way of blustering hajjajs secretary came in with the customary dainties on a silver tray the algarvian minister fumed to see them but his manners were too good to let him talk business for a while hajjaj carefully hid his smile he enjoyed turning the algarvians respect for zuwayzi customs against him but the small talk over refreshments could go on only so long at last hajjaj had to ask and to what do i owe the pleasure of this unexpected visit unexpected i doubt it balastro said but some of the harsh edge was gone from his voice qutuz had picked a particularly smooth particularly potent wine still he did not sound accommodating as he went on unless you can speak the truth when you tell me your kingdom isnt taking in kaunian fugitives no i cannot do that and i do not intend to try hajjaj replied zuwayza is indeed taking in kaunian refugees and will continue to do so king mezentio has charged me to say to you that your giving haven to these fugitivesmarquis balastro clung to his own wordcannot be construed as anything but an unfriendly act on the part of your kingdom he glared at hajjaj the wine hadnt softened him so much after all algarve knows full well how to punish unfriendly acts i am sure of it hajjaj glared back is mezentio thinking of using us as fodder for his mages to kill to power their sorceries along with however many kaunians you have left the sheer insolence of that far out of character for hajjaj made balastro lean forward in surprise by no means your excellency he replied after a pause for thought but you are an ally or so algarve has believed do you wonder that we mislike it when you clasp our enemies to your bosom zuwayza is a small kingdom of free men hajjaj replied do you wonder that we welcome others who come to us looking for freedom they cannot find in their own lands i wonder that you welcome kaunians balastro growled and you know cursed well why i wonder that you welcome them too indeed i do hajjaj pulled the city directory out of the drawer where he had put it a few days before and opened it to one of the dogeared pages i see here the name of uderzo the florist who has been here for thirty years now since he got out of algarve at the end of the six years war and here is goscinnio the portraitist he has been here just as long and got here the same way do you think forthweg and jelgava and valmiera and lagoas werent screaming at us for taking in algarvian refugees if you do sir youre daft he opened the directory to yet another marked page i can show you a great many more if you like never mind i take your point but balastro didnt look or sound happy about taking it i remind you though your excellency that you were not allied to any of those kingdoms at the time as i have told you before we are your allies we are your cobelligerents against unkerlant but we are not your servants or your slaves hajjaj replied if you try to treat us as if we were we shall have to see how long we can remain your allies if you bring in spies and enemies we shall have to see whether we want you for allies balastro said remember how many dragons you have from us and how many behemoths remember how our dragonfliers help ward your skies if you want to face unkerlant on your own he shrugged would mezentio make good on such a threat he might and hajjaj knew it the zuwayzi foreign minister dared not underestimate the hatred the king of algarve had for kaunians how long ago were you begging us for more help here in the north hajjaj asked not very as i recall we didnt get much of it as i recall balastro leaned forward again this time with keen interest might we get more in exchange for looking the other way at certain things you do algarvians were good at looking the other way when there were things they didnt want to see hajjaj usually found that trait dismaying now he might be able to use it to zuwayzas advantage that could be a bargain or the start of one he said hoping to escape this dilemma with honor after all skarnus world had shrunk to the farm where he lived with merkela and raunu the hamlet of pavilosta and the roads between those places hed had little reason and less chance to go far astray since washing up on the farm one more piece of flotsam tossed adrift as valmiera foundered by now though hed made a name for himself as one of the leaders of the fight against algarve in his country he wasnt sure how he felt about that on the one hand he was flattered that other valmierans knew he was one of those who hadnt despaired of the kingdom on the other their knowing he remained a rebel against the occupiers made it more likely the redheads would find out too and so when he strode into the town of tytuvenai he looked around to make sure no algarvians were paying him any undue attention to his surprise he saw hardly any of king mezentios men on the streets valmieran constables as blond as skarnu patrolled them instead in smart uniforms that reminded him of the one hed worn in the army they eyed his homespun tunic and baggy trousers with almost as much scorn as nobles in priekule would have aimed at him come to see the bright lights farmboy one of them called to skarnu the fellows partner laughed aye skarnu answered with a wide foolish grin the role he played amused him a city man pretending to be a country yokel to fool a couple of other city men but if the new audience criticized his performance he wouldnt get a bad notice in the local news sheet hed get killed hed never been in tytuvenai before and so some of his curiosity was genuine the town hed heard had some monuments that dated back to the days of the kaunian empire he saw none he did see some plots of ground that looked as if theyd recently held something or other but were now empty he wondered if algarvian wreckers had got rid of monuments they didnt fancy as he knew theyd done elsewhere in valmiera after some searching he found the tavern called the drunken dragon the dragon on the signboard above the door certainly looked as if it had had several too many skarnu smiled up at it before he went inside he checked to make sure no one had picked his pockets the drunken dragon lay in that kind of neighborhood valmieran constables didnt come hereabouts inside the place was dark and smoky and crowded people gave skarnu a stranger a onceover as he made his way to the bar whatll it be asked the taverner a man missing a couple of fingers from his right handprobably from a wound in the six years war for he was old enough ale and roasted chestnuts skarnu answered as hed been told to do the taverner eyed him then slowly nodded after giving him what hed asked for the fellow said why dont you take em over to that table by the fireplace looks like its got room for a couple more all right ill do that skarnu said the men sitting at that table didnt look much different from the rest of the crowd some were old some were young none looked rich one or two looked a good deal shabbier than skarnu did a couple but only a couple looked as if theyd be nasty customers in a fight where you from one of the toughlooking fellows asked that was the question hed been waiting for pavilosta he answered ah the tough said several of the men nodded one of them lifted a glass of wine in salute simanu that was a nice piece of work skarnu had never heard an assassination praised in such matteroffact terms this was the crowd hed come to meet all right he hoped none of the blonds at the table was an algarvian spy by coming to tytuvenai hed bet his life none of them was a balding fellow with silverrimmed spectacles said were just about all here now i dont know if zarasai will be able to come that was not the name of a man but the name of a town a sensible precaution skarnu judged the bespectacled man went on those people talk all the way across valmiera they can act all over the kingdom at the same time too we have to be able to do the same if were going to make their lives interesting it sounds good the ruffian said but how do we go about it the post is slow and the whoresons read it where are we going to get enough crystals and how do we keep their mages from listening in on them emanations will leak and we cant afford it not if we want to keep breathing we cant those are good questions the man with the silver spectacles said nodding but we cant go on as we have been either a good blow like the one at count simanu went half wasted because we didnt make those people sweat all over the place at the same time and we could have but we didnt because we didnt know it would happen till after it did nobody talked about algarvians or redheads or named king mezentio that skarnu judged was also wise no telling who might be trying to listen at some of the nearby tables skarnu said only trouble is if youd known ahead of time they might have known ahead of time too aye that was the tough again his voice gone savage weve spawned enough traitors and to spare thats certain and its not just the nobles who go riding with those people or the noblewomen who let those people go riding on them either skarnu thought of his sister the marchioness krastaan algarvian colonels lover these daysbut not for long for the fellow was continuing theres traitors all the way down when our time comes round again well have some fancy killing to do he sounded as if he looked forward to every bit of it we must be ruthless but we must be fair the bespectacled man said this isnt unkerlant after all the tough tossed his head no it sure isnt is it unkerlant is still in the fight dont you wish we could say the same skarnu winced that hit home painfully hard he said were still in the fight a whole tables worth of us the tough said speaks well for the kingdom that it does but youre right pavilosta were what valmieras got and were the ones who are going to set her to rights when the day is ours one of the other irregulars was about to say something when the tavern door opened the fellow with the silverrimmed spectacles nodded to himself maybe that will be zarasai after all but it wasnt yet another valmieran who hadnt given up on the fight against algarve instead it was a kilted algarvian officer backed by a handful of his own countrymen and quite a few more valmieran constables he spoke in a loud voice i am hearing there is an unlawful assembling here you are all under arresting for questioning somebody threw a mug at himnot somebody from the table at which skarnu sat it caught the redhead in the face he went down with a yowl clutching at his smashed face a moment later all the mugs in the drunken dragon seemed to be flying skarnu wasnt sure the valmieran army had tossed so many eggs at the redheads while it was still a going concern but mugs were less deadly than eggs and these algarvians and their valmieran stooges surged into the tavern some of them had bludgeons and started beating on anyone they could reach some of them had sticks to skarnus shame the redheads trusted the valmieran constables with such weapons sure they would use them against their own countrymen except for the fire all the lights in the tavern went out that just made the brawl more confusing skarnu sprang off his chair and laid about him the chair slammed into somebodys ribs whoever it was went down with a groan skarnu hoped hed flattened a foe not a friend back here that was the bespectacled mans voice it came from the direction of the bar skarnu fought his way toward it someone close by him took a beam in the chest and toppled when skarnu smelled burnt flesh he went down too and crawled the rest of the way the valmieran army had failed against algarve but hed learned how to fight in it behind the bar he almost crawled over the tough the fellow grinned at him and said come on pal i know the back way good skarnu said i hoped there was one he also hoped the algarvians and the constables who did their bidding werent watching it and scooping up fleeing foes one by one the tough scrambled into the little room in back of the bar skarnu followed him the little room had a door that opened on the alleyway behind the drunken dragon the tough hurried through it skarnu would have peered out first but when the tough didnt get blazed he followed again nobody looked to be watching the alley maybe the algarvians didnt know it was there and maybe the valmieran constables hadnt bothered telling them about it skarnu hoped the constables werent cooperating so enthusiastically as they seemed to be anyhow after looking this way and that he said now we split up aye i was going to tell you the same thing pavilosta the other valmieran answered youve got a pretty good notion of what youre doing looks like powers above keep you safe and you skarnu said the tough hadnt waited for his reply but was already strolling down the alley as if he didnt have a care in the world skarnu strolled up it trying to act similarly nonchalant he felt easier when he ducked into another alleyway that ran into the one behind the tavern that second alley led him to a third and the third to a fourth tytuvenai seemed to have a web of little lanes going nowhere in particular by the time skarnu emerged onto a real street he was several blocks away from the drunken dragon he hoped more of the men who kept on resisting the algarvians had got out after the tough and him you there the call was sharp and peremptory skarnu turned a constable was pointing at him aye you bumpkin what are you doing here if he was trying to panic skarnu he failed for all the world as if he were nothing but a bumpkin the marquis jingled coins in his pocket sold some eggs he answered now im heading home well go on then the constable growled he might not have caught hold of foes of the algarvians but he had exercised his petty authority that was enough to satisfy him skarnu hurried out of tytuvenai he breathed easier once he was out in the countryside most people on the roads outside the towns looked like farmerswhich made sense because most of them were farmers he wondered how the algarvians had got word of the meeting their enemies were having someone betrayed us the thought was inescapable and everyone whod sat around that table now knew what he looked like and near which village he lived if the algarvians caught his comrades and squeezed them would they send a company of soldiersor a couple of officers and a company of valmieran constableslooking for him on the farms round pavilosta in their boots he would have that worried him more than anything come on sergeant pesaro boomed to the squad of algarvian constables he led west from gromheort keep moving you can do it bembo lifted off his hat and wiped sweat from his forehead with his other sleeve fat old bugger he grumbled why doesnt he have an apoplexy and fall over dead hes not even as fat as he used to be oraste said i know bembo didnt like that either and wasnt shy about saying why its all this fornicating marching were doing powers above even im starting to get skinny not so youd notice youre not oraste answered which made bembo send him a wounded look and tramp along for some little while in silence sergeant pesaro wasnt shy about filling silences keep it moving he repeated wont be much longer before we get to that stinking oyngestun place oh aye and wont they be glad to see us when we get there bembo said weve already taken one lot of kaunians out of the lousy dump whatll they do now that were coming back for more forthwegiansll cheer just like i would oraste said as far as the blonds go well who cares no one cared what happened to the kaunians in forthwegexcept those kaunians themselves and there werent enough of them to matter that was why dreadful things kept happening to them if the kaunian kingdoms were winning the war what would they be doing to algarvians bembo wondered nothing goodhe was sure of that another thought crossed his mind if the unkerlanters do win the war what will they do to algarvians he didnt care to imagine that he was ever so glad to be marching through eastern forthweg rather than through unkerlant even if king mezentios men were moving forward again there the forthwegians might not love algarvian constables but some of the rumors that came drifting out of unkerlant made the hair on the back of his neck try to prickle up here we are pesaro said lifting him out of his unhappy reverie beautiful oyngestun the garden spot of all forthweg huh oraste said looking at the small decrepit village with his usual scorn if forthweg needed a good purging this is where theyd plug in the hose bembo thought about that then snorted as long as oraste was making jokes about villages and not about him he thought his squadmate was a pretty funny fellow oyngestuns two or three algarvian constables were waiting for the squad from gromheort so were a couple of dozen kaunians all standing glum and dejected in the village square powers above you lazy buggers pesaro shouted to the local constables wheres the rest of em we havent got enough men to do a proper roundup one of the men posted to oyngestun answered miserable blonds start sliding away whenever our backs are turned you should have blazed a couple that would have given the rest the idea pesaro threw his hands in the air as if to say what can you do all right all right well take care of it he turned to his squad come on boys itll be a little more work than we figured but well live through it remember we want to make a clean sweepno more kaunians left in oyngestun were going to take em all back to gromheort with us a young constable named almonio asked permission to fall out sergeant he didnt have the stomach to seize kaunians and put them on leyline caravans to certain death to bembos surprise pesaro had let him get away with hanging back but the sergeant shook his head this time only place theyre going is gromheort kid you can cursed well help us get em there you know whatll happen to them afterwards though same as i do almonio protested no pesaro shook his head again the wattle under his chin a flap of skin that had been filled with fat when he was heavier flopped back and forth the same thingd happen to them if they stayed here were just moving em so we can keep track of em easier and youll help or ill report you have you got that aye almonio answered miserably youd better pesaro raised his voice to a paradeground roar kaunians come forth come forth or it will be worse for you he spoke only algarvian a constable named evodio who remembered the classical kaunian that had been beaten into him in school translated pesaros bellows into the language the blonds were more likely to understand but regardless of the language in which they were hailed no kaunians came forth as bembo had said they remembered what had happened the last time the algarvian constables from gromheort visited oyngestun if thats the game they want to play by the powers above well play it pesaro said by pairs men go through the houses and bring them out as he and oraste got started bembo said we went down this street the last time we were here did we oraste shrugged why bother remembering he pounded on a door and shouted kaunians come forth to bembos surprise the door opened the elderly kaunian who stood in the entry hall spoke slow clear algarvian i am here what do you want come with us grandpa bembo said and jerked a thumb back toward the village square all you blonds are going back to gromheort weve seen this old buzzard before oraste said so we have by the powers above bembo said nodding hes the one with the cute granddaughter right he didnt wait for his partner to agree but turned back to the kaunian come on grandpa where is she vanai is not here the old man answered she has not been here since the early winter she ran off with a forthwegian lout i do not know where they went a likely story oraste said with a sneer bembo was inclined to believe the kaunian the fellow would have had trouble sounding so indignant were he lying but you never could tell were going to have to search your place he said go ahead you will not find her the kaunian said and then if i am to be taken to gromheort what may i bring with me youre not going to be taken palyoure going to walk oraste answered you can take whatever you can carry but if you dont keep up youre going to get whats coming to you and thats for sure he looked as if he would enjoy giving the old man what he thought was coming to him i will keep up the kaunian said he stood aside come search try not to steal too much he shook his head what difference does it make i have spent my whole life here but i doubt i shall ever see this place again my empire of knowledge has fallen just as the great empire did in times gone by whats he talking about oraste asked why do you think i know bembo replied in some annoyance he pointed at the old man pack what youre going to take and be quick about it then go to the square come on oraste lets make sure that gal isnt hiding here oh aye a murky light sparked in orastes eyes if we catch her i know how to make her pay when they went inside bembo stared in astonishment he turned to the kaunian what in blazes do you do with all these books hed never seen so many in one place in his life read them study them cherish them the blond answered i have spent my life seeking understanding and what has it got me one sack to carry on the road to gromheort he bowed stiffly i suppose i should thank you for paring existence down to essentials whats he talking about oraste repeated he sounded more irritable this time more ready to strike out at what he didnt understand it doesnt matter bembo told him come on lets look for the girl we cant waste time about it weve got plenty of other kaunians to shift he and oraste tore through the house with practiced efficiency they found no one lurking in pantries or behind or under furniture or anywhere else maybe the old bugger was telling the truth oraste said who would have believed it stranger things have happened bembo answered did you get anything good when we split up there this and that the other constable said dont know what all of its worth but some of its cursed old thats for sure how about you about the same bembo told him somebody ought to do something about these books theyre probably worth a good bit to somebody but not to anybody i know most of em are kaunian garbage anyway oraste said you ask me the mice and the silverfish are welcome to em come on bembo like you said hes not the only stinking blond weve got to fetch they did their job well enough to keep sergeant pesaro from screaming too loudly at them by early afternoon all the kaunians the constables could flush out were standing in the square with evodio translating pesaro said now we go back to gromheort have you got that anybody who doesnt keep up will be sorry to the end of his daysand that wont be a long way off lets go curse you you poxridden redheaded barbarian a blond shouted in pretty good algarvian why should we do what you oraste pulled his stick off his belt and blazed the kaunian with deliberate malice in the belly the man fell shrieking and writhing a womanprobably his wifescreamed over their cries oraste shouted anybody else want to get gay with us well give you what he got evodio turned that into classical kaunian though bembo didnt think it needed any translating pesaro said get moving evodio translated that too all the kaunians started east except the blazed man even his wife her face stunned and empty trudged out of oyngestun some of the forthwegians who lived in the village jeered as the blonds left some waved mocking goodbyes some had already started going through the houses of the people whod lived side by side with them for so many years bembo said curse them they have a better chance to clean out the kaunians than we got he sighed being a constables a tough job selfpity came easy to him oraste raised a gingery eyebrow you want to go fight the unkerlanters instead powers above no the mere thought was enough to make bembo turn and curse the kaunians shambling along the road the old kaunian scholar spoke in his own language several of his countrymen smiled seeing that bembo did not follow he shifted to algarvian it is a proverb from the days of the kaunian empire and still true today i think speech is a mirror of the soul as a man speaks so is he bembo yanked his bludgeon off his belt and belabored the old man till blood streamed down his face from a split scalp quote proverbs at me will you he shouted ill teach you one keep your lousy mouth shut have you got it have you he raised the bludgeon again aye the kaunian choked out bembo strutted along feeling better about the world oraste slapped him on the back which made him happier yet garivald woke with the sun in his face when he looked around he saw other mensome wrapped in rockgray unkerlanter army blankets some in captured algarvian tan ones some in peasant homespunlying on pine boughs among the trees he shook his head in slow wonder as he did almost every morning when he woke he wasnt a peasant any more or not an ordinary peasant he was an irregular fighting king mezentios men far behind their lines he wriggled out of his own blanketthe redhead whod carried it into southern unkerlant wouldnt need it not ever againsat up and stretched then he put on his sandals and got to his feet his belly rumbled not far away a stewpot was bubbling above a slow fire he hurried over whats in there he asked the fellow stirring the pot with a big iron spoon barley mush and a little bit of blood sausage the cook answered like garivald like most unkerlanters he was stocky and swarthy with dark hair and a strong hooked nose but his accent said he came out of the north not from the duchy of grelz want a bowl hmm garivald rubbed his chin as if thinking it over bristles rasped under his fingers chances to shave here in the woods seldom came his belly rumbled again he quit being coy aye here you go then the fellow tending the pot grabbed a cheap earthenware bowl and filled it full of mush mind you wash it before you give it back ill remember garivald said he would have to work to remember and knew it back in zossen his home village his wife annore would have cleaned up after him washing things was womens work not mens sudden tears stung his eyes to make sure the cook didnt see them he bent his head over the bowl and began to eat how he missed his wife how he missed his son and daughter too and howoh howhe missed the village where hed spent all thirtytwo he thought it was thirtytwo but he might have been out one either way years of his life another unkerlanter irregular came up to the cook and got a breakfast bowl of barley after taking it he nodded to garivald and said how about a song pal by his soft speech he was a local like garivald by now youve heard me sing havent you garivald asked and the other fellow nodded in some exasperation garivald went on then why would you want to hear me again im better at making the words than i am at singing them he sometimes wished hed never discovered he had to power to shape words into pleasing patterns he would still be back with his family then back in zossen and back under algarves thumb now he was a free manfree but alone he knew how lucky he was not to be a dead man some of the songs he made had been for the irregulars in the woods around zossen but the algarvians had found out who shaped the tunes that helped rouse the countryside against them theyd seized him and taken him off to herborn the capital of the duchy of grelz now the reborn puppet kingdom of grelz with mezentios cousin on the throne to do away with him if munderics irregulars hadnt ambushed the redheads and rescued him hed long since have been boiled alive the other irregular paused between spoonfuls of barley porridge to say youre not that bad and if youve got something new id get to hear it first nothing new this morning garivald said and went back to finishing his own breakfast he knew he probably wouldnt have been rescued if it werent for his songs and he did spend time letting people hear his unspectacular voice but nobody in his experience felt like singing early in the morning to his relief the other fellow didnt press him but went back to try to wheedle a second bowl of mush from the cook he had no more luck there than hed had with garivald and slouched off cursing his fate garivald rose and hurried away which didnt prove the best idea hed ever had he almost bowled over munderic the leader of this band sorry he stammered and stepped out of the way its all right munderic was burly even by unkerlanter standards hed done a better job of shaving than most of the men who followed him that should have made him look more pleasant somehow it didnt he went on i was looking for you as a matter of fact were you garivald asked in what he hoped wasnt too hollow a voice he wasnt sure he wanted to draw the leaders notice want it or not he had it munderic nodded briskly aye high time you were blooded songs are all very well but you ought to be able to fight too the algarvians are moving a couple of squads between lohr and pirmasens were going to make sure they dont have a happy time on the road back in zossen fifty or sixty miles away garivald had heard of lohr and pirmasens but he couldnt have told where they lay he still couldnt not exactly he was too new to what seemed to him a vastly distant part of the world give me a stick and ill do what i can he said munderic slapped him on the back i know you will his grin showed a couple of broken teeth itll make your songs better too because youll know more of what youre singing about i suppose so garivald answered he nodded to munderic as he might have to a schoolmasternot that hed ever had any schooling himself how do you know the algarvians will be moving i have ears in lohr and i have ears in pirmasens the leader of the irregulars answered he had ears in half a dozen villages around this stretch of wood garivald already knew as much munderic continued if i hear the same thing in both places its likely true or its an algarvian trick to draw you out garivald said munderic pondered that youve got a nasty suspicious mind he said at last i wont tell you youre wrong because the redheads could be doing that but i dont think they are this time i hope youre right garivald told him im betting my life on it munderic said for ill be along you know i dont send people out to do what i wont now garivald was the one who had to ponder and nod at munderics order the irregulars gave him a stick captured from some algarvian it bore a small enamelwork shield of green white and red and was a bit shorter a bit lighter than the unkerlanter military model hefting it garivald said feels more like a stick for blazing rabbits than one for people the man who gave it to him wore a filthy tattered rockgray tunic that had probably been on his back since the algarvians advance the summer before overran this part of unkerlant and left him a soldier stranded in enemyheld territory dont be a bigger fool than you can help he said and pulled up his left sleeve to show the long straight scar left behind after a beam burned a chunk of meat from his arm a stick just like that did this he laid his right finger on the scar it can happen to you tooor it can happen to an algarvian try and see that it does youll be happier afterwards believe me aye youre bound to be right about that garivald remembered the captured irregulars the algarvians had hanged in zossen who had they been just a couple of men nobodyd ever heard of if they caught him and hanged him in pirmasens or lohr who would he be there no one at all just a stranger without any luck he didnt want to end his days like that or on the wrong end of a stick either munderic led his raiders out of their woodland shelter in the dark quiet hours between midnight and dawn garivald yawned and yawned trying to make himself wake up this is our time munderic said the algarvians think they can do as they please during the day but the night belongs to us despite that proud boast the irregular leader and the rest of the band moved like hunted animals when they emerged from the forest and came out into the open country bordering it once a dragon screeched high overhead they stopped moving altogether freezing as rabbits will when an owl hoots at last munderic said come on its gone garivald looked up into the sky he didnt see the dragon but he hadnt seen it before either he wondered howor ifmunderic knew it had flown on even at night he could see good farmland was going to waste around these parts rank weeds overran fields that hadnt been planted in barley or rye grass grew tall in meadows where cattle and sheep hadnt grazed sadly garivald shook his head so many things would be a long time going back to the way they had been if in fact they ever did where the road ran through one of those ungrazed meadows munderic halted and held up a hand we wait here he said well dig ourselves in along both sides of the track and when the redheads come by well make them pay be sure they cant spy any spoil from your digging mind its not an ambush if they know its there garivald had nothing with which to dig he stood there feeling useless and helpless till another unkerlanter let him borrow a shorthandled spade a soldiers tool not a farmers one with which a man could dig while on his knees or even on his belly heap up some of the dirt in front of your hole advised the fellow whose spade he was using itll help block a beam aye garivald said thanks by the time he finished the eastern sky had gone from gray to pink starlings started their metallic twittering in the gray morning twilight munderic strode along the road to see what an algarvian footsoldier would spy he had a couple of men pull up grass and weeds to hide their holes better he didnt criticize garivald which made the peasant proud at last munderic pronounced himself satisfied now we wait he said the sun rose garivald peered through the plants ahead out toward the road it was empty it stayed empty a long time bugs and spiders crawled on him as the day turned warm flies started biting he slapped and cursed and wished he were home sweat poured off him as munderic had ordered he waited a couple of unkerlanters came by on foot and one riding a sad little donkey the irregulars let them go the sun was well past its high point in the north when the algarvians marched up the road from the direction of lohr they were singing as they marched a rollicking tune in their own language as usual they seemed convinced they owned the world garivald knew his job was to teach them otherwise munderic had threatened death and destruction for any man who started blazing too soon and so warned the redheads of the trap before they were all the way into it garivald let three or four of them past him before he started blazing everyone else seemed to have the same idea so half the algarvians went down in the space of a few heartbeats but the rest proved tougher shouting and cursing they dove for cover behind the bodies of their fallen friends and into the tall grass of the meadow with the irregulars on both sides of the road though finding a safe spot wasnt easy they kept blazing till they were blazed downa beam from one of their sticks passed close above garivalds head singeing the weeds and leaving the scent of lightning in the air one algarvian started running back toward lohr not out of cowardice garivald judged but to try to get help the fellow hadnt gone far when a beam caught him in the middle of the back and stretched him facedown in the dirt of the roadway gather up their sticks munderic called cut the throats of any of em still breathing then wed better get out of here all safe the irregular whod asked garivald for a song didnt come out of his hole somebody went to check and found hed taken a beam just above the ear he was as dead as the algarvians munderic stamped his foot curse it i wanted a clean job almost but not quite we did what we set out to garivald said and the redheads arent about to he started off toward the forest with two sticks on his back and two lines for a new song going through his mind sabrinos dragon raced east through the crisp cold air of the austral continent the algarvian commander could look left and see the waves of the narrow sea crashing against the rocky shore of the land of the ice people he could look to the right and see the dazzling glitter of the barrier mountains still sheathed in snow and ice even though spring was rounding toward summer he wondered what lay beyond the barrier mountains the ice people traveled beyond them at this season of the year so had a few intrepid explorers from civilized kingdoms hed read some of their accounts they differed so wildly he wondered if the explorers had all gone to the same country tempting to think about turning his dragon to the south and flying and flying and flying but theres a war to be fought he muttered and looked ahead once more the lagoan army was still retreating though not much pursued it a few battalions of yaninans stiffened by even fewer algarvian footsoldiers and a couple of companies of behemoths but the lagoans did not have the dragons to be able to stand against the force he led that the lagoans had any dragons at all had come as a nasty surprise the first time his fliers ran up against them but the enemy outnumbered four to one by his wing and colonel broumidis beasts could scout and warn their ground forces when danger was on the way but could not block that danger a beam from a heavy stick down on the ground blazed up at the algarvian dragons even had it struck one it would have done no more than infuriate the beast but it was a warning come no lower sabrino nodded to himself the lagoans were playing their half of the game as well as it could be played he leaned to one side and peered down past his dragons scaly neck as hed expected king vitors men were digging in like so many moles he nodded again aye the lagoans had plenty of professional competence without enough dragons though how much good would it do them drop your eggs lads he spoke into the crystal he carried with him for good measure he waved the hand signal that meant the same thing his own dragon carried eggs too he slashed the cords that held them to the huge badtempered beast down they fell along with the eggs from the dragonfliers he led he watched them tumble toward the ground the moment they were gone his dragon flew more strongly more swiftly he would have walked faster after shedding a heavy pack too balls of fire sprang up as the eggs releasing the sorcerous energy stored in them burst on the lagoans that ought to hit them a good solid lick captain orosio said aye sabrino nodded but we wont destroy them the most we can do is make their lives miserable weve done pretty well at that id say so we have orosio rolled his eyes but if we have to rely on the yaninans to hunt them down and kill them were going to be in for a long wait if the yaninans could have done it we wouldnt need to be here dont i know it sabrino answered a little nervously he glanced down at the crystal he used a slightly different spell to talk with broumidis who wouldnt be able to hear this he wanted to be very sure broumidis couldnt hear this were going to have to bring in more of our own footsoldiers and behemothsmore dragons tooif were going to drive the lagoans off the austral continent once for all the yaninans just arent up to the job oh i know that sir orosio was a longtime veteran toonot one with so much service as sabrino whod fought as a footsoldier in the six years war a long generation before but with plenty to give him a healthy cynicism about the way the world worked most of them would sooner be back home raising cabbages theyve got no stomach for a real fight some of their officers are good but a lot of them have their places on account of whom they know too thats too true sabrino said noble blood is all very well but youd better know what youre doing to boot if you dont youll get yourself killed and a lot of the men youre supposed to lead too not if the men know youre useless and run away instead of fighting orosio said sabrino grimaced the yaninans had done that more often than he cared to remember his squadron commander went on every algarvian and every dragon we use to prop up king tsavellas men is one we cant use against king swemmel i know ive said as much ive made myself unpopular saying as much sabrino was old enough that he didnt care too much about making himself unpopular so long as his wife put up with him and his mistress remained compliant he wouldnt worry about the rest of the world he guided his dragon down a little lower trying to assess how much harm this latest assault had done the lagoans with dust still rising from where eggs had burst that was hard to do and the enemy hed found was cursed clever at making things on the ground seem worse than they were in the hope of luring algarvian dragons to destruction though tempted to loiter in the air till all the dust cleared sabrino decided that wouldnt be a good idea he spoke into the crystal again this time to all his squadron leaders lets go back to the dragon farm so the groundcrew men can give us some more eggs with the sun shining almost all the time the more we can pound the lagoans the better a moment later he passed that on to colonel broumidis too aye colonel the enthusiastic cry came not from broumidis but from captain domiziano senior to orosio in time spent commanding a squadron he came from a family with better bloodlines and better connectionsbut far junior in overall experience domiziano never failed to remind sabrino of a happy puppy always ready to rush ahead the wing commander knew that was an insult to a brave and talented officer but couldnt drive the thought from his mind as the algarvian dragons began flying off toward the west several lagoan heavy sticks that had stayed quiet up till then blazed at them sabrino waggled a finger down at the ground i thought you might have some surprises waiting he said as if the lagoans far below could hear you wont see us coming down to peek at you as trustingly as we did when this round of fighting started seeing that they were doing the algarvians no harm the lagoan sticks soon fell silent again sabrino nodded in reluctant approval aye king vitors men knew what they were doing all right no point to wasting charges they might really need in some later fight he led the wing of algarvian dragons and their yaninan hangerson toward the positions tsavellas and mezentios footsoldiers and behemoths were holding as they neared them broumidis face with its black hairy caterpillar of a mustache appeared in sabrinos crystal if you look to the left of my dragons my lord count you will see some of the lagoan beasts coming east the yaninan officer said is it your pleasure that we assail them sabrino turned his head to the left sure enough he did see lagoan dragons over there a long way off you have good eyes he told broumidis he made a point of complimenting yaninans whenever he found even the vaguest occasion to do so after a little pause for thought he shook his head no well let them go theyre likely trying to entice us into an ambush look like easy meat and then lead us low over some sticks the lagoans have hidden away somewhere best thing we can do is tend to our business and drop some more eggs on their army if we hit it hard enough sooner or later theyll have to come up and fight us on our terms let it be as you wish of course broumidis was as always impeccably polite but i wanted to make sure you were aware of the possibility for which i thank you sabrino matched courtesy with courtesy and then after one more glance over toward the lagoans to make sure they werent trying to double back after his own wing he put them out of his mind that turned out to be a mistake the dragon farm wasnt very far behind the line to which the yaninan and algarvian ground forces had advanced peering west sabrino spied a ragged column of smoke rising into the air he frowned nothing in the neighborhood had been burning when the wing set out when he got a little closer he exclaimed in horror a moment later broumidis face appeared in the crystal again my lord count he said i think we now know the true reason we saw the lagoan dragons may the powers below eat them flying back toward the east aye sabrino agreed dully he wished hed ordered his wing and the yaninan dragons after the lagoans if he had they might have enjoyed a measure of revenge but that wouldnt have brought the dragon farm back into being the lagoans must have loaded their handful of dragons with all the eggs they could carry then struck as hard a blow as they could at their enemies base curse them sabrino muttered the lagoans were clever tacticians since they couldnt hope to oppose the vastly superior algarvian and yaninan dragons in the air theyd hidden their own beasts as best they could till they could make life as miserable as possible on the ground for their foes theyd done a hideously good job as sabrino urged his dragon down in a long slow spiral he saw what a good job it was the lagoans had plastered the tents of the groundcrew men with eggs a few of the algarvians and yaninans who cared for the dragons had survived unharmed and waved to their countrymen as they approached but more were down wounded or dead corpses and pieces of corpses littered the cratered ground where the tents had stood and there were more craters than the eggs from a small force of dragons could have accounted for one of those craters still sending up nasty smoke was enormousit looked as if something had taken a great bite out of the ground sabrino needed a moment to get his bearing and realize the lagoans must have landed an egg right on the wagons that had carried the eggs his wing was using against the enemy till some more came forward from heshbon his dragonfliers wouldnt be dropping any more his dragon landed with a thump that made him lurch against his harness a groundcrew man shouted colonel my lord count and then could go no further but burst into tears lets see to the animals sabrino saidthe first words in the dragonfliers creed as in the cavalrymans but with so many groundcrew men dead seeing to the dragons was a far longer slower harder job than it would have been otherwise and the ice people brought only a bare handful of camels to the dragon farmnot enough to content the voracious beasts one of the hairy nomads spoke in yaninan to broumidis the beard that grew up almost to his eyes and the hairline that started just above his eyebrows masked his expression but sabrino could hear the scorn in his voice what does he say sabrino asked the yaninan dragonflier turned back to him he says he thought algarve was great he thought algarve would drive everything before it now he sees it is not so he sees that algarvians are just another pack of mangy men coming down here from across the ocean and nothing special at all he says that does he sabrino growled broumidis nodded did enjoyment for his powerful allies discomfiture spark for a moment in his black eyes if it did sabrino hardly supposed he could blame him the algarvian colonel and count said tell him we have hardly begun to show what we can do but even he could not denynot to himself at any rate whatever he admitted to the man of the ice peoplethat the work ahead had just grown harder two the shiver that ran through cornelu had nothing to do with the chilly sea in which his leviathan swam a rubber suit and sorcery shielded him against that nor was it evenor not entirely at any ratea thrill at returning to sibian water to his home waters no this was a fighting mans excitement the excitement any warrior worth his salt felt at being one small part of a large attack on a hated foe dragons flew overhead dragons painted in lagoan red and gold leyline cruisers showing lagoas jack made for sibian waters so did a large force of lagoan leviathans of which cornelus mount was but one the exile shook his fist at the islands looming up out of the sea not at his countrymen whod lived on them for upwards of a thousand years but at the accursed algarvians who occupied them now you will pay he shouted in his own languagewhich an algarvian might well have understood since the invaders tongue and that of the locals were not just cousins but brothers how you will pay as if to imitate his gesture the leviathan slapped the water with its flukes he patted the beast wondering how much if anything it really understood leviathan riders often talked about that when they sat around and drank wine cornelu looked up to the sky again dragonfliers never talked about how much their animals understood they knew perfectly well the brutes understood nothing more dragons were in the air now the newcomers flying off the sibian islands the algarvians wouldnt leave this challenge unanswered such had never been their way if they couldnt hit first they would hit back and hit harder and their ships the ones that werent already on patrol near sibiu would be sallying from their harbors cornelu patted the leviathan again hed already sunk an algarvian cruiser another one would be very fine he chuckled and said but a floating fortress would be even better some of the algarvian dragons eggs slung beneath them were diving on lagoan ships one only a mile or so from cornelu beams from the heavy sticks the ships carried reached up for them a dragon one wing burned off plunged spinning into the sea its eggs burst then sending up an enormous white plume of water but the dragons drove swiftly and the sailors at the sticks could not blaze them all before they released their eggs bursts of sorcerous energy flung men into the ocean the ship lurched and settled down deeper onto the sea from its track along the ley line an egg must have slain the mages who tapped the energy channeled along the worlds grid survivors ran here and there what would they what could they do aboard a vessel suddenly at the mercy of wind and waves cornelu didnt know and had no time to find out a couple of dragons painted in strange patterns of green and red and white were circling overhead they didnt know whose side he was on eggs tumbled down from one of them whose flier had evidently decided he wouldnt take chances with a slap cornelu urged his leviathan into a dive and then perhaps twenty feet below the surface of the sea into a sprint away from the neighborhood where it had been the eggs burst there the sea transmitted sound very wellbetter than air in fact cornelus head rang with the bursts so did the leviathans it swam harder than ever fleeing those fearful sounds when it surfaced cornelu scanned the sky again afraid the algarvian dragons might still be after him but they werentlagoan dragons had driven them off lagoans are good for something after all cornelu admitted his leviathan wiggledindignantlybeneath him he hadnt meant that personally had the leviathan taken umbrage at his mockery of its kingdom maybe it understood more sibian than hed thought and maybe he was being silly another wing of dragons dropped eggs on the harbor ahead lehliu the smaller southern port on sigisoara the island east of tirgoviste dragons were probably dropping eggs on tirgoviste town too cornelu wished he were there to see that he wished he were there to see them drop eggs on his house and on his faithless wife in itprovided his daughter were somewhere else brindza hadnt done anything to him even if costache had as soon as the lagoan dragons let their eggs fall they flew off toward the east toward the great island from which theyd set out theyd had to do a lot of flying to reach sibiu and few were up to the challenge of fighting fresher algarvian beasts once they were gone the lagoan ships grew more vulnerable to attack from the air but the ships didnt pull back indeed they pressed forward with astonishing boldness some of them drew close enough to the shore to start tossing eggs into the harbor king mezentios men had mounted eggtossers of their own at the edge of the shoreor perhaps theyd simply taken over the ones sibiu had emplaced cornelu wasnt familiar enough with the defenses of lehliu to say for certain one way or the other he was certain the algarvians defended the port as aggressively as they did everything else eggs burst all around the attacking lagoan warships and hit several of them and here came the first algarvian ships out of the harbor little patrol craft long on speed short on weapons a lagoan egg hit one of themhit it and crippled it all in the same instant but others dodged past and started blazing at the lagoans no mezentios men werent afraid to mix it up come on my beauty cornelu told his leviathan he would have spoken to eforiel just the same way he thought of his old leviathan as he would have thought of a dead wife hed loved hed loved his real wife too but she was still alive and he loved her no more the patrol vessels were faster than the leviathan of course but the leyline cruiser hed sunk had been faster too all he needed to do was come alongside and stay alongside for less than a minute after that the patrol craft could glide away it wouldnt keep gliding long but then his leviathan gave a startled twitch and began to turn aside from the path on which hed set it that had nothing to do with mackerel or squid and he knew it the great beast had sensed another of its kind close by and was speeding to the attack in a clash between leviathans cornelu was unlikely to be anything but a spectator he did jettison the eggs the beast had brought from lagoas he regretted that but did it without hesitation speed and maneuverability counted for more than anything else in this kind of fight he wished he could have had more time to work with the leviathan sibian training enhanced the instincts inborn in the beasts and gave them an edge over their counterparts from lagoas and algarve but he hadnt had the chance and would have to rely on the leviathans speed and ferocity somehownot even the finest mages knew howleviathans and their dumpy cousins the whales could unerringly find their way through the sea the first cornelu knew of the beast his mount had sensed was when it twisted away to keep his leviathans fanged jaw from tearing a great hole in its flank he got a brief glimpse of an algarvian clinging to the other leviathans back as he was clinging to his that other leviathan tried to bite his beast too it also missed though cornelu saw its teeth glitter he pulled his knife from its sheath he couldnt do much against the algarvian leviathan but he might be able to harm the rider if the fight came to the surface his own mount writhed in the water almost as lithe and limber as a serpent it butted the algarvian beast with its closed beak the enemy leviathan writhed in pain cornelu understood why a leviathan could stave in the side of a goodsized wooden vessel with a blow like that and with the other beast hurt cornelus leviathan bit at it again this time the algarvians mount could not escape blood gushed forth and darkened the water all thought of fight forgotten the other leviathan fled cornelus pursued and bit another chunk out of its flank and one from a tail fluke either of those bitesto say nothing of the first onewould have been plenty to devour half a man or maybe all of a man cornelu wouldnt have wanted to be the algarvian aboard that wounded leviathan the fellow would have a cursed hard time getting the animal to pay attention to him rather than to its own torment and the blood pouring from it would surely draw sharks normally a shark wouldnt dare come near a leviathan but normal rules didnt hold with blood in the water and the rider would be in at least as much danger as his mount how was the rest of the fight the bigger fight going cornelu needed a while to find out victory had made his leviathan nearly as hard to control as defeat had the algarvians eforiel would have behaved better the sibian naval officer was as sure of that as he was of his own name but eforiel was dead gone he had to do the best he could with this less responsive beast at last he got the leviathan to rear up in the water lifting him so he could see farther few lagoan dragons were still in the air most had indeed flown back toward the dragon farms from which theyd set out but the algarvian dragons flying close to the conquered islands kept on attacking the lagoan warships that had come to raid sibiu a couple of more lagoan ships had already lost leyline power and drifted helplessly in the water before long either dragons or leviathans would sink them the algarvians were getting more and more ships out of lehliu harbor too they had fewer in the fight than the lagoans but plenty to be dangerous especially with so many dragons overhead cornelu had heard the lagoans were building ships that could carry dragons and from which the big scaly beasts could fight that struck him as a good idea though he didnt know whether it was true if it was none of those ships had come to sibiu he scowled more and more this was looking like a losing fight the thought had hardly crossed his mind before a couple of lagoan ships hoisted the red pennant that meant retreat every lagoan vessel in the flotilla turned away from sigisoara curse you for cowards cornelu cried sibiu wasnt the lagoans kingdom why should they fight hard for it and he had no choice but to turn away from his own native islands either his salt tears mingled with the salt sea he wondered why the life hed had back in tirgoviste had taken more wounds than the algarvian leviathan even if the war ended on the instant he had nothing to come home to but still he grieved it is my kingdom curse them he said as much to hear the sounds of his own languagedifferent from both algarvian and lagoanas for any other reason when he brought his leviathan back into setubal he found the lagoan sailors whod returned before him celebrating as if theyd won a great victory he wanted to kill them all instead he found a bottle of plum brandy that wasnt doing anyone any good took it back to the barracks set aside for sibian exiles and drank himself into a stupor ham fernao said reverently beefsteak mutton endive onions longing filled his sigh dont affonsos voice was piteous youre breaking my heart the other lagoan mage did look as if he were about to weep im breaking my belly fernao sat on a flat rock the firstrank mage stared in distasteaye thats the right word he thoughtat the charred chunk of camel meat and the half a roasted partridge on his tin plate the camel would be fatty and gamy the ptarmigan would taste as if fernao were eating pine needles which were the birds favorite food and imparted their flavor to its flesh other lagoans scattered over the bleak landscape of the austral continent looked bleak themselves affonso had on his plate a supper every bit as unappetizing as fernaos he said the worst part of it is it could be worse we might not have anything to eat at all i know fernao used his belt knife to cut a chunk off the camel meat he impaled it and brought it to his mouth those few days when we had no supplies coming in were very bad lucky this new clan of ice people likes us better than the last one did he chewed grimaced swallowed or maybe its just that this clan hates the yaninans more than the other one did probably affonso said the secondrank mage glanced warily up toward the sky what i hate are algarvian dragons overhead at every hour of the day and night aye even if they havent been quite so much trouble since we smashed up their farm fernao said until we have more of our own though theyre going to keep on pounding us from the air where are we going to get them affonso asked if i could conjure them up i would fernao answered but i cant in this miserable country who knows what any of my fancy magic would be worth you could talk to a shaman of the ice people affonso laughed to show he was joking even if he was he left fernao unamused i could do all sorts of things that would waste my time but i wont he snapped then he scratched at his coppery beard which was at least as scraggly as affonsos all right the other mage placatingly spread his hands all right fernao took a resinoustasting bite of ptarmigan he thought of doeg the caravanmaster whose fetish bird was the ptarmigan fernao had eaten one as soon as hed escaped doegs clutches to show what he thought of traveling with the man of the ice people every time he ate another one he took more revenge he threw the bones down by the rock ants swarmed over them like everything else in the austral continent they tried to cram a years worth of life into the scant time spring and summer gave them leaning back on the rock fernao looked up into the heavens again the sun was below the northern horizon but not very far below the sky there glowed white and bright only a few of the brightest stars shone through the deeper twilight near the zenith fernao narrowed his eyes they were already narrow for he had a little kuusaman blood in him to try to see more he was sure he could have read a news sheet if only hed had a news sheet to read and then the dreaded shout went up dragons cursing fernao ran for the nearest hole dug between rocks he and affonso jumped into it at essentially the same instant he peered west he hadnt expected the algarvians to come back to torment his countrymen so soon he saw no dragons not to the west turning his head he spied them coming out of the northeast he frowned what point to attacking from a different direction it wasnt as if they needed to surprise the lagoans lieutenant general junqueiro couldnt do much about them except hunker down only when the cheering began among men who paid more attention to dragons than he was in the habit of doing did he realize they werent algarvian dragons some were painted in lagoas bright red and gold others in the sky blue and sea green of kuusamo which made them hard to see fernao started cheering too down came the dragons one after another lagoan soldiers rushed toward them cheering still they werent experienced groundcrew men but at the dragonfliers shouted orders they started putting together a makeshift dragon farm along with affonso fernao also ran toward the dragons keep some beasts in the air he shouted powers above the algarvians might come back any time a lagoan dragonflier pointed up to the deep blue sky craning his neck fernao saw several of the great creatures wheeling overhead he bowed to the dragonflier who grinned as if to say he forgave him affonso asked how did you get here or should i say how did you get here without the algarvians attacking you the lagoan dragonfliers grin got wider yet we kept em too busy to notice us he answered we laid on a big attack against sibiu while mezentios men there were busy fighting it our dragon transports sneaked down south past the sibs islands and made it here nicely done fernao said bowing again what else have you brought along any real food after camel meat and ptarmigan that was a matter of sudden urgent concern but the dragonflier shook his head just us the dragons and some eggs no room for anything else a kuusaman came up the lagoan grinned again well we brought some friends along too i see fernao nodded to the short swarthy kuusaman do you speak lagoan little bit the fellow replied he shifted languages but i am more at home in classical kaunian ah excellent fernao said in the same tongue most of our officers will be able to talk with you some of them will speak kuusaman too of course i wish i knew more of it you wear the badge of a mage is it not so the kuusaman asked fernao nodded the kuusaman held out his hand saying i am pleased to make your acquaintance sorcerous sir this war will be won with magic as well as with footsoldiers and dragons and behemoths i am called tauvo clasping the proffered hand fernao gave his own name and added my colleague here is affonso i am pleased to know you both tauvo said after shaking hands with affonso too lagoan mages have made a good name for themselves so have those from the land of the seven princes fernao said tauvo smiled his teeth very white against his yellowbrown skin fernaos praise hadnt been altogether disinterested he went on kuusaman mages have done some very interesting work in theoretical sorcery lately it was work about which he knew less than he wanted and work about which hed tried without success to find out more maybe this tauvo knew a little something if he did he didnt let on his voice was bland as he answered i am sure you honor us beyond our worth if you ask me about dragons i can speak with something approaching authority he looked around seeming to take in the grim almost empty landscape for the first time what do dragons eat in this part of the world camel meat mostly fernao answered that is what we eat too for the most part unless you prefer ptarmigan people called kuusamans impassive no matter what people called kuusamans tauvo looked revolted i prefer neither his dark narrow eyes went from fernao to affonso do i guess that i may not have a choice well you could eat gnats and mosquitoes instead affonso said but they are more likely to eat you right on cue fernao slapped at something crawling on the back of his neck tauvo slapped at something too there do seem to be a good many bugs here he admitted they put me in mind of pori not far from the family home back in kuusamo you should have seen them a month ago fernao said they were three times as bad then tauvo nodded politely but fernao wasnt deceived the dragonflier didnt believe him he wouldnt have believed anyone who said such things either not without going through it someone came running from the tent where junqueiros crystallomancers worked dragons he shouted scouts to the west say algarvian dragons are coming tauvo forgot fernao and affonso he ran back to his dragon shouting in his bad lagoan at the soldiers whod just helped him chain it to a spike driven into the ground so theyd help get the chain off all the dragonfliers were scrambling aboard their mounts they fought their way into the air one after another the algarvians came over the lagoan army before many of the newly arrived dragons had got very high king mezentios dragonfliers didnt seem to be expecting any interference the little force of dragons the lagoans had had before had stayed out of their way no longer the scouts from the new arrivals attacked the algarvians before king mezentios men knew they were there a couple of algarvian dragons tumbled out of the sky the cheers from the lagoans on the ground made fernaos ears ring but the surprise didnt last long the algarvians quickly rallied they dropped their eggstheyd been cursed quick about getting resupplied after the lagoan raidwithout bothering to aim some struck home among the lagoan soldiers on the ground anyhow others tore up the grass and low bushesmany of which would have been trees in a warmer part of the world all around the encampment without the eggs the algarvian dragons were swifter and more maneuverable their fliers had more experience in battle than the lagoans or the kuusamans before long some of the newcomers went down the others kept fighting though and the algarvian dragons did not linger but flew back off toward the west fernao turned to affonso whod again dived into the same muddy trench as he had pretty soon it wont just be the algarvians dropping eggs on us well be dropping eggs on them and the yaninans too his fellow mage laughed if we drop eggs on the yaninans theyll run away thats all they know how to do its all theyve shown anyhow fernao agreed but the algarvians whatever else you say about them stand and fight well just have to lick them then affonso said now we can do it and there are more of us down here than there are algarvians he laughed and shook his fist toward the west on to heshbon more of us than algarvians now aye fernao said but they can bring in reinforcements easier than we can not if we take heshbon before they do it affonso returned fernao thought his friend was unduly optimistic but said heres hoping we can bring it off if we have enough dragons maybe leudast counted himself lucky to be alive hed had that feeling any number of times when fighting the algarvians but rarely more so than now the summer before he knew hed been fortunate to escape from a couple of the pockets the redheads had formed on the plains of northern unkerlant but getting out of the pocket south of aspang hadnt taken just good fortune it had required something uncommonly like a miracle he chewed on a lump of black bread then turned to captain hawart and said sir were in trouble again i wish i could say you were wrong hawart answered around his own mouthful of bread both men sat on somewhat drier high ground in the middle of a swamp along with perhaps a hundred unkerlanter soldiersso far as leudast knew all the survivors from hawarts regiment mournfully the captain said if only wed known they were getting their own attack ready back there aye if only leudast echoed its nothing but luck any of us are left alive you ask me we didnt have enough of anything to stop them once they got gliding down the ley line as if to underscore his words a dragon screeched not too high overhead he looked up the dragon was painted in algarvian colors leudast stayed where he was bushes and scrubby trees helped hide the unkerlanters in the swamp from the dragonfliers prying eyes leudasts rockgray tunic now stained with grass and dirt was a good match for the mud and shrubs all around after another screech the dragon flew on heres hoping the whoreson didnt spy us leudast said captain hawart shrugged we cant stay here forever not unless we want to turn into irregulars we can eat frogs and roots and such for a long time sir leudast said the algarviansd have a cursed hard time digging us out i know that hawart answered but theres a bigger war going on than the one for this stretch of swamp and i want to be a part of it leudast wasnt so sure he wanted to be a part of it hed risked his neck too many times and come too close to getting killed sitting here in a place the redheads would have a hard time reaching suited him fine he would have liked it better with more food and a drier place to sleep but as hed said unkerlanter peasants could get by on very little saying as much would only get him into trouble and he knew it he tried an oblique approach a lot of the men are pretty frazzled right now i know that im pretty frazzled myself hawart replied but so is the kingdom if unkerlant folds up it wont matter that we got to sit here happy in the swamp for a whileand the fights already moving past it on both sides you can hear that aye leudast said every one of hawarts words was the truth and he knew it but he still didnt want to leave this shelter that had been so long in coming and so hard to find and then one of the sentries came trotting back from the eastern approaches to the high ground theres algarvians starting to probe the swamp sir he told hawart still think we can drive em back whenever we please alboin leudast asked the youngster scratched at his formidable nose its gotten harder sergeant he admitted but we arent licked yet he had a burn above one eyebrow a couple of fingers difference in the path of the beam that had scarred him and it would have cooked his brains inside his head only three real paths that lead here leudast said the redheadsll be a while finding em too theyll spend a couple of days floundering in the mud odds are and we can hold em off for a long time even if im wrong hawart laughed though he didnt sound very happy doing it the wars coming to us whether we like it or not he said me i dont like it very much he glanced up at alboin your orders are dont blaze unless youre discovered or unless they strike a path and come straight for us if they dont well pull back after dark and see if we can find the rest of our army alboin saluted and repeated the orders back then he headed east to pass them on to the other lookouts and to return to his own station watching his broad back leudast slowly nodded alboin was a veteran now all right hed seen the bad along with the good and he was still fighting and not too discouraged captain hawart and his men got about half of what leudast had predicted as much as anyone could expect when dealing with algarvians without snow on the ground the sun was going down in the southwest before king mezentios men realized the swamp was defended then they started a brisk little skirmish with the sentries they sent more and more soldiers forward to drive back the unkerlanters and also started lobbing eggs in the general direction of the strongpoint dont let em worry you lads hawart said as one of those eggs burst and threw mud and stinking water all over the landscape theyre tossing blind sit tight a bit and then well get out of here unlike the algarvians hawarts men knew the swamp well theyd found paths that led west as well as some that offered escape in other directions pity we havent got any eggs we could bury here to give the redheads a little surprise when they make it this far leudast said pity we cant bury the cursed algarvians here hawart answered but as long as they dont bury us well get another chance at them later the sentries came back up the paths to the main patch of higher ground one of them had an arm in a sling itll be a while before the algarvians get here he said he still had fight in him lets get moving hawart said and then casually leudast youll head up the rear guard leudast had been in the army since the days when the only fighting was the spasmodic war between unkerlant and gyongyos in the mountains of the far far west if anyone here could lead the rear guard he was the man if that meant he was all too likely to get killed well hed been all too likely to get killed quite a few times now if he stood and fought his comrades would have a better chance of getting away he shrugged and nodded aye sir hawart gave him a dozen men a couple of more than hed expected he positioned them so that they covered the places where the paths from the east opened up onto the high ground they waited while their countrymen slipped away to the west by the trilling algarvian shouts that came from the other direction they wouldnt have to wait very long sure enough here came a filthy angrylooking redhead he didnt seem to realize the path opened out onto a wider stretch of nearly dry ground he didnt get much of a chance to ponder it either leudast blazed him he crumpled his stick falling from his hands to the muddy ground a moment later another algarvian appeared at the end of a different track two beams cut him down but not cleanly he thrashed and writhed and shrieked warning mezentios men behind him that the unkerlanters hadnt all disappeared well get the next few then back over to the paths the rest of the boys are using leudast called here he was leading a squad again rather than a company with the problem smaller the solution seemed obvious several algarvians burst out onto the firm ground at once blazing as they came the unkerlanters knocked down a couple of them but the others dove behind bushes and made leudasts men keep their heads down that meant more algarvians could come off the paths without getting blazed leudast grimaced king mezentios men werent making his life easybut then they never had back he shouted to the little detachment under his command theyd all seen a good deal of action and knew better than to make a headlong rush for what would not be safety instead some retreated while other blazed at the algarvians then the men whod run stopped and blazed so their friends could fall back past them darkness was gaining fast now but not fast enough to suit leudast he felt horribly exposed to mezentios men as he scrambled and dodged and twisted back toward the mouth of one of the paths the rest of hawarts shrunken command had taken he counted the soldiers who came with him eight one of them wounded theyd made the redheads pay but theyd paid too lets go he said and hurried till the path bent he barely recalled the bend was there and came close to rushing straight ahead into the ooze and muck of the swamp peering back through the thickening twilight he made out the redheads coming after his little force he blazed at them blazed and shouted the vilest curses he knew after hed blazed after hed cursed he slid on down the path as quietly as he could the algarvians charged straight toward where he had been as hed hoped they would they charged toward where he had been and then past where he had beenand right into the mud he didnt understand a word of what they were saying but it sounded hot he was tempted to start blazing again he was sure he could have picked off a couple of them instead he drew away from them disappearing down another bend in the path hed been this way before by day and by night captain hawart wanted everybody ready for whatever might happen but the algarvians would have a cursed hard time following the path leudast chuckled they would have had a hard time following it in daylight as he knew full well swemmel somebody called softly from up ahead cottbus leudast answered the king and the capital were hardly the most imaginative sign and countersign in the world but theyd do he added bugger every algarvian in unkerlant with the biggest pine cone you can find whoever was up ahead of him laughed youre one of ours all right im your sergeant leudast told him come on lets get moving weve got to catch up with the rest of the regiment the rest of the company you mean the other soldier said both statements amounted to about the same thing a couple of runins with the redheads had melted what was a regiment on the books to a companys worth of men leudast hoped the algarvians whod faced his regiment had melted in like proportion but wouldnt have bet on it he stumbled along sticking a foot into the muck every now and again himself when he would cock his head to listen to the redheads progress the noise they made got fainter and fainter he nodded to himself no they couldnt follow the path in the dark somewhere before midnight the ground grew firm under his feet no matter where he set them swamp gave way to meadow what was left of the regiment waited there leudast lay down on the sweetsmelling grass and fell asleep at once hed come through another one in summertime after the hucksters and farmers and artisans left the market square in skrunda young jelgavans took it over by the light of torches and sorcerously powered lamps they would promenade and flirt sometimes they would find places where the lights didnt reach and do other things talsu and gailisa headed for the market square hand in hand talsu walked more freely these days the knife wound an algarvian soldier had given him in the grocery gailisas father ran still troubled him but not so much as it had he said at least the cursed redheads let us keep our lights down in valmiera everything goes dark at night so enemy dragons cant see where to drop their eggs no enemy dragons around these parts gailisa said she lowered her voice and leaned over to whisper in talsus ear the only enemies in these parts wear kilts oh aye talsu agreed with her breath soft and warm and moist on his earlobe he would have agreed to just about anything she said but he might not have had that fierce growl in his voice hed reckoned the redheads enemies long before one of them stuck a knife in him and had been part of jelgavas halfhearted attack on algarve before the algarvians overran his kingdom into the square he and gailisa strolled to see and to be seen they werent the chief attractions nor anything close to it rich mens sons and daughters didnt stroll they strutted and swaggered and displayed as much to show off their expensive tunics and trousers and hats as to exhibit themselves gailisa hissed and pointed look at her the shameless creature she said clicking her tongue between her teeth flaunting her bare legs like a like an i dont know what like an algarvian talsu said grimly though he didnt mind the way the rich girls kilt displayed her shapely legs to keep gailisa from thinking he was enjoying the spectacle too much he also pointed and look at that fellow there the one with the mustache hes as blond as we are but hes in a kilt too disgraceful gailisa said whats the world coming to when kaunian folk dress up in barbarian costumes nothing good talsu said no nothing good at all something new had been added to the promenade since algarve invaded jelgava and king donalitu fled for lagoas redheaded soldiers leaning against the walls and eyeing the pretty girls along with the young men of skrunda one of the algarvians beckoned to the girl in the kilt when she came over he chucked her under the chin kissed her on the cheek and put his arm around her she snuggled against him her face shining and excited little hussy gailisa snarled i want to slap her shameless doesnt begin to say what she is she stuck her nose in the air talsu had been looking at the girls legs again if kilts hadnt been an algarvian style he would have said they had something going for them for women as far as he was concerned the young jelgavan man in a kilt simply looked like a fool a jelgavan in proper trousers came by squeezing music out of a concertina the algarvians made horrible faces at the noise one of them shouted at him going away bad musics but the jelgavan shook his head my people like it he said and half a dozen jelgavans raised their voices in agreement they far outnumbered the redheads and the soldiers werent carrying sticks a fellow in a sergeants uniform spoke to the music critic who didnt say anything more the concertina player squeezed out a happy tune gailisa tossed her head thatll teach em she said aye it will talsu pointed toward a fellow trundling a barrel along on a little wheeled cart would you like a cup of wine why not she said itll wash the taste of that mattressbacked chippy out of my mouth the wine seller dipped up two cups from his barrel the wine was of the plainestan ordinary red flavored with oranges and limes and lemons but it was wet and it was cool talsu poured it down and held out the cheap earthenware cup for a refill the wine seller pocketed the coin talsu gave him then plied his tin tipper once more as talsu sipped the citruslaced wine he glanced at the algarvians in the market square he knew it was foolish but he did it anyhow he might recognize the one hed hit in the nose in the grocers shop but he had no idea what the one whod stabbed him looked like a redheadthat was all he knew gailisa was glancing across the market square toward the other side of town it still doesnt seem right he said huh what doesnt talsu asked so many things in skrunda didnt seem right these days he had trouble figuring out which one she meant that the algarvians knocked down the old arch gailisa answered it had been here more than a thousand years since the days of the kaunian empire and it hadnt done anybody any harm in all that time they didnt have any business knocking it down ah the arch aye talsu nodded hed been running an errand to that side of town when a couple of algarvian military mages brought it down with wellplaced eggs he hadnt thought much about the archwhich commemorated an imperial kaunian victory over longdead algarvian tribesmenwhile it stood but he too missed it now that it was gone maybe the wine hed drunk made him say the arch louder than hed intended a fellow a few feet away heard him and also looked toward the place where the monument had stood he said the arch too and he said it loud on purpose the arch this time a couple of people said it the arch the arch the arch little by little the chant began to fill the square the concertina player echoed it with two notes of his own the algarvian soldiers started watching the crowd of jelgavans in a new way looking for enemies rather than pretty girls one of the redheads a lieutenant wearing a tunic talsus father had sewn for him spoke in jelgavan the arch is down not going up again no use complaining go home the arch the arch the arch the cry kept on and got louder and louder talsu and gailisa grinned at each other as they shouted theyd found something king mezentios men didnt like like it the algarvians certainly didnt they huddled together in a compact band theyd come to the market square to have a good time not to fight the promenading jelgavans badly outnumbered them if things went from shouting to fighting the unarmed redheads were liable to have a thin time of it in an experimental sort of way talsu kicked at one of the cobbles in the square it didnt stir he kicked it again harder and felt it give a little under his shoe if he needed to pry it out of the ground and fling it at the algarvians he could if he wanted to he could and he knew he couldnt be the only jelgavan in the crowd having such thoughts go home the algarvian lieutenant said again shouting this time then he made an enormous mistake adding in the name of king mainardo i order you to go home mainardo was mezentio of algarves younger brother put on the throne here after the redheads conquered jelgava a moment of silence followed people stopped shouting the arch the arch the arch when they resumed they had a new cry donalitu donalitu donalitu talsu joined it roaring out the name of jelgavas rightful king even as he roared he wondered at the passion for king donalitu that had seized everyone himself included the king had been more feared than loved while he sat on jelgavas throne and with reason hed ground down the commoners and flung them into dungeons if they complained in spite of that though he was a jelgavan not a redheaded usurper kept on the throne by redheaded invaders instead of shouting again for the jelgavans to go home the algarvian lieutenant tried a different ploy stand aside he yelled let us by that would have left the square to the jelgavans the biggest victory theyd have had in skrunda since their kingdom fell to mezentios men but it didnt feel like enough to talsu it didnt seem to feel like enough to anybody people didnt move aside they cried out donalitus name louder and more fervently than ever in a moment the brawl would start talsu could feel it something in the aira small hiss right at the edge of hearing talsus body knew what it was before his brain did he pushed gailisa to the cobbles and lay down on top of her as the first egg burst no more than a couple of furlongs away all through the square young men both jelgavan and algarvian were going to the ground even before the egg burst theyd all known combat in the recent past and retained the reflexes that had kept them alive more eggs fell on skrunda some farther from the square some nearer the bursts were like thunderclaps battering talsus ears where are they coming from gailisa shouted whos dropping them i dont know talsu answered and then as she tried to struggle to her feet powers above sweetheart stay down no sooner had he said that than an egg burst right in the market square the blast picked him up then slammed him back down onto gailisaand onto the cobbles his wounded side howled agony shrieks all through the square said his side was a small thing he knew too well what eggs could do hed never expected them to do it in skrunda though they kept falling too more or less at random another one burst near the square more people cried out as fragments of the eggs shell tore into their flesh only when no more eggs had burst for several minutes did talsu say i think we can get up now good gailisa said you squashed me flat and my back will be all over bruises from the stones but when she did get up she forgot her own aches as soon as she saw what the eggs had done to others she shut her eyes then seemed to make herself open them again so this is war her voice was grim and distant aye talsu said the algarvian lieutenant lay groaning not ten feet away clutching at a badly gashed leg before the eggs started falling talsu would gladly have bashed in his head with a cobblestone now he stooped and tore at the fellows kilt to make a bandage for his wound my thanks the redhead said through lips bloody where hed bitten them talsu didnt much want his thanks he did want to learn what he could who did this he demanded the algarvian lieutenant shrugged and winced air pirates he answered which told talsu little but he went on kuusamo and lagoas can carry dragons in ships did not expect them so far north why would they do it talsu asked whythis with another shrug the algarvian said they fight us youyou are only in the way talsu scowled at that cavalier dismissal but the more he thought about it the more sense it made in this war anyone and everyone unlucky enough to be in the way got trampled trasone tramped through the wheat fields surrounding a mediumsized townno one had bothered telling him its namesomewhere in southern unkerlant a few of king swemmels soldiers blazed at the advancing algarvians from hastily dug holes as trasone got down on his belly to crawl forward major spinello cried out behemoths spinello sounded gleeful so trasone guessed they were algarvian behemoths the battalion commander wouldnt have been so cheerful had the great beasts belonged to unkerlant sure enough eggs from the tossers the behemoths carried on their backs began bursting on the unkerlanter soldiers ahead before long the unkerlanters stopped blazing trasone didnt raise his head right away swemmels men were sneaky whoresons they might well have been waiting for unwary algarvians to show themselves so they could pick them off but spinello yelled come ontheyre finished trasone raised up far enough to see the battalion commander striding briskly toward the town muttering trasone got to his feet too spinello was brave all right but he was also liable to get himself killed and some of his men with him not this time though spinello and his soldiers went forward and so did the behemoths they came out of the wheat fields and onto the road leading into the town refugees fleeing the algarvians already clogged the road seeing more algarvians coming up behind them they began to scatter dragons swooped down on them just then dropping eggs that flung bodies aside like broken dolls and then they flew on to drop more eggs on the town ahead the behemoths charged through the unkerlanter fugitives who were still fleeing down the road for once in this war the behemoths ironshod horns found targets the soldiers on the beasts whooped and cheered as they ran down one peasant after another thats how things go sergeant panfilo said cheerfully you get in the way you get flattenedand you deserve it too oh aye no doubt about that trasone agreed he was a big broadshouldered young man almost as burly as an unkerlanter weve flattened a lot of the buggers too he looked ahead more plains more fields more forests more towns more villagesseemingly forever but weve still got a deal of flattening to finish we do too right panfilo said too bloody right well were gaining again he pointed ahead look the dragons have gone and set the town afire aye trasone said i hope they cook a regiments worth in there but i dont suppose they will the unkerlanters arent standing up to us the way they did last summer i think weve got em on the run they arent battling they way they did thats sure enough panfilo agreed maybe the fights finally leaking out of emor maybe theyre falling back toward wherever theyre going to make a stand now theres a cheery thought trasone said heres hoping the unkerlanters dont have it wouldnt you like things to be easy for once oh that i would panfilo answered but youve been doing this a long time by now how often are things easy valmiera was easy trasone said that makes once the sergeant told him trasone nodded they both let out noises that might have been grunts or might have been laughs then got back to the serious business of marching again not all the unkerlanter soldiers had run off toward the west some eggtossers the dragons hadnt wrecked started lobbing eggs at the advancing algarvians somebody not too far from trasone went down with a scream trasone shivered as he tramped past the wounded man it could have been him as easily as not and he knew as much when the leading squads of his battalion started into the town to fight it out with king swemmels men major spinello threw a fit no no no he howled and made as if to tear his fiery hair or rip out his waxed mustachios stupid buggers poxbrained cretins what do you think youre doing go around flank them out let the poor trudging whoresons who come after us dig the pus out of the pocket our job is to keep moving we never let them get set up to slug it out with us we go around have you got that have you powers below eat you youd better all right well bloody well go around panfilo said and swung his arm to lead his squad south of unkerlant spinello was also screeching at the behemoths on this part of the field and got them not to go straight into the town either they tossed a few eggs into it as they skirted it to north and south trasone said i think hes a pretty good officer as long as we keep moving we can lick these unkerlanter whoresons right out of their boots only time they match us is when mud and rain or snow make us slow down maybe so panfilo allowed no small concession from a veteran sergeant toward a green officer he promptly qualified it by adding if he tells one more dirty story about that kaunian bitch back in forthweg though ill hit him over the head with my stick and make him shut up oh good trasone said im not the only one whos sick of them then somehow finding that out made the march seem easier the unkerlanters must have been hoping the algarvians would come into the town and fight for it street by street when they saw mezentios men werent about to they began pulling out themselves men in rockgray tunics dogtrotting in loose order with horses hauling eggtossers and carts full of eggs they wouldnt have held the town against the algarvian troopers following the ones pushing the front forward out in the open they didnt last long against those frontline troops the algarvians on the behemoths showered eggs down on them with impunity as soon as one of those eggs touched off a supply dump for the unkerlanter eggtossers king swemmels men began to realize they were in a hopeless position at first by ones and twos and then in larger numbers they threw down their sticks and came toward the algarvians with hands held high along with his comrades trasone patted them down stole whatever money they had and whatever trinkets he fancied and sent them off toward the rear into the captives camps they go and good riddance too he said we may be seeing some of them again one day panfilo said huh trasone shook his head not likely aye it is panfilo said havent you heard he waited for trasone to shake his head again then went on they go through the camps and let out some of the unkerlanters who say theyll fight for raniero of grelzwhich means for us trasone stared now thats a daft notion if ever there was one if they were trying to kill us a little bit ago why should we trust em with sticks in their hands again ahh its not the worst gamble in the world panfilo said put it this way if you were an unkerlanter and got the chance to give king swemmel a good kick in the balls wouldnt you grab it with both hands i might trasone said slowly but then again i might not too i havent noticed that the whoresons are what youd call shy about fighting for their king no matter whether hes crazy or not its not like theyve got a lot of choice not after swemmels impressers get their hands on em sergeant panfilos shoulders moved up and down in a melodramatic ever so algarvian shrug and its not like i can do anything about it any which way im just telling you what ive heard pretty shitty way to go about things anybody wants to know what i think trasone said panfilo laughed at him dont be dumber than you can help nobody cares a sour fart for what a common footslogger thinksor a sergeant either come to that now spinellospinello theyll listen to hes got himself a fancy pedigree he does but i bet he doesnt care one way or the other what happens to unkerlanter captives hes not interested in laying them so why should he care trasone returned and got a laugh from the sergeant neither one of them was laughing a few minutes later when a flight of unkerlanter dragons streaked toward them out of the trackless west because the unkerlanters painted their beasts rockgray and because they came in low and fast trasone and his comrades didnt see them till they were almost on top of the algarvians a tongue of flame reached out for him as a dragon breathed fire trasone threw himself flat the flame fell short he felt an instants intense heat and did not breathe then the dragon raced by the wind of its passage blew dust and grit into trasones face he rolled from his belly to his back so he could blaze at the unkerlanter dragons he knew how slim his chances of hurting one were but blazed anyhow stranger things had happened in this war as far as he was concerned that the unkerlanters were still fighting was one of those stranger things a dragon flamed an algarvian behemoth the soldiers riding the behemoth died at once without even the chance to scream partly shielded by its armor the beast took longer to perish bellowing in agony flames dripping from it and starting fires in the grass it galloped heavily till at last it fell over and lay kicking even then it bawled on and on theres supper trasone said pointing roasted in its own pan panfilo lay sprawled in the dirt a few feet away if this were last winter roast behemoth would be supperand wed be cursed glad to have it too dont i know it trasone answered what did you think i was kidding theres not a man with a frozenmeat medalthe decoration given for surviving the first winters savage fighting in unkerlantwholl do much kidding about behemoth meat except the ones who ate mule or unicorn instead or the ones who didnt eat anything sergeant panfilo said theyre mostly dead by now trasone got to his feet well wed better keep going and hope those buggers dont come back our dragonfliers are better than the unkerlanters any day but they cant be everywhere at once now panfilo was the one to say dont i know it he went on when we started this cursed fight did you have any notion how stinking big unkerlant was not me trasone answered at once powers below eat me if i dont now though ive walked every foot of itand a lot of those feet going forwards and then backwards and then forwards again and he hadnt walked enough of unkerlant either he hadnt marched into cottbus and neither had any other algarvian it still might happen he knew that despite unkerlanter dragons king mezentios army was rolling forward again here in the south take away unkerlants breadbasket take away the cinnabar that helped her dragons flame trasone nodded lets see swemmel fight a war once we have all this stuff he thought come on major spinello shouted were not going to win this cursed war sitting on our arses get moving get moving trasone glanced toward sergeant panfilo panfilo waved the squad forward on they went into the vastness of unkerlant marshal rathar scowled at the map in his office with his heavy unkerlanter features he had a face made for scowling he ran a hand through his irongray hair curse the algarvians he growled theyve got the bit between their teeth again he glared at his adjutant as if it were major merovecs fault they didnt do quite what we expected no sir merovec agreed that we was courteous on merovecs part rathar had thought the algarvians would strike hard for cottbus again once the spring thaw ended and the ground firmed up had he been commanding king mezentios troopers that was what he would have done hed strengthened the center against the assault hed expected but mezentios generals looked to have moved more of their men into the south and had forced one breakthrough after another there were not going to be able to stop them down there not for a while rathar said merovec could do nothing but nod the advances the algarvians had already made ensured that they would make more theyd seized enough ley lines to make bringing reinforcements down from the north much harder and unkerlant didnt have enough soldiers west of the duchy of grelz to stop the redheads or even to slow them down very much merovec said if wed known they were building up for their own campaign south of aspang aye if rathar said unhappily king swemmel had insisted that the unkerlanters strike the first blow in the south as soon as the land down there got hard enough to let soldiers and behemoths move and so they had but then the algarvians struck too and struck harder and now the army the unkerlanters had built up to batter their way back into grelz was shattered it had held the finest regiments swemmel and rathar could gather some of them had managed to break out of the pocket the algarvians formed south of aspang somebut not enough soldiers who might have been strong in defending the south were now dead or captive rathar got up from his desk and paced back and forth across his office merovec had to step smartly to get out of the way the marshal hardly noticed hed almost trampled his aide he strode over toward the map what are they after he rumbled down deep in his chest merovec started to answer but then realized rathar hadnt aimed the question at him indeed as his pacing proved rathar had forgotten merovec was there he might have asked the question of himself or of the powers above his adjutants views didnt matter to him rathar had a gift for visualizing real terrain when he looked at a map it was a gift rarer than he wished it were he knew too many officers who saw half an inch of blank paper between where they were and where they wanted to be and assumed getting from the one point to the other would be easy they didnt quite ignore swamps and forests and rivers in the way but they didnt take them seriously either the marshal of unkerlant did this spring at least the algarvians hadnt attacked all along the front as they had a year earlier mezentios men lacked the strength for that but theyd sapped unkerlant too the question was whether king swemmels soldiers king swemmels kingdomcould still stand up against the blow the redheads were still able to launch cinnabar rathar muttered down in the mamming hills were the mines from which unkerlant drew most of its supply of the vital mineral algarve was always short on cinnabar which had to account for the redheads growing adventure in the land of the ice people maybe the mines scattered through the barren hills in the far south of unkerlant were reason enough for mezentio to launch the kind of attack he had it made more sense than anything else rathar had stumbled across cinnabar sir when major merovec did finally speak he reminded the marshal of his existence aye cinnabar rathar said its obvious it hadnt been not till he pondered the map in just the right way but it was now we have it they need it and theyre going to try to take it away from us merovec came over and looked at the map too i dont see it sir he said with a frown theyve got too much too far north to be striking down at the mamming hills wouldnt you rathar retorted thats the screen to keep us from coming down and hitting them in the flank if they gave me the chance thats just what id do too by the powers above i may try it anyhow but theyre making things harder for me theyre good at what they do i wish they werent butthe mamming hills lord marshal merovec still sounded anything but convinced theyre a long way from where mezentios men are now theyre a long way from anything rathar said which was true enough not even a lot of unkerlanters down in those parts except for the miners the hunters and herders in the hills look more like kuusamans than anything else pack of thieves and robbers major merovec muttered oh aye like any unkerlanter rather looked down his beaky nose at the alien folk who lived on the edges of his kingdom after a few moments thought he added i hope they stay loyal theyd better stay loyal there his adjutant reassured him if they dont itll be the worst and the last mistake they ever make rathar nodded at that anyone who failed to take king swemmels views on vengeance seriously was a fool a generation of unkerlanters had come to take that for granted even the hillmen had learned to fear the kings name if they went over to the algarvians they would be sorry the other question was how sorry would they make unkerlant get paper and pen major rathar said i want to draft an appreciation of the situation for his majesty the sooner swemmel got rathars views on what was going on the less inclined he would be to listen to anyone else or to get strange notions of his own or so the marshal hoped merovec dutifully took dictation when rathar finished his adjutant rolled the sheets into a cylinder and tied a ribbon around them rathar used sealing wax and his signet to confirm that he had dictated the memorial merovec took it off to pass to swemmels civilian servitors these days rathar did not go home much his son was at the front in the north toward zuwayza his wife had got used to living without him hed had a cot set up in a little room to one side of his office legend had it that during the six years war general lothar had entertained his mistress in the little roombut then lothar had been half algarvian himself and all sorts of stories stuck to him someone shook rathar awake in the middle of the night his majesty requires your presence at once a palace servitor declared im coming rathar said around a yawn whatever swemmel required he got had rathar asked something like wont it keep till morninghad he been so foolish unkerlant would have had a new marshal by sunup were rathar lucky he would have been ordered to the front as a common soldier more likely his head would have gone up on a spear to encourage his successor since hed been sleeping in his tunic the marshal had only to pull on his boots grab his ceremonial sword and run his fingers through his hair to be ready he followed the servitor through the royal palacequiet now with most courtiers and soldiers asleepto swemmels private audience chamber the guards there were wide awake rathar would have been astonished to find anything else after theyd searched him after hed set the sword on a wall bracket the men let him enter swemmels presence he prostrated himself in front of his sovereign and went through the rituals of abasement till swemmel decided he could rise and when he had risen the king fixed him with the glare that turned the bones of every underling in unkerlantwhich is to say every other unkerlanterto jelly you have proved wrong again marshal swemmel said how shall we keep you at the head of our armies when you keep being wrong the last word was nearly a scream stolid as usual rathar answered if you know an officer who will serve the kingdom better than i have your majesty set him in my place for a dreadful moment he thought swemmel would do it but then the king made a disparaging gesture everyone else is a worse fool than you swemmel said why else do the algarvians keep winning victories we are sick to death of being served by fools swemmel had put to death a great many men who were anything but fools in the twinkings war against his brother kyot when neither of them would admit to being the younger and in its aftermath and then all through his reign whenever he suspected an able ambitious fellow was able and ambitious enough to look toward the throne pointing that out struck rathar as useless he said your majesty we have to deal with what is the algarvians are driving again down in the south aye swemmel glared again eyes dark burning coals in his long pale face i have here your appreciation more retreats i want a general who fights not one who runs away and i intend to fight your majestywhen the time and the ground suit me rathar said if we fight when and where the algarvians want us to do we help ourselves or do we help them remember weve got ourselves into our worst trouble by striking at them too soon he took his life in his hands with that last sentence swemmel had always been the one whod urged premature attack no other courtiers would have dared remind the king of that rathar dared one day he supposed king swemmel would take his head for lese majesty meanwhile if swemmel heard the truth once in a while the kingdom stood a better chance of coming through the crisis we must save the cinnabar mines in the mamming hills the king said we agree with you in this without them our dragons would be greatly weakened when he said we did he mean himself or unkerlant did he even separate the two rathar didnt know fathoming swemmels mind was hazardous at the best of times which this wasnt pulling his own mind back to the matter at hand he said so they would and did the algarvians have it their dragon force would be strengthened to the same degree they must not have it then they shall not have it they shall not swemmels eyes rolled in his head his voice rose to a shrill shout once more we shall slaughter them we shall bury them unkerlant shall be algarves graveyard rathar waited till his sovereign regained some semblance of calm then cautiously the marshal asked having read the appreciation your majesty do you recall my mention of the town called sulingen on the northern bank of the wolter what if we do swemmel answered which might have meant he didnt recall and might have meant he simply didnt care the latter it proved sulingen is too near the mamming hills to suit us if we can stop the algarvians before then so much the better rathar agreed but if they break through at sulingen then how can we stop them at all swemmel grunted it had better not come to that he shook his head sulingen too close too close but they cant pass it they mustnt pass it rathar didnt know if hed won his point or not he hadnt lost it in the first instant anyhow with swemmel that was something of a victory in itself three leofsig toweled water from his beard and used a hand to slick his damp hair back from his forehead in summer he used gromheorts public baths more often after a day of road building than he had when tlie weather was cool the baths werent heated so well as they had been before the war but that mattered less when he would have got sweaty even without a hard days labor he grimaced as he redonned his old filthy stinking tunic no help for it though he had only a few tunics and no prospect of getting more till the war ended if it ever did the algarvians took almost all the wool and linen forthweg made only people with the best of connections sported new clothes these days when leofsig left the baths he looked around warily lest he spy felgilde hed seen the girl hed jilted only once since backing away from their engagement and that had been coming out of the baths he didnt want to see her again to his relief he didnt see her now that improved his mood as he headed home he turned the last corner and started down his street he hadnt taken more than a couple of steps before he stopped in surprise hed almost run into a kaunian are you mad he exclaimed get back to your own district before a redheaded constable spots you the blondactually his hair was more silver than goldtouched a scabby scar on the side of his head when he spoke he used his own tongue rather than forthwegian i have already made the acquaintance of those barbarians thank you then you do not want to make it again leofsig answered also in kaunian that got the old mans notice your pronunciation is not all it should be he said but what in these wretched times is since you do speak this language somewhat perhaps you will not betray me may i trouble you with a question before i go my way your being here is trouble leofsig said but then he relented ask better you pick me than someone else very well then the kaunians voice like his bearing was full of fussy precision ask i shall am i mistaken or is this the street on which dwells a young man of forthweg named ealstan leofsig stared i havent seen ealstan in months he answered startled back into forthwegian hes my younger brother whats he to you he wondered if he should have said even that much could the algarvians have persuaded a kaunian to spy for them he knew too well they couldthe promise of a few square meals might do the job but if the redheads were after anybody in his family they were after him not ealstanhe was the one whod escaped from an algarvian captives camp maybe this would be all right what is he to me the kaunian repeated in his own language well i see i must ask another question beyond the one you gave me did your brother ever mention to you the name vanai aye leofsig said in a faintly strangled voice he pointed at the old man then you would be her grandfather im sorryi dont recall your name why should you i am only a kaunian after all as leofsig had gathered from ealstan the old fellow carried venom in his tongue he went on in case your memory should by any chance improve henceforward i am called brivibas tell me at once whatever you may know of my granddaughter how much to tell how much to trust after a few seconds thought leofsig answered last i heard she was well and so was my brother brivibas sighed there is the greatest weight off my mind but you see one question does indeed lead to another where are they what are they doing id better not tell you that leofsig said the more people who know the more people who are likely to find out do you think i have a tongue hinged at both ends brivibas demanded indignantly before leofsig could answer somebody threw a rock that missed brivibas head by scant inches and shattered against the whitewashed wall behind him a shout followed the rock get out of here you miserable stinking kaunian i hope the algarvians catch you and whale the stuffing out of you the look brivibas sent the raucous forthwegian should have left him smoking in the street like dragonfire when it didnt brivibas turned back to leofsig perhaps you have a point after all he said quietly my thanks for what you did tell me he hurried away his shoulders hunched as if awaiting blows only too likely to fall on them that could have been worse went through leofsigs mind as he walked on toward his own house if cousin sidroc had come upon them for instance it could have been much worse but sidroc was away training in plegmunds brigade with other forthwegians mad enough to want to fight for algarve or if brivibas had come to the house and spoken with uncle hengist sidrocs father oh the unpleasant possibilities had few limits when leofsig rapped on the door hengist opened it hello boy he said as leofsig stepped in leofsig was taller than he was and thicker through the shoulders but he didnt seem to notice hello leofsig said shortly he didnt mind his father and mother thinking of him as a child it grated when uncle hengist did it leofsig strode past his fathers brother and into the house as hengist shut and barred the door he said the algarvians are on the move in unkerlant again no denying it now huzzah leofsig said without stopping if all the algarvians in the world moved into unkerlant and got killed there that would have suited him fine but hengist like sidroc kept finding reasons not to hate the invaders so much leofsig thought it was because the redheads were strong and his uncle and cousin wished they were strong too now though hengist had a new reason for thinking well or not so badly of king mezentios men as long as the algarvians move forward plegmunds brigade wont be going into such danger i suppose not leofsig admitted if hed been one of mezentios generals he would have spent forthwegians lives the way a spendthrift went through an inheritance why not they werent algarvians but he didnt say that to his uncle he couldnt afford to antagonize hengist who knew how hed got out of the captives camp muttering to himself he left the entry hall and went into the kitchen hello son his mother said as she pitted olives how did it go today not too bad leofsig answered he couldnt talk about brivibas not with uncle hengist still liable to be in earshot that would have to wait wheres conberge he asked your sister is primping elfryth answered primly she wont be having supper with us tonight grimbaldyou know the jewelers sonis taking her to the theater i dont know what theyre going to see something funny i hope most of the plays they put on these days are funny or try to be anyhow leofsig said he paused in thought this isnt the first time grimbalds come by for conberge is it his mother laughed at him i should say not and if youd been paying any attention at all youd know how far from the first time it was too i wouldnt be surprised if his father started talking with your father before long that rocked leofsig back on his heels thinking of his sister married he didnt want her to be an old maid but he didnt want her moving away either for the first time in his life he felt time hurrying him along faster than he wanted to go quietly he said i have news itll have to keep though he jerked his chin toward the entry hall he didnt know that uncle hengist was still hanging around there but he didnt know that hengist wasnt either elfryth nodded understanding what he meant good news or bad she murmured leofsig shrugged he didnt know what to make of it his mother fluttered her hands looked a little exasperated and went back to the olives when someone knocked on the door a few minutes later leofsig opened it there stood grimbald leofsig let him in gave him a cup of wine and made desultory small talk till conberge came out a couple of minutes later by the way she beamed at grimbald she might have invented him away they went hand in hand lets have supper elfryth said after theyd gone the casserole of porridge and cheese and onions with the pitted olives sprinkled over the top filled the pit in leofsigs belly afterwards he and his mother and father sat quiet and replete uncle hengist tried several times to get a conversation going he had no luck not even when he twitted leofsigs father about the way the algarvians were still advancing after a bit he rose to his feet and said i think id need to be a necromancer to squeeze any talk from you people im heading off to a tavern maybe i can find some live bodies there and out he went into the night hestan smiled at leofsig your mother told me you knew something interesting my thought was that if we were all dull enough my brother might get impatient hengist has been known to do that well it worked elfryth rounded on leofsig nowwhat happened that you couldnt tell me about before leofsig recounted the meeting with brivibas when hed finished his father said id heard theyd brought the kaunians from oyngestun to gromheort i wondered if ealstans friend had any relatives among them he had nerve coming out of the kaunian district he clicked his tongue between his teeth i hope i would have done the same for my kin ealstan didnt much like him leofsig said i can see whyhe thinks he knows everything there is to know and hes one of those kaunians whove never forgiven us for coming out of the west and turning forthweg into forthweg and now hes got a forthwegian in his family hestan said musingly no he wouldnt much care for that would he no more than a lot of forthwegians would care to have a kaunian in theirs he left himself out of that group and after a moment continued ill have to see what i can do for him poor fellow im afraid it may not be very much though if the algarvians put him on a caravan and send him west elfryth began i cant do anything about that hestan answered i wish i could not just for him but i cant once i find out where hes staying i can send him money if he has any sense about such things hell be able to pay off the redheads they can be bought he glanced over to leofsig several algarvians had been bought so they wouldnt notice his unauthorized return to gromheort from that captives camp im just glad most of the redheads you paid off are out of gromheort these days father leofsig said but i dont know how much sense this brivibas has not a lot maybe if his own granddaughter and ealstan both wanted to stay clear of him hestan sighed you may well be right but i can hope youre wrong i hope im wrong too leofsig said he can put us in danger not just himself vanai sprawled across the bed in the cramped little flat she shared with ealstan reading the flat which had had only one abandoned romanceand that a piece of hate translated from algarvianin it when they started living there now boasted a couple of rickety bookcases both of them packed ealstan brought home several books a week he did work hard to keep her as happy as he could but trained by her grandfather shed cut her teeth on the subtleties of kaunian epics and histories and poetry forthwegian romances struck her as spun sugar straightforward all bright colors heroes and villains sharply defined it wasnt that she didnt enjoy them she usually did still at least half the time she knew all the important things that would happen before she got a quarter of the way into a book the slim little volume in her hands now wasnt a romance at all it was called you too can be a mage in the preface the authorwho didnt say what rank of magecraft he held or if he was a ranked mage at alldidnt come right out and promise that anyone who finished the book would end up a firstrank mage but he certainly implied it a likely story vanai muttered if magecraft were so easy everybody would have been a mage but using sorcery and performing it on your own were two very different things despite her doubts she kept reading the author had a sprightly style and seemed convinced he was telling the truth regardless of how improbable vanai found that you can unleash the power within yourself he insisted back in oyngestun shed tried magica cantrip lifted from a text belonging to her grandfather that dated back to the kaunian empireto try to get major spinello to leave her alone a little later spinello got posted to unkerlant vanai still didnt know whether the spell and his departure had anything to do with each other she didnt know but she hoped she wondered what had happened to spinello after he got to unkerlant nothing good was her dearest wish many many algarvians had met their ends in battle against king swemmels men was one more too much to ask she doubted she would ever learn spinellos fate she hoped with all her soul she would never see him again if she didnt who would bring word of him to her no one if she had any luck at all with a deliberate effort of will she pushed major spinello out of her mind and went back to you too can be a mage the author concentrated on spells that might bring in money and on those that might lure someone goodlooking of the opposite sex neither of which areas inclined vanai to trust him very far but he insisted using these same principles can get you anythingaye anythingyour heart desires what does my heart desire vanai asked rolling over and looking up toward the poorly plastered ceiling shed never had a lot of money and had got very used to doing without it she wasnt looking for anyone but ealstan what did she want then if only every algarvian would vanish off the continent of derlavai now there was a nice round wish regretfully vanai laughed at herself it was also a wish far beyond anything she could learn in you too can be a mage it was a wish far beyond the powers of all the nonalgarvian mages in the world put together she knew that all too well too what could she wish for that she might actually be able to get the chance to go out on the streets of eoforwic if i need to she suggested to herself that wouldnt be so bad that in fact would be splendid ealstan had brought her a forthwegianstyle long tunic if only she looked like a forthwegian now she flipped through the pages of the book sure enough there was a section called improving your appearance vanai didnt think looking like a forthwegian constituted an improvement but she was willing to settle for a change she studied a couple of the suggested spells one by its phrasing was pretty plainly a translation from the kaunian she didnt recall ever running across the original no doubt her grandfather could have cited exactly the text from which the forthwegian had filched it and no doubt brivibas would have had some pungent things to say about forthwegians meddling with their betters works but whatever brivibas had to say these days he was saying it to someone elseand if he was trying to publish it he was saying it in forthwegian he wasnt vanais worry any more she hoped the algarvians hadnt thrown him into a leyline caravan and sent him west past that she refused to worry about him still she intended to try the translated spell not the other one maybe that was because she was a kaunian herself and maybe in some measure it was because she was her grandfathers granddaughter whichever was true she couldnt even think about trying the spell before ealstan got home even if shed had all it would need she wouldnt be able to see the change if she did it before then neither on herself nor in a mirror and if she turned herself into a crone she wouldnt want to go out on the streets either when ealstan gave his coded knock vanai threw the door open and let him in ethelhelm and his band are back in town he said after hed hugged her and kissed her hes got more stories to tell than you can shake a stick at thats nice normally vanai would have been bubbling with eagerness to hear news of the outside world now hoping to see some of it for herself she cared much less listen ealstan to what i want to do listen ealstan did he had patience and as she went on his own enthusiasm built that would be wonderful sweetheart he said do you really think you can do it i dont know vanai admitted but by the powers above i hope so im so sick of being stuck here you cant imagine she waited to hear whether ealstan would claim he could imagine it even if he didnt feel it himself to her relief he only nodded and asked what will you need for the spell vanai had been pondering that herself you too can be a mage didnt go into a lot of detail yellow yarn she answered black yarndark brown would be even better vinegar honey a lot of luck ealstan laughed i can bring you back everything but the luck weve got honey and vinegar vanai answered all you have to buy is the yarn and youve already brought me luck have i his tone went bleak is this luck being trapped in this little flat day after day for a kaunian in forthweg this is luck vanai said i came this close she snapped her fingersto getting sent west remember im lucky to be alive and i know it maybe you should be content with that part of her said maybe you shouldnt want any more but she did she couldnt help it and because she couldnt the next day seemed to crawl past the walls of the flat felt as if they were closing in on her when ealstan came home after what seemed like forever she threw the door open and snatched from his hand the little paperwrapped parcels he was carrying he laughed at her nice to know youre glad to see me oh i am she said and he laughed again she tore the parcels open one held pale yellow yarn a pretty good match for the color of her own hair the skein of yarn in the other package was dark brown she nodded to ealstan these are perfect hope so he said will the spell wait till after supper im starved he gave his belly a theatrical pat even though vanai didnt want to wait any more she did and then at last there wasnt anything left to wait for she got the honey and the vinegar she got lengths of each color yarn and she got you too can be a mage after studying the spell it gave as carefully as if she were a firstrank theoretical sorcerer essaying some conjuration that had never been tried before she nodded im ready good ealstan said you dont mind if i watch of course not she said just dont jog my elbow ealstan didnt say a word he pulled up a chair and waited to see what would happen next vanai began to chant she felt strange incanting in forthwegian rather than classical kaunian though the tongue in which a spell was cast had nothing to do with how effective it was a lot of history had proved that as she chanted she dipped the yellow yarn first into the vinegar then into the honey she laid it on top of the length of dark brown yarn she frowned a little while she was doing that the phrasing for the spell there seemed particularly murky as if the translator whoever he was had had trouble following the kaunian original she hurried on a last word of command and the spell was done you dont look any different ealstan remarked hed stayed quiet all the time vanai was working shed almost forgotten he was there now sweat streaming down her face from the effort shed just put forth she looked upand froze in horrified dismay no wonder she didnt look any different the spell hadnt worked on her it had worked on ealstan he made a very handsome kaunian but that wasnt what shed had in mind whats the matter he asked he couldnt see the effects on himself any more than vanai would have been able to on herself with a curse she flung you too can be a mage across the room the translator hadnt known what he was doingand hed landed her and ealstan in a dreadful fix how was ealstan supposed to go out if he looked like a blond her heart in her shoes vanai told him what had happened well thats not so good he said easiergoing than she could have been try it againthe exact same spell i meanexcept this time put brown on yellow with a little luck thatll get us back where we started she envied him his calm forthwegians were supposed to have terrible tempers to fly off the handle at any excuse or none here though she was furious while ealstan took things in stride and hed come up with what sounded like a good idea she went over and picked up you too can be a mage the cover was bent she wished she could bend the author too ealstan still looking like a kaunian came over and gave her a kiss it almost felt as if she were being unfaithful to the real him but part of her also wished he could stay a kaunian except when he had to go outside you too can be a mage he said provided you have more going for you than this fool book ill try the spell again vanai said then ill throw the book away keep it ealstan said read it enjoy it just dont use it grimly vanai set about the spell once more with the reversal ealstan had suggested she wanted to correct the forthwegian text where she knew it had gone awry but she didnt and when she called out the word of command ealstan went back to looking like himself did it work he askedhe couldnt tell aye vanai heard the relief in her own voice you wont have to go through what i go through for looking like this i like the way you look ealstan said and i wouldnt mind looking like a kaunian except that i can do a better job of keeping you safe if i dont that was no doubt true vanai hated it but couldnt argue it she slammed the cover of you too can be a mage shut she never intended to open it again splashing through muck toward yet more trees ahead sergeant istvan said i never thought the stars looked down on such a forest the big gyongyosian plucked on his curly tawny beard as far as he could tell the forest in which he was fighting went on forever corporal kun said sooner or later it has to stop when it does theres the rest of unkerlant ahead kuns beard grew in lank clumps he was lean and would have been cleverlooking even without spectacles hed been a mages apprentice before going into the gyongyosian army and seldom let anyone forget it i know istvan answered morosely i wonder if any of usll be left alive to see it he had no great desire to see the rest of unkerlant as far as he was concerned the unkerlanters were welcome to their kingdom he wanted nothing to do with it the mountains that were the borderland between gyongyos and unkerlant had been bad this endless forest in its own way was worse he wouldnt have bet that whatever lay beyond it made for much of an improvement but he did want to live to find out more men with tawny yellow hair and beards who wore leggings like istvans waved his squad and him forward all safe enough one of them said weve cleared the unkerlanters out of the stretch ahead istvan didnt laugh at his countrymen but keeping quiet wasnt easy brash kun did speak up nobody knows whether those goateaters are cleared out till after they blaze half a dozen men in the back some of them will be lurking there you mark my words you have no faith said one of the warriors beckoning the squad onward we have plenty of faith istvan said before kun could answer we have faith there will be some unkerlanters all our patrols havent swept up there always are he didnt waste any more time with the guides but tramped east past them ever deeper into the woods behind their spectacles kuns eyes were puzzled you dont usually stick up for me like that sergeant he said ill take you over those knowitalls any day istvan answered they havent done any real fighting or they wouldnt talk like a pack of idiots besides youre mine if anybody rakes you over the coals its me let them tend to their own thats fair thats right a few minutes later off to one side someone let out a shriek hes been blazed someone else shouted gyongyosian troopers scurried this way and that trying to flush out the unkerlanter sniper they had no luck no none of king swemmels men in these parts istvan said no chance of that at all goat shit kun said they both laughed though it wasnt really funny snipers and holdouts took a constant toll on the gyongyosians trying to force their way through the vast pine forests of western unkerlant endless ferns and tree trunks to hide behind endless branches on which to perch endless foliage with which to conceal no rooting out the enemy was next to impossible kun looked now this way now that he knew as the guides had not that where there was one sniper there were likely to be more somewhere up ahead eggs were bursting istvan wondered who was tossing them at whom with the breeze blowing from out of the east bringing the sound toward his ears he had trouble being sure he hoped those eggs were landing on the unkerlanters heads come on come on that was captain tivadars voice istvan relaxed a little if hed found his company commander hed brought the squad somewhere close to where it was supposed to be tivadar caught sight of him and waved the partys up ahead aye istvan turned to his men come on you lugs back into the line we go not enough time pulled back and we didnt pull back far enough either szonyi said istvan remembered when hed been new to the game he wasnt any more he picked the same thing to complain about as istvan would have or for that matter as a fellow whod been in the army since before istvan was born would have they cant very well give us a proper leave not when its a weeks march back to the nearest ley line that could take us anywhere worth going istvan told him istvan had been a sergeant long enough by now to know how to squelch grumblers too then they cursed well ought to bring some whores forward szonyi said since istvan thought that was a good idea too he didnt argue any more captain tivadar fell into step beside him swemmels boys are up to something he said nobody knows what yet but they havent been standing and fighting the past couple of days the way they would before maybe they finally know theyve been licked istvan threw up a hand tivadar sputtered raucous laughter all the same istvan went on no i didnt mean it theyre tough no doubt about it and theyve got more lines in these woods than a thief has on his back after he takes his forty lashes tivadar added no if they dont fight now its because theyre plotting something nasty for later aye youre likely right sir istvan agreed with a sigh more eggs burst closer now istvan looked around for the nearest hole in which he could hide something he did as automatically as he breathed and because he wanted to keep breathing that also made him take more notice of the forest through which he was marching tivadar noticed him noticing the captain didnt miss much you see what i mean aye istvan said again nodding if theyd fought the way they usually do the woods here would be beaten flat instead most of the trees are still standing thats what im talking about the company commander agreed when theyve always done one thing and they all of a sudden change to another anybody with any sense starts wondering why an egg burst close enough to send branches crashing down only a few strides away they havent quite given up yet istvan remarked dryly tivadar chuckled no it doesnt seem that way does it but its not the same kind of fight as it has been and i dont trust it the breeze from out of the east blew smoke into istvans face he coughed a couple of times a moment later he smelled something else the sicklysweet reek of corruption sure enough a few paces farther on he strode past a bloated corpse in a rockgray tunic he jerked a thumb toward it good to see we got one of those sons of goats anyhow oh weve hurt them tivadar said but what theyve done to us the whole cursed country is too big and too far from everything to make it easy to fight over istvan said we cant get at it and the unkerlanters cant get very many men into it either but as long as they can keep us from getting into country that really is worth something theyre ahead of the game thats about the size of it captain tivadar agreed the breeze out of the east picked up and tried to lift his service cap off his head he tugged it down over his curly hair sooner or later we will break out then by the stars well make them pay till then he grimaced till then the debt just keeps getting bigger cries echoed through the forest as istvans squad neared the front he had trouble sorting out gyongyosians and unkerlanters no matter which kingdom wounded men came from their moans and screams sounded very much alike telling how far away the racket came from wasnt easy either istvan kept expecting attackers to burst out of the bushes at any moment only to realize a heartbeat later that the noises hed heard came from a long way off theyve stopped tossing eggs tivadar said he frowned and plucked a hair from his beard i wonder why theyve got more eggtossers than we do they dont have to manhandle them over the mountains to get them here only the stars know why unkerlanters do things but istvan frowned too when they dont do what they usually do you wonder what theyre up to like you said youd better too if you want to keep the stars shining on you the company commander answered he started to say something else but coughed a couple of times instead smokes getting thick aye it is istvans eyes stung and watered he pointed east its coming from that way too maybe swemmels men are burning themselves up and thats why they arent using their eggtossers he laughed then coughed himself too much to hope for no doubt it is tivadar said but we have to before he could tell istvan what the gyongyosians had to do a couple of his countrymen burst out of the woods ahead istvan almost blazed them for unkerlanters but swemmels men didnt wear leggings or bushy yellow beards and they didnt yell fire at the top of their lungs in his language either while istvan was gaping captain tivadar rapped out where how bad bad the men said in the same breath one of them added the accursed goateaters have fired the whole forest against us and then without waiting for any more questions they both dashed off toward the west istvan and tivadar stared at each other while they were staring the breezeno more than a breeze now a freshening windblew thick smoke into their faces they both coughed and both looked as if they wished they hadnt istvan heard other shouts of fire he also heard more gyongyosian soldiers plunging through the woods fleeing the flames and then he heard the fire itself crackling with insane glee a moment later he saw it through the branches and brambles ahead a wall of flames licking up tree after tree and advancing on him as fast as a man could walk he turned to tivadar what do we do sir we the company commander bit back whatever hed been about to say and answered we fall back what else can we do itll cook us if we stay he shook his fist at the fire and at the unkerlanters behind it may the stars never shine on them who would have thought to use fire as a weapon of war whoever had thought of it had had a good idea istvan didnt need to order his squad away from the flames he had to work to keep them from fleeing like so many panicked horses he had to work to keep panic from sinking its teeth into him too the fire was frightening in a way war wasnt it wasnt trying to kill him it was just doing what it did and the only thing he could do about it was run run he did hoping he could go faster than the flames behind himever closer behind him it seemedtrees turned into torches smoke got thicker and thicker till he could hardly breathe could hardly tell in which direction he should run away from the flamesthat was all he knew at last when he was beginning to wonder how much farther he could run he plunged into the bog from which hed emerged earlier that day he slogged into the mud rejoicing at what hed cursed then now the fire had trouble following he shook his fist at it as tivadar had shaken his fist at the unkerlanters whod started it when the flames died down he and his comrades would go forward again and what would king swemmels men have waiting for them then for the first time in a very long while the marchioness krasta made the acquaintance of someone who not only could outshout her but paid no attention to her desires whatever her maidservant bauskas bastard by the algarvian captain mosco a girl the mother had named malya howled as loud as she wanted whenever she wanted powers above krasta complained to colonel lurcanio youd think the mansion would be big enough to shield me from the racket of a squalling brat but it isnt doesnt she ever shut up she is in training to become a woman krastas lover replied in valmieran with only a slight trilling accent she glared which only made the algarvian nobleman laugh he said perhaps we will go out to supper tonight then you will not have to listen to this noise that so distresses you good krasta said anything to get away and bauska is just useless useless i tell you if this is what having a baby does to a woman im glad i havent had any even so lurcanio scratched at the new pink scar on his forehead one of the souvenirs of the concealed egg that had burst at a valmieran nobles mansion the redheads still hadnt arrested anyone for that krasta wished they would for one thing the egg might have harmed her too for another lurcanio grew quite tediously dull when he tried to track the culprit whoever he was where shall we go krasta asked trying to decide what she felt like eating i had in mind the imperial lurcanio answered ive seen talk about that place in romances two hundred years old it would be a shame not to get to know it while i am in priekule all right krasta said ive heard the service is slow there though normally she hated anything that smacked of delay but now she brightened so much the better the longer im away from the baby the better ill like it babies are enjoyablein moderation lurcanio said krasta thought babies were enjoyable tooat a distance preferably a distance of several miles with the prospect of supper before her her mind turned to more important things what shall i wear she murmured she couldnt make up her mind down here in lurcanios office she needed to see what was in her closet making her excuses to the algarvian she hurried back to her own wing of the mansion and upstairs to her bedchamber for a wonder malya wasnt screeching her head off that let krasta go through her wardrobe in peace but it didnt make her any more decisive than she would have been otherwise she had so many clothes she needed help narrowing down her choices bauska she shouted if the brat was taking a nap krastas serving woman could start earning her keep again when bauska didnt come right away krasta called for her again even louder malya started to cry krasta cursed bauska came into her bedchamber a moment later carrying her daughter and wearing a resentful expression reproach in her voice she said she was asleep milady if she was asleep you should have come in here faster krasta answered a retort that made perfect sense to her she glowered at bauska the serving woman was still doughy and fat with a pale face marred by purple circles under her eyes malya woke her up all the time malya sometimes woke krasta too which infuriated the marchioness how may i serve you bauska asked through clenched teeth she rocked the baby back and forth in the cradle of her arms help me pick an outfit krasta said shed given that order any number of times before bauska was efficient about obeying it once shed got krasta to choose a pair of dark green trousers picking three tunics that went with them let her mistress decide which one she wanted a coppery shade brighter than that of lurcanios hair which was going gray as bauska withdrew krasta pursued her with words there that wasnt so hard was it it was in fact easy enough that she could have done it herself but what point to having servants if you didnt use them when she came downstairs colonel lurcanio beamed and kissed her hand do you see he said you can if you put your mind to it look lovely even without making me wait i dont want you to take me for granted krasta answered and that was true in ways she hoped lurcanio didnt fully grasp if she began to bore him all he had to do was crook a finger to get himself another mistress that was how things were in occupied valmiera these days of course he might also crook his finger so if she angered him a point that didnt cross her mind he laughed now i may do many things he said but i would never be so rash as to do that lets go as always krasta missed the bright lights priekule had shown before the war lurcanios driver an algarvian like his master got lost a couple of times and finally had to ask a patrolling valmieran constable for directions to the imperial even when he got there krasta wasnt sure he had the restaurant like every other building in the capital remained dark on the outside to make things difficult for lagoan dragons the entry hall was dark too only after a servitor closed the door did he open the black curtains at the other end of the hall the sudden brilliance he revealed made krastas eyes water almost as if shed looked up at the noonday sun lurcanio blinked a couple of times too as a fawning waiter escorted krasta and him to the table he said eateries with indifferent food keep things dark so you dont know exactly what youre getting the imperial now the imperial has confidence yes sir we do the waiter said drawing out krastas chair so she could sit down i hope sir when your meal is done you will be able to tell me our establishment deserves to have such confidence i hope so too lurcanio answered as a matter of fact i had better be able to his smile had sharp edges reminding the waiter who was occupier and who occupied the fellow gulped nodded and fled when he returned he brought menus and a list of potables krasta chose a dark ale lurcanio wine from the marquisate of rivaroli an excellent selection sir the waiter said i think so lurcanio said now that algarve has taken rivaroli back from valmiera the least i can do is take a bottle of her wine that sent the waiter away in a hurry again krasta stared across the table in some annoyance shed been ready to order supper too and now she couldnt she looked around the imperial more than half of the men eating supper were algarvians the blond men with them had the sleek look of those whod done well for themselves since valmiera fell to king mezentios men their yellowhaired lady friends were almost as elegant almost as lovely as those who accompanied the redheads idly lurcanio asked does the name pavilosta mean anything to you pavilosta krasta shook her head it sounds like it ought to be a town is it out in the provinces somewhere i suppose who cares where as far as she was concerned the civilized world ended a few miles outside of priekule oh it had extensions in fashionable resorts but she was certain pavilosta wasnt among them she would have known more about it if it were aye out in the provinces lurcanio said you would not by any chance have got a letter from there lately powers above no krasta exclaimed she wasnt clever in most senses of the word but she did have a certain shrewdness to her pointing at her companion she went on and if i had youd know about it before i did lurcanio chuckled well i hope i would but you never can tell he might have said more but the waiter came back with his wine and krastas ale this time krasta got to order she chose the pork chop stuffed with crayfish meat ah youll enjoy that milady the waiter said he turned to lurcanio and dipped his head and for you sir roast chickendark meat not white lurcanio answered very simplejust brush it with olive oil garlic and pepper all the rich things you valmierans eat i marvel that youre not round as footballs well need a little time to prepare it that way sir the waiter warned lurcanio nodded in acquiescence the waiter departed once more if you come to a place like this you shouldnt be simple krasta said simplicity to her mind was anything but a virtue lurcanio had different ideas done well simplicity makes for the highest art he said krasta shook her head again no that wasnt how she looked at the world with a whimsical shrug lurcanio changed the subject shall we return to the uninteresting village of pavilosta why if its so uninteresting krasta asked sipping her ale lets talk about interesting things instead how many drops of poppy juice do you suppose id have to give bauskas little bastard to make her stop yowling so much i am a good many things but an apothecary i am not lurcanio replied you might silence the baby for good if you gave it too much i do not think this a good idea thats because you dont have to listen to itexcept when youre up in my bedchamber that is krasta said when youre over in the west wing you probably dont even know when its pitching a fit instead of answering that lurcanio made a steeple of his fingertips if you brother the marquis were still alive do you think he would have done his best to reach you and let you know his situation skarnu krasta raised an eyebrow she didnt think of her brother much these dayswhat point when he hadnt come home from valmieras debacle aye i think so im sure of it in fact lurcanio eyed her not as a man eyes a woman but more like a cat eyeing a mouse she glared at him she didnt care for that more often than not he ignored her glares this time he looked away it could be he said at last the investigators in those parts do not know everything there is to know theyve proved that often enoughtoo often in fact what are you talking about krasta asked crossly nothing lurcanio answered with another fine algarvian shrug it might have been something but it turns out to be nothing he sipped the golden wine hed ordered then nodded solemn approval ill tell you what krasta said if i ever get a letter from my brotheror from anyone else in this pavilostainthewilderness placeyoull be the first to know about it oh i expect i will my dearyou said so yourself the algarvian colonel answered with a laugh krasta took offense at its tone they might have squabbled some more but the waiter chose that moment to bring their suppers on a tray not even krasta felt like quarreling when faced with that lovely food and lurcanio having tasted his chicken said aye simplicity is best he beamed at krasta you prove that every day my dear she smiled back taking it for a compliment pekka sat in her kajaani city college office staring up at the ceiling staring up through the ceiling after a long stretch where the theoretical sorcerer scarcely moved she bent to the paper in front of her and scribbled two quick lines and then after a moment another a smile chased the abstracted expression she had worn from her broad highcheekboned face this is real sorcery she thought the other part the part that goes on in the laboratory that hardly matters without this laboratory experiments would be nothing but guesswork plenty of mages would have disagreed with her that bothered her not at all her husband was one of those mages that bothered her only a little leino was good at what he did and i by the powers above am good at what i do too pekka thought through her open window she heard a masons trowel scraping across mortar as he set bricks in place to repair a wall damaged in a laboratory accident that was all most people knew about what had happened here a few weeks before pekka devoutly hoped it was all the algarvians knew about what had happened here she though she knew better after looking up at the ceiling a while longer she wrote another line and slowly nodded one step at a time she and siuntio and ilmarinen were learning more about the energy that lay at the heart of the relationship between the laws of contagion and similarity the hole in the wall the mason was repairing was one of the lessons the master mages hadnt learned quite so well as they thought they had if we figure out how to release the energy where and when we need it we can shake the world pekka murmured sometimes thinking about what they might do terrified her and made her wish theyd never started down this ley line but whenever she thought about what mezentios wizards had done first against unkerlant and then to yliharma the capital of her beloved kuusamo she hardened her heart the algarvians hadnt needed the new sorcery to shake the world oldfashioned sorcery on a large and bloodthirsty scale had been plenty for that we wont slaughter people to get what we want pekka thought we wont no matter what i would sooner see kuusamo plunge into the bothnian ocean and with this new sorcery we wont have to kuusamo wouldnt have to if pekka and her colleagues could gain the understanding they needed if they didnt the land of the seven princes was liable to plunge into the sea pekka stared down at her latest sheet of calculations if she couldnt come up with answers fast enough shed never imagined that sort of pressure when someone knocked on the office door she jumped in surprise it was still light outside but it would stay light outside the whole day through or almost kajaani lay so far south it made the most of summer pekka opened the door there stood leino another day done her husband said he worked in neat chunks of time not as mood and inspiration struck him let me pack up my things pekka said she didnt leave calculations lying around the office as she had in safer happier more innocent times hows it going leino asked as they walked across the campus toward the caravan stop where theyd board the car that would take them close to their home pretty well pekka answered she gave her husband a wry grin i always seem to do my best thinking just before you come and get me the breeze smelling of the sea blew a lock of her coarse black hair across her face she flipped it back with a toss of the head aye thats the way of it leino agreed i hope i didnt knock right in the middle of an inspiration the way i have a few times no it wasnt too bad she said id just written something down so i have a fair notion of where i ought to be going when i pick up in the morning she sighed now i have to hope the ley line im traveling actually leads somewhere i dont think you need to worry about that leino said if it led anywhere more important dear professor heikki would have to worry about a whole new laboratory wing not just a chunk of wall dont say that pekka looked around anxiously though none of the other students and scholars on the walks was paying any attention to her husband and her anyway its not so much what were doing as controlling what were doing thats turning into the biggest problemaside from the department chairman of course and even she wouldnt be so bad if shed just leave me alone youll manage leino sounded more confident than pekka felt a fairsized crowd of people was waiting at the caravan stop he fell silent he didnt worry about spilling secrets quite so much as she did but he was no blabbermouth somebody at the stop was waving a news sheet and exclaiming about what a splendid job kuusaman dragons were doing against the algarvians down in the land of the ice people theres good news pekka said ayefor now leino replied but if we poke the algarvians down there what will they do send more men across the narrow sea most likely they can do it easier than we can he paused of course everybody they send to the austral continent is somebody they cant use against the unkerlanters so that might not be so bad after all then again it might pekka said i know swemmels an ally these days but were mad if we fall in love with him the only reason hes better than mezentio is that he wasnt the one who started slaughtering people to make his magic stronger but he didnt wait very long before he started doing it too did he if he had waited cottbus probably would have fallen leino said and held up a hand before his wife could snap at him i know hes no great bargain but wed be worse off if the algarvians werent fighting him too and you cant tell me that isnt so since pekka however much she wished she could truly couldnt tell him that she pointed down the ley line and said here comes the caravan i hope well be able to get seats and not have to wait for the next one leino said as things turned out pekka got a seat her husband stood beside her hanging onto the overhead rail till a good many people got out at the downtown stops and not so many came aboard then he sat down beside her they rode together as the caravan glided along the energy line of the worlds grid to their stop when they got out they climbed the hill that led up to their house hand in hand before they got home they stopped next door to pick up their son from elimaki and how was uto today pekka asked her sister not so bad elimaki answered which given uto wasnt the smallest praise she might have offered have you heard from olavin lately leino asked elimakis banker husband had gone into the service of the seven princes to keep the armys finances running smoothly ayei got a letter from him in the afternoon post elimaki said hes complaining about the food and he says theyre trying to work him to death she laughed a little you know olavin if he said everything was fine id think someone had ensorceled him pekka took her sons hand come on lets get you home im going to give you a bath after supper that produced as many piteous howls and groans and grimaces as shed expected indifferent to all of them she gave her sister relief from uto and took charge of him herself whats for supper tonight leino asked as they went into the house i have some nice mutton chops in the rest crate and a couple of lobsters too pekka answered which would you rather have if youre starving i can do the chops faster than the lobsters lets have the mutton chops then leino said no lets have lobster uto said then i wont have to have a bath so soon maybe i could use the hot water from the lobsters to bathe you in pekka suggested uto fled squalling in delicious horror mutton chops pekka said to remind herself she shook her head if she wasnt acting like one of the absentminded mages comics made jokes about what was she doing she took the lid off the rest crate which broke the spell that kept the crates contents from aging at the same rate as the world around them in a different way the crate did some of the same things as her experiments but it did them undramatically by conserving sorcerous energy rather than releasing it in bursts she reached into the crate for the mutton chops which lay wrapped in butcher paper and string a moment later she called for her husband when leino came into the kitchen she thrust the package of chops at him here she said you can throw these in a pan as well as i can i need to do some calculating youve had an idea leino said in accusing tones i certainly have pekka answered now i want to get some notion of whether im right or not all right leino said if youre not going to worry about whether they come out half done or burnt i wont either is there anything else i can do for you aye there is pekka said keep uto quiet im going to need to be able to hear myself think ill try leino said i make no guarantees pekka blazed him a look that warned hed better do his best to offer a guarantee his grimace said he understood that even as pekka understood lifeand utocould include the unexpected she went into the bedchamber she shared with her husband took out pen and paper and began to calculate she knew the parameters of rest crates well it wasnt as if she were stumbling around half in the dark as she so often was while calculating implications of the stillmurky relationship between the laws of similarity and contagion it could work she breathed by the powers above it truly could she hadnt been more than half serious when she gave her husband the chops by the time he called that they were ready shed found most of what she needed to know the results startled her youve got something leino said as he served up mutton chops and a salad of spinach and scallions i can see it on your face i do pekka agreed still sounding surprised and i want to kick myself for being such a fool i didnt see it before i want to get on the crystal and talk with ilmarinen and siuntio they might have better notions of where to go with this than i do either be vague or send them a letter leino answered you never can tell whos liable to be listening thats true enough its too true in fact pekka said absently she added these chops are good that surprised her almost as much as the possible new use for rest crates had thanks leino turned to uto there do you see i wasnt trying to poison everybody after all now eat up did he really say that pekka asked leino nodded pekka wagged a forefinger at their son dont say things like that again or youll spend some more time sleeping without your stuffed leviathan that was a threat to make uto behave himself at least for a little while if only the algarvians were so easy pekka thought but they werent and wouldnt be despite her new idea the war was a long way from won she laughed not very happily she needed some more progress on some of the other ideas shed had before the new one would be worth anything at all as skarnu buried the egg in the middle of the ley line that ran between the farm on which he lived and pavilosta he wondered where the valmieran underground had come up with it jelgavan army issue he remarked leaning on his spade for a moment how did it get down here from the north in the darkness he couldnt see the expression on raunus face but what the veteran sergeant said made his feelings plain dont worry about hows and whys sir somebody got hold of it somebody else got it to us and now were going to make the redheads lives miserable with it thats good enough all right skarnu agreed he peered both ways along the ley line if an unscheduled caravan should come gliding up before he and raunu had the egg buried they wouldnt get a second chance to do the job properly the same held true if an unexpected algarvian patrol picked the wrong time to make sure the ley line stayed safe and secure but everything was quiet crickets chirped somewhere in the distance an owl hooted breathing a little easier skarnu started digging again so did raunu twinkling stars watched them work there was no moon think thats deep enough skarnu asked after a bit aye should do raunu answered grunting he picked up the egg and lowered it into the hole it had better have the proper spell on it so itll burst when a caravan goes over it he said otherwise wed be doing just as much good hiding a rock down here they said it did skarnu reminded him of course theyve probably been wrong before huh raunu said a sound of reproach your lady wouldnt care to hear you talk like that and you cant tell me different what would merkela have to say probably something on the order of shut up and dig it was good advice even if it came from skarnus own mind he shut up and dug when he and raunu had filled in the hold and tamped down the dirt he said now lets get out of here we dont want the algarvians to find us toting spades back to the farm thatd take a bit of explaining wouldnt it raunu yawned there in the darkness getting late for explanations too he shouldered his shovel as if it were a stick and started off toward merkelas farm skarnu followed they hadnt gone more than a quarter of a mile before skarnu heard the soft whoosh of a caravan sliding down the ley line he turned to raunu in surprise must be a special they havent got anything scheduled for this time of night had the algarvians had anything scheduled he and raunu would have picked a different time to visit the ley line before raunu could answer the caravan passed over the egg skarnu and he had buried the egg released its energy in a short sharp roar the rattles and bangs that followed were caravan cars crashing to the ground shouts and screams pierced the nighttime quiet skarnu turned to raunu solemnly the two valmieran soldiers who hadnt given up the fight against algarve clasped hands then they hurried away moving faster than they had before king mezentios men would surely flood the area around the ley line with soldiers both to help the injured on the caravan and to search for the folk whod planted the egg beneath it when they got back to merkelas farm raunu went off to sleep in the barn as he always did skarnu went into the farmhouse barred the door behind him and climbed the stairs to the bedchamber he shared these days with merkela shed been lying in bed but she hadnt been asleep did i hear the egg burst she asked sitting up i thought i did you were right skarnu said it was a special caravan toohad to be that means it was probably packed full of algarvian soldiers we might have struck them an even better blow than wed hoped whatever you did to them its less than they deserve merkelas voice held a purr she flipped back the blankets that covered her beneath them she was bare and sowould you sooner celebrate or sleep skarnu had swallowed a yawn as he went up the stairs now around another one he said my sweet i mean no disrespect when i say id sooner sleep well have to get up with the sun and theres always too much work to do this is what life is on a farm merkela said skarnu didnt answer he knew she knew how ignorant hed been when he first came to the farm she also knew hed been an officer which meant he was a noblemanwhich she would doubtless think meant hed never done any work to speak of before he came to the farm she wasnt so far wrong but he didnt care to be reminded of it he took off his boots stripped to his drawers and lay down beside her the next thing he knew sure enough the sun was shining through the window he dressed again feeling as if hed gone to bed only moments before bread and honey and a mug of ale sent him out of the house still trying to rub sleep from his eyes ill stumble through the day he thought and sleep like a stone tonight raunu looked worn too seeing that salved skarnus pride the sergeant wasnt far from twice his age but had the endurance of granite if he showed the strain of the nights work skarnu didnt need to be ashamed of his own exhaustion my day to go weeding too raunu said mournfully you can tend the livestock if youd rather skarnu told him minding the cattle and sheep was easier workor was most days anyhow but raunu shook his head he had a stubborn pride of his own i wont fall over he said with that he went back to the barn and came out with a hoe as he had with the shovel he carried it with a military precision he would have used with a stick by the determined look on his face he would have taken argument as insult raunu waved him out to the fields and went to get a long staff with a crook for himself as he drove the animals out to the meadow he shaded his eyes with his free hand and looked over toward raunu who bent his back to grub weeds out of the ground skarnu sighed the sergeant would ache tonight skarnu would also have ached had he gone weeding today but he would have got over it faster than his comrade and the animals didnt look as if they would give him any trouble today they grazed contentedly the cows not very far away from the sheep by all the signs theyd be content to keep on doing it till skarnu drove them back into their pens when the sun set for all they needed him he could have lain down in the tall thick grass and caught up on his sleep then the first two men stumbled out of the woods that marked the border of the meadow they were both kaunians they had yellow hair and wore tunics and trousers though of a cut that hadnt been stylish in valmiera since not long after the end of the six years war they were also both filthy and unshaven and so scrawny that their oldfashioned clothes hung loosely on them seeing skarnu they hurried toward him arms outstretched beseechingly they called out to him their voices harsh drythroated croaks he stared clutching the staff half ready to use it as a weapon for he understood not a word they said but then after a moment he did or thought he did they werent speaking valmieran what came from their mouths was classical kaunian though with an accent different from the one hed learned in school theyre kaunians from forthweg he realized and a shiver ran through him he tried to remember the classical tongue which hed used little since his schooling stopped repeat yourselves he said you are from the caravan aye their heads bobbed up and down together the caravan then they both started talking at the same time too fast for skarnu to follow when they used what was for him a foreign tongue and one spoken with an intonation hed hardly ever heard before slowly he said proud that hed remembered the word he pointed to the taller of them you talk too late he realized hed used the intimate rather than the formal pronoun and verb form his schoolmaster would have striped his back but the kaunian from forthweg didnt criticize his grammar talk he did though not so slowly as skarnu would have liked out of the corner of his eye skarnu saw raunu scramble over the fence that kept the livestock out of the crops and trot toward him the hoe most definitely a weapon now after listening for a bit raunu asked whats he saying i can make out a word here or there but thats all as a sausagesellers son hed never had occasion to learn the classical language im only getting about every other word myself skarnu answered distracted by the veterans question he didnt even follow that much for a couple of sentences but he thought he had the gist unless im wrong the redheads were sending them somewhere so they could kill them to draw their life energy for magic as he understood bits and pieces of classical kaunian so the blonds from forthweg could follow scraps of valmieran aye they said one of them drew his thumb across his throat raunu grunted like they did against yliharma this past winter eh he nodded sounds likely powers below eat mezentio and all his people wonder if they aimed to have another go at kuusamo or hit setubal in lagoas they would know i dont skarnu answered his gaze met raunus for a moment theyd done more and better than they could have guessed by wrecking this leyline caravan skarnu remembered the one hed seen with merkela not long before the attack on yliharma the one with shutters over all the windows had it been hauling doomed kaunians down to the edge of the strait of valmiera help us one of the men from the caravan said feed us hide us the other one added before skarnu could answer a man and a woman came out of the woods hand in hand seeing their countrymen they pointed back toward the caravan algarvian soldiers the woman exclaimed hide us the kaunian man in the meadow said again but before skarnu could answer all the kaunians from forthweg began running they couldnt stand the idea of being anywhere near king mezentios soldiers stop skarnu and raunu called after them but they wouldnt stop and when three more blonds burst out of the woods they pelted past skarnu and raunu too theyd all managed to get out of sight when half a dozen redheaded men in kilts stepped out onto the meadow they came up to the two valmierans you seeing escaping criminals one of them asked skarnu looked at raunu raunu looked at skarnu they both looked back at the algarvian with the stolid uncaring gaze of peasants didnt see nobody skarnu answered raunu nodded agreement the algarvian muttered something in his own language that sounded like a curse as the kaunians from forthweg had done he and his comrades ran on theyll catch a lot of them raunu said out of the corner of his mouth i suppose so but they wont do it right away and it wont be easy skarnu answered and anyone who speaks even a little of the old language will find out what the algarvians have been doing to our cousins in forthweg if we dont see a lot more people in this part of the kingdom starting to fight the redheads now we never will raunu thought that over nodded and headed back toward the fields he had more weeding to do four every so often garivald looked at the little enamelwork plaquestriped red green whiteset into the butt of his stick he wondered what had happened to the algarvian invader whod once carried it nothing good he hoped not that many algarvians patrolled the forests through which munderics band of irregulars prowled mezentios men kept the roads and ley lines leading west open as best they could and rarely batded the unkerlanters who hadnt given up despite being far behind the line when the redheads wanted to make life difficult for the irregulars they sent in their pet soldiers from the toy kingdom of grelz how can we blaze them garivald asked not long after munderic and his comrades rescued them from the redheads they might be our brothers some of them are our brothers the cursed traitors the leader of the fighting band answered how can we blaze them if we dont theyll cursed well blaze us they arent playing games when they come after us they want us dead as long as were alive and free it reminds them they live their lives in chains and they put them on themselves i dont follow that garivald said munderic spat the algarvians dont conscript soldiers into the army that sticks its belly in the air for that pimp of a puppet king named raniero they dont dare send out impressers because most of the men theyd drag in hate raniero worse than they hate us every bugger in that army volunteered to come after us now are you ready to blaze em all aye garivald answered adding i hadnt known thatabout the grelzer soldiers i mean all sorts of things you dont know arent there munderic rumbled i find more every day garivald admitted hed known just how to live in zossen hed been doing farm work since he was big enough to toddle around after chickens and chivvy them back to his parents house hed known the people in the village as long as he or theyd been alive depending on who was older a tiny world but one in which he was completely at home now hed been uprooted thrown into something new and each day brought fresh surprises itll give you more to sing about munderic said which was also true where do we go next garivald asked weve been gathering supplies from the villages north of the forest the leader of the band of holdouts answered so well go south for a while next one on the list is a little place called gartz the redheads dont even bother putting a garrison therethey just go through now and again all right that sounds easy enough garivald said several villages around their forest stronghold kept the irregulars in food and tunics and other things they needed they avoided a couple of others whose firstmen favored the algarvians and the puppet king raniero of grelz munderic kept threatening to wipe those off the face of the earth but he and his followers hadnt done it yet the irregulars left the cover of the pines and oaks and birches not long after sunset the band numbered perhaps fifty all together of whom half a dozen or so were women that was one more thing garivald hadnt known hadnt imaginedbefore munderic and his comrades rescued him from mezentios men one of the women fell into stride beside him her name was obilot i wish we were raiding tonight not just bringing back sheep and rye and oats she said the algarvians had smashed her village on their way west she thought she was the only one from it left alive now she wanted to go out and raid every night so did all the women in the band they hated the algarvians worse than their male counterparts did weve got to eat too garivald said like a lot of people whod gone hungry he wanted to make sure he didnt have to youre soft obilot said she sounded soft herself her voice was high and thin the top of her head barely came up to garivalds chin she looked more delicate and girlish than annore but a scar seamed her left arm from elbow to wrist she bore the mark with prideshed cut the throat of the algarvian whod given it to her a hideous screech drifted down from high overhead garivald looked up but couldnt spy the dragon he wondered if eggs would start dropping on the irregulars but somebody said theyre flying west he relaxed if the beasts were on their way to the big fight they wouldnt worry about a band of raiders deep inside territory algarve was already supposed to have conquered garivald sniffed i smell smoke he said that will be the village were going to wont it aye munderic answered youd better pay attention to your nose at night itll let you know youre coming up on people before your eyes will ive noticed garivald answered hed usually taken stinks for granted back in zossen when he was among them all the time he hardly noticed them only when hed been out working in fields upwind from the village had he had its odors of smoke and manure and seldomwashed humanity forced upon his consciousness beside him obilot spoke suddenly thats too much smoke for a little place like gartz and the dogs should be barking but they arent munderic grunted youre right curse it his call was soft but urgent spread out go slow were liable to be walking into something obilot caught garivald in the flank with an elbow get off the path well go through the fields and be ready to turn around and run like a rabbit with a ferret on its tail if the redheads have an ambush laid on heart pounding in his chest garivald obeyed her most of the irregulars were bypassed soldiers they knew what to do at times like these the ones who hadnt been in king swemmels army had more practice fighting the algarvians than garivald did before joining this band the worst fights hed known were a couple of drunken brawls with fellow villagers this was different he might die here and he knew it peering ahead through the darkness garivald saw jagged outlines instead of the smooth pale surfaces of thatched roofs theyve burnt the place he burst out that they have beside him obilots voice went cold as a blizzard when she continued it was more to herself than to garivald you never get used to it she started cursing the algarvians with loathing all the more bitter because it was helpless to change whatever lay ahead gratz hadnt been much of a village munderic had been right about that now garivald discovered it wasnt a village at all anymore every house had been burned bodies lay everywhere men women children animals they didnt stink yet this must have happened today munderic said harshly this is what the algarvians did to a village near zossen when it rose against themthis or something like it garivald said gartz wouldnt have risen the leader of the irregulars answered gartz was supposed to stay nice and quiet so it could go right on giving us what we needed we didnt raid here any more than we do close to our other villages only a fool fouls his own nest someone betrayed them obilot said sounding even more wintry than before someone who liveslivedhere or maybe someone in a traitor village who figured out what gartz was doing garivald started to say something but held his tonguehed just stepped out into the village square the algarvians had built a gibbet there three bodies hung on it two men and a woman their heads canted at unnatural angles each corpse had a placard fastened to it a lighter square in the night he turned away fighting sickness hed seen such things before when the redheads hanged irregulars theyd caught outside of zossen munderic went over and cut down one of the placards he couldnt have read it in the darkness garivald couldnt have read it at all hed never learned his letters after a moment munderic let the placard fall to the ground i dont care why the algarvians say they killed them he muttered they killed them because they dont want our peasants remembering whose kingdom it really is vengeance obilot said softly more and more of the irregulars gathered in the square staring at the bodies swaying every so slightly in the breeze another charge on the bill theyll pay garivald said another reason theyll rue the day the song built itself a long furious call for revenge against the redheads when it was through the irregulars gaze had swung from the bodies to him munderic came up and patted him on the shoulder this is why the algarvians wanted to hang you too he said they were talking about boiling me alive garivald remarked munderic nodded thats the kind of thing they do he pointed to the gibbet this is the kind of thing they do well here in unkerlant theyre finding were as fierce as they are we can war like this same as them we can and we are and we will till they all flee aye the irregulars said an angry ragged chorus aye garivald echoed he turned to munderic ill put that last bit into the song it deserves to be there huh munderic said playing it down but garivald knew hed pleased the leader of the irregulars after a moment munderic went on and now wed better get out of here nothing we can do to help gartz and were not going to get anything out of the place either just have to hope the algarvians or their grelzer dogs dont do the same to all the villages that feed us before garivald could say what was on his mind obilot exclaimed we can do one thing for gartz even if we dont do it here and now we can kill lots of redheads aye another savage growl from the whole band as the irregulars started back toward the sheltering woods garivald caught up with munderic and asked what happens if they do wreck all the villages that are friendly to us then we start raiding the ones that arent harder than ever munderic answered theyll find out that mezentios men arent the only ones who can tear things to pieces our own countrymen garivald paused a moment in thought aye if we have to munderic walked on for a couple of paces then slapped him on the back in the still night the noise seemed loud as a bursting egg along with the rest of the lagoan army fernao tramped west across the almost treeless plains of the land of the ice people he couldnt have said how advance felt different from retreat but it did when he remarked on that to affonso the other mage looked at him as if he were daft ill tell you how its different affonso said its better thats how well so it is fernao agreed theyll make soldiers out of us yet if were not careful i understand soldiers better than i ever did before affonso said when the other fellows trying to kill you things that look foolish in peacetime start making more sense all of a sudden thats so fernao nodded their discipline isnt the same as the sort we have but its there you cant get around that up from the south came a band of ice people leading camels they exchanged halloos with the lagoan scouts after a little while an army quartermaster went out to dicker with them before long lagoan soldiers took charge of some of the camels pointing affonso said another advantage of advancing is that were better fed the ice people dont ignore us the way they did when we were going backwards fernao shook his head we may have more to eat when were advancing but were not better fed the only way we could be better fed would be to go back to lagoas and if i ever see a camel in the zoological gardens in setubal ill spit in his eye before he can do it to me affonso laughed though fernao hadnt been joking the other mage said weve been here too cursed long thats certain by the powers above even the women of the ice people are starting to look good to me oh my dear fellowmy deepest sympathies fernao exclaimed and put an arm around affonsos shoulder the women of the ice people were as hairy as the men not just on their faces but all over their bodies some distress in his voice fernao went on theyre starting to look good to me too but they still havent started smelling good to me so im safe a while longer anyhow still he noticed the rank stink of the ice people much less than he had when hed first come to the austral continent for one thing hed grown more used to it for another he like everyone else in the lagoan expeditionary force stank much worse than he had back then high overhead a dragon let out a shriek of fury fernao looked up to see if he could spot it but not with the alarm bordering on panic hed known a few weeks before sure enough it was a kuusaman beast and hard to note against the sky up until the dragon transports came shrieks in the air would have burst from the throats of enemy dragons and would have meant eggs raining down in short order no more now lagoan dragons painted red and gold and kuusaman beasts painted sky blue and sea green took the fight to the algarvians and yaninans fernao enjoyed picturing in his mind enemy soldiers frantically digging for their lives as sorcerous energy seared them and hurled fragments of lichencovered stones in all directions better them than me he thought aye better them than me up ahead of the marching footsoldiers a behemoth paused to tear at the grass and stunted foottall birches that covered the plain fernao pointed to it i wonder if we can keep all the beasts fed when winter comes again he said for that matter i wonder if we can keep all of us fed when winter comes again affonso shuddered i never dreamt we might have to spend a second winter down herebut then this isnt a dream its a nightmare do you remember when this campaign was supposed to be quick and clean and easy did you ever hear of a campaign that wasnt supposed to be quick and clean and easy fernao asked and then answered his own question the trouble is the whoresons on the other side keep coming up with ideas of their own who ever heard of a yaninan with any idea except running away affonso asked fernao laughed so did his comrade but not for long with a grimace affonso continued but there are more algarvians down here than there used to be and they do have other ideas mostly nasty ones fernao agreed thinking of the sorceries mezentios men had started using in unkerlant he kicked at the grass and the mossy dirt almost all of them nasty ones in this war behind its screen of scouts on camels and a few unicorns behind its behemoths the army slogged on toward a long low rise somewhere on the other side of that rise the yaninans and algarvians waited it was somewhere not far away too fernao exclaimed as dragons painted in red and white and green streaked out of the west driving a handful of kuusaman and lagoan beasts before them nor did the algarvians content themselves with that their dragons threw themselves at those flying above the lagoan army whenever the algarvians did anything they did it with all their might fernao watched dragons wheel and twist and flame in the skyand watched some of them fall out of the sky too broken and burning then a unicorn out ahead of the army toppled to the ground pinning its rider beneath it a great gout of steam rose from its body it had been blazed by a heavy stick fernaos gaze went to the top of the rise coming over it were behemoths that didnt belong to the lagoan army lagoan beasts tramped forward to meet them both sides began tossing eggs theyve got more behemoths than i thought they did affonso said in worried tones aye fernao was worried too if theyve been reinforced his voice trailed off if the algarvians had brought more behemoths to the austral continent theyd surely brought more men down here too footsoldiers swarmed over the ridge behind and between the enemy behemoths affonso cursed yaninans havent come forward like that in all the days of the world he said bitterly i wont tell you youre wrong however much i wish i could fernao replied king swemmel ought to thank us every one of those whoresons we slay is one the unkerlanters wont have to worry about im more worried about the algarvians whore liable to slay us affonso answered fernao didnt see how he could fault his friends thinking there he peered nervously toward the south if the algarvians had brought in enough behemoths to confront the lagoan army had they brought in enough to outflank king vitors men too but no cries of alarm rose there and he saw no great shapes pounding across the plain to cut off the lagoans with more than a little relief he turned his attention back to the battle ahead with more relief still he saw that the lagoan behemoths were holding their own against the algarvian animals there werent so many of the algarvian behemoths as hed thought at first frightened glance even if there were plenty to have routed the lagoan scouts indeed the lagoan behemoths were starting to push the algarvians back vitor a great shout rose from the lagoan ranks king vitor and victory the soldiers surged forward fernao and affonso went with them the algarvians began falling back faster now maybe theyd been running a monster bluff sometimes they paid a price for their arrogance every so often this business is easier than you think it would be fernao said to affonso aye the secondrank mage nodded remember how we were worried about the yaninans the first time they tried to hit us we didnt know then theyd run every chance they got im not sorry they did fernao slogged up the rise the lagoan footsoldiers most of them younger than he and affonso moved faster than the mages they hurried to catch up with their behemoths which were just reaching the crest of the rise and disappearing as they went down the other side panting a little or more than a little fernao went on nice of the algarvians to do the same so it is affonso agreed he was breathing hard too you wouldnt expect it of them the way you would of the yaninans no you wouldnt fernao peered thoughtfully toward the top of the rise i wonder if theyve got something in mind hardly had the words left his mouth before several behemoths came back over the top of the rise heading east toward the lagoan force whats this affonso said skidding to a halt nothing good fernao replied a moment later he exclaimed tooin dismay those are our animals but where are the rest of them what have mezentios whoresons gone and done affonso asked fernao couldnt answer him not this time whatever theyd done though it had worked their behemoths thundered after the lagoan beasts that were advancing no more this time the lagoan behemoths couldnt halt their charge a third of the way up that long slope fernao took out his shorthandled shovel and began digging himself a hole he couldnt dig so deep as he would have liked he soon found that the soil as in so many places on the austral continent was frozen solid the year around only a couple of feet below the surface but any kind of scrape in the soil was better than none he heaped up the dirt in front of the scrape and then half jumped half lay in it cold started seeping into his body soldiers were going to earth too and so was affonso and none too soon for the algarvian behemoths started plastering them with eggs again some of those behemoths bore heavy sticks instead of eggtossers as a beam from one of them could bring a unicorn crashing to the ground so it could also blaze straight through two or three men before becoming too attenuated to be deadly any more a few at a time king vitors men began falling back from the rise to the flat ground below as they retreated fernao found out what had gone wrong beyond the crest of the rise on the side he hadnt been able to see whod have thought those buggers would have hauled those really heavy sticks all this way one disgruntled trooper said to another well they did curse em the second lagoan trooper answered you get a stick thats heavy enough and not even a behemoths armor will stand up to it the two footsoldiers tramped past before fernao could hear any more but hed heard enough and to spare turning to affonso he said they outfoxed us it doesnt do to trust the algarvians affonso said mournfully he leaned up on an elbow to peer out over the top of the dirt hed piled up in front of his own miserable excuse for a hole in the ground with a grunt he added theyre going to overrun us if we stay here much longer and theyll have an easier time killing us if we get up and run fernao said but affonso was right if he didnt want to be captured or slain in place hed have to run and run he did abandoning the rise far more quickly than hed gone up it having won their victory the algarvians didnt pursue hard that was some consolation for fernao but not much he knew too well that mezentios men could come after the lagoan army any time they chose count sabrino had strolled through a good many algarvian camps in unkerlant the first summer of the war there when things were going well the stroll he was making through this encampment on the austral continent put him in mind of those the encampment was smaller but filled with the same sense of quiet confidence hed known before in unkerlant that confidence was dead buried by a resistance far stronger and more ferocious than the algarvians had imagined when they started on thebadroads west here in the land of the ice people it still lived the algarvian force here was tiny compared to the armies that had gone into unkerlant but it wasnt facing the whole of swemmels vast kingdom either algarvian soldiers sat on stones or on the grass tending to their boots or packs or sticks as if they were so many craftsmen practicing their trades behemoth crews tinkered with their animals armors or fiddled with their eggtossers to make them fling a little farther it was all very businesslike even the wounded who were tended by mages and surgeons did their best to make light of their injuries in best algarvian style one cracked a joke so funny it made the fellow sewing up his leg pause to laugh out loud sabrino had seen the same sort of thing in unkerlant it had made him proud then here it left him sad at last he found his way to the tent of brigadier zerbino the officer king mezentio had appointed to command the algarvian forces in the land of the ice people zerbino a big bluff fellow who was marquis of a small domain in southern algarve greeted him with a bear hug and a flagon of wine we smashed them he declared positively smashed them so we did sir sabrino agreed zerbino held the higher military and social ranks now we can keep the cinnabar going across the narrow sea oh aye zerbino said swigging from his own flagon and we can drive the cursed lagoans right off the austral continent traitors to the algarvic race thats what they are might as well be kaunians he swigged again ive sent messages by crystal asking the king for more more of everything by the powers above enough to let us finish the job is that a fact sir sabrino said tonelessly hoping that tonelessness disguised the alarm he felt it didnt or not well enough whats biting you colonel zerbino demanded its something besides these cursed mosquitoes ill say dont you want to lick the lousy lagoans right out of their boots on the austral continent sir everything bites you in the summertime sabrino answered his joke did not go over so well as the wounded troopers had after a moment he went on id sooner lick unkerlant if we do that we can settle lagoas later king mezentio doesnt think the same way not at all he doesnt zerbino said we came down here to help the yaninans best way to do it is to give the lagoans a good boot in the arse and thats what were doing but sir sabrino began but me no buts the marquis made a sharp chopping gesture with his right hand just have your dragons ready to go after the lagoans whenever i give the word you can do that cant you if you cant youd better give me the reason why right now i can do that sir sabrino agreed having been doing it for a good deal longer than zerbino had been on the austral continent he spoke with some asperity if the marquis noticed he affected not to thats fine thats fine he said finish your wine and ill fill you up again this isnt the sort of country you want to face sober after all before the algarvian buildup sent supplies flooding across the narrow sea sabrino had been drinking camels milk sometimes fermented sometimes not and boiled water he said thank you sir i dont mind if i do good to see wine again even better to taste it enjoy it zerbino said well slaughter all the lagoans and drive them out of this miserable place and then we wont have to worry any more about cinnabar going across the narrow sea he made it sound so easy sabrino wondered where hed fought before coming to the austral continent valmiera most likely he thought zerbino couldnt have seen much duty in unkerlant or he wouldnt have been able to keep that particular brand of optimism whenever sabrino thought of unkerlant he wished he were back there in the bigger harder fight this is a sideshow he said once more the real wars against king swemmel aye and were winning it brigadier zerbino answered after his large larynx worked to get down a swallow of wine were bloody well winning it we drive them in the south the same as we drove them all along the frontier last summer algarve wasnt driving all along the frontier in unkerlant this campaigning season sabrino understood why king mezentio didnt have the men to do it had zerbino come to the same conclusion he gave no sign of it sabrino upended his goblet to pour the last of the wine down his throat i thank you for the hospitality sir he said my dragons will be ready for whatever you may need from us i know that zerbino said youve even got the yaninan dragons flying as if the men on them know what theyre doing thats not easy allies he let out a loud disdainful sniff thats more colonel broumidis doing than mine sir sabrino said hes a good officer and nobody anywhere would say anything else some of his junior men handle themselves well too when they get good leaders the yaninans can fight you couldnt prove it by me not with what ive seen of their footsoldiers zerbino sniffed again even more noisily than before how many goblets of wine had he had before sabrino came to see him no way to tell he bowed and straightened readily enough you are dismissed with a salute sabrino left the new commandants tent as he walked back toward the makeshift dragon farm he had to fight hard to keep from muttering curses under his breath king mezentio had decided not just to keep the lagoans from making trouble for the cinnabar shipments from the austral continent but to conquer it to the degree that men from derlavai could conquer the land of the ice people wasteful sabrino thought but the word didnt pass his lips king swemmel would have called the plan inefficientand as far as sabrino was concerned the halfmad king of unkerlant would have been right colonel broumidis came up to sabrino as he returned to the dragons as always sabrino had trouble fathoming the expression on broumidis face the yaninans large dark eyes held depths that made a mockery of the confident way algarvians viewed the world doing his best to hide his unease sabrino asked and what can i do for you today colonel i do not know if there is anything you can do for me colonel broumidis replied something sparked in those usually fathomless eyes in any case i should be the one asking you what i can do this is algarves war now with yanina playing the part of the poor relation as usual or am i wrong policy demanded that sabrino insist broumidis was indeed mistaken right this minute he couldnt stomach policy he rested his hand on broumidis shoulder for a moment in silent sympathy the yaninan officer said you are a good chapis that the right word he didnt wait to hear whether that was the right word but went on if more algarvians were like you i should not mind so much being subordinated to them as things are however he didnt go on sabrino understood what he was saying though yaninans didnt take kindly to being subordinated to their own countrymen let alone to foreigners it cant be helped my dear colonel he said if only he stopped much more abruptly than broumidis had if only we yaninans could have beaten the lagoans on our ownthat is what you meant is it not broumidis asked and sabrino could but miserably nod broumidis sighed i wish it had been so if you think i enjoy being a joke to my allies you may think again actually colonel i do not believe you believe such a thing yourself though i would not say the same for a good many of your countrymen you are a gentleman sabrino answered uneasily remembering how many unkind things hed had to say about the yaninans fighting abilities before colonel broumidis could politely deny any such thing an algarvian dragonflier came running toward him and sabrino shouting crystal says the lagoans and kuusamans are flying this way broumidis bowed to sabrino we can take up this discussion another time for now we have business he ran back toward the dragons he commanded shouting orders in his own throaty language sabrino started shouting orders too he already had dragons in the air now that both sides had goodsize forces of dragonfliers he always took that precaution he still wished hed also taken it before the lagoans wrecked his earlier dragon farm though wishes there did no good if he could prevent another such disaster and make the enemy pay that would do his wing full of veteran fliers and of dragons trained as well as they could be wasted no time getting into the air he noted with approval that broumidis yaninans were not behind them in a good army broumidis might have gained marshals rank even as a colonel in a bad army he made the men he led far better than they would have been without him and here came the lagoans and kuusamans half the dragons gaudy in red and yellow the other half hard to see because their paint blended in with sky and landscape zerbino and his reinforcements had driven the lagoans back from their latest advance on heshbon but hadnt broken their spirits lagoans flew dragons much as algarvians did aggressively thinking the best thing they could do was close with their opponents the kuusamans fought in a different style they were precise and elegant in the air looking for any chance to cause trouble and causing plenty when they found one their combined force slightly outnumbered the one sabrino led they were on the point of gaining the upper hand when colonel broumidis careless of tactics hurled all the yaninan dragons against them and threw them into momentary confusion sabrino shouted himself hoarse then shouted into his crystal all right broumidisget out now youve done your job and more than done it i am so sorry my dear colonel but i cannot understand a word you say the yaninan answered a moment later his dragon assailed by three at once plummeted to the ground sabrino cursed loudly and foully which did no good at all his dragons and the remaining yaninans drove the lagoans and kuusamans back toward their own armyand he had the dreadful feeling that did no good either ealstan was happier when ethelhelm brought his band back to eoforwic the musician was a friend or as close to a friend as he had in the occupied forthwegian capital more than ever he wished vanai could meet the band leader but vanai couldnt come out of the flat and ethelhelm was far too prominent and easily recognized to let him visit without drawing notice did you bring back enough from your swing around the kingdom to make reckoning it up for you worth my while ealstan asked him oh aye i expect we did ethelhelm answered his flat argued that hed been bringing back plenty from all his swings around the kingdom it had so many things ealstans lacked but ealstan couldnt dwell on that for the musician was continuing but youd better not call forthweg a kingdom you know why not ealstan asked taken by surprise what else are we a province of algarve ethelhelm said and if you dont believe me you can ask the redheads forthweg had been provinces of other kingdoms before for the hundred years leading up to the six years war both algarve and unkerlant had done their best to make the forthwegians forget theyd ever been a kingdom both had failed during the chaos after the war forthweg wasted no time regaining its freedom when ealstan made a detailed suggestion about where the algarvians could put their opinion and what they could do with it once it got there ethelhelm laughed but not for long you want to be careful where you say that kind of thing you know he remarked some people would make you regret it you should talk ealstan retorted the songs you sing its a wonder mezentios men havent found a deep dark dungeon cell for you its no wonder at all the band leader answered ive paid off so bloody many of them im probably supporting a couple of regiments in unkerlant by myself he grimaced i have to stay rich if i cant keep paying the whoresons off theyll start listening to the words again oh ealstan didnt know why he sounded startled his father had paid off the algarvians too to keep them from noticing leofsig well by your books you can keep on paying them for quite a while good ethelhelm said i intend to i have to as a matter of fact he made another horrible face and ill tell you something else toonot everything they want from me is money is that so ealstan could tease ethelhelm you have a couple of redheaded women fighting over who gets to make you her pet powers above be praised im spared that ethelhelm answered with another laugh but i might enjoy myself if they were he and ealstan both laughed this time conspiratorially algarvian women had a reputation for looseness just as algarvian men had a name for corruption what people said about algarvian men turned out to be largely true which made thinking about redheaded women more intriguing but ethelhelm sobered no i wont enjoy this if i end up having to do it they want the band to perform for plegmunds brigade oh ealstan said againthis time a sound of pain and sympathy not surprise what are you going to do talk it over with the boys some more first the band leader replied its just what we want rightgiving shows for a brigade full of traitors but if its the only way we can stay out of trouble with the algarvians we may have to at not quite eighteen some things looked very clear to ealstan if you do play how are you any different from the fellows who carry sticks for king mezentio ethelhelms lips tightened i wish you hadnt asked it quite that way now that the words were out of his mouth ealstan also wished he hadnt asked it quite that way he didnt want to lose ethelhelm as a client or as a friend but he didnt want to lose his respect for him either after a pause the musician went on i dont know what to tell you about that theres some truth to it but if we dont play for the brigade the algarvians are liable to shut us up is that better he meant it seriously this time ealstan thought before he answered i dont know he said at last i just dont know we have to make some compromises with the algarvians if we want to live isnt that the sad and sorry truth the band leader agreed ealstan waved around the flat the wave encompassed thick carpets fine furnishing books paintings drums and viols and flutes the other thing you have to ask yourself is how much is all this worth to you ethelhelm gave him an odd look i never thought id see my conscience sitting in a chair talking to me what do you think ive been asking myself ever since the algarvians came to me its not an easy question why not it was easy for ealstan now ethelhelm did look exasperated why not ill tell you why not because ive worked a long long time and ive worked really hard all that time to get where i am and now i have to throw it away by making the redheads angry thats why its not easy ealstan hadnt spent a long time working toward anything the only thing he had that he couldnt bear to give up was vanai and hed already given up everything else for her he got to his feet i think id better go aye i think maybe youd better ethelhelm replied i havent told them we would yet you know i just havent told them we wouldnt either with a nod ealstan left as usual he noted the stairwell didnt stink of cabbage or of anything worse as much as all the fine furnishings in ethelhelms flat that reminded him of what the band leader had to lose heat smote when he left the block of flats summer in eoforwic like summer in most of forthweg was the savage season of the year the sun beating down from high high in the sky tempers could fray his almost had and so had ethelhelms he sighed seeing himself in ethelhelms place listening to himself telling the algarvians they had no business raising plegmunds brigade let alone expecting him to play for it but he was his fathers son too after a moment he laughed at himself easy enough for a man with nothing to lose ethelhelm had rather more than that ealstan had already known as much this whole block of flats told him as much ethelhelm didnt want to lose it either ealstan hadnt known that but he did now he wondered how the bandleader would get around it and if ethelhelm could for ethelhelms sake and his own he hoped so he passed a recruiting broadsheet for plegmunds brigade and another and another the algarvians made sure there were plenty about had sidroc finally joined it as hed kept saying he would or had he found better sense somewhere for his cousins sake ealstan hoped that last was true he walked by another one of those ubiquitous broadsheets this one though had algarves dogs scrawled across it in bold strokes of charcoal seeing that made ealstan smile in spite of plegmunds brigade not all or even most of his countrymen had any use for their occupiers he saw several more defaced broadsheets on his way back toward his own block of flats they all had different slogans on them either theyd been written by different hands or by one fellow with a lot on his mind one of the slogans read stop killing kaunians ealstan almost burst into tears when he spied it he sometimes wondered if he were the only forthwegian who cared being reminded he wasnt felt good a forthwegian dashed round a corner and ran toward and then past him with what looked like a womans leather handbag pressed to his side and so it was a moment later a couple of algarvian constables whistles shrilling rounded that same corner in hot pursuit they pointed at the fleeing forthwegian and shouted stopping thief no one on the crowded street showed the least interest in stopping the thief cursing sweating the algarvians pounded after him they didnt get far before somebody stuck out a leg and tripped the one who was in front his partner fell over him both of them howled they got up with filthy tunics and with bleeding elbows and kneesthe kilts they wore made their scrapes worse by leaving knees bare each of them yanked his bludgeon off his belt and started belaboring the forthwegian they thought had tripped them after he went down with a groan the algarvians started beating all the forthwegians they could reach one of them swung at ealstan but missed and then a forthwegian leaped on one of the constables the other algarvian dropped his bludgeon grabbed for his stick and blazed the forthwegian the fellow let out a shriek that echoed through the street the redhead hed jumped scrambled to his feet a rockprobably a priedup cobblestonewhizzed past the algarvians heads an instant later another rock caught one of them in the ribs they both started blazing then blazing and shouting for help at the top of their lungs ealstan had no idea whether any help for them was close by he didnt wait around to find out either especially not after a beam zipped past his head and burned a scorched smoking hole in the wooden front of the leathergoods shop by which he was standing forthwegians fell screaming and thrashing but more rocks flew too along with curses one of the algarvians went down when a stone caught him in front of the ear his comrade stood over him still blazing then someone tackled the standing constable from behind baying like wolves the mob swarmed over both redheads ealstan cheered to see them go down but he didnt linger to help stomp them to death he hadnt seen a riot in eoforwic but the stories hed heard about the one that had happened not long before vanai and he came to the city made him want to get away rather than join in his own countrymen would have things all their own way for a little while but then the algarvians would gather enough men to restore orderand they wouldnt much care whom they killed while they were doing it either breaking glass announced that the forthwegians were starting to plunder the shops along the street ealstan stepped up his pace hoping to put as much distance between himself and trouble as he could he didnt like to think about forthwegians robbing other forthwegians but hed heard stories about that too he hadnt believed all of them now he realized he might also have been wrong about that hed just turned onto his own street when a couple of squads of algarvian constables tramped up it every one of them looking as grim as any soldiers hed ever seen the redheads carried infantrystyle sticks not the shorter less powerful weapons they usually used their eyes swung toward him in frightening unison he shrank away from them he couldnt help himself had he given them the least excuse they would have blazed him and he knew it when he got up to his flat vanai exclaimed powers above whats going on out there riot he answered succinctly for once you can be glad youre holed up in here im going to stay right here too till things quiet down or till i have to go out for food only after the words were out of his mouth did he realize that sounded less than heroic after listening to himself again he decided he didnt care bembo and oraste paced along the edge of the district into which gromheorts kaunians and those from the surrounding countryside had been crowded as long as the blonds stayed inside the district everything was fine when they didnt the algarvian constables had to make them regret it supposed to be a tough time over in that eoforwic place bembo remarked for a couple of days there i was wondering if they were going to stick us on a caravan and send us over there to help put out the fire with a shrug his partner answered wouldnt matter to me if the kaunians get out of line we kick them around if the forthwegians get out of line we kick them around too you hate everybody dont you bembo meant the question sardonically but it came out sounding half admiring im a fornicating constable oraste answered its my fornicating job to hate everybody back in tricarico i hated algarvians i can still think of some algarvians i hate matter of fact bembo hoped oraste was talking about sergeant pesaro he didnt ask though had orastes disdain been aimed at him the other constable wouldnt have hesitated to tell him so instead bembo said how are we supposed to win the war if the places weve conquered keep giving us trouble his partner shrugged again we kill enough of those whoresons who think theyre so cursed smart the rest will get the idea pretty stinking quick one thing about dead men they hardly ever talk back to you a live man a scrawny kaunian with a leather apron over his tunic and trousers came out of his shop and beckoned to the constables bembo and oraste looked at each other when a kaunian actually wanted something to do with them something fishy was liable to be going on what is it bembo growled in his own language if the blond didnt speak algarvian the powers below were welcome to him but the kaunian did and pretty well too can you gentlemen please help me with a quarrel i am having with my neighbor an unpleasant light blazed in orastes eyes bembo understood what it meant the kaunian shopkeeper perhaps luckily for him didnt if oraste decided this fellow was rightor if he could payhis neighbor would regret it if the neighbor had a better caseor more silverthis blond would rue the day he was born either way oraste would end up happy whats he doing to you bembo asked or what does he think youre doing to him the shopkeeper started to explain a moment later another kaunian popped out of the shop next door and started screaming at him this fellows algarvian was worse than the first mans but he made up in excitement what he lacked in grammar bembo smiled to listen to him even if he didnt talk any too well in a way he sounded very algarvian indeed before long both kaunians were dropping broad hints about what they would do if only things were decided in their favor bembo smiled some more this was shaping up as a profitable afternoon and then just when the excitable blond was about to make a real offer oraste gave bembo a shot in the ribs with his elbow the other constable pointed look at that old bugger if hes not sneaking back after he was out when he wasnt supposed to be what is he doing sure enough the silverhaired kaunian was trying to edge past the constables and the argument and go deeper into the part of town where he was allowed to be since bembo and oraste were only paces inside the edge of that district the kaunian had to be coming from outside it a schoolmasters logic couldnt have cut more sharply hold up there pal bembo called to the man who turned back to him with surprise and alarm on his face a moment later bembo was surprised too surprised that he recognized the fellow its that old son of a whore from oyngestun he said to oraste well kiss my arse if youre not right oraste said i knew he was mouthy i didnt know he was sneaky too bembo advanced on the kaunian so did oraste behind them the two shopkeepers both exclaimed the constables ignored them all right pal bembo said what were you doing sliding through the parts of gromheort where youre not supposed to go i was looking for word of my granddaughter the kaunian answered in his slow precise algarvian i am concerned for her safety oraste laughed shes a kaunian right same as you are none of your buggers are safe you sure arent safe old man he pulled his bludgeon off his belt and twirled it by its leather thong the scar where bembo had struck the kaunian on the road from oyngestun to gromheort was still bright pink if he needed another lesson oraste looked eager to arrange it the kaunian licked his lips he saw what was on orastes face too one of his hands slid into a trouser pocket coins jingled he said you never really saw me outside this quarter did you i dont know bembo answered i havent decided yet although the kaunian had proved pretty dense before he had no trouble figuring out what that meant he gave bembo and oraste enough silver to make them decide they hadnt seen him sneaking back after all and then showing he really could learn he got out of there in a hurry to keep the constables from beating him even after hed paid them they turned back to the two kaunian shopkeepers only to discover the blonds had made up their quarrel oraste hefted his bludgeon i ought to bloody both of you for wasting our time he growled both the shopkeepers started jingling coins bembo a mild enough sort most of the time wouldnt have got so much out of them they were however plainly scared to death of orasteand they couldnt very well bribe him without bribing bembo too the plump constables belt pouch grew full and nicely rounded that wasnt so bad he said as he and oraste returned to their beat behind them the two kaunians started shouting at each other again bembo still had a miserable time following their language but he thought the excitable one was berating the other for calling the constables oraste spat on the cobblestones oh aye its some silver he said but what can we spend silver on not much not in this rathole of a town id sooner have broken some heads you can always spend money in a tavern bembo said if you feel like it you can break heads in a tavern too its not the same oraste said breaking heads in a tavern is just brawling if i do it on the job i get paid for it bembo had known a fair number of constables with that attitude but few so open about it as oraste preferring bribes to brawls bembo said therell be other chances the way weve stuffed all these kaunians into this little tiny stretch of town theyre going to be at each others throats all the time so well get plenty to do oraste looked down a cross street toward the heart of the kaunian district in gromheort the blonds had set up a market along both sides of the street which was too narrow to begin with bembo wondered what they sold one another none of them could have had very much aye they are packed pretty tight oraste allowed i just hope theres no pestilence that starts going through em why bembo said in some surprise his partner usually showed no concern whatever for kaunians because the pestilence might spread to us you mean oh that too oraste said though he didnt seem to have thought of it himself but what i mostly meant is a pestilence would kill off the lousy blonds before we got the chance to use their life energy against the unkerlanters or wherever else we need it oh bembo said thats true and so it was even if his stomach did a slow flipflop every time he thought about it i wish we could have beaten king swemmel without using magic like that so do i on account of it would have been easier on us oraste said but the more kaunians we get rid of the better off everybodyll be after we finally win the war theyve been stepping on our faces for too long now its our turn bembo couldnt disagree not out loud oraste would have thought him a slacker or worse a closet kaunianlover he wasnt he had no use for the blonds he hadnt back in tricarico and he didnt here in gromheort either but he was too easygoing to enjoy massacre a couple of other constables came out of the district in the company of six or eight young kaunian women half the women looked sullen and bitter the other half anywhere from resigned to happy where are you taking them bembo called recruits for a soldiers brothel one of his countrymen answered he turned back to the women saying dont any of you worry about a thing by the powers above youll have plenty to eat and thats no lie got to keep you good and plump to give the boys somewhere nice to lay down one of the women translated for the others a couple of them the skinnier ones nodded after the little procession was out of earshot bembo turned to oraste and asked how long do you suppose theyll last in a soldiers brothel couplethree weeks oraste replied they wear em out they use em up and then they bring in some fresh meat thats how it goes about what i thought bembo looked after the blondes he sighed and shrugged they dont know what theyre getting into poor dears like a lot of algarvians he was sentimental about women even kaunian women oraste wasnt maybe they dont know what theyre getting into but i bet theyve got a pretty good notion of whatll be getting into them he threw back his head and guffawed thats not bad bembo said and coming from oraste it wasnt the constables walked on for a few paces then bembo stroked his chin i wonder why that old kaunian from oyngestun thought his granddaughter was somewhere outside the kaunian quarter who cares oraste answered which threatened to kill off conversation altogether but he went on she ran off remember thats what the old geezer told us anyhow maybe some forthwegians hiding her here in town and taking it out in trade his leer was lewd filthy aye that could be bembo admitted however crude oraste was he had a good notion of how people worked she was prettier than most of these forthwegian women anyhow theyre built like bricks that was unchivalrous but from what bembo had seen pretty much true he didnt think about how he was built still crude but very practical oraste said well if we catch her we can get some of that for ourselves he rocked his hips forward and back bembos nod held nothing but eager agreement even before leofsig knocked on his own front door he knew something had gone wrong he heard shouts from inside the house as he hadnt since sidroc went off to join plegmunds brigade no sooner had he knocked than he stiffened one of those raised voices belonged to his cousin he must have got leave leofsig thought and sure enough when the door swung open there stood sidroc big as life hullo he said good to see you again hello yourself leofsig answered and let it go at that when he and sidroc clasped hands it quickly turned into a trial of strength after a while they both gave up with honors about even sidroc grinned even a few months before his grip wouldnt have been a match for leofsigs not caring to acknowledge that leofsig asked how long will you be here three days sidroc said leofsig decided he could probably stand that his cousin went on then its back to the encampment outside of eoforwic a little while longer then advanced training somewhere elsethey havent told me where yet leofsig didnt much care where sidroc went so long as he went let me by will you ive been working all day in the hot sun and i want to wash i know that feeling by the powers above sidroc said he hadnt known it before he left then his main goal had been avoiding as much work as he possibly could but he didnt step aside they treat us pretty well though we even had ethelhelm and his band come out and play for us the other day did you leofsigs opinion of ethelhelm dropped a notch or two this time instead of asking he pushed past his cousin and into the entry hall sidroc gave him a dirty look but closed the door after him only as leofsig stepped into the kitchen did he belatedly realize sidroc was liable to be a very nasty customer in a fight in the kitchen conberge was chopping leeks and throwing them into the pot over the fire mutton stew leofsigs nose told him without the slightest effort to keep her voice down his sister said well he wont be staying here very long powers above be praised as far as im concerned if the algarvians want him so much they can have him sidroc could hardly miss hearing what she said the nextdoor neighbors could hardly miss hearing what she said leofsig turned back toward the entry hall he wondered if he would find out just how nasty a customer his cousin could be but sidroc to his relief and even more to his surprise stayed out of the kitchen can i clean up a bit leofsig asked conberge pointed to a kettle next to the pot to which shed just added the leeks hot waters right there waiting for you she said she looked past him toward the entry hall pointedly she added some stinks dont go away no matter how you wash let him be leofsig said his sisters eyebrows flew up he went on you said it yourself hell be gone soon if we can stay civil for three days that will be the end of it how can there be an end with a traitor in the family conberge demanded leofsig had no good answer for that he got out of having to make one by starting to wash his sister left the kitchen but left it with her nose in the air he cleaned up as quickly as he could and went back to his own bedchamber to put on a fresh tunic in place of the dirty sweaty one he was wearing hed just changed when someone rapped lightly on the door come in he called and his father did leofsig nodded i thought that was you everyone else knocks louder to make sure i notice hestans smile quirked up only one corner of his mouth sometimes difference is enough to make you notice something things dont always have to be louder softer often serves just as well maybe leofsig said after a moment he went on i wish you could convince sidroc of that his father sighed hengist is still living here and apart from him were the nearest kin sidroc has left when he got leave where else would he go to suck up to his redheaded pals leofsig suggested i dont know why he loves them so muchif it werent for them his mother would still be alive and his house would still be standingbut he does as far as im concerned they can have him hestan sighed again i cant very well slam the door in his face not with hengist living here and i dont want to turn my brother out that might be dangerous you know why on account of me leofsig said thats right his father nodded and so well put up with my charming nephew as best we can for as long as hes here its only three days i think we can manage aye he told me he had to go back then leofsig said then the algarvians teach him more about murdering kaunians or terrorizing unkerlanters or whatever they intend to do with plegmunds cursed brigade the king would sit up in his grave if he knew what the redheads were doing to his name i wont say youre wrong because i think youre right hestan answered but having sidroc off in the west somewhere far far away wont be the worst thing in the world for us no matter what he ends up doing here he cocked his head to one side and waited to see how leofsig would respond to that seeing his father eyeing him made leofsig think before he spoke no matter what happens to him there you mean he said slowly also slowly hestan smiled hauling rocks hasnt taken your wits away anyhow the algarvians wouldnt be recruiting forthwegian soldiers if they didnt intend to throw them into the fire and the fires in unkerlant burn hotter than they do anywhere else from the kitchen came elfryths call suppers ready leofsig grinned at his father the fires in unkerlant burn hotter than anywhere else except under the supper kettle i hadnt thought of it that way but youre right hestan answered and a good thing too says i come on they headed for the dining room together when they got there uncle hengist did what hed started doing again this summer he waved a news sheet at hestan here did you see he asked the algarvians are driving everything before them down in the south sounding as cheerful as if he were discussing a football match he talked about soldiers and behemoths captured soldiers and behemoths slain provinces seized and towns afire from eggs dropped on them from on high beside hengist sidroc sat listening to the recital with a broad grin as hestan and leofsig sat down neither of them said anything that seemed to irk sidroc who growled no stopping the algarvians theyll smash unkerlant to powder if they were having everything their own way why would they need plegmunds brigade leofsig asked sidroc didnt answer him not in words but his scowl was eloquent leofsig smiled back as nastily as he could like most forthwegians sidroc was swarthy but an angry flush darkened his cheeks above the edge of his beard even so leofsigs grin got wider and more provoking yet before anything could come of that conberge and elfryth brought in olives and bread and olive oil for dipping to start the supper no matter how much leofsig enjoyed baiting his cousin he enjoyed eating more a day on the roads always left him feeling empty he noticed that sidroc displayed the same sort of wolfish appetite and wondered how hard the algarvians were working him in the encampment theyd set up both young men also dug into the mutton stew there wasnt quite so much mutton in it as leofsig would have liked times were hard his mother and sister had stretched the stew with beans and turnips and parsnips after two big bowls he sopped up gravy with a thick slice of bread cut from the loaf he drank three cups of wine too he still had plenty of room for cheese and candied fruit afterwards he could have eaten more than he got but his belly had stopped snarling at him enjoy it while you can he said to sidroc when you head for unkerlant youll be lucky if you get barley mush well do fine sidroc retorted if theres any food at all well take it thats what being a soldier is all about thats what being a thief is all about leofsig said ignoring his fathers warning look and if they send you down south youll find out all about snow the same way they did last winter good luck stealing when everythings frozen up this time hestan did more than send a warning look his tone sharper that usual he said leofsig what were we talking about before supper sidrocs father dwells here and sidroc himself is a welcome guest aye father leofsig answered but his face betrayed himit showed exactly how welcome he thought sidroc was seeing that sidroc half rose from his chair breathing hard he said i know you all hate me do you know what i dont care do you know what else every stinking one of you can kiss my arse son uncle hengist began sidroc cut him off aye you too father you were screaming at me to stay out of the brigade as loud as anybody else and you were wrong you hear me wrong his voice rose to a roar best lot of mates ive ever found so you can kiss my arse too just like them just like me sidroc leofsig got up walked round the table and kissed his cousin gently on the lips there for a moment sidroc simply stared he wasnt too bright but then with a bellow of rage he realized what leofsig had done he swung on leofsig without any shift in his eyes to warn what he was going to dosure enough the algarvians had taught him a thing or two leofsig saw stars he reeled backwards fetching up against the table sidroc swarmed after him fists flailing from furious his cousins face had gone deadly cold hell kill me if he can leofsig realized he threw a punch at sidroc but his cousin blocked it with a forearm his father and uncle hengist were brawling too but he could pay them no heedhe was indeed fighting for his life conberge screamed curses as vile as any leofsig had ever heard in the army but sidroc flung her back onto her mother when she rushed at him conberge and elfryth went down in a heap leofsig grabbed a bowl and hurled it at sidroc he missed the bowl shattered against the wall sidroc kicked leofsig leofsig kicked too trying to put sidroc out of the fight with a wellaimed foot but sidroc twisted quicker and smoother than leofsig remembered him being and took the kick on the hip not between the legs panic surged in leofsig what can i do he reached for the bread knife at the same moment sidroc grabbed one of the chairs he swung it as if it weighed nothing at all his first swipe knocked the bread knife flying from leofsigs hand the next caught leofsig in the side of the head he sagged to the floor ihave to get up he thought but his body didnt want to hear him ihave to sidroc hit him again the lamps seemed to flare red then guttered toward blackness he never felt any of the blows that landed after thator anything else ever again five vanai heard what she thought were ealstans familiar footfalls coming up the hall toward their flat but when the knock on the door came it was several harsh bangs not the coded raps ealstan always used ice shot up vanais back had someone betrayed ealstan to the redheads had someone betrayed her heart thudding she waited for the harsh cry kaunian come forth she wondered if she would do better to come forth or to go out the window headfirst it would be over in a hurry then and it wouldnt hurt much who could guess what the algarvians did to kaunians in their labor camps before they finally slew them but while vanai was wondering the knock came againthe right knock this time cautiously she approached the door who is it she asked in a low voice its me ealstan answered let me in it was unquestionably ealstan but he didnt sound right were a couple of algarvians standing behind him in the hall one maybe holding a stick to his head what disaster would descend on her if she opened the door she didnt know but she knew ealstan wouldnt have left her to face disaster alone that decided her she unbarred the door and pulled it open ealstan stood there alone breath whooshed out of vanai in a long sigh of relief then she saw the look on his face she gasped as involuntarily as shed sighed what is it she demanded ealstan didnt answer he didnt move either she had to grab him by the arm and tug him into the flat and then tug him again so she could close the door once shed barred it she spun round to face him what is it she repeated ealstan still didnt answer not with words instead he thrust a sheet of paper at her she hadnt even noticed he was holding it of themselves her eyes went down to it the forthwegian script was exceptionally clear but she hadnt read more than a couple of lines before it seemed to blur your brother she whispered aye my brother dead the phrases jerked from ealstan one by one as if from a clockwork toy that was running down but then unlike such a toy ealstan somehow found the energy to say more my stinking cousin killed him beat him to death the way youd beat youd beat i dont know what tears started running down his cheeks and into his beard vanai didnt think he knew he was crying she made herself keep reading the letter ealstans father had sent they didnt do anything to him she said in disbelief they didnt do anything to him at all to sidroc you mean ealstan asked and vanai foolishly nodded as if she might have meant someone else ealstan went on why should they do anything to him leofsig was just a forthwegian and sidrocs in plegmunds brigade theyll probably pin a medal on him for it didnt you tell me plegmunds brigade was training outside of eoforwic vanai answered her own question of course you did that singer you like went out with his band and performed for them ethelhelm ealstan sounded amazed hed come up with anything so mundane as the musicians name aye the brigade is hereor some of its here some of its gone off to train somewhere else i found out about that from him but wont the soldiers do something to your cousin vanai was faltering and she knew it they cant want somebody whos nothing but a murderer can they what do you think soldiers are ealstan answered bleakly especially soldiers who fight for king mezentio but it doesnt matter anyhow look at the date on the letter vanai hadnt now she did thatsthree weeks ago she said and it just got here now another foolish question ealstan fortunately took it as a matter of course he said aye what do the algarvians care about how the post runs in forthweg or even if the post runs in forthweg were lucky it got here at all if you call that luck but youre right or i hope youre righti want to go out and see if i can get the algarvians to do something about sidroc if hes still here i mean hes liable not to be dont do that vanai exclaimed huh why not ealstan asked as if he intended heading for the encampment of plegmunds brigade that very moment shock had to have dulled his wits patiently vanai answered because you still might be wanted in gromheort thats why do you plan to show up there and have them arrest you oh ealstan sounded astonished no that hadnt crossed his mind at all when it did he nodded youre right curse it well he might not even be there powers above i hope hes not there i hope he goes out and the unkerlanters kill him first thing i wish i could do it myself i wish i had done it back there in gromheort a million sidrocs arent worth one of my brother im sorry vanai went to him and held him they clung to each other for a while vanai hoped that did ealstan some good she doubted it would do much but maybe if he thought she thought he felt better he really would feel a little better she shook her head she wasnt used to needing such convoluted thoughts oh ealstan said again this time as if remembering something theres a piece of the letter right at the end thats meant for you there is vanai hadnt read the whole thing the crushing bad news that headed it had been enough now she pulled back so she could look at the rest sure enough ealstans father wrote your friends grandfather has been asking after her we have said that so far as we know she is well we shall say nothing more without your leave and hers vanai said i dont want him knowing any more than that i dont even want him knowing that much but it cant be helped dont worry ealstan told her my father knows how to keep his mouth shuta bookkeeper has to and my mother and sister wont blab either thinking about her kept him from thinking about the rest of the newsbut only for a moment then his face crumpled for he went on leofsig wont say anything leofsig cacacant say anything not any more he cant he started to weep again vanai went into the kitchen took down a bottle of spirits and poured a full glass for ealstan and half a glass for herself here she said handing him his drink this he knocked it back as if it were so much water vanai blinked he didnt usually drink like that she sipped her own letting the spirits slide hot down her throat when ealstan spoke his voice held an eerie calm maybe ethelhelm can find out for me whether sidroc is still in the camp near here if he is what could you do vanai asked she held up her hand palm out as if to stop him from doing whatever he was thinking and she feared she knew what that was as if to a child she said once more youre not going out there yourself all right he said so readily that she looked at him in surprise and sharp suspicion but he went on im a bookkeeper too remember if you read the romances bookkeepers dont do their own dirty work they hire somebody else to do it for them he plucked at his beard i wonder if ive got enough to have a man killed maybe ethelhelm would know he still spoke very clearly the spirits certainly werent affecting him much are you sure you want to ask him vanai could feel what shed drunk which was a good deal less than what ealstan had put down she had to form her words with care he did go out and play for the brigade remember aye thats so ealstan said unhappily dont know who i can trust any more dont know if i can trust anybody any more he sounded on the edge of tears again that might have been the spirits working in him but it might have been simple grief too you can trust me vanai set down her glass and took his hands in hers and i can trust you youre the only person in the world i can trust i think you have your family anyhow whats left of it ealstan said and vanai bit her lip but then he nodded aye i know i can trust you sweetheart this time he reached for her he didnt use endearments very often which made them all the more welcome when they came if hed wanted to take her back to the bedchamber to lose himself in her flesh for a little while she would gladly have given herself to him but he didnt he held her then let her go can you eat she asked and he nodded she went back to the kitchen ill fix something bread and olives and cheese and salt fish in oil werent very exciting but they filled the belly ealstan methodically ate whatever vanai set before him but gave no sign of noticing what it was she might have fed him earth and ashes and sawdust and he would have disposed of those the same way she gave him more spirits too again they could have been water by the way he drank them and for all the effect they had on him after hed finished eating he said i wish i could have been there for the memorial service i cant believe its doneitll be a long time done now curse the miserable slow post had he been able to go to the memorial service he would have gone without vanai she couldnt go out on the streets without fear now let alone step into a caravan car but ealstan wasnt even thinking about her the only person on his mind was poor dead leofsig she couldnt blame him for thinking of his blood kin first she kept telling herself that hed known them all his life and her really only a few months but she wished he would have shown a few more signs of recalling what her special problems were and she cursed the useless worthless hopelifting heartbreaking author of you too can be a mage had he really known what he was doing she could have made herself look like a forthwegian instead of turning ealstan into a counterfeit kaunian she wondered if her curse would bite she hoped so she had been able to work some sorcery even if it hadnt turned out the way she wished do you want anything else she asked ealstan he shook his head she got up and carried the few plates to the sink washing them took only a handful of minutes when she turned back to ealstan she found him slumped down onto the table asleep his head in his hands she shook him but got only a snore she shook him again and roused him to a sludgy semiconsciousness but nothing more all the spirits had caught up with him at once half supporting him she got him into the bedchamber it wasnt easy she was as tall as he but not much more than half as wide and when he landed on the bed he sprawled diagonally across it still wearing his shoes that left no room at all for her she thought about rearranging him but decided not to bother instead she took her own pillow and curled up on the sofa it was cramped but on a warm night she didnt need a blanket after a while she fell asleep her back creaked when she got up at sunrise the next morning ealstan she discovered had scarcely moved she didnt have the heart to wake him she didnt think he would be very happy with the world when he did wake up and not only because he would have to remember his brother had died shed seen plenty of drunken forthwegiansand more to the point hungover forthwegiansin oyngestun she knew what to expect she poured out a cup of wine it wouldnt stop the pain but might ease it a little presently she heard a groan from the bedchamber treading as softly as she could she carried the wine in to ealstan walking through skrunda talsu felt like a man whod been interrupted in the middle of something important the whole town had been interrupted in the middle of something important the townsfolk had been on the point of a major uprising against the algarvian occupiers when dragons from lagoan or kuusaman ships dropped enough eggs on skrunda to confuse a lot of people about who the true enemy was talsu wasnt confused with that big scar on his flank he would never be confused were the algarvians not occupying jelgava their enemies wouldnt have needed to drop eggs on skrunda that seemed plain enough to him he couldnt understand why some of the townsfolk had trouble seeing it jelgavans cleared debris from ruined houses and shops the algarvians made the news sheets trumpet their labors if talsu heard one more hawker shouting about air pirates he thought he would deck the luckless fellow he wanted to shout himself shout that the news sheets were full of tricks when they werent full of lies but he didnt and he didnt deck any of the vendors either back when hed fought in the jelgavan armyand back before that too back to the days when he was a childhed feared king donalitus dungeons as had any of his countrymen who presumed to criticize the king and the upper nobility had the algarvians opened all the dungeons freed all the captives and taken no more king mainardo might have won a goodsized following redhead though he was they had freed some of king donalitus captives but in mainardos name theyd taken many more and algarvian torturers enjoyed a reputation about as black as that of the men whod served donalitu before he fled silence then remained the safest course going back into the family tailors shop made talsu sigh in relief here if anywhere he could breathe free his father looked up from a cloak he was sewingfor once for a jelgavan customer not for one of the occupiers did you get those hinges i wanted traku asked talsu shook his head i went to all three ironmongers in town and they all say theyre not to be had for love nor money not in iron and not in brass either the algarvians are taking all the metal they can out of the kingdom before long were liable to have trouble getting needles traku looked unhappy your mothers been after me to fix those cabinets for weeks now im finally getting around to doing it and i cant get what i need for the job she wont be very happy to hear that you cant very well put the hinges on if you cant get them now can you talsu gave his father a conspiratorial wink well thats true traku brightened but not for long shell say i could have gotten em if id gone out and done it right away instead of sitting around on my rump all day long he managed to sound a lot like his wifeenough so to land him in trouble if shed heard him theyre talking about tin or maybe pewter talsu said his father made a face not very strong either one of em and who says the algarvians wont start stealing tin too and leave us with nothing but lead nobody talsu answered i wouldnt put anything past em theyd steal anything that wasnt nailed down and now theyre stealing the nails too traku said he laughed talsu grimaced annoyed he hadnt thought of the joke himself before he had the chance to try to top it the door swung open and the bell above it jangled in came an algarvian officer swaggering as mezentios subjects had a way of doing talsu had practice changing his tone on the spur of the moment good day sir he said to the redhead how may we serve you today that was what the occupiers wanted to have the people theyd conquered serve them when the algarvian answered it was in classical kaunian talsu and his father exchanged looks of alarm talsu remembered scant bits of the old language from his school days not that hed had many of those traku further removed and with even less formal schooling knew only a handful of words do you speak jelgavan at all sir talsu asked no the redhead answeredin the classical tongue talsu flogged his memory and essayed a few words of classical kaunian himself talk slow then aye i shall talk slowly the algarvian said and then proceeded to start talking too fast talsu and traku both waved their hands in something approaching despair how dreadful to lose a sale because a foreign soldier spoke the grandfather to their language when they had so little of it themselves for a wonder the algarvian understood the problem here is this slow enough aye talsu said think so he paused again to think wantwhat kilts the officer answered he patted the kilt he was wearing in case talsu didnt get the idea two kilts numbers hadnt changed much the algarvian showed two with his fingers anyhow instead of thumb and forefinger he used forefinger and middle finger to talsu that made him seem to give an obscene gesture after talsu translated for his fatherwhich he probably didnt need to dotraku nodded aye i can make em he said find out when he wants em though thats the other thing ive got to know ill try talsu answered he looked hopefully at the algarvian but the fellow couldnt have understood a word of jelgavan talsu couldnt come up with the classical kaunian word for when either he kicked at the floorboards in frustration but then he had a good idea instead of fumbling around for a word he couldnt find he pointed to a calendar hanging on the wall behind his father ah the algarvian said and then a spate of the classical tongue too fast for talsu to follow but he was nodding and smiling so he must have understood what talsu meant to prove he did he went over and touched the days date on the calendar then he touched one two weeks hence having done so he looked a question toward talsu and traku talsu thought the date looked reasonable but traku was the man who had to decide aye he said and then as long as the price is right hed been talking as much to his son as to the algarvian now he turned toward the algarvian and named a price he thought right the algarvian affected not to understand king mezentios men always overacted in a dicker though traku must have sensed the same thing talsu did he found a pencil and a scrap of paper wrote out the price and gave it to the algarvian no the fellow said againthe word remained similar to what it had been in the days of the kaunian empire he had a pencil of his own in the breast pocket of his tunic he scratched out the figure traku had written and substituted one half as large traku shook his head to emphasize the point he crumpled up the piece of paper and tossed it into the trash can he picked up the cloak hed been working on and got back to it good day talsu told the algarvian he would have enjoyed telling him some other things too but didnt know the words for those in classical kaunian with an exasperated sniff the redhead opened his belt pouch and took out a sheet of paper of his own he wrote another price this one higher traku looked at it shook his head and kept on sewing the algarvian thrust the paper and pencil at him as if doing the fellow a great favor traku wrote a slightly lower price than the one hed first proposed haggling with paper and pencil father talsu said ive never seen the like neither have i but i wont worry about it if i can get the deal i want traku said if i cant ill just keep on doing what im doing here he spoke slowly and distinctly in case the algarvian knew more jelgavan than he let on pantomime and scribbles took the place of the shouts and insults that often went into a hot dicker the algarvian could have taken his act to the stage and made more money than king mezentio was likely to be paying him by his agonized grimaces traku might have been cutting off his fingers one at a time with pinking shears trakus style was more restrained but he didnt bend much they finally settled on a price closer to his first one than to the redheads counteroffer half now half on delivery traku said and talsu had to try to get that across to the algarvian as the fellow had before he did a good game job of not understanding at last looking as if he were biting down hard on a lemon he paid only then did talsu take out a tape measure and note down his waist size and the length of his kilt after the measurements were done the algarvian bowed and left well make some silver off him traku said aye talsu agreed you fought him hard there i wish i could have done it with a stick in my hand his father answered having been too young to fight in the six years war and too old to be called out with talsu traku imagined army life as being more exciting than the terrorpunctuated boredom talsu had known as a soldier it wouldnt have made much difference talsu told him which was undoubtedly true after a moment he went on doesnt seem right listening to one of mezentios whoresons spouting the old language when we cant hardly speak it ourselves thats a fact his father said im cursed if i know what we can do about it though i couldnt stay in school i had to buckle down and make a living and it worked out the same way for you and if anybody thinks i miss school hes daft talsu said still and all if the algarvians can speak classical kaunian theres got to be something to it wouldnt you say otherwise they wouldnt have it in their schools who knows what the redheads would do traku said but talsu wouldnt be pushed off his ley line not even by scorn for the algarvians and theyre wrecking all the monuments from the kaunian empire too he persisted they know classical kaunian and they dont want us to know anything about the old days what does that say to you says we used to be on top and they dont want us knowing about it now that were on the bottom traku answered talsu nodded thats what it says to me too and if they dont want me to know it seems like i ought to doesnt it thered be people in town who could teach me the old language without putting stripes on my back if i did a verb wrong i bet his father gave him an odd look i thought you were the one who just said he didnt miss school it wouldnt be school exactly talsu said you go to school because you have to and they make you do things whether you want to or not this would be different if you say so traku sounded anything but convinced but talsu answered i do say so and do you know what else id bet plenty im not the only one who thinks the same way either traku went back to work on the cloak once more no keeping the past alive didnt matter that much to him it hadnt mattered to talsu either not till the algarvian showed greater knowledge of an important part of that past than he had himself and if other people in skrunda felt the same way talsu didnt know what would happen then finding out might be interesting as krasta was in the habit of doing she made her way through the algarvianoccupied west wing of her mansion toward colonel lurcanios office she ignored the admiring looks the redheads gave her as she walked past them no she didnt ignore those looks though she affected to had the clerks and soldiers not glanced up as she went past she would have been offended lurcanios new aide captain gradasso rose bowed and spoke in classical kaunian my lady i am sorry but the colonel has given me specific orders to the effect that he is not to be disturbed krasta could be devious especially where her own advantage was concerned i dont understand a word youre saying she replied in valmieran that wasnt quite true but gradasso would have had a hard time proving it gradasso for that matter would have had a hard time understanding the modern language krasta strode past him and into lurcanios office her algarvian lover stared up from the papers strewn across his desk i dont care to see you right now he said didnt gradasso tell you as much who knows what gradasso says krasta replied the old language is more trouble than its worth if anyone wants to know what i think why would anyone want to know that lurcanio sounded genuinely curious why dont you care to see me now intent on her own thoughts krasta paid no attention to his why lurcanio echoed because my rather dear i have been far too busy and i will be for quite some time doing what krasta demanded if it didnt have to do with her how could it possibly be important running enemies of my kingdom to earth lurcanio answered his tone reminded her why she feared him still she tossed her head as if deliberately tossing aside the fear why do you need to waste your time doing things like that she asked valmiera is yours after all dont you have more important things to worry about shouldnt you be worrying about me was what she meant by the way lurcanio raised an eyebrow he understood her perfectly well my sweet nothing in valmiera is more important to me than the triumph of my kingdom he told her nothing do you follow that or shall i draw you a diagram krasta glared i dont know why i put up with you no one requires you to do any such thing lurcanio said if i do not please you go find someone else and i will do the same it shouldnt be that hard for either one of us she kept on glaring harder than ever as no valmieran lover had ever done lurcanio used indifference as shield and weapon both he knew he could find another lover without much trouble plenty of valmieran women were looking to form connections with the occupiers if krasta went looking for another algarvian she would have to compete with all of them was she likely to find one as well placed as lurcanio she didnt think so was she likely to find one as irksome she doubted that too but it counted for less than the other curse you you infuriating man she snarled colonel lurcanio bowed in his seat infuriating her still more you are welcome to try he said i doubt you will have much luck and now please leave i will talk to you more later but that can keep my work cannot curse you krasta said againthis time in fact she shrieked it she spun on her heel and stomped out slamming the door behind her as she went captain gradasso stared at her she made a suggestion she couldnt possibly have translated into classical kaunian gradasso might not have understood it but he did realize it was no compliment that sufficed krasta stalked through the algarvian functionaries she made similar incandescent suggestions to the ones who presumed to look at her some of them did speak valmieran and some of those made suggestions of their own by the time krasta got back to her own wing of the mansion she was in a perfect transport of temper she thought about tormenting bauska but that was too easy to give her much satisfaction she thought about going out to the avenue of equestrians to wander from shop to shop but that would make her rage go away she didnt want it to go away she wanted to savor it as she would have savored a fine ale and she wanted to do something with it she wanted to hit back at lurcanio who had provoked it in the first place with that in mind she paused somewhere she didnt usually stop in front of the large bookcase downstairs most of the volumes there had gone unexaminedcertainly by hersince the days when her mother and father were still alive she pulled one off the shelf when she blew on it she raised a puff of dust she made a mental note to berate the cleaning women but that could wait what she had in mind couldnt smiling a predatory smile she carried the book up to her bedchamber and barred the door behind her dare me will he she muttered well ill teach him powers below eat me if i dont her heart sank when she opened the volume all the curses were in classical kaunian which meant krasta didnt understand at first glance what they would do to an indifferent lover and in fact she had trouble finding one aimed at an indifferent lover plenty cursed faithless lovers but that wasnt lurcanios flawor krasta didnt think it was anyhow even the headings above the spells were written in an annoyingly antique style halfway back toward the classical language she considered a conjuring that induceth love between a man and a woman if it be used in their meats but then shook her head she didnt want to restore lurcanios ardor through magecraft she wanted to punish him for not having enough that a man may be always as a gelded man seemed more promising and also seemed easy enough to manage all she needed to do was give lurcanio a glowworm in his drink plenty of them sparked on and off in the garden during mild summer evenings that will teach him she said and slammed the book shut she hadnt tried to catch glowworms since she was a little girl but it didnt turn out to be hard since lurcanio was too busy with his precious work to bother coming to her bedchamber that evening he had no way of knowing she went out into the garden and gathered half a dozen in five minutes she carried them back into the mansion in a little marble box that had once held face powder when she got up the next morning she used the handle of a brush to mash the glowworms into a revolting paste she reasoned that would be easier to mix into a cup of wine or a mug of ale than would whole bugs having a pretty good notion of when the cook would be fixing lurcanios breakfast she went down to the kitchens just then aye milady it is ready the cook said bowing krasta seldom stuck her nose into his domain i was setting things on his tray as a matter of fact i shall carry it to him krasta said we quarreled yesterday and i want to show him all is forgiven the cook bowed again in acquiescence if the idea of krasta forgiving anyone startled him he gave no outward sign he simply handed her the tray when it was ready then held the door open for her so she could take it into the west wing before she got there she stirred some of the glowworm paste into lurcanios ale watching him drink it would be revenge in and of itself even if the spell didnt work but krasta wanted it to work lurcanio enjoyed mocking her if she left him impotent she could do the mocking and could also enjoy acting as seductive as she could making him pant for what he couldnt have seeing her with the breakfast tray gradasso didnt try to keep her out of lurcanios office whats this lurcanio said when she came in have we got a new maid aye krasta did her best to sound contrite which wasnt easy for her i was down in the kitchens and thought i would bring you what the cook had made andshe looked down at her toes in pretended maidenly embarrassmenti thought tonight you might bring me something too did you now lurcanio boomed laughter some sausage maybe is that it still affecting innocence krasta shyly nodded lurcanio laughed again and raised the mug of ale in salute well since you ask for it so prettily perhaps i shall he drank krasta had to fight hard not to hug herself with glee she wondered if he would notice anything odd about the taste but he didnt the rest of the day passed most happily krasta didnt scream once at bauska not even when her maidservants bastard brat spent half an hour howling like a wolf with a toothache bauska eyed her as if wondering what was wrong most days that would have been plenty to anger krasta by itself today she didnt even notice which made bauska more curious and suspicious than ever krasta also ate her own breakfast and luncheon and supper without sending anything back to the cook by the time evening came around everyone at the mansion was wondering whether she was really herselfand hoping she wasnt for bed she put on almost transparent silk pajamas slid under the covers and waited not too much later someone knocked on the door to the bedchamber come in krasta said sweetly its not barred in came lurcanio he barred the door and wasted no time taking off his tunic and kilt when he flipped back the sheets he paused a moment to admire krasta in her filmy nightclothes then got her out of them and then with his usual panache he proceeded to make love to her he had no trouble whatever krasta was so surprised she let him bring her to her peak of pleasure before she realized she wasnt supposed to be enjoying it how did you do that she asked still breathing a little hard how lurcanio leaned up on an elbow and raised an eyebrow the usual way how else but he paid more attention to her tone than she was in the habit of giving his why did you think i would be unable why would you think i might be unable well er i uh krasta had seldom made heavier going of an answer to her mingled mortification and relief lurcanio started to laugh little fool did you try to curse me with impotence i told you it was a waste of time soldiers are warded against much magic from real mages let alone from lovers who work themselves into a snit because they dont get enough attention he reached out and stroked her between the legs did you think i paid enough attention to you just now i suppose so she said sulkily if i were younger i would go another round the algarvian said but even though i am not so young i can still pay you more attention he brought his face down where his hand had been is this better he asked as he began krasta didnt reply in words but her back arched presently it was a great deal better indeed with a weary sigh trasone tramped east away from the fighting front in southern unkerlant by the powers above it sure feels good to get pulled out of the line for a few days he said enjoy it while it lasts sergeant panfilo answered on account of it wont dont i know it trasone said mournfully arent enough of us to do all the job that needs doing i hear tell there are a couple of regiments of yaninans off on the left of the brigade because there arent enough real algarvian soldiers to hold the whole line ive heard that too panfilo said i keep hoping its a pack of lies it had better be trasones tone was dark if the unkerlanters start running behemoths at a bunch of lousy yaninans with pompoms on their shoes you know whatll happen as well as i do theyll run so fast theyll be back in patras day after tomorrow the veteran sergeant replied and trasone nodded panfilo went on half the time i think wed do better if those buggers were on swemmels side instead of ours aye trasone trudged on up the road it was summer and dry so a cloud of dust like thick brown fog obscured his comrades more than a few yards away that was better than slogging through mud or snow but not much the dead bloated carcass of a unicorn feet sticking up in the air lay by the side of the road he smelled it before he could see it pointing to it he said i thought that was going to be soldiers not just a beast the stinks a little different panfilo said unicorns are sweeter maybe his prominent nose wrinkled its not perfume though any which way sure isnt trasone pointed ahead whats the name of that town there we just took it away from the unkerlanters last week and already i cant remember place is called hagenow panfilo told him not that i care as long as the lines in front of the brothels dont stretch around the block and as long as theyve got plenty of popskull in the taverns trasone nodded strong spirits and loose women he was hard pressed to think of anything else he required from a leave in the rear areas after a moment though he did be nice to go to sleep and not worry about waking up with my throat cut and thats true too panfilo said if the dice are hot ill win enough silver to make myself armor out of it when i go back in your dreams trasone said and then remembering proper military etiquette in your dreams sergeant they marched along in silence for a while two weary filthy men in a battalion full of soldiers just as weary and just as filthy from somewhere up ahead major spinellos bright tenor came drifting back on the breeze somehow or other spinello kept the energy to sing a dirty song trasone envied him without wanting to imitate him something else came drifting back on the breeze too a stink of unwashed humanity worse than that rising from the soldiers along with a strong reek of nasty slit trenches phew trasone said and coughed if thats hagenow the unkerlanters are welcome to it i dont remember that it smelled all that bad when we went through it before neither do i panfilo peered ahead shading his eyesnot that that did much against the dust then he pointed look there trasone in that barley field thats not hagenow not yet we havent gone over the little river in front of it so what in blazes is that id take oath it wasnt here when we headed west over this stretch of road so would i trasone narrowed his eyes also trying to pierce the dust after a little while he grunted its not a townits a captives camp ah youre right panfilo said the guards and the palisade around the place helped make its nature clear or so it seemed then a gate opened so more people could go into the camp trasone grunted again those arent unkerlanterstheyre blonds his laugh was nasty well i dont expect theyll be in there stinking up the place all that long and when they go i hope our mages give swemmels whoresons a good kick in the balls with their life energy thats the truth panfilo agreed if it werent for the kaunians we wouldnt have a war thats what everybody says anyhow so its likely right well by the time this wars over there wont be a whole lot of kaunians left trasone said maybe that means the next onell be a long time coming hope so half an hour later they got into hagenow it was more than a village and less than a city and had taken a beating when the algarvians managed to drive the unkerlanters out of it not many unkerlanters were on the streets now the ones who were flinched away from the algarvian soldiers as far as trasone was concerned that was how things were supposed to be major spinello turned to his men listen you rogues i expect you to leave bits and pieces of this town still standing so the next gang of soldiers coming in have somewhere to enjoy themselves too past that have yourselves a time me i aim to screw myself dizzy and off he went plainly intent on doing just that hes got it easy trasone said a little jealous he wont have to stand in line at an officers brothel he pulls his weight panfilo said weve had plenty of worse officers over us and cursed few better ones go on tell me im wrong cant do it trasone admitted he pointed to the queue in front of the closest brothel for ordinary troopers it wasnt quite so long as panfilo had feared but it wasnt what anybody would call short cant get my ashes hauled right away either might as well pour down some spirits first an algarvian soldier served as tapman in a tavern that had surely belonged to an unkerlanter before mezentios army swept into and then past hagenow trasone wondered what had happened to the unkerlanter but not for long what have you got he demanded when he elbowed his way up to the bar ale or spirits the fellow answered wasnt much wine in town and the officers have it all let me have a slug of spirits then trasone told him and some ale to chase it the tapman gave him what he asked for he knocked back the spirits then put out the fire in his gullet with the ale before other thirsty troopers could shove him away from the bar he got a refill he thought about drinking till he couldnt stand up any more he thought about getting into a dice game too three or four were going on in the tavern but he had other things on his mind he looked around for panfilo but didnt see himmaybe the sergeant had other things on his mind too panfilo wasnt in the line trasone chose it snaked forward with a few drinks in him he didnt mind its not moving faster when a drunken soldier started cursing how slowly it moved two military constables hustled him away trasone was glad he hadnt complained after what seemed a very long time he got inside the brothel in the downstairs parlor sat six or eight wearylooking women in widesleeved long tunics of red or green or yellow silk almost the uniform of whores down in forthweg or unkerlant about half the women were unkerlanters the others kaunians blonds didnt live in this part of unkerlant the algarvian authorities must have shipped them in for their soldiers pleasure theyd likely get shipped off to a captives camp when they wore out too trasone thought most forthwegian women dumpy and plain he pointed to a kaunian she nodded slowly rose from her chair and led him upstairs in a little room up there she pulled off her tunic and lay down naked on the pallet trasone quickly got out of his own clothes and lay down beside her when he began to caress her she said dont bother just get it over with she spoke good algarvian all right he said and did she lay still under him her eyes were open but she looked up through him looked up through the ceiling to somewhere a million miles away he had to close his own eyes because the empty expression on her face put him off his stroke he didnt think shed last much longer when he grunted and spent himself the whore pushed at him so she could get up and put her tunic back on trasone went back across the street to the tavern and did some more drinking after a while he got back into the line for the whorehouse this time he chose a forthwegian woman she proved a little livelier he didnt feel as if he were coupling with a corpse the leave passed that way he had a dreadful hangover when major spinello collected the battalion and started everyone toward the front again sergeant panfilo kept bragging about the havoc hed wreaked in the brothels of hagenow trasone didnt mind the boasts hed heard their like before but he kept wishing panfilo wouldnt talk so loud they were marching west past the labor camp when trasone said looktheyre taking out a bunch of blonds what are they going to do with em panfilo asked and how do you know they arent getting away on their own theyd be running harder if they were getting away and they wouldnt have soldiers standing watch over em trasones pounding head made him testy he pointed again and look therethose arent just soldiers theyre mages theyve got to be nobody in uniform who isnt a mage stumbles around like that panfilo chuckled well i wont say youre wrong and if those are mages his voice dropped if those are mages i think i know what theyre going to do with the kaunians so this is how it goes aye this is how it goes trasone agreed hed felt the strong lash of algarvian sorcery passing over him to fall on the unkerlanters and hed been on the receiving end as the unkerlanters massacred their own people to build a sorcery to strike back at the algarvians but hed never seen how such magecraft was made now he would unless his squad marched past before the slaughter began they didnt the algarvian soldiers in the field lined the kaunians up in neat rows then at a shouted order trasone clearly heard they raised their sticks and started blazing the blonds who didnt fall at once tried to run now that did them no good the soldiers kept on blazing and the kaunians had no place to flee after a few minutes they all lay dead or dying and the mages got to work trasone could hear their chants rising and falling too but couldnt understand a word of them after a moment he realized why they werent incanting in algarvian but in classical kaunian he started to laugh if that didnt serve the blonds right what did he felt the power the mages were raising the soldiers had killed hundreds of kaunians how much life energy was that he couldnt measure ithe was no wizard but it was enough and more than enough to make his hair stand on end under his broadbrimmed hat even though he was getting only the tiniest fringe of it as it built then it flashed away he could tell the very instant the mages launched it at king swemmels men the feel of the air changed as it did just after a thunderclap all that energy would come down on the unkerlanters heads he turned to sergeant panfilo better them than us he said powers above a lot better them than us the sergeant didnt argue with him as always marshal rathar was glad to get out of cottbus away from the capital he was his own man when he gave an order everyone leaped to obey it was almost like being king almost but hed seen the kind of obedience king swemmel commanded he didnt have that he didnt want it either what he did have was a hard time making his way into the south where the worst of the fighting was the algarvians having punched through the unkerlanter defenses now stood astride most of the direct routes from cottbus to the south to get where he was going rathar had to travel along three sides of a rectangle taking a long detour west to use ley lines still in unkerlanter hands when he got to durrwangen he wondered if hed come too late algarvian eggs were bursting just outside the city and some inside it as well we have to hold here as long as we can he told general vatran this is one of the gateways to the mamming hills and the cinnabar in them we cant just give it up to the redheads i know how to read a map too vatran grunted if we dont hold em here theres nowhere else good to try and stop em this side of sulingen but the whoresons have the bit between their teeth again the way they did last summer how in blazes are we supposed to make em quit keep fighting them rathar answered or would you sooner let them have all the cinnabar they need would you sooner lie down and give up was what he really meant he studied vatran hed urged swemmel to keep the officer in charge down here now he was wondering if hed made a mistake vatrans attack south of aspang had failed there were reasons it had failed neither vatran nor any other unkerlanter had realized the algarvians were concentrating so many men in the south but vatran hadnt covered himself with glory since either the question was could anyone else have done better vatran understood that question behind the question he glared up at rathar who stood a couple of inches taller vatrans nose was sharp and curved as a sickle blade had it been one in truth he might have used it to cut the marshal down if you dont care for the job im doing he ground out give me a stick take the stars off my collar and send me out against the algarvians as a common soldier i didnt come here to put you in a penalty battalion rathar answered mildly officers who disgraced themselves sometimes got the chance for redemption by fighting as ordinary soldiers penalty battalions went in where the fighting was hottest men who lived got their rank back most didnt well then lets talk about how were going to hold on to what we can down here vatran said that was a good sensible suggestion before rathar could take him up on it eggs crashed down around the schoolhouse vatran was using for a headquarters rathar threw himself fiat so did vatran and all the junior officers in the chamber most of the glass in the windows had already been shattered what was left flew through the air in glittering deadly arcs a spearlike shard stuck in the floorboards a few inches from rathars nose never a dull moment vatran said when the eggs stopped falling where were we trying to stay alive rathar answered getting to his feet trying to keep our armies alive too if you know a magic to manage it i hope youll tell me vatran answered the algarvians have more skill than we do the only thing we can do to stop em is put more bodies in their way were doing that as best we can we have to do it better the marshal said down here now its the way things were in front of cottbus last fall we havent got a lot of room to fall back if we do we lose things we cant afford to lose i know that vatran said i need more of everythingdragons behemoths men crystals you name it and youll have what you needor as much of it as we can get to you anyhow rathar told him moving things down from the north isnt easy these days in case you hadnt noticed ill bet you did by the look vatran gave rathar he would have been just as well pleased if the marshal hadnt been able to come down from cottbus in a way rathar sympathized with that no general worth his salt should have been eager to have a superior looking over his shoulder had the fight in the south been going well rathar would have stayed up in the capital even if that meant enduring king swemmel but with the algarvians bulling forward vatran could hardly expect to have everything exactly as he wanted rathar asked the question that had to be asked will we hold durrwangen i hope so general vatran answered then his broad shoulders moved up and down in a shrug that held none of the jauntiness an algarvian would have given it i dont know marshal to tell the truth i just dont know the cursed redheads have been moving awful fast and he hesitated before going on and the soldiers arent as happy as they might be either no rathars ears pricked up youd better tell me more about that and youd better not waste any time doing it either its about what youd expect the general said theyve been licked too many times and some of em dont see how anything differents going to happen when they bump up against the algarvians again thats not good rathar said in what he thought a commendable understatement i havent seen anything about it in your written reports no and you wont either vatran told him dyou think im daft to put it in writing where his majesty could see it my head would go up on a pike five minutes laterunless he decided to boil me alive instead he spread his handsbroad peasant hands much like rathars you hold my life lord marshal if you want it you can take it but you need to know the truth for which i thank you rathar again wondered whether he wanted vatran dead probably not who could have done better here in the south no one he could think of save perhaps himself dont the men remember what we did to the algarvians last winter no doubt some of em do vatran answered but its not winter now and it wont be for a while even down here and in summer when their dragons can fly and their behemoths can run nobodys beaten mezentios men yet weve made them earn it rathar said if we can keep on making them earn it sooner or later theyll run out of men aye vatran said either that or well run out of land we can afford to lose if we dont hold sulingen and the mamming hills can we keep on with the war people had asked that about cottbus the summer before unkerlant hadnt had to find out the answer for the capital had held rathar hoped his kingdom wouldnt have to find out the answer this time either he had no guarantee though and neither did unkerlant doing his best to look on the bright side of things he said i hear theyre starting to put yaninans in the line they wouldnt do that if they didnt have to thats soto a point vatran said but theyre no fools they wouldnt be so dangerous if they were they give the boys with the pretty shoes the quiet stretches to hold that lets them concentrate more of their own men where they have to do real fighting before rathar could reply more eggs fell on durrwangen again he and vatran stretched themselves on the floor the schoolhouse shook and creaked all around them rathar hoped the roof wouldnt come down on his head still more eggs fell the algarvians couldnt have moved so many tossers so far forward could they more likely dragons with redheads atop them were dropping their loads of death on the unkerlanter city and vatran had already said he lacked the dragons to repel them a runner with more courage than sense rushed into vatrans headquarters even while the eggs were falling general he cried general by his tone rathar knew something had gone badly wrong sure enough the fellow went on general the algarvians have broken through our lines west of the city if we cant stop them theyll slide around behind us and cut us off what vatran and rathar said the same thing at the same time in identical tones of horror both men cursed then vatran who know the local situation better demanded what happened to the brigades that were supposed to hold the buggers back unhappily the runner answered uh some of them sir some of them went and skedaddled fast as they could go rathar cursed again in a low voice vatran said now you see what i meant i see it the marshal said i see well have to stop it too before the rot gets worse he climbed to his feet the runner stared at him how bad a breakthrough is it he snapped pretty bad sir the messenger replied theyve got behemoths through and plenty of footsoldiers with em theyre astrideno theyre pastthe ley line leading west out of durrwangen that was also rathars most direct route back to cottbus not that any route from the embattled south to the capital was direct these days can we drive them back he asked both the runner and general vatran siruh lord marshalthe redheads have pushed a lot of men through the runner said his gaze swung toward vatran so did rathars vatran licked his lips i dont know where we could scrape up the men he said at last most unhappily and coming at durrwangen from out of the west who would have thought the algarvianswho would have thought anybodycould come at durrwangen from out of the west we havent got the defenses there that we do east of the city probably why the algarvians chose that direction for their attack rathar said vatran gaped at him as if hed suddenly started declaiming poetry in gyongyosian the marshal repeated the question hed asked before can we hold durrwangen i dont see how lord marshal vatran answered i dont either but i was hoping you did since youve been on the spot here longer than i have rathar said since we cant hold the place wed better save what we can when we pull out dont you think a loud thud outside the schoolhousenot a bursting egg but a heavy weight falling from a great heightmade vatran smile savagely thats a dragon blazed out of the sky he said as if one downed algarvian dragon made up for all disasters aye well get out and well keep fighting and wed better make sure there are no more skedaddles rathar said whatever we have to do to stop them wed best do it king swemmel might have spoken through his mouth he was ready to be as harsh as swemmel to get what he had to haveno what unkerlant had to have somewhere not far away another dragon slammed to the ground rathar nodded once more the algarvians were paying a price along with his men leudast squatted in a field of sunflowers it would have been a dangerous place to have to fight with the plants nodding taller than a man the only way to find a foe would be to stumble onto him for the moment the algarvians were a couple of miles to the northor so leudast hoped with all his heart he leaned forward to listen to what captain hawart had to say the regimental commander spoke in matteroffact tones the kingdom is in danger boys if we dont stop mezentios whoresons before too long it wont matter anymore because were licked you wouldnt be talking like that if wed hung on to durrwangen somebody said thats so but we didnt hawart answered and some soldiers got blazed because they didnt fight hard enough too not just groundpounders either there are a couple of dead brigadiers on account of that mess weve done everything we could that voice came from behind hawart leudast didnt see whod spoken up there either whoever it was hadnt stood up and waved that was for sure leudast wouldnt have either not if hed said something like that the regimental commander whirled trying to catch the soldier whod let his mouth run captain hawart couldnt which meant he glared at everyone impartially listen to me he said youd cursed well better listen to me or youll all be dead men if the algarvians dont kill you your own comrades will its that bad its that dangerous we cant fall back any more whats this about our comrades sir leudast said hawart had ordered him to ask the question with a flourish captain hawart took from his belt pouch a sheet of paper he waved it about before beginning to read it leudast watched the soldiers eyes follow the sheet a lot of the men were peasants who could no more read than they could fly to them anything on paper seemed more important more portentous simply because it was written down leudast knew better at least most of the time but hawart had told him what this paper was now the officer explained it to the rest of the regiment this is an order from king swemmel not from our division headquarters not from general vatran not even from marshal rathar powers above praise him from the king so youd better listen boys and youd better listen good and the troopers he commanded did lean forward so they could hear better the kings name made them pay attention leudast knew it made him pay attention he also knew he didnt want the king or the kings minions paying attention to him which they were too likely to do if he disobeyed a royal order even to the slightest degree not one step back hawart read in ringing tones iron discipline iron discipline won the day for the right in the twinkings war even when things looked blackest our army held firm against the traitors and rebels who fought for that demon in human shape kyot kyot of course had been swemmels twin brother an inconvenient twin who refused to admit he was the younger of them hed paid for his claim the whole kingdom had paidand paid and paid but if kyot was a demon in human shape and was also swemmels twin what did that make the present king of unkerlant before leudast could dwell on that for very long hawart went on the algarvian invaders shall not be permitted to advance one foot farther onto the precious soil of unkerlant our soldiers are to die in place before yielding any further territory to mezentios butchers and wolves the enemy must be checked must be halted must be driven back any soldiers who shirk this task shall face our wrath which we assure all who hear these words shall blaze hotter than anything the redheaded mumblers can possibly inflict on you here and there soldiers looked at one another leudast looked up at the sky and the nodding sunflowers he did not want to have to try to meet anyone elses eyes from everything hed heard from everything hed seen swemmel was neither lying nor boasting however much leudast feared the algarvians he feared his own sovereign more any soldier who retreats without orders shall be reckoned a traitor against us and shall be punished as befits treason hawart read any officer who gives the order to retreat without direst need shall be judged likewise our inspectors and impressers shall enforce this command by all necessary means what does that mean haifa dozen soldiers asked the question out loud leudast didnt but it blazed in his mind too after the impressers caught him and made sure he had a rockgray tunic on his back hed thought he was done worrying about them was he wrong evidently he was for captain hawart said ill tell you what it means boys somewhere back of the army theres a thin line of impressers and inspectors every one of them has a stick in his hands you try running away those buggersd just as soon blaze you as look at you leudast believed him by the way soldiers heads bobbed up and down everybody believed him anyone whod ever dealt with inspectors and impressers could have no possible doubt that they would blaze their own countrymen but how many of them would get blazed in return while they were doing it no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than he shied away from it as a unicorn might shy from a buzzing fly if unkerlanters began battling unkerlanters if the twinkings war or even some tiny portion of it visited the kingdom once again what would spring from it why algarvian conquest and nothing else leudast could see so hawart said there it is lads we dont go back any more not if theres any help for it we go forward when we can we die in place when theres no other choice and we dont go back not unless he paused and shook his head we dont go back we cant afford to not anymore you heard the captain leudast growled as any sergeant might have after an officer gave orders hed heard the captain too and wished he hadnt swemmels orders left no room for misunderstanding hawart put the paper back into his belt pouch he had to look up orienting himself by the sun before he could point east and north thats where the algarvians are he said lets go find them and give them a good boot in the arse theyve already done it to us too many times aye leudast said a few other troopers snarled agreement but most of the men though they obeyed hawart readily enough did so without any great eagerness theyd seen enough action by now to understand how hard it was to halt the redheads in the open field leudast had seen more action than almost any of them he wondered why he retained enough enthusiasm to want to go forward against the algarvians im probably too stupid to know better he thought sunflower leaves rustled brushing against his tunic and those of his comrades dry fallen leaves crunched under his boots the plants bobbed and shook as he pushed his way through them the sunflowers were taller than a man but an alert algarvian with a spyglass could have tracked from afar the marching unkerlanters by the way the plants moved without a breeze to stir them leudast hoped mezentios men werent so alertand also hoped that even if they were they had no eggtossers nearby coming out from among the sunflowers was almost like breaking the surface after swimming underwater in a pond leudast could suddenly see much farther than he had been able to ahead lay the village whose peasants would have harvested the sunflowers dragonsperhaps algarvian but perhaps unkerlanter toohad visited destruction on it from the air only a few huts still stood the rest were either blackened ruins or had simply ceased to be people moved amongst the ruins though for a moment leudast admired the tenacity of his countrymen who but unkerlanter peasants would have tried so hard to go on with their lives even in the midst of wars devastation then he stiffened unkerlanters would have been more solidly made than these tall scrawny apparitions and no matter how tall and scrawny unkerlanters might have been they would never ever have worn kilts leudasts body realized that faster than his mind he threw himself to the ground at the same time someone else shouted algarvians forward captain hawart called he was going to obey king swemmels order or die trying leudast thought but hawart didnt want to do any more dying than he had to for he added forward by rushes my companyeven squads forward leudast commanded he got up and went forward with the evennumbered squads hed learned from hawart not to order anything he wouldnt do himself the men in the oddnumbered squads blazed at the algarvians in the village ahead as leudast dove to the ground again he wondered how many algarvians the village held and how many more were close enough to join the fight hed find out before long hed done a good job of teaching the raw recruits who flooded into his companys ranks what needed doing even before he screamed the next order the soldiers from the oddnumbered squads were running past their comrades and toward the algarvians in the village he blazed at the redheads the range was still long for a handheld stick but beams zipping past them and starting house fires would make mezentios men keep their heads down and interfere with their blazing captain hawarts regiment had worked its way across half the open country between the edge of the sunflower field and the village when eggs began dropping on the unkerlanter soldiers leudast cursed in weary frustration hed seen that sort of thing happen too many times before the algarvians had too many crystals and used them too well to make them easy foes but the unkerlanters kept moving forward more slowly than they should have their eggtossers started pounding the village the huts that were still standing went to pieces we can do it leudast shouted to his men he hadnt seen any reinforcements running up to bolster the redheads in the place it would be hard work expensive workit would probably get down to knives in the endbut he didnt think the algarvians could hold against a regiment hed just got to his feet for another rush toward the village when dragons swooped down on his comrades and him his first warning was a harsh hideous screech that seemed to sound right in his ear a moment later with a belching roar like a hundred men puking side by side a dragon painted in bright algarvian colors poured flame over half a dozen unkerlanters leudast dove for cover and blazed at dragons and dragonfliers the redheads aboard the dragons were blazing at soldiers on the ground too other dragonfliers let eggs fall from hardly more than treetop height they burst among king swemmels men with deadly effect behemoths this summer the cry wasnt usually so full of panic and despair as it had been the year before now now seeing the regiment falling to pieces around him leudast shouted back a moment later others took up the cry the unkerlanters who still lived stumbled and staggered off toward the sunflowers from which theyd emerged king swemmel could give whatever orders he liked in the face of overwhelming enemy superiority not even fear of him would make his men obey six in algarve leyline caravans always traveled with the windows shut tight hajjaj had rather enjoyed that it meant the cars were as warm as the zuwayzi weather in which hed grown up in zuwayza itself however the custom was just the opposite letting air into the caravan cars helped ensure that they didnt get too intolerably hot as his own special caravan car glided east hajjaj sipped date wine and peered out at the sunblazed landscape through which the ley line ran turning to his secretary he remarked it never fails to amaze me that the unkerlanters wanted this country badly enough to take it away from us so they could rule it themselves qutuz shrugged your excellency i do not seek to fathom unkerlanters any more than i seek to fathom algarvians the ways of the pale men who wrap themselves in cloth are beyond the ken of any rightthinking zuwayzi those ways had better not be or well end up in trouble without the faintest notion of how we got there the zuwayzi foreign minister answered he sipped at his wine again then let out a wry chuckle and if we do understand the clothed ones well end up in trouble knowing exactly how we got there even so your excellency qutuz said thus this journey aye hajjaj said unhappily thus this journey when he thought of it in those terms he wanted to drink himself into a stupor instead he went on ive spent most of my life learning everything i could about the algarvians admiring them imitating their style and their energy yoking my kingdom to mezentios and then the war came and with it this this madness of theirs even so his secretary repeated did you see no sign of it before the fighting began hajjaj considered that not many he said at last oh kaunians and algarvians have often been foes down through the years but men of kaunian blood taught in the university when i studied at trapani and no one thought anything of it they sought knowledge and truth no less than their algarvian colleaguesand enjoyed affairs with pretty students no less either i might add qutuz smiled then said the days before the six years war must have been a happier time than the one we live in now in some ways and for some people hajjaj said im an old man but i hope im not such an old fool as to go blathering about how wonderful the days of long ago were an unkerlanter grand duke ruled zuwayza then remember and ruled it with a rod of iron he probably needed one qutuz observed oh without a doubt my dear fellow hajjaj replied that made it no more pleasant to be his subject though and another unkerlanter grand duke lorded it over one half of forthweg and an algarvian prince over the other and the forthwegians hated them both impartially his secretary nodded thoughtfully what you say makes a good deal of sense your excellencyas it has a way of doing but tell me this in the days before the six years war would anyone have used the kaunians as king mezentio is using them nowor as king swemmel is using his own people no hajjaj said at once in that you are right mezentios fatherand swemmels toowould sooner have leapt off a cliff than ordered such a slaughter he tossed back the rest of the wine in his cup at a gulp then slammed it down on the little table in front of him a moment later the leyline caravan came up over the top of a little rise qutuz pointed eastward you can spy the sea from here your excellency we are almost arrived a little reluctantly hajjaj turned to look sure enough deeper blue lay between the yellowgray of sand and stone and the hot blue bowl of the sky above them the zuwayzi foreign minister narrowed his eyes to see if he could spy any boats afloat on that deep blue sea he saw none but knew that did not signify whether he could spy them at this moment or not they would be out there a few minutes later the caravan glided to a halt in the depot of a little town called najran which existed for no other reason than that the ley line ran into the sea there it wasnt a proper port nothing protected it from the great storms that blew in during spring and fall but boats could go in and out and what they brought could head straight for bishah thus najran and thus too the camelhair tents that had sprouted around the handful of permanent buildings najran boasted thus the zuwayzi soldiers naked between wide hats and sandals who patrolled the area their commander a portly colonel named saadun bowed low before hajjaj welcome welcome thrice welcome the officer said and i assure you your excellency that welcome comes not only from my men and me but also from those we guard bowing in returnnot quite so deeplyhajjaj replied they are welcome here as i have come to make plain to them i bring no newssheet scribes with me for i would not embarrass our allies but i will not pretend these folk do not exist too many people have been doing that for too long either pretending they dont exist or trying to make sure they dont exist saadun said even so hajjaj echoed qutuz take me to them colonel if you would be so kind aye saadun bowed again come with me then as hajjaj followed him through the streets of najran the local zuwayzin came out of their shops to stare till the war few strangers had come to their hamlet who would have wanted to so long as he had other choices the folk in the camelhair tents had none had they not come to najran hajjaj wouldnt have either somebody in one of those tents stuck out his head his unkempt golden beard gleamed in the merciless sunlight when he saw saadun and hajjaj approaching he exclaimed and came all the way out of the tent more blondsmen women and childrenspilled from the rest of those makeshift shelters they still wore whatever clothes theyd had on when they got to zuwayza most of those clothes were tattered but theyd been mended and were almost painfully clean as one the kaunian refugees bowed low when hajjaj walked up to them the zuwayzi foreign minister glanced over toward colonel saadun saadun nodded back unabashed they know who you are your excellency is it not fitting that they should show their gratitude i do not see that i did anything particularly requiring gratitudeonly what any decent man would do hajjaj said saaduns mouth narrowed as if he were about to speak but he didnt after another few steps hajjaj sighed with things as they are in the world these days maybe common decency does rate gratitude but the worlds a sorry place if it does the worlds a sorry place all right saadun said and said no more before hajjaj could find an answer the kaunians streamed toward him despite their clothes despite the wide straw hats theyd got here in najran many of them were badly sunburned no wonder that in the days of the kaunian empire the ancestors of these blonds had traded with the dusky nomads who roamed zuwayza but had never tried to make it into an imperial province powers above bless you your excellency exclaimed the man whod first peered out of his tent and spied hajjaj he spoke his own tongue but hajjaj understood any cultured man learned classical kaunian but only the kaunians of forthweg used it as their milk speech the accent sounded odd to hajjajs ears but only a little i am glad to see you here and safe he replied he spoke slowly carefullythough fluent in written kaunian he seldom had occasion to use it orally youve saved us the blond said youve kept us alive when no one would have cared if youd killed us all the other kaunians gathered around hajjaj even the boys and girls nodded at that another man said wed join your army and fight your foes for you if only his voice trailed away he didnt know how to go on and be polite at the same time a woman filled in the blank saying what had to be in everyones mind if only you werent friends with the algarvians you are a good man your excellency you must be a good man how can you stand to be friends with the algarvians as she asked the question bewilderment filled her voice and her face algarve helps my kingdom right wrongs done against us hajjaj answered no one else couldno one else wouldgive us that help and you help us when no one else could or would the first kaunian man said doing that might turn your friends into your foes hajjaj shrugged it has not happened i do not think it will happen here in the north algarve needs us the kaunians stirred and muttered among themselves the woman whod been forthright before was forthright again no one needed us in forthweg not the barbarians we lived among and not the barbarians who overran the land either if the blonds in forthweg hadnt reckoned their far more numerous forthwegian neighbors barbarians the forthwegians might have been less enthusiastic about watching them get shipped off to destruction or on the other hand the forthwegians might not have from the clan struggles among his own people hajjaj knew neighbor did not necessarily love neighbor even when they looked alike a young woman asked your excellency what will you do with us now her voice was husky and sweet before shed suffered on the sea voyage to zuwayza she might well have been quite a beauty even gaunt and drawn as she was she remained striking hajjaj thought of a thing or two he would have liked to do with her even if age kept him from doing such things as often as he once had she was hardly in a position to refuse him and hed needed a third wife a wife for amusement ever since hed sent greedy lalla back to her clanfather he shook his head angry at himself and ashamed too if he took advantage of her weakness how was he any different from an algarvian for now he answered you will stay here no one will molest you you will have food and water after the war is over we shall decide your permanent fate if the redheads win we can all go and throw ourselves back into the sea a man said he was probablyin fact he was almost certainlyright but hajjaj countered if unkerlant wins what will become of us zuwayzin much the same i fear we shall protect ourselves and we shall do our best to protect you as well we thank you the striking young woman said and the rest of the blonds three or four dozen of them solemnly nodded she went on we feared you would sink our boats or give us over to king mezentios men anything this side of that seems a miracle of kindness again all the kaunians nodded if common decency seemed a miracle what will be left of everything weve spent so long building up by the time this cursed war finally ends hajjaj asked no one answered him he hadnt thought anyone would the excitement of going up to yliharma was dead inside pekka it had been since the algarvians with their brutal sorcery almost leveled the capital of kuusamo but like it or not research called her out of the south she was sure she wasnt the only nervous passenger on the leyline caravan when the caravan pulled into the depot in yliharma pekka grimaced at the cracked walls patched with pale new cement she also wondered how well the patches would hold if the algarvians renewed their sorcerous assault on the city with all her heart she hoped she wouldnt have to find out siuntio stood waiting for her on the platform here let me take your bag the old theoretical sorcerer said reaching for it ill do no such thing master pekka said indignantly i can carry it myself siuntio had aged visibly since theyd started working together maybe the strain of the sorcery was telling on him or maybe the aftermath of the shock from the attack on yliharma or maybe he was simply drawing toward the end of his time wherever the truth lay he looked as if a strong breeze would blow him off the platform pekka knew she was stronger than he he had to know it too his sigh was wistful not angry well come along then he said i trust the principality will suffice oh no i want something grander pekka sounded even more indignant than she had a moment before then she laughed so did siuntio yliharma had no hostel grander than the principality setubal might on the other hand it might not too pekka went on youll spoil me you know i doubt it siuntio said and even if we should manage it running around after that scamp of an uto should unspoil you pretty soon hard to be spoiled when youre exhausted pekka agreed she gave the senior mage a sidelong glance we both have to run around after that scamp of an ilmarinen dont we siuntio wheezed laughter ive been running around after ilmarinen longer than youve been alive i take a certain amount of pride in noting that ive made him run around after me a few times too he waved to a horsedrawn cab the driver descended from his perch and held the door open the principality siuntio said as he handed pekka up into the cab aye sir the driver said respectfully pekka didnt think he knew who siuntio was but anyone who wanted to go to the fancy hostel had to be a person of more than a little consequence the hostel lay only a few blocks from the depot that was true of most newer hostels which were sensibly close to the greatest source of travelers older ones stood near the hill on which the palace stood and along the road west to lagoas almost as if they were so many algarvians the servitors at the principality bowed and scraped and fussed over pekka when she came into the lobby it wasnt because she had siuntio walking by her side either to her mind that would have been reason enough to bow and scrape and fuss but the folk who worked at the hostel neither knew nor cared who siuntio was they fussed over pekka for no better reason than that she had money had she been a trollop rich enough to afford the principality they would have treated her the same way the idea made pekka angry money shouldnt count for more than quality she said to siuntio he took her ire in stride as best she could tell he took everythingexcept occasionally ilmarinenin stride money is easier to measure he replied and what else was a working theoretical sorcerer likely to say pekka stuck out her chin and looked stubborn sometimes the easy measurement isnt the important one she was a working theoretical sorcerer too instead of answering right away siuntio leaned forward and kissed her on the cheek she spluttered in surprise the old mages smile was saucy go on upstairs order yourself a fancy supper the seven princes are paying for enjoy the steam room and then sluice yourself down with cold water some people used to think being a sorcerer meant depriving yourself of everything that made life worth living do you still you know better she answered aye i do for ive seen your home siuntio said you have no home in yliharma so youre doomed to enjoy yourself here ill see you in the morning he turned and went out to the waiting cab pekka stared after him with mingled exasperation and affection then seeing no other good choice she went on upstairs and did exactly what siuntio had suggested the mattress in her little suite was wider and sorter and altogether more inviting than the one she used at home even so she didnt sleep well for one thing she didnt have leino lying there beside her stealing the coverlets and doing his best to make sure she froze for another no matter how inviting the bed was it was also unfamiliar pekka tossed and turned and laughed at herself im too comfortable to doze off she thought however absurd it sounded it was true eventually she did fall asleep after an extravagant breakfast of smoked salmon and delicate onions on rye bread she went downstairs siuntio and ilmarinen waited for her in the lobby siuntio looked not much different from the way he had the night before when she saw ilmarinen though her first thought was that hed had too much to drink and was suffering on account of it so youre here to join the vultures feast eh he said and she realized it was fury not a hangover that reddened his eyes and made the wrinkles in his cheeks and on his forehead seem deeper and more erodedlooking than shed ever seen them im here aye she said as for feasts i dont know about any except the one i just finished in my room ilmarinen rounded on siuntio powers above you quack didnt you tell her siuntio shook his head no i wanted her to approach the question with an open mindwhich she will do now but despite plainly doing his best to sound assured he also sounded a little embarrassed what didnt you tell me master siuntio pekka asked sharply whatever it was i wish id known about it ilmarinen started to answer siuntio held up a hand for a wonder that made ilmarinen hesitate to pekka siuntio said nothing you wont find out now that i promise you if you come along with this excitable fellow and me youll see as much for yourself he led her toward one of the meeting chambers off the main lobby quietly she said dont ever keep things from me again if you please i did what i judged best siuntio answered and shes worth three of you because of it you old fraud ilmarinen growled he wasnt enjoying siuntios discomfiture as he would have most of the time he was too angry for that pekka wondered what could have caused the rift between them and how shed somehow landed in the middle of it siuntio opened an ornately carven door when pekka saw people already at the table she expected theyd been raahe and alkio and piilis the other theoretical sorcerers on the track of the relationship between the laws of similarity and contagion she and siuntio and ilmarinen had outdistanced them but they werent far behind instead though two tall men rose from their chairs and bowed to her siuntio said mistress pekka i present to you grandmaster pinhiero of the lagoan guild of mages and his secretary brinco good day mistress pinhiero said in good almost unaccented kuusaman he was in his late middle years his hair more gray than red brinco younger and plumper contented himself with bowing again good day pekka replied automatically polite but then she began to wonder why she and her colleagues were meeting with two of lagoas leading mages she didnt wonder for long the answer seemed only too obvious nodding to pinhiero and brinco she said i hope you gentlemen will excuse us for a moment we have something that wants discussing she stepped out of the meeting chamber ilmarinen seemed glad to go with her siuntio rather less so you see ilmarinen saidto siuntio not to her for he went on she wants no part of this either letting the lagoans share what weve found its madness nothing but madness is it siuntio shrugged and then shook his head theyre at war with algarve no less than we are they have skilled mages too and ilmarinens snort cut him off those two i know their work such as it is theyre skilled politicos but thats about all and aye lagoas is at war with algarvenow what happens when lagoas is at war with us again as its liable to be one day the guild of mages will use what we teach em and beat us over the head with it if we do this siuntio said patiently we shall do it with precautions just as we show the lagoans what weve learned so shall they be bound to share with us whatever they may discover ilmarinen threw back his head and laughed so loud a waiter carrying a tray of smoked whitefish into another chamber stopped and stared did you ever stop to think the lagoans might cheat if i were in their boots i would pekka wondered if that thought had crossed siuntios mind he was such a good man himself he might well reckon others better than they really were but no not this time for he replied aye they may cheat so may we they may be dangerous to us in time to come the algarvians are dangerous to us now which of these carries the greater weight you know my answer ilmarinen said were it up to me id tell pinhiero and brinco to go chase themselves remember that other mage they sent to spy on us that fernao he went away with a flea in his ear thanks to me i remember fernao pekka said he wrote to me trying to find out what i was up to i didnt tell him anything well then lets send these buggers home too ilmarinen said its two to one against you siuntio you cant go on dickering with them by yourself or youd bloody well better not anyhow i would not siuntio said the choice of whether or not we proceed lies with mistress pekka as you say but she has not yet stated it so you may be speaking too soon i also note that you have not answered the question i set you which is more important more dangerouswhat algarve is doing now or what lagoas may do later he looked toward pekka so did ilmarinen to siuntio she said you would have had a better chance of getting me to do what you wanted if youd talked with me about it first i suppose so he answered but then ilmarinen would be screaming id seduced you however pleasing that prospect may be its not what i had in mind do what you think is right you have an instinct for it i rely on that an instinct for rightness pekka wanted to laugh in the senior theoretical sorcerers face if she had such a gift why werent the experiments going better she glared at him and at ilmarinen they were both older and wiser than she why were they leaving the choice in her hands because with all their age and wisdom they cant agree the answer came back as clearly as if shed shouted the question she shook her head but if im wrong oh if im wrong and they were waiting for her waiting with impatience that grew as she looked from one of them to the other a snap decisionher snap decisionmight turn out to be crucial to the way the war turned out and to the fate of kuusamo for generations to come she almost hated them for putting that burden on her shoulders but there it lay and she had to bear it slowly hesitantly she said they are our allies if they can help us do this thing they had better know what we know ilmarinen scowled siuntio beamed pekka angrily turned away from both of them theyd forced this choice on her now whether she was right or wrong sheand everybody elsewould have to live with it istvan trudged east along a forest path he didnt know what had made the path whatever it was he didnt think it was a man the path wandered and doubled back on itself more than a manmade track would have it hadnt been improved as a manmade track would have either istvans leggings were muddy all the way up to midthigh in proof of that accursed be the unkerlanters he growled as his boots went into yet more mud each one made a wet sucking sound as he pulled it free this stinking forest is bigger than most kingdoms and harder to get through too my guess is they keep it this way on purpose kun said with the mountains in front of it it shields everything beyond from us szonyi grunted may the stars never shine on me again if ive seen even a single piece of unkerlant worth having what do you want to bet the rest of the kingdom is just as worthless wouldnt touch it istvan said at once i would kun said somewhere in unkerlant theres country that grows pretty good soldiers theyve been using them against us and theyve been using them against the algarvians too those goateaters have to come from somewhere as far as istvan was concerned the unkerlanters might have come out from under flat rocks like any other worms and grubs they certainly seemed to come out from under flat rocks in the forest striking the gyongyosians and then slipping away again every few miles they would form a line and fighteither that or when the wind was with them they would start a forest fire and let istvan and his countrymen worry about that instead of any merely human foes something moved in the woods off to istvans left his head whipped around toward it what was that he said sharply raising his hand to keep his squad from moving forward into what might be an ambush i didnt see anything szonyi said almost stepping on his boot heels neither did i that was kun though hed gained corporals rank he still thought enough like a common soldier to enjoy the chance to tell someone superior to him that he was wrong but istvan didnt think he was wrong not this time use your little magic he told kun youll know when someones moving toward us not so aye kun said a little sulkily but i wont be able to tell if hes friend or foe you know about that id better istvan said you almost blazed me for a kuusaman when we were out on that island in the bothnian ocean instead of stuck here in these accursed woods all right then kun said and worked the small quick spellone of the sort a mages apprentice might learn even if his master wasnt inclined to teach him much after a moment he let out a soft grunt of surprise and glanced over to istvan it is a man sergeantnot a beast and not a bit of fluff from your imagination i wish it had been istvan said unhappily now were going to have to hunt the bugger down and find out who he is he waved to his squad into the woods boys no help for it some of the troopers cursed not at him but at their luck kun said i hope its one of our officers some popinjay of a captain or even a colonel by his tone he didnt hope that because he feared to fight an unkerlanter no he hoped to get a chance to give an officer a hard time without fear of punishment and istvan chuckled and said aye hoping for the same chance himself but he stopped chuckling the instant he stepped off the track if the man hed spotted was an unkerlanter as seemed more likely hed have to hunt the fellow down he would almost have sooner gone unarmed after a tiger in this trackless forest the unkerlanters were better at moving unseen and unheard than most gyongyosians if that was an unkerlanter there why had he let istvan see him had he made a mistake swemmels men seldom made that kind of mistake if it wasnt a mistake what was the unkerlanter trying to lure him into the first thing he found himself lured into was mud up to his knees once more cursing wearily he dragged himself out after a considerable search he and his comrades found nothing are you sure your magic knows what its talking about he asked kun aye the sorcerers apprentice answered someone was moving around here sergeant but i dont know who and i dont know where oh huzzah istvan said sourly the son of a whore could be sitting somewhere close by gnawing on a big chunk of goat meat and wed never know the difference eh thats about the size of it kun said i can cast the spell again if you like if hes still moving toward us ill know but i dont think its very likely istvan didnt think it was very likely either but since he couldnt think of anything better to do he said go ahead kun went ahead after a couple of minutes he spread his hands nothing nothing i can find anyhow huzzah istvan repeated so hes past us is he either that or hes sitting tight and not moving toward us kun answered he slapped at a fly that landed on the back of his hand then asked what now it was a good question istvan wished he had a good answer for it he wanted to say lets go back to the path and keep on and forget about it then this whoreson if he is an unkerlanter will be someone elses worry he wanted to say that but discovered he couldnt he had a stubborn streak that refused to let the words pass his lips what came out instead was we keep looking kun nodded a chance streak of sunlight glittered off the gold frames of his spectacles all right sergeant we keep looking that wasnt perfect submission as it would have been in a different tone of voice as things were kun couldnt have been more emphatic about calling istvan an idiot if hed held up a sign istvan knew he was probably wasting his time and his squads as well what with all the ferns and brambles and thorn bushes on the ground the unkerlanter had so many places to hide that the only way to find him would be to stumble over him that thought had hardly crossed his mind before one of his troopers gave a shout that abruptly turned into a cry of pain come on istvan said and scrambled toward the soldier the gyongyosian was down on the ground but not badly hurt that way he said and pointed east istvan heard someone running through the woods he blazed in the direction of the noise it kept on so he must have missed the wounded soldier said i never would have known the goatbugger was there but i tripped over his foot luck istvan muttered it hadnt been good luck for the soldier but it had been for the gyongyosians as a group istvan raised his voice after him keep him running and well run him down either that or well run straight into trouble he thought but the unkerlanter was fleeing whatever hed planned disrupted and so istvan and his comrades pounded after him a beam hissed through the forest steam spurted from a pine bough not too far above istvans head he threw himself flatand landed on his belly in a bramble bush there szonyi shouted from off to his left i saw where he blazed from well blaze him then istvan shouted back no sooner were the words out of his mouth than he crawled through the brambles and briars as fast as he could go if the unkerlanter blazed at the sound of his voice he wanted the fellow blazing in the wrong place again he wondered if the enemy soldier was leading his comrades and him into a trap hed seen no signs of it but he wouldnt not if the unkerlanter knew what he was doing in an odd way it didnt matter with the chase on he and his men could hardly abandon it he scuttled over to a tree ignoring the scratches on his face and arms and the burrs clinging to his tunic and leggings cautiously he peered out from behind the trunkonly for an instant before jerking his head back he wasnt so foolish as to peer twice from the same place that was asking for a beam right between the eyes instead he crawled over to another tree and took a look from behind that one he got lucky he spied the flash from a stick and it wasnt aimed at him he threw his own stick to his shoulder and blazed a harsh voice cried out in pain istvan didnt break cover to finish off the wounded unkerlanter he wasnt sure the fellow really was wounded and he wasnt sure the enemy soldier didnt have friends close by either the most he would do was hurry to another tree closer to the bushes among which the unkerlanter had hidden himself something thrashed in those bushes something the size of a man istvan blazed again his was not the only beam biting the bushes either here and there they withered and turned brown as if stricken by the drought that never came to this forest after a while the thrashing stopped got him somebody said in gyongyosian istvan wasnt so sure hed seen too many wounded unkerlanters who stayed alive for no other reason than the hope of taking a couple of gyongyosians with them king swemmels subjects werent a warrior raceas the stars proclaimed no folk but the men of gyongyos were true warriorsbut they werent soldiers to be despised either gyongyos was learning that the hard way kun strode forward before istvan could shout a warning the mages apprentice went in among the bushes stooped and then rose and waved hes dead he called where are his friends though you fool istvan called back kun started as if jabbed by a pin then dropped down into the bushes again this time he didnt get up right away but no unkerlanters hot for revenge came charging at him he made his way back to the rest of the squad just one of the goateaters szonyi said just one and now hes not there anymore either just one istvan agreed but he tied us up for quite a while he wounded one man and well have to hustle to get back to the path and hustle even harder to catch up with the rest of the company he caused almost as much trouble as if hed blazed us all may the stars be dark on his spirit he trudged back toward the path no one would ever put this down in a history of the war he didnt even know whether to reckon it a success he didnt know whether the war was a success either success or not it went on sunlight sparkled off the greenish blue waters of the strait of valmiera to the north lay the algarvianoccupied mainland of derlavai to the south the great island that held lagoas and kuusamo cornelu looked up into the sky watching for dragons for the moment he saw none he and his lagoan leviathan might have been alone in the ocean and that ocean might have stretched unchecked to the end of the world he wished that were so he knew too well it wasnt he still hadnt given this new leviathan a name one day he told himself one day ill know meanwhile keeping the beast nameless was one more way for the sibian exile to keep lagoas at arms length the leviathan didnt care one way or the other so long as it got plenty of squid and mackerel and those failing sardines it stayed happy cornelu wished the notion of a full belly cheered him as readily at his command the leviathan reared in the water working its great tail to propel the front of its bodyand him with ithigher above the surface of the sea but even with that widened circle of vision he spied no ships that suited him fine he checked the sky againa beautiful sky full of puffy white clouds that drifted across it the way dumplings drifted in soup it remained empty of dragons he wondered how long it would stay that way algarvian beasts flew against lagoas and kuusamo while lagoan and kuusaman dragons visited destruction on the mainland of derlavai sometimes high overhead opposing flights met and fought sometimes a heavy stick or another dragon would wound a dragon over land either before or after it dropped its eggs and the beast and its flier would go into the sea fliers hoping for rescue could live for a while in the water leyline ships werent much good for rescuing them if a flier came down on a ley line they could scoop him up aye but the greater part of the ocean was closed to them oldfashioned sailboats and leviathans both of which could travel anywhere did far better in such missions and so cornelu traveled with two crystals on this patrol one was attuned to lagoan dragonflight headquarters back in setubal the messages he got from it would direct him to lagoan fliers who went into the strait of valmiera the other crystal had been captured from an algarvian and was attuned to the emanations the enemy used any algarvian dragonflier cornelu captured and brought back to lagoas was one who wouldnt fly again for king mezentio somewhere out in the strait no doubt were algarvian leviathanriders with captured lagoan crystals there were stories about clashes when men from both sides raced to rescue a downed dragonflier cornelu hadnt been in any of those in fact the next dragonflier he brought back would be his first he understood how war could be that kind of business he also understood that the algarvians would have been happier if their ships and leviathans dominated the strait of valmiera and their dragons dominated the sky above it that meant watching the sky not just for flights of dragons heading south but also for hunters looking for him and others like him he felt easier after the sun plunged blazing into the sea even with a nearly full moon in the sky he didnt have to worry so much about algarvian maraudersor about lagoan marauders who might mistake him for the foe the leviathan liked patrolling at night too for larger fish came nearer the surface than they did during the day attention attention that was one of the crystals he carried but which he had to pause and remember that hed understood the call without having to think about italgarvian was much closer to his native sibian than was lagoan excitement tingled through him as he brought the captured crystal to his ear to listen better an urgent algarvian was saying he went into the water after the raid on branco we were halfway back to our base at kursiu and his dragon just couldnt fly anymore poor creature noted on the map another algarvian replied will send rescuers as fast as we can hes a good fellow the algarvian dragonflier said earnestly he doesnt deserve to drown all alone no he deserves worse than that cornelu muttered branco lay east of setubal and kursiu he pulled out a map printed on waterproofed silk and held it close to his face to read it in the moonlight after a moment he put it away with a soft grunt he wasnt far from where that dragonflier had gone down finding him wouldnt be easy not in the dark but it wouldnt be easy for the algarvians either it ought to be worth a try cornelu tapped the leviathan it began a search spiral lagoans trained their beasts to spiral widdershins not deasil as leviathans turned in the sibian navy cornelu knew it didnt really make a coppers worth of difference but he couldnt help thinking his mount was going in the wrong direction trying to retrain the leviathan to sibian practice would probably just confuse it though help me came from the algarvian crystal so loud and clear that cornelu thought for a moment hed come upon the dragonflier without realizing it the fellow went on dont know how much longer i can stay afloat an officer cornelu thought a squadron leader or a flight leader at the least to have a crystal of his own that made capturing him all the more important cornelus hand slipped to the knife he wore on his belt if he couldnt bring the algarvian back to lagoas hed make very sure the fellow never flew for mezentio again help me the dragonflier said again he couldnt be very far away not when cornelu was receiving the emanations from his crystal so clearly at cornelus command the leviathan lifted the front of its body into the air again the sibian peered across the moonlit sea looking for someone bobbing in the water the leviathan turned this way and that enjoying the display of strength cornelu found nothing but frustration till there by the powers above he muttered and sent the leviathan racing west when he drew near he called out to the man struggling in the water here to me hurry he spoke in algarvian trilling the r sounds instead of pronouncing them in the back of his throat as he would have in his own language hurrah the downed dragonflier shouted and swam with sudden surprising strength to the leviathan hope of rescue powered him like a shot of strong spirits give me your knife cornelu said still in algarvian dont want any accidents happening to my beast youre the boss the algarvian said and passed him the weapon if you think im going to argue with the fellow who fishes me out of the drink youre daft good cornelu said hold tight to the harness there i cant do that for you and were still a long way from home too far the algarvian said aye too stinking far i thought id be able to nurse my dragon across the strait after that accursed lagoan flamed him but no such luck he sank like a stone when we went into the water the nasty creature and i wont miss him a bit dragonfliers always talked like that they had nothing but scorn for their mounts cornelu had never understood why they wanted to fly them in the first place he set his hand on his leviathans smooth back a leviathan now a leviathan responded all a dragon gave you was trouble hang on he told the algarvian again the fellow would not have any kind of sorcerous protection against the sea he might yet freeze before cornelu could bring him to landalthough lying against the warm length of the leviathan would help keep him going at cornelus command the great beast swam south toward lagoas cornelus eyes slid toward the dragonflier how alert was he would he realize what was going on before the lagoans took him off to a captives camp cornelu hoped nothis own life would be easier if the algarvian kept on thinking hed been rescued not captured for the first half hour or so everything went as smoothly as the sibian could have wanted but then the dragonflier looked back toward the moon which hung in the northwestern skyand away from which the leviathan was swimming i hate to tell you my dear fellow but home is that way mezentio pointed northward as if certain cornelu had made a foolish mistake and would turn around once it was pointed out to him getting ready once more to pull out his knife cornelu answered no algarve is that way my home iswasin sibiu and im taking you to lagoas he let his native growl come out as he spoke why you son of a whore in the moonlight the algarvians face was a shadowed mask of astonishment you cheated me ruse of war cornelu said calmly ill tell you what if you dont like it you can let go and swim back to algarve go right ahead i wont stop you for a moment he thought the dragonflier would let go cornelu wouldnt have missed a moments sleep if the fellow had then the algarvian shifted as if thinking about attacking him instead cornelu did draw the knife its blade gleamed the dragonflier cursed no wonder you wanted me to give you my dagger no wonder at all cornelu agreed but you really dont want to try anything stupid you must know the sorts of magic leviathanriders get all i have to do is make the beast stay down longer than you can hold your breath the algarvian didnt lack for nerve suppose i let go then you get to swim home same as before cornelu answered or if you annoy me enough you make about two bites for a leviathan curse you the algarvian said glumly all right its a captives camp for me i wish i could have dropped an egg on your head a year ago cornelu shrugged then youd be drowning about now or maybe a shark or a wild leviathan would have found you before you went under you ought to thank me not curse me id thank you if you were one of my countrymen the dragonflier said you didnt sound like a stinking sib ive studied algarvian cornelu said we know our enemies it didnt help you the dragonflier replied he didnt know how close he came to dying in that instant cornelu was within a hairs breadth of drowning him only the thought that the fellow might have useful information stayed his hand the algarvian went on besides you sibs are algarvic too you shouldnt be fighting king mezentio you should join him in the real battle the battle against unkerlant no thanks cornelu told him getting your kingdom invaded says a lot about whom you ought to be fighting you dont understand the algarvian dragonflier insisted i understand well enough cornelu said and i understand whos got whom here to that the algarvian dragonflier had no answer at cornelus urging the leviathan kept swimming south on toward lagoas along with the rest of the men in his training platoon sidroc ran through the forest his legs ached his lungs burned sweat poured off him he dared not slow even if he did feel as if he were coming to pieces the algarvian drill instructors assigned to turn plegmunds brigade into a real fighting outfit seemed to be made of metal and magic they never got tired and they never failed to noticeand to punisha mistake forward one of them shoutedin algarvian of courseas he trotted along beside the forthwegian recruits keep moving both of those were standard algarvian commands sidroc had expected the redheads would make him into a soldier before joining the brigade he hadnt thought they would make him into an algarvianspeaking soldier he wished hed studied harder at the academy he splashed through a stream the edge of the forest lay not far ahead he and his comrades had run this route before once they got out from under the trees they had less than a mile to go to get back to their tents faster the algarvian shouted if i go any faster ill fall over dead sidroc thought resentfully the algarvians were even worse than uncle hestan for making him do things he didnt want to do hed paid hestan back paid him in blood leofsigs blood he hadnt really intended to kill his cousin but he wasnt sorry he had either leofsig had been another one who made him feel like dirt just because he wasnt a lousy kaunianlover he cursed well wasntand neither was leofsig not any more sidroc burst out of the trees and into the sunshine beyond he could see the tents aheadand the arch through which he and his comrades would have to run to get to them he wished he were still back near eoforwic but the whole regiment in training had gone to this camp in the uplands of southern forthweg only days after the algarvian authorities got him out of gaol in gromheort another shout from the algarvian drillmaster keep moving he added something to the standard command this time something sidroc didnt quite catch he did gather the last man from the company into the camp would regret it he made his legs pound on already he was discovering he could get far more out of his body than hed ever imagined ishouldn t have let leofiig give me a hard time for as long as i did he thought ishould have whaled the stuffing out of ealstan too well maybe the day will come as he neared the arch he noted with fierce pride that only a couple of dozen men were still ahead of him passing another one he looked back over his shoulder the rest of the company was strung out almost all the way back to the woods whatever the algarvian had threatened he didnt have to worry about itthis time above the arch stood a sign whose stark black letters on white announced an equally stark message we are born to die sidroc wished he didnt have to look at that message every time he came in from an exercise he liked the slogan on the other side of the sign the one he saw going out better we serve plegmunds brigade that was what hed signed up to do and hed cursed well do it he stopped running as soon as he passed under the arch what he wanted to do next was fall on the ground and pass out had he been foolish enough to try it an algarvian drillmaster or one of the men in the company would have booted him to his feet he could go over to the unicorn trough and splash cold water on his face then dripping he took his place in the ranks and waited for the rest of the company to come in the last staggering soldier did collapse once he got under the arch and sure enough the algarvian drillmaster whod gone with the company on its runand who hardly seemed to be breathing hardkicked him till he managed to force himself upright again tired are you wiglaf the drillmaster said in fluent forthwegian you just think youre tired maybe after you dig us a new slit trench youll really be tired what do you think even sidroc who liked to mouth off knew better than to answer a question like that but the luckless wiglaf said have a heart sir i without visible malice and without hesitation the redheaded drillmaster kicked him again no back talk he growled we are going to make you the finest fighting men in the worldafter algarvians of course orders are meant to be obeyed get moving now wiglaf could barely move but stumbled off toward the latrines sidroc nudged the fellow next to him a scarfaced bruiser name ceorl poor miserable whoreson he murmured almost imperceptibly ceorl nodded silence in the ranks the drillmaster bellowed sidroc and ceorl both froze into immobility if the algarvianwho might have had eyes and ears in the back of his headhad spotted them they were liable to end up digging slit trenches with wiglaf but luck was with them the redhead contented himself with glaring this way and that before snarling dismissed to queue for supper till he heard that sidroc would have bet he was too worn to want anything to do with food his belly had other ideas somehow it propelled him forward so that he was third in line and had his tin mess kit out and waiting ceorl was right behind him and chuckled a little wiglafs going to miss supper too too bad sidroc had scant sympathy to waste on anyone but sidroc if hes not worth anything in drills odds are he wont be worth anything in a fight either he held out the mess tray a forthwegian cook filled it with barley mush with onions and mushrooms and with a sharp rather nasty cheese melted into it sidroc hardly cared what the stuff tasted like he wolfed it down and could have eaten three times as much he needed fuel for his belly no less than a baker needed it for his ovens somebody with a soft heart or more likely a soft head went off to share his supper with wiglaf sidroc wouldnt have done that he didnt suppose anyone would have done it for him either expecting nothing from those around him he seldom found himself disappointed after supper came language drills the algarvians were even more ruthless than schoolmasters about pounding their languageor standard commands in it anyhowinto the men of plegmunds brigade youll be serving alongside algarvians likely under algarvians the instructor growled at them if you dont understand orders youll get them killedand yourselves too of course he added as if a few forthwegians were of but small import by the time language lessons ended it was dark sidroc found his cot pulled off his boots and was instantly asleep clamor woke him attack someone screamed he put on his boots again grabbed his kit and stumbled rubbing his eyes out into the darkness it was only another drill of course but he and his comrades had to respond to it as if it were real and it bit time out of precious sleep as if it were real too when shrill whistles summoned the company to assembly the next morning sidroc felt more dead than alive after roll call he ate hard bread and cheap olive oil for breakfast breakfast was without a doubt the most relaxed meal of the day he and his comrades gabbed and complained and told as many lies as they could think of one thing they didnt do they didnt ask why their tentmates their squadmates had joined the brigade no one sidroc had discovered did that the rule was unwritten but might have been all the stronger for that he had no trouble seeing the reason behind it some men had taken service under algarvian leadership for the sake of adventure or because they hated unkerlanters sidroc knew that volunteering information wasnt against the rules but some of the men in the brigade were plainly ruffians or robbers or worsehe wouldnt have wanted to meet ceorl in a dark alley for that matter few people would have wanted to meet him in a dark alley either one thing united the men of the brigadeand it too was a thing of which they did not speak sidroc knewthey all knew they all had to know most forthwegians despised them for the choice theyd made sidroc didnt care what most forthwegians thought so he told himself over and over again on a good day he could make himself believe it for a while form up an algarvian drillmaster called another command delivered in standard form the redhead who carried a shouldered stick marched his charges out of the camp he pointed to a hill overgrown with bushes about half a mile away and switched to forthwegian thats the place you have to take you have to be sneaky and sly do you understand me aye sir sidroc shouted with everyone else sneaky and sly good the drillmaster nodded approval im going to turn my back for a while when i turn around again i dont want to see you if i do see you ill try and blaze you i wont try to kill you but my aims not perfect you dont want to make me do anything wed both be sorry for later have you got that aye sir sidroc yelled again hed done this drill before once the drillmaster had come within a couple of inches of blazing off his nose he didnt want to give the algarvian an excuse for doing it again when the fellow ostentatiously turned his back sidroc dove into the bushes and did his best to disappear he couldnt just stay there though he had to move forward to get up to the crest of the hill he scrambled from one bush to another rarely going from his belly up to his knees never going from his knees to his feet before long the drillmaster did start blazing somebody let out a shrieka shriek of fear not one of pain the algarvian laughed like a man having altogether too good a time sidroc drew only one beam as he crawled through the brush it wasnt even a near miss he felt good at attracting so little notice one thing the algarvians had made very plain during these endless drills plegmunds brigade would be going where people would do their level best to kill everyone in it from bush to boulder to tree stump to bush to at last the top of the hill sidroc looked down at himself hed got filthy on the way but he didnt care for one thing that proved he was doing a good job for another someone else would have to wash his long tunic another member of the brigade a corporal named waleran emerged from cover a moment after sidroc did he was good sidroc hadnt had the least idea he was there till he showed himself thats a fine exercise he said flicking a drop of sweat from the end of his nose they never worked us so hard in king pendas levy and thats the truth no eh sidroc said if waleran was a veteran that helped explain how hed got to be a corporal if they had maybe forthweg wouldve done better aye it could be so waleran agreed it could indeed but ill tell you this boywell go through the unkerlanters like a hot knife through butter sidroc nodded he was sure of the same thing himself if hed doubted it would he have joined plegmunds brigade in the first place he had no use for unkerlanters any more than he did for kaunians or except when it came to fighting algarvians or anyone else who wasnt a forthwegian but he said king swemmels in charge of an awful lot of butter well what if he is waleran said scornfully well just have more to go through thats all and ill tell you something else too he waited till sidroc leaned toward him then went on i dont think itll be long before we get the chance either sidroc clapped his hands together he could hardly wait some of the farms around the village of pavilosta had a new hand or two working on them merkelas did as for skarnu he was glad to have extra help and especially glad the help came from forthwegian kaunians whod been on their way to almost certain destruction these days raunu slept downstairs in the farmhouse leaving the barn for vatsyunas and pernavai a husbandandwife pair whod managed to stay together when the leyline caravan carrying them got wrecked youll have to find yourself a lady friend too skarnu teased him one day while they were weeding together then youll have somewhere better to sleep than a rolledup blanket in front of the fire powers above if i managed to find somebody cursed near anyone can the veteran underofficer snorted a blanket suits me fine captain he answered as for the ladies well if you know a blind one she might think i suited well enough he ran a hand over his tough battered features youre not homely skarnu said on the whole sincerely youre distinguishedlooking thats what you are raunu snorted again and ill tell you what distinguishes me too that none of the ladies wants to look at me shows how much you know skarnu answered take pernava now if she doesnt reverence the ground you walk on its not the same raunu shook his head she looks at you the same way its because we took her and vatsunu in instead of giving em to the cursed redheads thats all its not because shes hot for us she isntshes got him instead like skarnu he used the valmieran forms of pernavai and vatsyunas names not the classical versions theyd worn in forthweg having ordinary names kept them from drawing algarvian notice and skarnu had to admit the justice of raunus comment all right he said but shes not the only woman around either youve got a woman and youre happy so you think everybody needs one raunu said me im fine without thanks and when the itch gets strong i can go into pavilosta and scratch it without spending a whole lot of silver skarnu threw his hands in the air ill shut up he said this is one argument im not going to wini can see that he picked up his hoe which had fallen down between rows of ripening barley and beheaded several dandelions growing in a little clump dont just let them lie there raunu warned him merkelall use the leaves for salad greens i know skarnu picked up the dandelions and stuffed them into his belt pouch this farm was fine for two and its done pretty well for three things are liable to be lean if its got to feed five though every little bit helps pemava and vatsunu dont eat as much as two regular valmierans would raunu said they look at what merkela sets out like theyve never seen so much food in all their born days by the look of them they havent seen much food any time lately thats for sure skarnu said and raunu nodded skarnus hand gripped the hoe handle as if it were an algarvians neck and from what they say about the way the redheads treat our kind back in forthweg he grimaced and hacked down some more weeds these inedible raunu nodded once more aye if i hadnt wanted to go on fighting mezentios men before hearing the stories from forthweg would tip me over the edge tip me no by the powers aboveitd throw me over the edge me too skarnu said but not everyone felt that way for the life of him he couldnt understand why some of the farmers around pavilosta were only too glad to let the algarvians have the forthwegian kaunians whod escaped into the countryside when the leyline caravan was sabotaged some of the local peasants let it go at that others went out of their way to betray fugitives to the redheads vatsyunas and pernavai werent safe even here if one of those locals should walk by and spy them working in merkelas fields if that happened the algarvians were all too likely to learn this farm was a center of local resistance logically skarnu supposed that meant he and merkela and raunu should have sent the kaunian couple from forthweg packing when they came out of the woods lost and hungry and afraid somehow logic hadnt had much to do with it then with shouldered hoes skarnu and raunu trudged toward the farmhouse when the sun sank in the west vatsyunas was feeding the chickens pernavai weeding with merkela in the herb garden near the house neither of them had known the first thing about farming before war swallowed forthweg hed been a dentist and shed taken care of their two children and those of several of their neighbors they didnt know where the children were now the two girls hadnt come out of the wreck of the leyline caravan vatsyunas and pernavai hoped they still lived but didnt sound as if they believed it and now they are come in home from their moils and toils vatsyunas said in what he thought was valmieran and so it was after a fashion valmieran as it might have been spoken centuries before when it remained much closer to classical kaunian than it was these days neither the dentist nor his wife had known any of the modern language when they arrived now they could make themselves understood but no one would ever believe valmieran was their native tongue merkela got up and dusted off the knees of her trousers im going in to have a look at the stew she said i killed that henyou know the one i mean skarnu the one that wasnt giving us more than an egg a week aye that ones better off dead skarnu said merkela had made such calculations before now they took on a new urgency if she was wrong too often people would go hungry the farm had less margin for error than before the fugitives came chicken stew bread to sop up the gravy ale peasant food skarnu thought that was what he would have called it the edge of a sneer in his voice back in priekule he wouldnt have been wrong but the sneer would have been it tasted good and filled his belly past that what more could a man want nothing skarnu could think of vatsyunas said i had liefer drink wine at meats buthe took a long pull at his cup of alehaving gone so long without much in the way of either wine or aliment im not fain to play the ungrateful cull the now just listening to him made skarnu smile his speech improved week by week eventually skarnu hoped he would sound pretty much like everyone else meanwhile he was a lesson in how the valmieran language had got to be the way it was today after another long draught vatsyunas set the cup down empty he said what i am fain for is vengeance gainst the scurvy coystril knaves the flamehaired barbarians of algarve who used me so he looked from raunu to merkela to skarnu can it be done without foolishly flinging away the life with which you gifted me anew on taking in my lady and me pernavai spoke very quietly i too would have revenge on them she was so pale she looked almost bloodless skarnu wondered what mezentios men had done to her then he wondered if vatsyunas knew everything the redheads had done to her that was a question to which he doubted hed find an answer he didnt quite know what to tell the escaped kaunians from forthweg who didnt know hed been one of the people whod wrecked the leyline caravan that carried them cautiously he said all of valmiera cries out for vengeance against the algarvians no pernavai and vatsyunas spoke together her golden hair flew round her head as she shook it vatsyunas was bald but somehow managed to look as if he were bristling even so he said did you speak sooth why would the countryside not seethe with strife why are so many here so glad to give over to the red wolves their kinsfolk from the distant occident why an what we hear be true do so many here give themselves to the conquerors body and soul pernavai added her words were bitter as wormwood to skarnu who remembered the news sheet listing his sister with that algarvian colonel what did the whoreson call himself lurcanio that was it one day skarnu thought ill have a reckoning with krasta but that would be true only if lurcanio had no reckoning with him meanwhile meanwhile merkela spoke up while he was still contemplating his own embarrassment we have traitors aye when the time comes well give them what they deserve she raised her proud chin drew a thumbnail across her throat and made a horrible gargling noise some have gotten it already in sooth vatsyunas breathed and merkela nodded the dentist from forthweg asked know you then at whose hands these treacherous wretches of whom you speak lie dead right gladly would i join with them for to commence the requital of that which can never be requited and i pernavai spoke less than her husband but sounded no less determined before either skarnu or merkela could answer raunu said even if we knew anything about that wed have to be careful about saying very much what people dont know nobody can squeeze out of em think you wed betray vatsyunas began angrily but he fell silent when his wife touched his arm they spoke back and forth in quick classical kaunian for them a birthspeech as usual skarnu could make out words but rarely sentences as he seized one phrase two more would slip past him after perhaps half a minute vatsyunas returned to his archaismlittered version of valmieran i am persuaded you have reason i crave you pardon for mine earlier hasty speech dont worry about it skarnu spoke as he might have in his days as an officer on pardoning a soldier for some minor offense vatsyunas gave him a measuring stare only then did he realize the kaunian from forthweg might have recognized that tone for what it was and might have drawn his own conclusions from it skarnu decided that wasnt so bad if he could trust any man he could trust vatsyunas if i can trust any man someonesomeone who wore patriots maskhad betrayed the meeting of resistance leaders at tytuvenai no one knew whoor if anyone did skarnu hadnt heard about it he praised the powers above that no algarvian patrol had swept down on this farm having vatsyunas and pernavai here made such a visit more likely he knew as much so did merkela so did raunu skarnu poured himself more ale from the pitcher some risks werent just worth taking some had to be taken seven colonel lurcanio chucked krasta under the chin she hated that it made her feel as if she were a child but from lurcanio she endured it as the carriage rolled toward valmieras royal palace lurcanio said this should be a gay gathering tonight for you maybe krasta replied lurcanio gave her a longer leash for what she said than for what she did i dont see the sport in watching king gainibu crawl into a brandy bottle nosefirst do you not my sweet lurcanio sounded genuinely surprised his father presided over algarves humiliation after the six years war since the father is no longer among the living we have to avenge ourselves on the son he chuckled with the way gainibu drinks i must say he helps the driver had no trouble tonight picking his way through priekules dark avenues as they pulled up in front of the palace the redheaded soldier spoke to lurcanio in their own language lurcanio laughed and said something back he turned to krasta he says hes going to do some drinking too while he waits for us to come out i told him he had my leave its not as if he were a king to do it on his own krasta made cruel jokes like that herself they were almost the only jokes she did make she enjoyed them less when however justly they were aimed at the man she still thought of as her sovereign lurcanio seldom let such considerations worry him he handed her down from the carriage and his night sight seemingly as good as an owls led her to the palace once past the doors and curtains that kept light from leaking out krasta blinked against the glare servitors gave her and her companion precisely calibrated bows she was a marchioness and lurcanio only a count but he was an algarvian and she only a local so they bent fractionally lower for him than for her that had irked her the first time it happened and still irked her now by the way lurcanio smiled he knew it irked her too a herald bawled out their names as they strode into the grand salon where gainibu was receiving his guests as usual krasta scanned the room to see what sort of crowd it was and where she fit into it at first she thought it was very much the usual sort valmieran noblemen algarvian soldiers and the tarts some noble some notwho clung to their arms and smiled at their jokes then off in one corner of the salon she noticed an algarvian in tunic and kilt of civilian cut surrounded by six or eight valmieran men some of them quite disreputablelooking they all ignored the receiving line that led up to king gainibu and to the always full glass in his free hand most of them were holding glasses too and their talktheir arguments reallybid fair to drown out everything else who are those people krasta asked irritably you have not made the acquaintance of the algarvian comptroller of publications lurcanio returned if i had would i be asking about him krasta tossed her head well that explains why the others the valmierans are acting the way they are what can you expect from a pack of writers i wonder how many of them will take spoons home in their pockets some very good work has been done since we took charge of publications lurcanio said krasta shrugged she hadnt read very much before the algarvians overran valmiera and she still didnt lurcanio went on before the war iroldo there used to teach algarvian at a college in some valmieran provincial town he knows your writers well and wants to get the best from them well of course krasta said that makes algarve look good too lurcanio started to say something stopped and then said something else altogether every so often you come out with something surprisingly astute if you did it more often it would cause me more concern what do you mean krasta hardly heard what hed said shed spotted viscount valnu and was waving across the salon at him never mind chuckling a little lurcanio gave her backside an indulgent pat go and see your friend if the two of you hadnt been out talking together who knows what might have happened when that egg burst at the reception the duke of klaipedas nephew was putting on krasta didnt like to think about that she was much happier thinking about cuckolding lurcanio with valnu her algarvian loverand keeper thought valnu liked boys valnu as a matter of fact probably did like boys but he liked women too of that krasta had no doubt whatever he gave her a dazzling smile as she came up to him it made him look like a suave affable skull hello darling he said and kissed her on the cheek hello yourself krasta said coolly she let valnu introduce her to his friends most of them young algarvian officers at least as pretty as he was they were polite but none of them seemed interested in krasta for her own sake a couple of them gave valnu sidelong glances as if wondering how he could possibly find a woman appealing as if to explain himself he said we were having a drink together the marchioness and i outside that mansion when the saboteurs egg burst inside it if wed stayed there we might both have been killed ah the algarvian officers said almost in one breath they could accept a twist of fate as an explanation where mere animal attraction would have offended them krasta had to work not to laugh in their faces as shed known more about valnu than lurcanio did so she also knew more about him than did these fellows he took her by the arm lets get something to drink and you can tell me how youve been since the pretty algarvian officers rolled their eyes again krasta had to hold in a laugh as valnu steered her toward the bar she stroked his cheek and archly murmured are you going to sneak me out of here a minute before this place goes up in flames too he stopped which rather surprised her i hadnt planned on it no he replied in unwontedly serious tones then he grinned and added if that happens tonight itll catch both of us by surpriseand a lot of other people too he waved to one of the tapmen ale for me aye sirale the fellow said and for you milady brandy with wormwood krasta told him after a couple of shots of that she would have an excuse for any sort of outrageous behavior shed been pretty outrageous the last time she drank it with valnu back in the days when valmiera was still a kingdom in its own right and not an algarvian appanage having at last been eased from the receiving line king gainibu had made a beeline for the bar he waved to the man behind it the same for me as the lady here is having he said only the slow precision of his diction marked how much hed already poured down as the bartender handed him the glass of bluegreen spirits he remarked soon i will find a chair and go to sleep then the algarvians will be happy and so will i valnu steered krasta away from the sodden king as hed steered her away from the algarvian officers thats not the way a sovereign should talk he said thats not the way a sovereign should have to talk no i dont think so either krasta said hes a laughingstock for the redheads the worst part is he knows it sensitive to slights herselfor at least to being on the receiving end of themshe had some notion of how poor drunken gainibu had to feel every now and then my dear you do succeed in surprising me valnu said this makes twice in one night really krasta laughed sure enough the spiked brandy was mounting straight to her head lurcanio said the same thing though i think i only surprised him once well he is bound to be harder to surprise than i am valnu said practically everything surprises me including my being here at this doleful gathering its like the bloodied ghost of what one of these affairs should be krasta thought about that she wasnt used to figures of speechthose that hadnt ossified into clichés at any ratebut she had no trouble figuring out what this one meant hard times she agreed nodding but what can we do the algarvians are stronger than we are the algarvians as far as i can see are stronger than everybody else is so they want you to think valnu said so they want everybody to think its part of their magic thinking them stronger than everybody else helps make them stronger than everybody else but there are some faces ive seen before in these crows that arent here tonight so krasta said vaguely sure enough the brandy was making her thoughts spin before long she might be looking for a chair just like her sovereign valnu bowed himself almost double im so relieved to discover you dont know everything there is to know after all where i ask you are the algarvian officers who were here but are no more why gone to unkerlant of course king swemmel you see isnt yet convinced the algarvians are stronger than everybody else captain mosco krasta exclaimed he wasnt here because hed had to go there that seemed sensible enough she wished valnu wouldnt try to make something important and meaningful out of it she wasnt up to dealing with complications right now who is captain mosco valnu asked krasta stared owlishly at him how could he not know captain mosco was my aide a very good fellow colonel lurcanio said in his precise almost unaccented valmieran he has gone to fight in the west powers above grant that he stay safe i didnt notice you come up krasta told lurcanio she hadnt noticed a good many things since drinking the laced brandy one of the things she hadnt noticed was how many things she hadnt noticed lurcanio said seeing a friend is all very well milady but i did want to remind you that you came here with me and will also be going home with me valnu shrieked laughter and patted lurcanio on the arm why my dear colonel i do believe youre jealous lurcanios answering laugh was smug the laugh of a man certain he had nothing to fear krastas laugh was wild and dangerousand so drunken that lurcanio didnt let it worry him in the least if valnus laugh was relieved neither krasta nor lurcanio noticed did you have a good time lurcanio asked as they went home through the dark quiet streets of priekule later that evening the poor king krasta answered she would have a dreadful headache in the morning king gainibu though would surely have a worse one krasta slumped over against lurcanio and fell asleep how long would the good weather last on the austral continent people started asking that not long after the summer solstice before long the birds would start flying north fernao wished he could fly north too but the war against yanina and algarve pinned him to the land of the ice people just think he said to affonso if everything had gone as wed hoped it wouldthe way everybody back in setubal said it wouldwe could be enjoying the fleshpots of heshbon right now the secondrank mage raised a gingery eyebrow i thought you told me heshbon was a miserable hole in the ground oh it is fernao assured him it is but what i pray you do you think youre sitting in now affbnso laughed though it wasnt really funny lagoan attacks and algarvian counterattacks had chewed up a good deal of the coastal country in the land of the ice people fernao and affonso had both taken refuge in the crater a bursting egg from some earlier fight had left in the ground at the bottom of it were a little grass a little water and much more muddy ice next to a literal hole in the ground fernao said in meditative tones a metaphorical hole in the ground doesnt look so bad any more or will you tell me im wrong affonso shook his head i wouldnt dream of it how could i you outrank me but i will say that if wed taken heshbon it probably would have got wrecked in the fighting that depends fernao said if wed taken it from the yaninans they would have handed it over and been glad to do it with the algarvians though youre right those whoresons would have fought us block by blocknot that heshbon has a whole lot of blocksand there wouldnt have been one brick left on top of another by the time the battle was through now affonso nodded though gloomily who would have thought a pack of swaggering fops could make such good soldiers they did in the six years war too fernao said they are brave no ones ever said otherwise but they dont know when to stop they never know when to stop thats why we have to beat them to make sure they dont go on doing just as they please all over the world i mean i understood you his colleague said whenever they slaughter another batch of kaunians the whole world seems to tremble for those who can feel it and theyve got the unkerlanters imitating them too i think ill have nightmares for the rest of my life war was a filthy business before fernao said its filthier now and weve got mezentios men to blame for it many of his worst nightmares centered on camels and all the ways it could be cooked he kept dreaming he would be asked to judge which was worst and to sample them all till he made a choice he had some camel baked in clay in his pack and thought it the most dreadful thing in the world save only hunger whatever affonso might have said about war or about camel meat or about anything else he didnt for a lookout shouted one of the words the lagoans in the austral continent least wanted to hear dragons fernao looked to the west the number of dragons winging toward the lagoan encampment made him curse the whoresons have flown more of the beasts across the narrow sea he said in dismay he looked at the hole in which he squatted wishing it were deeper wishing it had a good strong roof wishing most of all that the algarvians would turn around and fly back toward heshbon as usual he got none of his wishes several lagoan and kuusaman dragons flew above the lagoan army with a whistling thunder of wingsand with their usual hoarse angry shrieksmore rose from the dragon farm near the camp to challenge the beasts painted in red green and white watching affonso said makes you feel helpless doesnt it what because i cant do anything about the dragons fernao asked and affonso nodded fernao considered then shrugged less than i thought it would as a matter of fact there are too many things in this campaign i cant do anything about to get upset over any one in particular ill just watch the sport and hope i dont get killed he leaned back and did just that algarvians are trying something new looks like affonso said aye fernao answered absently the lead dragons flying out of the west engaged the lagoan and kuusaman defenders with the usual ferocity mezentios men brought to the attack dragons wheeled and whirled and twisted and snapped and flamed all over the sky above the lagoan army whenever the lagoans heavy sticks on the ground found targets they blazed at the algarvian dragons when one of those beasts tumbled toward the earth fernao couldnt tell whether a stick or a dragon on his side had laid it low but mezentios men had more dragons than theyd been able to bring to the fight before some of them kept the lagoan and kuusaman dragons busy the rest started dropping eggs on the lagoan army only a few dragons from his side broke free to attack the ones carrying eggs once the eggs started falling fernao stopped watching the action overhead he did what everyone else on the ground was doing he buried his face in the dirt and tried to mold himself to the side of the hole in which he lay affonso jumped into one nearby such precautions had kept them alive and no worse than scratched till now that they should do so one more time didnt strike fernao as unreasonable then a line of eggs probably all dropped by the same dragon walked straight toward the crater in which he huddled each burst was louder than the one before each made the ground shake worse when one hit quite close to that crater fernao screamed he couldnt help himself he was still screaming when the next egg burst the world around him went blinding white then black and when he woke he screamed again every inch of him cried out in agony the worst of it was concentrated in a couple of places his right leg his left arm take it easy friend somebody told himfar and away the most useless advice hed ever heard he would have said so but he needed all his breath for screaming his mouth tasted of mud and increasingly of blood he hadnt thought he could shriek louder than he was shrieking but discovered he was wrong when they went about setting his leg and bandaging some of his other wounds no he howled but they wouldnt listen he choked out two coherent sentences let me die kill me they wouldnt listen to that either they talked above him as if he werent there hes not going to make it one of them said not with the kind of healing we can give him in the field hes a firstrank mage another one answered the kingdom cant afford to lose him they didnt ask fernaos opinion hed given it and theyd ignored it how are we supposed to get him back to lagoas though the first voice said a dragon cant fly that far not without somewhere to rest on the way weve got ships down south of sibiu the second voice replied they were going to fly more dragons here i wish theyd done it sooner but we can send him that way and then east from there i wouldnt bet on him to last long enough to get slung under a dragon the first voice said fernao devoutly hoped he wouldnt last that long but the second voice said get a mage and slow him down its the only chance hes got they both went away after that the next voice fernao heard was affonsos ill do what i can he was saying to somebody off to the side just fool luck he isnt doing the same for me the burst picked him up and flung him into a rock fernao can you hear me aye fernao answered the next scream quivered in his throat as eager to be loose as a racing unicorn im going to slow you down affonso said i have to hope the spell will last long enough to get you to a ship where the dragon can rest theyll have a mage there to renew it so just give yourself to the magic let it take you let it sweep you away fernao wished it would sweep him into oblivion after what seemed far too long it did but when he woke he was in just as much torment as he had been before affonso began the spell for a moment he forgot the magic altogether lost as he was in his own pain then he realized that added to all his other torments he was swaying suspended in space instead of affonso he saw a dragons scaly belly above him when he turned his headactually when it flopped to one sidehe got a view of irongray ocean far below he never knew how long the dragon kept flying long enough for him to wish several times he were deadhe knew that thanks to or rather on account of affonsos spell no time seemed to have passed for him between the magic and his awakening he hadnt healed a bit in the interim at last after what seemed like a little longer than forever the dragon glided down to a ship sliding along a ley line as dragons had a way of doing it landed clumsily the pallet on which hed been lashed thudded down onto the deck the jolt made him shriek and faint unfortunatelyor so he thought of ithe woke up again when he did a man hed never seen before was staring down at him ill soon have you out again the stranger promised i hope my spell will hold long enough to get you back to lagoas theyll put you together again powers above willing youll be good as new again in a while fernao couldnt imagine being as good as new again he had trouble even imagining being conscious and out of pain hurts he groaned oh i bet it does the ships mage said now just give yourself to the magic let it take you let it sweep you away again oblivion descended on fernao again it swept over him so abruptly he had no idea it was there again he woke to agonybut agony of a different sort for now he found himself on a soft bed with a cast on his leg another on his arm and a bandage round his battered ribs when he whimpered a nurse said here drink this drink it he did hoping it was poison it wasnt it tasted overwhelmingly of poppy seeds it was so concentrated he wondered if he could keep it down somehow he did after a while the pain receded no he thought dreamily its still there but ive floated away from it with the drug in him it didnt seem to matter so much nothing seemed to matter very much where am i he asked he didnt particularly care about the answer either but asking about anything but the pain that had crushed him seemed a delightful novelty setubal the nurse told him ah fernao said with any luck at all ill never leave again then the poppy juice made him sleep a natural sleep different from the timefrozen comas the emergency sorcery had brought on little by little his body began to repair itself king swemmels long pale face stared out of the crystal straight at marshal rathar everywhere in the broad kingdom of unkerlanteverywhere the algarvians hadnt overrun at any ratepeasants and soldiers and townsfolk who could get to a crystal were listening to the king durrwangen has fallen swemmel said without preamble unkerlant is in danger we tell you that some of the soldiers who were posted there ran away instead of doing all they could against the invaders who want to enslave us they have been punished as they deserve for their cowardice and shall never have the chance to betray the kingdom again general vatran who shared an abandoned peasant hut with rathar grimaced he executed more men than he needed to vatran said a lot more men than he needed to rathar agreed with him but waved him to silence all the same he counted himself lucky not to be among the executed and counted vatran even luckier and he wanted to hear what swemmel had to say not one step back the king shouted his tiny image clenching a tiny fist not one step back we say again we shall never yield another inch of our sacred soil to the algarvian savages if they advance they shall advance only over the bodies of our warriors warriors who will never again turn their backs to the barbarous foe attack we say attack and triumph king swemmels image vanished from the crystal which flashed and went dark with another grimace vatran said i wish it were as easy as he makes it sound so does the whole kingdom rathar answered but hes right about one thing if we dont fight the algarvians we wont drive them away we havent got much room for retreat not anymore i dont care what swemmel says vatran declared a reckless statement from any unkerlanter i dont see how were going to stop the redheads this side of sulingen do you lord marshal he made rathars title half a challenge half a reproach they were alone in the hut otherwise without a doubt vatran would have kept his mouth shut and otherwise without a doubt rathar would not have answered no even saying it where only vatran could hear was a risk the general might become a marshal if he could persuade swemmel that the word had passed rathars lips of course rathar would call him a liar but still but vatran said well youre honest at any rate he tore a chunk off the very stale loaf of black bread theyd found in the hut and passed it to rathar rathar chewed and swallowed and thanked the powers above for a good set of teeth his canteen was full of spirits he swigged then offered vatran a drink maybe the general thought it was water he took a big swallow his eyes went wide he coughed a couple of times but held the spirits down fooled you rathar said with a chuckle but his amusement soon faded now if we could only fool the redheads if we dont vatran shook his head not even to rathars ear alone not even with a good slug of spirits in him would he saw what was in his mind rathar didnt have much trouble figuring out what that was he said it even if vatran wouldnt if we dont were ruined thats about the size of it lord marshal vatran agreed unhappily they just keep smashing through us if we dont fall back they cut off chunks of the army with their behemoths and chew em up at their leisure and if we do fall back we yield up the land they were after theyre stretched thin rathar said as much to keep up his own hopes as to hearten rathar theyve got yaninans holding quiet stretches of the line more of them every day theyre putting forthwegians and sibians into uniform to do their fighting for them if they keep stretching theyre bound to break sooner or later aye but will it be before they break us vatran said rathar took another swig of spirits he had no answer for that someone rapped on the door rathar opened it a filthy skeletally lean runner stood there panting the fellow saluted then said lord marshal the algarvians are pounding our lines to the northeast if they dont get some help theyre going to have to fall back again by his tone hed plainly either heard or heard about king swemmels speech not one step back the king had thundered to start retreating so soon after such an order did not bear thinking about turning to vatran rathar asked have we got dragons we can use to give them a hard time before the general could answer the marshal stabbed out a forefinger of course we dothat farm not far from here order em into the airwell see how mezentios men like getting hammered instead of doing the hammering his chuckle was harsh they wouldnt like it any better than soldiers ever did well too bad for them what else can we throw in there vatran asked he wasnt shy about fighting none of the unkerlanter generals left alive was the war had already weeded out a lot of men who did nothing but look handsome in a uniform tunic it would no doubt weed more without bothering to check the map rathar started naming regiments and brigades the unkerlanters could quickly move to defend the threatened area vatran did look at the map and stared how in blazes do you keep all that in your head lord marshal i dont know rathar answered a little sheepishly ive always had the knack it comes in handy every now and again still standing in the door of the hut he shouted for an orderly one came running up what do you need sir a horse for me and another one for general vatranor a unicorn apiece if thats easier rathar told him theres trouble north and east of here if were not on the spot how can we command the defense rathar knew he was less than the best rider in the world he rapidly discovered vatran was among the worst the orderly brought them both unicorns each with its gleaming white hide painted in mud and dirt and grasscolored splotches to make it harder to see even the unicorns ironshod horns were carefully rusted to stop any betraying glints of light from them rathar thought the beasts perfect vatrans opinion was rather different not so fast i pray you he protested as rathar sped to a stillmodest trot by the way vatran clutched the reins and clung to the saddle he might have been going at a breakneck gallop if he ever did have to go at a gallop rathar thought he would likely break his neck dragons ranged over the battered land behind the battle line some low some highalgarvian dragons from the air the two highranking officers looked like a pair of nondescript cavalrymen which suited rathar fine what will we do if we spy real algarvian horse lord marshalor if the redheads spot us vatran asked in piteous tones why charge them of course rathar answered deadpan vatran groaned then cursed as he realized the marshal hadnt meant it seriously rathar laughed a little finding anything to laugh about wasnt easy in the tradition of battles from longago days he rode toward the sound of the loudest fighting vatran managed to stay with him they trotted past a team of unkerlanters stripping the armor and eggtosser off a slain algarvian behemoth thats good vatran said thats very good we can use the gear and thats a fact the algarvians have too fornicating much of everything except soldiers we hope rathar said and vatran nodded the marshal looked over his shoulder at the unkerlanter workmen thoughtfully he went on have to make sure they slap a coat of rockgray paint on that mail before they put it on one of our behemoths even then our men are liable to take it for a rusethe redheads patterns are different from ours heres hoping the algarvians dont think of a ruse like that vatran said with feeling they think of too cursed many things and thats the truth aye isnt it just rathar said he filed the idea away as one against which he would have to warn the unkerlanter soldiery up ahead dragons swooped again and again the sharp roars of bursting eggs came ever closer together and unkerlanter footsoldiers began streaming away from the center of the fighting before rathar could get there and take charge of the defense they had the look hed seen too often in the fight against the algarvians the look of men not just beaten but stunned by what had rolled over them they gaped at the sight of anyone going toward the battle from which they were retreating its another cursed breakthrough one of them said didnt you hear the kings order general vatran thundered not another step back the soldier came to a ragged sort of attention realizing the two men on unicornback were officers he didnt realize what sort of officers they were he was too battered and worn to pay attention to the rank badges on their collar tabs if old swemmel went through what ive been through hed step back himself and pretty fornicating lively too vatran looked about ready to burst like an egg his fury did him no good before he could start thundering again the weary soldier and his comrades trudged past him and rathar heading west and south they mightthey probably wouldfight again later when the odds looked better for now theyd taken all they could come on rathar told vatran weve got more important things to worry about than a squads worth of stragglers if we cant stop the algarvians from breaking through whenever they press hard the whole kingdom will go over a cliff ought to line em up against a wall and blaze em vatran said forgetting his earlier claim that the king had been too merciful thats what wed have done in the twinkings war and you cursed well know it weve done it in this fight too rathar said and well do more of it if we have to but not this lot thats all vatran grunted his unicorn chose that moment to sidestep it almost threw him where even an average rider would have shifted his weight a little and gone about his business by the time the general had his mount under control rathar would have taken oath the beast looked scornful but it might have been the way the paint streaked its muzzle hed calmed down a little have to hit the redheads column in flank as it punches through thatll give em some trouble if we can bring it off good notion rathar told him and it was theyd blunted some algarvian attacks that way he wondered if the unkerlanter forces moving against the breakthrough could cut it off even more though he wondered where he was going to make the next fight this side of sulingen under garivalds tunic a drop of sweat ran down his back as he trudged toward the village of pirmasens heat wasnt what made him sweat though the weather was as warm and sticky as it ever got down in the duchy of grelz no he was afraid and knew how afraid he was liaz he said over and over again liaz liaz he couldnt very well go into any grelzer village under his own name not with the whacking great price the algarvians had put on his head most villagers hated king mezentio and his puppet king of grelz his cousin raniero more than they hated king swemmel but enough felt the other way about things to make him glad he had an alias now if only he could be sure of remembering it pirmasens wasnt one of the villages from which munderics irregulars usually gathered food and supplies the algarvians held it tight not least because it stood close to a ley line munderic needed to know what they were up to irregulars from other parts of unkerlant would have betrayed themselves as soon as they opened their mouths garivald would be a stranger in pirmasens but a stranger with the right accent as he neared the village he saw it was intact which meant unkerlanter soldiers hadnt made a stand here the summer before that wasnt so good it gave the locals less reason to hate the redheads it also gave them more reason to betray a fugitive bard named garivald if any of them should recognize him in the person of liaz another drop of sweat slid down his spine it wont be so bad he muttered and did his best to make himself believe it before the war a stranger wandering into a peasant village would have been a surprise especially if he was just another peasant and not a merchant with something to sell the fighting though had torn things up by the roots so munderic had told garivald anyhow garivald hoped the irregulars leader was right hoofbeats made him look back over his shoulder an algarvian trooper on a lathered horse cantered past him and into pirmasens the redhead eyed him on riding by just as he watched mezentios soldier any man who trusted another even for a moment risked his life these days well behind the horseman garivald came into pirmasens it was a bigger place than zossen which remained his touchstone probably because it lay close to the ley line and so drew more trade it looked achingly normal men out in the fields around the village women in the vegetable plots by their houses children and dogs and chickens underfoot a lump came into garivalds throat this was the way life was supposed to be the way hed always known it then a couple of kilted algarvians strode out of one of the few buildings in the village that wasnt somebodys house the tavern unless he missed his guess hed planned on going in there himselfhow better to find out what was going on in pirmasens than over a few mugs of ale now he wondered if that was such a good idea a dog came yapping up to him he stamped his foot and growled back and the dog ran away thats how you do it all right a villager called garivald had to work hard not to stare at the fellow hed never seen an unkerlanter with a fancy waxed mustache before he hoped hed never see another one either such fripperies might do well enough for an algarvian but they struck him as absurd on one of his countrymen aye sure is garivald replied hearing grelzer dialect identical to his own coming out of garivalds mouth the man with the mustache grinned it was a fine friendly grin one that should have made garivald like him at sight but for the hair on his lip it might have even seeing the mustachesurely the mark of someone currying favor with the redheadsgarivald warmed somewhat the local said havent seen you in these parts before have i now garivald smiled back he might be an amateur spy but he recognized a counterpart on the other side when he heard one wouldnt think so im from east of herea little place called minsen that was a village not far from zossen swemmels soldiers curse em fought hard to hold it so its not there anymore neither is my wife neither are my son and daughter he made himself sound grim ah ive heard tales like that so many times the fellow with the mustache said he came up and draped an arm around garivalds shoulder as if he were a sympathetic cousin im not sorry were out from under swemmels yoke and thats a fact look at the price you paid for getting stuck in the middle of a lost war aye garivald said youve got a good way of looking at things ah my names rual the man from pirmasens said garivald clasped his hand which also let him shake off that arm and im liaz he said hed got it right the first time anyhow let me buy you a mug of ale liaz rual said we can sit around and swap stories about what a son of a whore swemmel is suits me fine garivald said ive got plenty of em and he did too loving swemmel wasnt easy after what hed seen after what hed been through hating the redheads more was ill buy you one afterwards too ive got enough coppers for that anyhow well come on then lets get out of the hot sun sure enough rual led him to the building from which the algarvians had come more algarvians sat inside one of them nodded to rual in a familiar way as if the mustache hadnt been enough that told garivald all he needed to know about the other peasants allegiance it also told him he had to be extra careful if he wanted to get out of pirmasens in one piece rual waved to the fellow behind the bar who wore not only a mustache but also a ridiculous little strip of chin beard as if he hadnt been paying attention while he shaved two mugs of ale here rual called and set a shiny newly minted silver coin on the table garivald picked it up and looked at it so thats what king raniero looks like is it he remarked hadnt seen him before in his opinion raniero had a pointy nose he didnt think rual would care about his opinions in such matters aye rual waited till the tapman brought him his ale then raised his mug and heres to raniero having expected such a toast garivald had no trouble drinking to it rual added good to have a king in grelz again thats the truth garivald said though swemmel was the only king in grelz he acknowledged after a pull at his alewhich was pretty goodhe added i wish we hadnt had to have a war to get one though he also wished the king grelz had got werent an algarvian one more opinion he kept to himself no we should have had one of our own all along rual said but id sooner be tied to the redheads than to cottbus the algarvians in here were surely listening to him as he was listening to garivald garivald wondered what theyd think of his wanting a grelzer king rather than mezentios cousin i never worried about things like this before the fighting started he said at last i just wanted life to go on the way it always had he wasnt even lying rual gave him another sympathetic look though the last thing garivald wanted was his sympathy i understand what youre sayingpowers above know i do rual assured him but werent you sick of inspectors stealing your crops and impressers liable to drag you off into the army if you looked at em sideways or even if you didnt well who wasnt garivald said making it sound like an admission rual had dragged out of him again he wasnt lying again it didnt matter which rual didnt seem to understand the algarvians had done worse in zossen and no doubt elsewhere in unkerlantthan swemmels inspectors and impressers garivald decided to make his own comment before rual could ask another question this looks like a pretty happy place now ill tell you that oh it is rual assured him raniero makes a fine king so long as we dont trouble anything he leaves us alone you could never say that about swemmel now could you no indeed garivald laughed a particular kind of laugh one that suggested a lot of things you could say about king swemmel he would have enjoyed saying them tooto his wife or to his friend dagulf back in zossen saying them to rual would have been blackest treason well there you are rual said as if certain garivald agreed with him in every particular aye here i amat the bottom of my mug of ale garivald set coins old coins coins of unkerlant not grelzon the table and waved to the unkerlanter with the preposterous mustache and strip of beard behind the counter when he caught the fellows eye he pointed to his mug and ruals the tapman brought them refills my thanks rual said youre a man of your word too many drifters coming through pirmasens these days want to grab what they can and then slide out again this is a nice quiet place we want to keep it that way dont blame you garivald said almost tempts a fellow into wanting to settle down here for good he drank some more ale to get rid of the taste of the lies he was telling you could do worse liaz rual said and the curse of the war unkerlant and algarve were fighting was that he was probably right aye its right peaceful here he didnt mentionmaybe he even didnt consciously noticethe algarvian soldiers drinking at a table not ten feet away from him if theyd been back in algarve where they belonged he would have come closer to telling the truth garivald finished his ale now came the tricky part sliding out of pirmasens under the noses of those algarvian soldiers and under ruals too he got to his feet good to find a friendly face he said arent many of em left these days where are you heading rual asked somewhere that got hurt worse than you seem to garivald answered maybe somewhere i can find a farm nobodys working and get things going again thatd keep me too busy to worry about anything else for a while i expect and i expect youre right rual said good luck to you thanks garivald took a couple of steps toward the doorway one of the redheads sitting in the tavern spoke to him in algarvian he froze in alarm entirely unfeigned turning to rual he asked what did that mean i dont know any of their language he told you to count yourself lucky youre still breathing rual said oh i do garivald answered feeling the sweat start out under his arms once more every day i do he stood there for a moment wondering whether the algarvians were going to try to wring him dry but the fellow whod spoken just nodded and waved him away trying not to let out a sigh of relief he went out into the hot sunshine he didnt just turn around and go back the way hed come that would have roused suspicions instead he kept walking east toward herborn eventually when he judged it safe hed make a wide circle around pirmasens and double back toward the forests where munderic not false king raniero was lord and master for now he felt like a traveling mountebank whod stuck his head into a dragons mouth and pulled it back unscathed dragons were stupid beasts though every once in a while no matter how you trained them they would bite down dragons flew south overhead hundreds of them maybe even thousands some high some low all were painted in one variant or another of algarves green red and white to sergeant leudasts horrified gaze they seemed to cover the whole sky and not a single one of ours to try to flame them down he said bitterly theyll have a fight on their hands sooner or later captain hawart said theyd better anyhow or the game is as good as over leudast wondered if the game was as good as over hed wondered that before back last summer when the algarvians smashed and encircled unkerlanter armies again and again then toward the end of fall when mezentios mages first unleashed their slaughterfilled sorceries when winter came unkerlant fought back hard but now it was summer again and cursed redheads have got more lives than a cat he grumbled theyre nasty buggers no two ways about it hawart agreed like every man in his regiment he looked worn and battered still another wave of algarvian dragons passed overhead at least theyre not dropping their eggs on us leudast said where do you suppose the whoresons are headed coming out of a peasant village in northern unkerlant he knew little about the geography of the southand till the fighting started had cared less sulingen captain hawart spoke with great authority has to be sulingen on the wolter thats the last city in front of the mamming hills the last city in front of the cinnabar mines the last place where we can keep them from breaking through sulingen leudast nodded aye ive heard the name but after a pounding like that there wont be one stone in the town left standing on another oh i dont know the regimental commander said sticking a long stalk of grass in the corner of his mouth so he looked like a peasant from a village in the back of beyond rather than the educated man he was sulingens a goodsize place and towns take a deal of knocking down before theres nothing left of them powers above know weve seen that well i wont say youre wrong sir leudast admitted rubbles as good to fight from as buildings are too maybe even better but still he didnt go on he and hawart had been through a lot together but not so much that he cared to tag himself with the label of defeatist hawart understood where his ley line of thought was going but still he echoed you dont want them to drive you back to your last ditch because you dont have anywhere to go if they push you out of it the stalk of grass bobbed up and down as he spoke he tried to sound reassuring they havent even driven us back into it yet no sir leudast wasnt about to argue but he still wanted to say what was in his mind you can see it from here though off to the east leudast could also see columns of smoke marking the latest algarvian thrust into unkerlant he turned his head and looked west no new smoke there leudast let out a small sigh of relief the regiment wasnt about to be cut off and surrounded any time soon anyhow a starling hopped through the grass chirping metallically it pecked at a worm or a grub then flew away when leudast shook his fist at it those things are cursed nuisances he said theyll eat the fruit right off a tree and the grain right out of the fields they might as well be algarvians hawart said leudast laughed though it was at best a bitter joke a runner trotted up shouting for an officer when hawart admitted he was one the other unkerlanter said sir youre ordered east with as many men as you command to try and hold back the algarvians captain hawart sighed leudast knew how he felt simply lying in the grass for a little while without eggs bursting close by or beams sizzling past overhead was sweet it couldnt last leudast knew that all too well but he wished it would have lasted a little longer aye well come of course hawart said and started shouting for his men to get to their feet and get moving the runner saluted and hurried off likely to haul some more weary footsoldiers into the fight hawart sighed again well see if we go out again once were done too wont have so many dragons dropping eggs on us anyhow leudast said as he heaved himself upright theyre all off pounding that sulingen place well so they are hawart said maybe well be able to catch mezentios men in flank too from where the smokes rising their spearpoints gone past us with a little luck well chop it off heres hoping leudast wasnt sure he believed the unkerlanters could do that theyd had as little luck down here in the south this fighting season as theyd had all along the front the summer before but it was worth trying he wondered how many miles hed marched since the war against algarve started hundreds he knewmost of them heading west he was moving east now toward algarve back during the winter that had mattered a great deal now he supposed it still did but what mattered even more was that he could be blazed just as dead heading this way as the other open order he called to the men he led stay spread out you dont want them to be able to get too many of you all at once the veterans in his company already knew that and were doing it but he didnt have a lot of veterans left and every fight claimed more most of his men were not long off farms or city streets they were brave enough but a lot of them would get killed or maimed before they figured out what they should be doing only luck had kept leudast from going that way and he knew it a goodsize counterattack against the western flank of the algarvian drive looked to be building behemoths trotted forward along with unkerlanter footsoldiers more behemoths hauled eggtossers too heavy to fit on their backs teams of horses and mules urged on by sweating cursing teamsters and hostlers hauled even more leudast looked up into the sky hoping to spot dragons painted in rockgray when he didnt he grunted and kept marching he knew he couldnt have everything the support the footsoldiers were getting on the ground was already more than hed expected eggs started bursting in front of the regiment sooner than hed hoped though not really sooner than hed thought they would as usual the algarvians were alert they could be beaten but seldom surprised some soldier on the flank with a crystal had seen something he didnt like talked to the redheads eggtossers and then no doubt ducked back down into the tall grass come on leudast said theyre trying to scare us off are we going to let them he was scared every time he went into a fight he hoped his men didnt know it he knew too well he did as hed hoped mezentios soldiers didnt have that many eggtossers here on their flank most of them would be down at the head of the attack at what captain hawart called the spearpoint leudast would have put them there too if hed wanted to break through deeper into unkerlant but now he and his comrades were trying to break through and he thought they might do it then just after hed tramped through the fields around a ruined abandoned peasant village somebody blazed at him the beam missed but charred a line through the rye that struggled against encroaching weeds leudast threw himself down on his belly the smell of damp dirt in his nostrils brought back his own days in a peasant village advance by squads he shouted to his men again the veterans already knew what to do he heard them shouting instructions to the new men would the raw recruits understand theyd better leudast thought if they want to have the chance to get any more lessons soldiers said youd last a while if you lived through your first fight if you didnt you surely wouldnt up he came running heavily toward a boulder a hundred feet ahead he dove behind it as if one step ahead of the inspectors lay panting for a moment then peered around the chunk of granite the enemy was blazing from an apple orchard that like the fields around the abandoned village had seen better years leudast spotted a man in there who wasnt wearing unkerlanter rockgray he brought his stick to his shoulder and thrust his forefinger into the beaming hole the foeman toppled leudast let out a growl of triumph two more rushes brought him into the grove as he crouched behind a tree trunk he made sure the knife on his belt was loose in its sheath he knew from bitter experience that algarvians didnt go backwards without leaving a lot of dead theirs and those of their enemies as monuments to where theyd been urra he yelled as he ran forward again swemmel urra his countrymen echoed him he waited for the answering cries of mezentio and algarve to give him some idea of how many redheads he faced those cries didnt come instead the enemy soldiers yelled a name he hardly knewtsavellasand other things in a language hed never heard before in brief glimpses he saw that their uniforms were a darker tan than those of the algarvians and they wore tight leggings not kilts realization smote theyre yaninans he called to his men from everything hed heard the algarvians allies didnt have the stomach for the fight that mezentios men brought to it maybe that was so maybe it wasnt it might be worth finding out yaninans he yelled as loud as he could and then a couple of phrases of algarvian hed learned surrender hands high for a moment the enemys shouts and blazing went on as they had before then silence fell and then from behind trees and bushes and rocks skinny little men with big black mustaches began emerging when the first ones werent blazed down out of hand more and more came forth leudast told off troopers of his own to take charge of them and get them to the rear one of those troopers looked at him in something approaching awe powers above sergeant weve just bagged twice as many men as weve got i know leudast was astonished too its not so easy against the algarvians is it go on get em out of here he raised his voice and addressed the rest of his men theyve given us a chance were going into that hole fast and hard like it belongs to some easy wench now come on urra shouted the unkerlanters the new men loudest among them they thought it would be this easy all the time leudast didnt try to tell them anything different pretty soon theyd run into algarvians and find out for themselves meanwhile theyand hewould go forward as fast and as far as they could maybe if they got lucky enough theyd cut off the spearhead after all among the books ealstan had brought home to help keep vanai amused in the flat she dared not leave was an old atlas it was in fact a very old atlas dating back to the days before the six years war as far as that atlas was concerned forthweg didnt exist the east belonged to a swollen algarve while the west was an unkerlanter grand duchy centered on eoforwic here vanais chuckle had a bitter edge algarve was a great deal more swollen these days than it had been when the atlas was printed and the news sheets kept announcing new algarvian victories every day down in the south of unkerlant their spearheads reached toward the narrow sea she looked back from the atlas to the news sheet in fierce fighting she read the town of andlau fell to algarve and her allies an enemy counterblow against the flank of the attacking column was turned back with heavy loss andlau she saw was well beyond durrwangen three quarters of the way from where the fighting had begun in spring to sulingen sure enough mezentios men seemed to be moving as fast as they had the summer before but they cant vanai said out loud defiantly using her kaunian birthspeech they cant what will be left of the world if they do what would be left of the world for her if the algarvians won their war was nothing but they kept right on rolling forward all the same the news sheet went on in the boasting algarvian style even though it was written in forthwegian algarvian dragons hammered sulingen on the wolter dropping eggs by the thousand and leaving the city an ungainly sprawl stretched along the northern bank of the river burning in many places casualties are certain to be very heavy but king swemmel continues his useless senseless resistance good for him vanai muttered forthwegians despised their unkerlanter cousins not least for being stronger and more numerous than they were living in forthweg vanai had picked up a good deal of that attitude and her grandfather despised the unkerlanters for being even more barbarouswhich is to say less under kaunian influencethan the forthwegians shed picked up a good deal of that attitude too but now if the unkerlanters were giving king mezentios men a run for their money vanai would cheer them on she wished she could do more if she left the flat though she was all too likely to end up sacrificed to fuel the algarvian mages assault on unkerlant and so she stayed hidden and thought kinder thoughts about king swemmel than shed ever imagined she would from the atlas and the news sheet her eyes went to the little book called you too can be a mage she wondered why she hadnt pitched it into the garbage shed worked magic with it all right magic that had almost got her in more trouble than shed known before if you were already a mage the spells in you too can be a mage might be useful but if you were already a mage you wouldnt need them because youd already know better she complained about that to ealstan when he came home that evening he laughed which made her angry then he held up a placating hand im sorry he told her though he didnt sound very sorry it reminds me of something my father would say sometimes any child can do itas long as he has twenty years of practice vanai worked through that then smiled in spite of herself it does sound like your father or what youve said about him she answered then her smile faded i wish wed hear from him again so do i ealstan said his own face tight with worry with leofsig gone he must be going mad my whole family must be come to that she reached across the small supper table to set her hand on his i wish youd been able to do something about your cousin so do i he growled but his regiment or whatever they call it had left the camp outside eoforwic just before i got the news and even if it hadnt he grimaced what could i have done sidrocs worth more to the algarvians than ill ever be so theyd surely back him curse them powers below eat them and leave them in darkness forever aye vanai whispered fervently but the algarvians had to be immune to curses so many had been aimed their way since the derlavaian war started but none seemed to bite i think this may be what growing up means ealstan said finding out there are things you cant do anything about and neither can anybody else in one way vanai was a year older than he in another she was far older than that the second way didnt always show itself but this was one of those times kaunians in forthweg suck that up with their mothers milk she said they have ever since the kaunian empire fell maybe so ealstan said but its not bred in you any more than its bred in us you learn it one at a time too vanai remembered major spinello aye thats so she said softly hoping the redhead whod taken his pleasure with her to keep her grandfather from working himself to death had met a horrible end in unkerlant then she burst out with what she couldnt hold in any more what will we do if algarve wins the war ealstan got up went over to the pantry and came back with a jug of wine after pouring he answered i heardethelhelm sayszuwayza is letting kaunians land on her shores zuwayza vanais voice was a dismayed squeak theyre she caught herself shed been about to say the zuwayzin were nothing but bare black barbarians her grandfather would surely have said just that she tried something else theyre allied with mezentio so how long can that last i dont know ealstan said ethelhelm says the algarvians are hopping mad about it though how does he know vanai demanded do the redheads whisper in his ear why do you believe him when he tells you things like that because hes not wrong very often ealstan said what he doesnt hear the people in his band do maybe vanai said dubious still but where do they hear them the algarvians dont like etlielhelms music no but plegmunds brigade does remember ealstan answered hes played for them remember no matter how much i hated that i still do hate it but its true maybe vanai said this time in rather a different tone of voice she reached for the jug of wine and poured her own mug full i dont know why i dont just stay drunk all the time then i wouldnt care hard work staying drunk all the time ealstan said and it hurts when you start sobering up too i know what vanai also knew and didnt say was how much staying sober hurt ealstan wouldnt understandor he wouldnt have before leofsig got killed now he might vanai washed the supper dishes then returned to her books she was reading a tale of adventure and exploration in the jungles of equatorial siaulia back when she was living in oyngestun she would have turned up her nose at such fare but when her world was limited to a cramped flat and what she could see out a windowprovided she didnt get too close to the glassa story of exploration set on the tropical continent made her feel she was traveling even when she really couldnt leopards and gorgeous glittering butterflies and hanging vines covered with ants seemed real enough for her to reach out and touch them and when she read about the enormous fungus the natives would boil in the stomach of a buffalo when she read about that fungus she started to cry she thought she was being quiet about it but ealstan looked up from the news sheet he was reading and asked whats the matter sweetheart she turned a stricken face to him when fall comes i wont be able to go out hunting mushrooms he came over and put his arm around her i dont even know if ill be able to except maybe in a park or something this is a big city without a whole lot of open country around it but ill bring back the best ones i can buy i promise you that it wont be the same vanai spoke with doleful certainty she pulled a handkerchief out of her pocket and blew her nose tears were still sliding down her cheeks ive gone out hunting mushrooms every fall since since my mother and father were still alive she couldnt think of any stronger way to say for a very long time im sorry ealstan said if you were shut up inside the kaunian quarter here or back in gromheort do you think you could go mushroom hunting then in one way it was a perfectly reasonable question in another it was infuriating vanai stuck her nose in her book and left it there when ealstan said something else to her a few minutes later she ignored him she made a point of ignoring him and kept right on doing it till they went to bed that night when he leaned over to kiss her good night she let him but she didnt kiss him back he said i cant help it you know i wish i could but i cant vanai started to ignore that too she found she couldnt finding she couldnt she wished she could for tears stung her eyes i cant help it either she said choking a little on the words i cant help what the algarvians have done to us and i wish so much i could that just makes allthisthat much harder to take i know he said i wish i could do something about the redheads too but i just cant curse it he slammed a fist down onto the mattress hard enough to make vanai bounce up a little he was a forthwegian not a kaunian the algarvians yoke lay less heavily on his folk than on vanais but hed fled his family fled gromheort on account of her and his brother was dead because his cousin had joined the puppet brigade the conquerors had created she could hardly say he and his hadnt suffered on account of the occupation instead of saying anything she reached for him he was reaching for her too before long they were making love as her pleasure built she could forget the miserable little flat in which she was caged she knew the escape wouldnt last long but cherished it while it did afterwards drifting toward sleep ealstan said one day by the powers above ill bring you back to gromheort you see if i dont that did make her burst into tears she so much wanted to believe it and so much doubted she could and even if she did people there dont like mixed couples they didnt like them before the war theyll like them even less now people are fools ealstan said who cares what they like and dont like if more forthwegians liked kaunians the redheads couldnt do what theyre doing here vanai said she felt ealstans nod rather than seeing it people of her own bloodher grandfather for instancedespised forthwegians too but she didnt want to think about that she didnt want to think about anything she ground her face into her pillow after a while she slept eight dont just stand there major spinello shouted somehow he managed to stay dapper when all the algarvians he commanded looked like a pack of tramps youd bloody well better not just stand there weve got to keep moving if we arent moving forward you can bet your last copper the cursed unkerlanters will be trasone waved a hand spinello swept off his hat and bowed as if he were recognizing a duke not an ordinary trooper trasone said nothing to worry about sir i mean with the yaninans guarding our flank were safe as can be right sergeant panfilo let out a warning grunt several other algarvian soldiers tramping down the dusty road cursed their allies and spinello threw back his head and laughed youre a menace you are he told trasone aye the yaninans are heroes every stinking one of em but we saved their bacon when they looked like giving way now didnt we aye trasone cocked his head to one side and spat out the husk of a sunflower seed we had to double back to do it though i thought the idea was that they would cover our flank so we could smash all the unkerlanters in front of us and go on into the hills for the cinnabar oh aye thats the idea they had back in trapani spinello agreed a wave of his hand told how much or rather how little the officers and nobles back in trapani knew only trouble is every once in a while the unkerlanters have ideas too they kept an army in front of us and hit us from the side with another one thats all another wave said it was perfectly simple if you looked at it the right way but trasone wasnt in the mood to look at it like that if theyve got enough soldiers to hold some in front of us and to hit us from the flank with more how are we going to keep on moving forward he demanded panfilo grunted again and this time followed the grunt with words worrying about how isnt your job doing what youre told is i do what im told trasone gave the sergeant a dirty look you dont suppose idve come all this way because i like the scenery do you that made spinello laugh once more but he grew serious again in a hurry the unkerlanters have more men than we do nothing we can do about thatexcept to go on killing the whoresons of course but if theyve got more weve got better and thats why well win the war where trasone and panfilo and just about everybody else in the battalion trudged south and west along that road cursing and coughing in the clouds of dust their comrades kicked up spinello strutted along as if on parade trasone didnt know whether to envy him or to feel like strangling him somebodyhe couldnt see whosaid we may be better than the lousy unkerlanters but bugger me with a cheese grater if the yaninans are theyre our allies spinello said were better off with em than without em hed mocked ideas that came out of the capital of algarve before but he was echoing one there when trasone said allies he made the word into a curse if they were fighting my granny id bet on gran nasty old bitch is she spinello said which jerked a startled guffaw from trasone but instead of going on to defend the yaninans some more spinello half changed the subject they do say the sibs taking service with mezentio are really good fighters and this brigade of forthwegians theyre putting together is supposed to be full of tough customers too having fought in sibiu trasone knew the men who came out of the island kingdom could indeed fight hard but that wasnt the point or wasnt the whole point do we really need all those foreign buggers and if we do are there going to be any algarvians left alive by the time this war is through its like any other brawl sergeant panfilo said last man standing wins the road came up to and into a wood full of pines and beeches and birch pointing ahead trasone said how many unkerlanters are hiding in there and how many of usll be standing by the time we come out the other side nobody answered any algarvian officer who fought in unkerlant hated forests the unkerlanters were better woodsmen and had the advantage of preparing their positions ahead of time digging them out always cost a kilted soldier at the edge of the woods waved the battalion forward forward trasone went not without a pang hed had other algarvians wave him forward into woodsand forward into trouble he waited nervously for unkerlanters in hidden holes to start blazing at his comrades and him from behindor for a whole swarm of squat men in rockgray tunics to charge from one side of the road or the other half of them drunk all of them roaring urra as loud as they could if they got the chance theyd knock the algarvians into the undergrowth and maul them like wild beasts with every quiet peaceful step he took he grew more suspicious sparrows chirped a rabbit peered out at the algarvians then ducked back behind a bush all right trasone said where are they maybe we really did clear this wood panfllo said stranger things have happened i suppose name two trasone challenged before the sergeant could take him up on it the earth began to shake beneath their feet here and there along the road purplish flames shot up out of the ground men caught in them screamed horribly but not for long along either side of the roadway trees shivered like men caught naked in an unkerlanter winter some of them toppled as they did their crowns caught fire more algarvians screamed in torment trasone was screaming too screaming in terror sergeant panfilos shout had words in it magecraft unkerlanter magecraft he was right of course knowing he was right didnt make the sorcerous onslaught any easier for trasone or his comrades to bear had king swemmels men started tossing eggs at him normally he would have scraped a hole in the ground and waited them out as best he could he didnt want to do that here not when any hole he dug was liable to close up on him as soon as he dove into it he knew the danger because hed seen it happen to unkerlanters when his own armys mages sacrificed a regiments worth of kaunians but the kaunians as far as he could see had it coming and so did the unkerlanters trasone was no more likely than anyone else to think he deserved to be on the receiving end of anything unpleasant the moment the ground stopped quivering the moment trees stopped falling major spinello shouted be ready those ugly buggers are going to try to throw us out of here now you mark my words are we going to let em as far as trasone was concerned the unkerlanters were welcome to this stretch of forest especially after theyd rearranged it so drastically but he yelled no along with everybody else still able to talk well then wed better get ready to give em a proper greeting hadnt we spinello said suiting action to word he sprawled behind one of the pines that had come down but hadnt caught fire trasone was still looking for his own place to hide when eggs did start falling in the woods he ducked down behind a big gray lichencovered rock panfilo sprawled a few feet away digging himself a hole with a shorthandled spade while lying on his belly arent you afraid thatll swallow you if the unkerlanters throw more magic at us trasone asked aye but im more afraid of getting caught in the open if an egg bursts close by the sergeant answered trasone pondered that but not for long after a moment he yanked his own spade off his belt and started digging urra urra urra that cry swelling like surf as the tide came in announced an unkerlanter attack through it major spinello let loose a cry of his own crystallomancer sir the soldier who kept the battalion in touch with the army of which it was a part crawled toward spinello the major spoke urgently to him and he in turn spoke into the clear polished globe he carried in his pack urra urra swemmel urra here came the unkerlanters pushing their way up into the wood from the south theyd brushed aside the algarvians whod already passed through the trees now they were intent on taking back the forest they think well be easy meat spinello said they think theyve rattled us they panic when we hit them a good sorcerous lick and they figure well do the same but theyre only unkerlanters and were algarvians now were going to show them what that means arent we the only other choice was dying trasone didnt think much of that and if spinello figured the sorcerous attack hadnt rattled him the dapper little major was out of his mind the difference between a veteran and a raw recruittrasone had no idea whether it was the difference between algarvians and unkerlanterswas that he could keep going no matter how rattled he was peering over the top of his boulder he saw unkerlanters in rockgray rushing up the road and through the woods toward the line the algarvians were holding his lips skinned back from his teeth in a savage grinby the way they were advancing swemmels men didnt know a solidly held line was waiting for them well theyd find out he brought his stick up to his shoulder and blazed down a couple of unkerlanters who took no pains to hide themselves nor was he the only algarvian blazing king swemmels men fell one after another but they kept coming as always they were recklessly brave and as always they had soldiers to spare soldiers to burn trasone thought doing his best to make sure plenty of them did but before long he had to scramble backwards to a new hiding place to keep from getting flanked out he wasnt the only one either he wondered if spinello could keep any kind of control over his line for long then eggs started dropping on the unkerlanters both in the woods and beyond them dragons shrieked fury as they flew past at treetop height cries of panic replaced cries of urra the enemy attack foundered cut off at the root major spinello blew a shrill blast on his whistle forward he shouted they had their chance now its our turn mezentio he was the first to rush against the unkerlanters recklessly brave fit him as well as the enemy mezentio trasone yelled and went forward too caught by surprise by the dragons the crystallomancer had summoned the unkerlanters gave ground more readily than usual trasones battalion burst out into the open company south of the forest some of the grass was burning there thanks to the algarvian dragons and on the blackened grass lay blackened bodies trasone trotted past them with hardly a sideways glance hed already seen plenty of dead unkerlanters and a couple of miles farther south he saw more not soldiers these but row on row of peasantsold men and women mostlywith their hands bound behind them and their throats cut those corpses did make him grimace they were the fuel for the sorcery the unkerlanter mages had aimed at him and his comrades the mages unlike their victims had fled grimly trasone trudged after them camel sabrino spoke the word as if it were an obscure but potent obscenity if i never taste camel again ill count myself lucky dragons like it well enough lieutenant colonel caratzas said as far as sabrino was concerned the new yaninan senior officer wasnt a quarter the man colonel broumidis had been he was among other things much too fond of the aniseflavored spirits his countrymen brewed about all he really shared with broumidisand most other yaninanswas a passion for expressive gestures the only other real choice we have is eating marmots and voles and grubs theyd have to be tastier sabrino insisted theyd have to be more tender too tell me im wrong go on siri dare you instead of answering right away caratzas scratched his mustache which always made sabrino think a large black moth had landed on his upper lip even if i did tell you differently you would not think it mattered and why should you i am only a yaninan after all good for nothing but running away he breathed potent licoricescented fumes into sabrinos face oh my dear fellow sabrino exclaimed he didnt want caratzas knowing he thought he couldnt rely on him that would just make the yaninan all the more unreliable i do not question your courage yaninan dragonfliers here have performed as well as anyone could wishlook at your predecessors extraordinary valor you are gracious caratzas said with a sad halfsozzled smile you do not speak of the sorry performance of our footsoldiers here nor of the even sorrier performance of our footsoldiers in unkerlant not all of your followers not all of your countrymen show so much forbearance is that so sabrino said and the yaninan officer inclined his head to show it was sabrino had a low opinion of the general level of yaninan military skill himself caratzas doubtless knew as much even if sabrino didnt trumpet that opinion to the skies for his part sabrino had already known not all his fellow algarvians in the land of the ice people were so polite i shall discipline any man under my command who has offended you we are allies algarve and yanina and what a hypocrite i am sabrino thought he would sooner have been fighting in unkerlant himself had the yaninans been able to hold their own against lagoas here on the austral continent he would have been able to do that as things were as things were lieutenant colonel caratzas said it cannot be helped we are the small tagalong cousin but it grows wearisome sabrino didnt know what to say to that yanina was algarves small tagalong cousin in this war and algarve had to keep dragging that cousin out of trouble no wonder some of his fliers had been less courteous than they might have staying courteous and telling the truth werent easy to do in the same breath still the yaninan dragonfliers had fought wellthough better when broumidis led them what more could sabrino tell this tipsy lieutenant colonel he did his best as i say i will punish any man who maligns you or your kingdom algarve needs your aid it is better than nothing caratzas said i myself you understand am able to keep my temper in the face of these insults he hiccuped those sweetsmelling spirits no doubt helped blunt the sting of any insults he heard after another hiccup he went on but we yaninans are a proud folk and some of us will have blood to repay any slight i understand sabrino wished the yaninans were as prickly about doing a good job at war as they were about their honor that was one more thing he couldnt tell caratzas he looked east across the broad rolling plains where the austral continent sloped down from the barrier mountains to the narrow sea somewhere out there was the lagoan army it had been driven a long way back from heshbon but it was still there still dangerous still very much in the fight both the lagoans and sabrinos army kept dragons in the air all the time now watching one anothers movements and making sure nobody got any unpleasant surprises if we had more men more behemoths more dragons we could drive the lagoans into the sea caratzas remarked well so we could but that might mean we didnt have enough men to finish off the unkerlanters too sabrino said the fight up on the derlavaian mainland is more important than the war here something glowed for a moment in caratzas dark eyes then vanished in their depths before sabrino was sure he saw it the yaninan said in getting into a fight or several fights it is better to be sure one has enough men beforehand not afterwards that was a painfully obvious truth if wed taken cottbus sabrinos voice trailed away well one way or another well just have to lick swemmels men were driving them in the south the cinnabar there and the cinnabar we get here should keep us going till we beat all our enemies now there is a thought caratzas said sozzled awe in his voice beating all of ones enemies had he been an algarvian he would have bunched his fingers and kissed their tips yaninans used different gestures but the naked longing on caratzas face said more than any of them for a yaninan beating all of ones enemies had to be a dream and an impossible dream at that for an algarvian sabrino remembered the heady days of the summer before when unkerlant looked on the point of collapse had swemmel fled off into the uncharted west how long could lagoas have lasted without coming to terms with king mezentio not long by his way of thinking and kuusamo had still been neutral then sabrino sighed algarve had been on the brink right on the brink it could still happen sabrino murmured by the powers above it could unkerlant hadnt been knocked out of the war but she might yet be if that happened lagoas and kuusamo together could hardly stand against the united might of the entire continent of derlavai the world would be mezentiosif swemmel couldnt contest it any more horns blew the alarm startling sabrino out of his reverie cries of alarm shredded dreams of allembracing victory the lagoans someone shouted from the direction of the crystallomancers tent the lagoans are on our flank cursing foully sabrino sprang from the rock on which hed been sitting how did they get there he demanded as if caratzas would know to his surprise the yaninan did or at least had an idea i wonder if they made an arrangement with shamans from the ice people magic down here is a funny business i dont pretend to understand all of it do you understand that were all liable to get killed if we cant throw the lagoans back sabrino snapped how did they come up on our flank like any algarvian he had trouble taking the ice people seriously the lagoans on the other hand were deadly dangerous he knew that hed known it since his days as a footsoldier during the six years war when hed faced them in southern valmiera come to think of it hed been lucky to come through in one piece then his dragonfliers rushed up to their beasts as the handlers got them ready to fly and to fight sabrino scrambled aboard his own mount while a handler detached the chain that bound it to its stake he whacked the dragon with his goad it let out a hideous raucous screech and bounded into the air as the ground fell away beneath himand as at the same time his field of vision widenedsabrino discovered how if not why the lagoans had managed to escape the algarvian scouts notice even knowing they were there he had trouble seeing them it was as if his eyes wanted to rest anywhere but on marching men and hurrying horses and bulky behemoths that struck him as magecraft closely linked to the land the sort of thing the shamans might do the military mages attached to the army hadnt tried any serious sorcery down here because the land felt strange alien it wasnt alien to the hairy nomads whod roamed it for eons if theyd thrown in with the lagoans in that case we have to smash them too sabrino told his dragon it screeched again maybe that was approvaldragons liked nothing better than smashing things more likely it was random chance and the dragon had no trouble seeing the lagoans even if he did as soon as he gave it leave it folded its wings and hurtled toward them in as terrifying a dive as sabrino had ever known the dive was terrifying for a couple of reasons not only was he afraid the dragon would smash into the ground without being able to pull up he also feared a heavy stick would blaze itand him with it but the heavy sticks some of the lagoan behemoths carried werent so accurate when the behemoths were on the move and the enemy started blazing later than they might have maybe they thought for too long that the algarvians didnt know they were there if they thought that they were wrong sabrinos dragon flew along just above their heads the algarvian wing commander gave the great beast what it wanted the command to flame he thought it would have flamed the lagoans without the command and didnt want it breaking away from his control like that fumes loaded with brimstone and quicksilver made him cough this cant be good for my lungs he thought as if any dragonflier really expected to live long enough to have his lungs wear out but breathing the fumes from dragonfire was better by far than being bathed in it some lagoans shriveled and died where they stood others writhed on the ground or ran screaming human torches who could ignite their friends he and his wing hadnt had such an easy time wrecking an enemy column since the early days of the war against unkerlant the lagoans aiming at surprise hadnt brought their dragons with them so the algarvians had the air to themselves and even when king vitors men did blaze down an algarvian dragon the dead beast fell among them and wrecked most of a company in its death throes sabrinos dragon clawed its way higher it was ready and more than ready for another run at the lagoans looking down on them though sabrino saw theyd been thrown into enough disorder their attack on the algarvian expeditionary force would not come off no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than captain domizianos image appeared in his crystal enemy dragons flying hard out of the east the squadron commander reported sabrino looked that way sure enough he saw them himself back to our own men he said we can defend them and they can defend us with their heavy sticks and now instead of the lagoans moving on our soldiers on the ground well move on theirs try and pull the wool over our eyes will they weve already taught em a good lesson domiziano said so we have sabrino agreed waving for the wing to break off the attack on the lagoans weve taught em the magic the shamans of the ice people use isnt as good as they thought it was we ought to see if we can find some friendly shamans ourselves though and use it along with everything else weve got captain domiziano said sabrino started to tell him that was nothing but foolishness he stopped with the words unspoken the more he thought about the idea the better he liked it somewhere above sergeant istvan and his comrades the moon and stars shone down he couldnt see them though except in brief scattered glimpses through the treetops as he crept along on hands and knees he knew they looked down on the whole world the vast forests of western unkerlant only seemed to cover the whole world hed been in them for what felt like forever but that stood to reason from a few feet away szonyi whispered good thing we dont need to see where were going not for a while anyway aye istvan chuckled and sniffed we can follow our noses instead kun was off to the other side of istvan he said smells a lot better than anything our cooks have dished out lately kun could always find something to complain about as often as not istvan thought he was complaining to hear himself talk this time he thought kun was dead right the rich meaty odor that wafted from an unkerlanter cook pot somewhere up ahead would have draw him as rubbed amber attracted straws and bits of parchment even if his squad hadnt been ordered out on a night raid against king swemmels forward positions one of the other troopers in the squad let out an all but voiceless hiss theres their fire up ahead istvan didnt see the light till hed scrambled past the trunk of a pine so huge it might have been standing there since the day the stars chose the gyongyosians out of all the peoples of the world as the folk they claimed for their own once he did spy it he moved even more slowly and carefully than before the unkerlanters had proved time and again they were more woodswise than his countrymen the last thing he wanted was to give the game away before his comrades and he got the chance to steal that stew the firelight ahead did draw him more accurately than the delicious smell coming from the pot had he stretched out on his belly behind a clump of ferns and stared at the handful of unkerlanters gathered around their little fire they looked more alert than he would have liked one of them sat a good way away from the flames with his back to the fire and a stick in his lap their lookout without a doubt he has to be the first one we kill istvan thought if we blaze him down without making any noise we can get rid of the rest of the goateaters a lot easier he couldnt pass the order along even in a whispertoo risky he had to hope the troopers in his squad would be able to figure things out for themselves the men who couldnt do that kind of figuring were mostly dead by now one of the unkerlanters walked over to the fire and stirred the pot with a big iron spoon another one asked him a question in their guttural language before the first fellow answered he licked the spoon then he grinned and nodded if that didnt mean the stew was ready istvans stomach thought that was what it meant the growl that rose from his midsection might have come from a hungry wolf he glanced anxiously toward the unkerlanters in the clearing attacks could go wrong all sorts of ways but hed never heard of one betrayed by a rumbling belly alarm ran through him when one of swemmels soldiers looked his way im not here he thought as loudly as he could you didnt hear that after a moment the unkerlanter looked away istvan didnt even dare sigh with relief ever so slowly he brought his stick up to his shoulder he had a clear blaze at the enemy sentry he couldnt assume any of his comrades did if he managed to knock the fellow over the rest of the soldiers in the squad would take that as their signal to blaze at the other unkerlanters if everything went right the clearingand the cook potwould be theirs in minutes if anything went wrong istvan didnt dwell on that hed seen too many things go wrong since getting hauled out of his valley and into the army all you could do was make the best of them his finger slid toward the touch hole at the base of the stick the unkerlanter sentry leaned forward suddenly wary he lifted his hand to point into the woods not toward istvan but about where szonyi would have been istvan blazed him the beam caught the unkerlanter just in front of the right ear he toppled forward dead before he could finish his motion his stick made only a small thump as it fell out of his lap but that thump was enough to make some of the soldiers by the fire turn their heads his way the unkerlanters got out a startled yelp or two before a storm of beams from the woods cut them down istvan and his comrades rushed forward into the firelight to finish them with knives it was all over faster than istvan had dreamt it could be his squadmates and he dragged corpses in rockgray tunics away from the campfire this position is ours he said happily so is this stew no one cheered that might have drawn unkerlanters down on the squad but smiles stretched wide behind tangled tawny beards as one man the gyongyosians brought out their tin mess kits istvan grabbed the iron spoon that still stuck out of the pot he held the highest rank here so he had the right to serve the other soldiers according to how well theyd fought as far as he could tell everyone had fought splendidly and the pot held plenty of stew more than those unkerlanters could have eaten by themselves he was sure he spooned out carrots and onions and big chunks of turnip and even bigger chunks of meat all in a thick gravy that said the unkerlanters had been cooking it for a long long time benczur he called to one of the troopers eat yours on the way back to the companys encampment tell captain tivadar weve taken this clearing tell him well save some of whats in the pot for him too aye sergeant benczur said around a big mouthful of meat seems a shame to waste such good stuff on officers but what can you do he slipped off into the woods heading west the direction from which the gyongyosians had come istvan also sent szonyi and another soldier into the woods to the east to give a little warning if the unkerlanters counterattacked then he happily settled down by the fire and started spooning up stew himself wouldnt mind some ale or honeywine to wash it down he said they threw in too much salt he grinned as he spoke too much salt or not it was better food than he could have got from the cooks who accompanied the gyongyosian army in a similar vein and even with a similar grin kun said and i dont care how long they cooked this mutton it wasnt long enough might as well be chewing old clothes aye its pretty tough istvan agreed but are you sure its mutton i think it tastes more like beef i used to think all your taste was in your mouth sergeant kun said planting his barb with relish now i see you havent got any there either go ahead and argue you two one of the ordinary troopers said i dont care if its mountain ape by the stars whatever it is its a lot better than empty he took another mouthful istvan could hardly quarrel with that his own mess tin had emptied with astonishing speed he was working his way through a second helping when benczur came out of the woods captain tivadar right behind him istvan sprang to his feet and saluted tivadar spied the corpses at the edge of the firelight and nodded nicely done he said and that stew does smell good have some sir istvan said maybe you can tell us whats in it i say its beef kun here thinks its mutton what i think is you fellows cant be very sharp if you dont know what goes into a stew the company commander said he held out his mess kit give me some and ill tell you what i think after istvan had filled the tin with stew tivadar sniffed it eyed it and poked at the pieces of meat with the tip of his knife he speared on started to bring it to his mouth and then hesitated kun said dont be shy captain the way youre playing with it anybodyd say you thought it was goat or sometliing tivadar wasnt smiling any more he put the chunk of meat back in the mess tin then set the tin down corporal im afraid i do think thator i think it may be anyhow you know the unkerlanters eat goat this isnt beefid take oath on thatand i dont think its mutton either behind his spectacle lenses kuns eyes went wide istvans stomach lurched like a ship in a storm goat he said in a small sick voice the horror that filled the word was on the face of every other soldier in the squad istvan wouldnt have eaten goat meat if he were starving and set down in the middle of a herd of the beasts no gyongyosian would have goats ate filth and were lecherous beasts which made them unfit for a warrior race to touch only perverts and criminals proved what they were by touching goatflesh and sealing themselves away from all their countrymen and now he had or he might have and hed eaten it with enjoyment too he gulped then he wasnt gulping any more he was running for the edge of the clearing the squad had taken from the unkerlanters he fell to his knees leaned forward and stuck a finger down his throat up came the stew all of it in a great spasm of sickness that left him dizzy and weak kun knelt beside him puking his guts up too benczur spewed a few feet away everyone in the squad vomited up the tasty but forbidden flesh but that wasnt enough tears in his eyes the inside of his nose burning and full of the sour stink of vomitthe same nasty sourness that filled his mouth istvan knew it wasnt enough he got to his feet and staggered toward captain tivadar make me pure again sir he croakedhis throat burned too and me again kun was right behind him make me clean again i polluted myself and i stand filthy below the stars the rest of the troopers echoed them tivadars face was grave he would have been within his rights to turn his back and walk away he could have left the squad outcast to wander the trackless wood without any further aid till the unkerlanters or their own righteous countrymen slew them but he didnt slowly he said you did not kill the goat yourselves nor did you knowingly eat of it istvan and his comrades nodded with pathetic eagerness all that was true it might not be enough but it was true make me pure again sir he whispered please make me pure szonyi and the other sentry came out of the woods begging as he and the rest of the squad were begging captain tivadar drew his knife again give me your hand he told istvan your leftit will hinder you less istvan did tivadar gashed his palm istvan stood silent and unflinching welcoming the bright pain only when tivadar said bind it up now did he move had tivadar ordered him to let the wound bleed he would have done that too one by one tivadar purified the rest of the soldiers none of them jerked or cried out as he bandaged himself istvan knew he would wear the scar the rest of his days he didnt care he might lose the worse scar on his soul that mattered far far more marquis balastro made himself comfortable on the cushions that did duty for furniture in hajjajs office well your excellency said the algarvian minister to zuwayza arent you proud of yourself for taking in a pack of ragged kaunians as a matter of fact i am hajjaj answered coldly i thought it was quite clear that my kings views on the subject of these refugees are very different from those of your sovereign clear balastro nodded oh aye that it is but it is still not palatable to king mezentio who has ordered me to make that clear to you as well hajjajs courtesy grew even more frigid i thank you he said inclining his head now that you have delivered your sovereigns message i assume you have no further business here perhaps i will see you again on a happier occasion until then good day balastro grimaced by the powers above sir ive known dentists who used me more gently than you do do you speak for yourself now or as mezentios man hajjaj inquired for myself balastro replied if im speaking to balastro then and not to mezentios ministerwho could after all be anyoneill say that your dentist figure is an apt one because dealing with mezentios minister is like pulling teeth well if you think dealing with the zuwayzi foreign minister is easy for king mezentios ministerwho could as you say be anyoneyoud better think again your excellency balastro said i believed our kingdoms were supposed to be allies cobelligerents hajjaj said admiring the precision of the algarvian language the distinction would have been harder to draw in zuwayzi we have had this particular discussion before balastros sigh seemed to start at his sandals weve been friends a long time you and i our side is winning this cursed war why are we quarreling more than we ever did when times were harder for us weve had that discussion before too hajjaj replied the answer is because some of the things algarve has done make my blood run cold i dont know how to put it any more plainly than that we will do whatever we have to do to win balastro said well have sulingen soon and all the cinnabar in the hills behind it lets see king swemmel keep fighting us then didnt i hear this same song sung about cottbus something less than a year ago hajjaj asked algarvians sometimes boast about what they will do not what they have done balastro heaved himself to his feet that meant hajjaj had to rise too even if his joints creaked bowing balastro said you make it very plain ive come on a bootless errand perhaps well do better another time he bowed again no need to escort me out believe me i know the way off he went strutting as if algarves armies had taken cottbus and sulingen and glogau too hajjajs secretary stuck his head into the office an inquiring look on his face go away the zuwayzi foreign minister snarled his secretary disappeared hajjaj scowled angry at himself for letting his temper show a few minutes later the secretary came in again your excellency one of general ikhshids aides would speak with you if you are available to him of course qutuz hajjaj said send him in and i am sorry i snapped at you a moment ago qutuz nodded and went out without a word he returned a moment later saying your excellency here is captain ifranji ifranji was an intelligentlooking officer whose mediumbrown skin and prominent nose suggested he might have had an unkerlanter or two down near the roots of his family tree he carried a large envelope of coarse paper carried it very carefully as if it might bite him if he didnt keep an eye on it when qutuz brought in tea and wine and cakes the captain took two token sips and one token nibble and gazed expectantly at hajjaj with a smile hajjaj asked is something on your mind captain aye your excellency something is ifranji answered not smiling back he tapped the envelope with his forefinger may i show you what i have here please do hajjaj opened a desk drawer pulled out his reading glasses and held them up while raising a questioning eyebrow ifranji nodded hajjaj slipped the spectacles onto his nose ifranji opened the envelope and pulled out a folded rather battered broadsheet he passed it to hajjaj who opened it and read formation of a legitimate government of zuwayza by agreement with a number of nobles of zuwayza and with zuwayzi soldiers who refuse to fight further for their corrupt regime a new government of zuwayzathe reformed principality of zuwayza has been formed at the town of muzayriq under the rule of prince mustanjid all zuwayzin are urged to give their allegiance to the reformed principality and to abandon the insane and costly war the brigands of bishah have been waging against unkerlant well well hajjaj peered over the tops of his spectacles at captain ifranji i have been called a great many things in my time but never before a brigand i suppose i should be honored ifranjis mouth set in disapproving lines general ikhshid takes a rather more serious view of this business your excellency well when you get down to it so do i the zuwayzi foreign minister admitted he read the broadsheet again theres more subtlety here than i would have looked for from swemmel up till now hes always said zuwayza has no business existing as a kingdom at all now he seems to be content with turning us into puppets with him pulling a tame princes strings even so ifranji said nodding general ikhshid knows no noble by the name of mustanjid and has no notion from which clan he might come he charged me to ask if you did hajjaj thought then shook his head no the name is not familiar to me either ikhshid knows our clans as well as i do i am sure he said no one knew them so well as you sir ifranji replied he flatters me and hajjaj was flattered which didnt mean he thought the praise false he thought some more my guess is the unkerlanters found some merchant or captive and gave him a choice between losing his head and becoming a false prince or perhaps there is no prince mustanjid at all only a name on the broadsheets to seduce our soldiers the seduction is what concerns general ikhshid ifranji said his thought marched with yours king swemmel has not tried a ploy like this before how much have we got to worry about hajjaj asked are our soldiers throwing down their sticks and going over to king swemmel in droves your excellency indignant reproach filled ifranjis voice of course not the men carry on as they always have in that case ikhshid hasnt got much to worry about has he hajjaj said his feeling was that ikhshid didnt have much to worry about as long as the war went well if things went wrong who could guess what might happen ifranji said is there nothing we can do on the diplomatic front to weaken the force of these broadsheets i dont suppose king swemmel will accept a formal protest hajjaj said dryly and general ikhshids aide had to nod hajjaj went on our men know what the unkerlanters have done to us in years gone by they know what the unkerlanter invasion did to us a couple of years ago too thats our best guarantee no one will want to have much to do with this reformed principality now captain ifranji looked happier that is a good point sir i shall take your words back to the general he reached for the broadsheet hajjaj handed it to him and he refolded it and put it back in its envelope then he got to his feet which meant hajjaj had to do the same they exchanged bows hajjajs back clicked ifranji young and straight hurried away with a sigh hajjaj sank back to the pillows behind his low desk he sipped at the date wine left almost untouched during the ritual of hospitality his face bore a scowl that drove qutuz away when his secretary looked in after ifranji left hajjaj didnt know he seemed so grim swemmel has no business trying anything new he muttered under his breath of itself this ploy didnt feel dangerous if anything it might even help incite the zuwayzin against unkerlanter domination but if swemmel tried one new thing who could say he wouldnt try another one one that might prove more effective no doubt king shazli would hear of the reformed principality of zuwayza from general ikhshid hajjaj inked a pen and set it to paper even so he was sure the king would ask his opinion and he would look good in his sovereigns eyes if he gave it before it was asked hed almost finished when a horrible banging overhead made his hand jerk glaring at the ceiling he scratched out the word hed ruined the banging went on and on qutuz hajjaj called irritably what is that hideous racket are the unkerlanters dropping hammers on us instead of eggs no your excellency his secretary answered the roofers are making repairs now against the winter rains are they hajjaj knew he sounded astonished truly his majesty is a mighty king to be able to get them out before urgent need most folk as i know too well have trouble persuading them to come forth even at direst need doing his best to ignore hangings and clatterings he wrote a sentence then handed the paper to qutuz please take this to his majestys secretary tell him the king should see it today aye your excellency as ifranji had before him hajjajs secretary hurried away the zuwayzi foreign minister finished the goblet of date wine and poured himself another one normally a moderate man hajjaj felt like getting drunk algarve or unkerlant unkerlant or algarve he murmured powers above what a horrible choice his allies were murderers his enemies wanted to extinguish his kingdomand were murderers themselves he wished the zuwayzin could have dug a canal across the base of their desert peninsula hoisted sail and floated away from the continent of derlavai and all its troubles if that meant taking along some kaunian refugees he was willing to give them a ride had he been able to float away though derlavai would probably have come sailing after him and his kingdom that was how the world worked these days reformed principality of zuwayza hajjaj tasted the words then shook his head no that didnt have the right ring to it king swemmel hadnt figured out how to interest the zuwayzin in betraying their own government not yet anyhow but could he if he kept trying hajjaj wasnt sure that he wasnt sure worried him more than anything else about the whole business even though bembo couldnt read all of the message painted in broad strokes of whitewash on the brick wall he glowered at it he could tell it contained the word algarvians no whitewashed message containing that word in gromheort was likely to hold a compliment bembo grabbed the first forthwegian he saw and demanded what does that say when the swarthy bearded man shrugged and spread his hands to show he didnt understand the question the constable did his best to turn it into classical kaunian ah intelligence lit the forthwegians face i can tell you that he spoke kaunian better than bembo did almost anyone who spoke kaunian spoke it better than bembo did going on bembo urged it saysthe forthwegian spoke with obvious relishalgarvian pimps should go back where they came from he spread his hands again this time in a show of innocence i did not write it i only translated you asked bembo gave him a shove that almost made him fall in the gutter to the constables disappointment it didnt quite he made as if to grab the bludgeon he carried getting lost he growled and the forthwegian disappeared pimp bembo muttered in kaunian he switched to algarvian takes one to know one before walking on he spat at the graffito some forthwegian or other thought himself a hero for sneaking around with a paint brush in the middle of the night bembo thought the forthwegian whoever he was nothing but a cursed nuisance half a dozen forthwegians in identical tunics came up the street toward him after a moment he realized they belonged to plegmunds brigade he eyed them warily much as he would have eyed so many mean dogs running around outside a farm they were useful creatures no doubt about it but liable to be dangerous too and by the way they looked at him they were thinking about being dangerous right now hed moved out of their way before he quite realized what he was doing they realized it fast enough a couple of them laughed as they tramped past his ears burned forthwegians werent supposed to intimidate algarviansit was supposed to be the other way round bugger em bembo said under his breath they dont pay me enough to be a hero he laughed a nasty laugh they doubtless didnt pay those young toughs in plegmunds brigade enough to be heroes either all he had to do was pound the pavement here in gromheort the forthwegians would get shipped off to the west to fight king swemmels troopers they might not make heroes but a lot of them would end up dead serve em right too bembo thought let em laugh now theyll be laughing out of the other side of their mouths soon enough once hed got round the corner from the men of plegmunds brigade he started swaggering once more why not no one whod seen him embarrass himself was around now as far as he was concerned what had happened back there might as well have belonged to the days of the kaunian empire no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than he saw a kaunian on the street he reached for his bludgeon a forthwegian woman who saw him and the blond called out in algarvian make him wish the powers below had hold of him instead of you dont worry sweetheart bembo answered even though the woman was ten years older than he was shapeless and homely to boot she got even homelier when she smiled which she did now bembo didnt have to look at her for long though he swung his attentionand his angertoward the kaunian you there aye you you miserable son of a whore who let you out of your kennel the forthwegian woman giggled and clapped her hands and hugged herself with glee she stared avidly if anything dreadful happened to the kaunian she wanted to watch the blond turned out to speak algarvian bowing to bembo he said i am sorry sir sorry doesnt cut it bembo advanced on him club upraised the forthwegian woman clapped her hands again sorry doesnt begin to cut it the constable growled i already asked you once what are you doing running around loose this isnt your part of gromheort and youll pay for poking your nose out of the part that is do what you want to me the kaunian bowed again this time he kept on looking down at the cobbles my daughter is sick none of the kaunian apothecaries has the drug she needs and sohe shruggedi went outside to find it if you had a daughter sir would you not do the same since hed got out of the kaunian district odds were hed already bribed one algarvian constable bembo was as sure of that as he was of his own name have you got any money left he demanded aye some the blond answered and the forthwegian woman let out an angry thwarted screech the kaunian went on if it is all the same to you though i think i would sooner take a beating i will need the money for more medicine and for food bembo stared at him either the blond was serious or else hed just come up with the most outlandish scheme to escape a beating bembo had ever heard of he didnt know whether to admire the fellows nerve or to beat him to within an inch of his life to teach him not to try that sort of nonsense again the forthwegian woman had no doubts wallop him she shouted at the top of her lungs he deserves it he said so himself wallop him reluctantlyhe didnt want to do anything the noisy woman suggested bembo decided he had to give the kaunian a lesson if the blonds got the idea they could shame the algarvians into leaving them alone who could guess how much trouble theyd cause and so raising the bludgeon he advanced on the blond he hoped the kaunian would run the fellow was skinny and looked agile the constable wasnt like to be able to catch him he could prove his own ferocity and still not beat a man who wasnt fighting back but the kaunian just stood there waiting bembo didnt soften instead he got angry the club thudded down on the kaunians back the blond grunted but held his ground that made bembo angrier his next stroke laid open the kaunians scalp and that proved too much for the blond to bear with a howl of pain he turned and fled his trousers flapped at his ankles bembo tried to kick him in the backside but missed he ran after him for half a block by then he was panting his heart thudded in his chest he slowed then stopped hed done his duty you should have blazed him the forthwegian woman shouted it would have served him right oh shut up you old hag bembo said but not very loud he didnt want her screeching at him anymore what he wanted was a simple quiet tour on the beat a tour where he didnt have to do anything but stop in at some shops he knew to cadge a few cups of wine and some cakes and sausages and whatever else he might happen to crave he sighed what hed been through felt too much like work and his day wasnt even half over yet a few blocks later he came to the park where he and oraste had met and blazed a drunken kaunian mage it was daytime now not the middle of the night and allor at least mostkaunians were closed up in their own district nowadays on the other hand the park was even more decrepit than it had been a few months before no one had bothered cutting grass or trimming weeds he could hardly make out the paved paths along which oraste and he had walked he wanted to go through the park as much as he would have wanted to go fight unkerlanters alongside the men of plegmunds brigade he stood at the edge indecisive a gust of wind sprang up and wrapped long stalks of grass around his ankles as if trying to pull him in he made a disgusted noise and hopped back but that wouldnt do he realized as much however unhappy the knowledge made him sergeant pesaro would have some pungent things to say if he funked the job and if pesaro didnt just ream him out but told his superiors bembo knew he was liable to get shipped off to unkerlant and so with a melodramatic sigh he plunged into the park dry grass scrunched under his sandals sure enough staying on the paths was next to impossible weeds and shrubs grew higher than a mans middle here and there they grew higher than a mans head when bembo looked back over his shoulder he could hardly see the street from which hed come if anything happens to me in here he thought nervously nobodyd find out for days that wasnt quite true if he didnt come back from his shift people would go looking for him but would they find him soon enough to do him any good he had his doubts a kaunian emperor from the days of old might have held court on the benches in the middle of the park without anyone outside being the wiser when bembo got to them he found not a kaunian emperor but a couple of forthwegian drunkards by their unkempt shaggy beards and filth they made the park their home bembos hand went not to his bludgeon but to the short stick he carried next to it the forthwegians watched him he nodded to them they didnt move he walked past them their eyes followed him he didnt want to turn his back on them but he didnt want them to see he was afraid either he ended up sidling away from them crabfashion a rustling in the bushes made him whip his head around another forthwegian as grimy and disreputable as the two on the benches waved his arms and shouted boo he laughed like a loon so did the other two drunks you stupid baldarsed bugger bembo screamed i ought to blaze you in the belly and let you die an inch at a time as a matter of fact he wasnt sure he could blaze the forthwegian his hand shook like a fall leaf in a high breeze the fellow whod frightened him hawked and spat oh run along home to mother little boy he said in good algarvian you cursed well dont belong anywhere they let grownups in he laughed again futter your mother bembo was still too rattled to hang on to his aplomb as a proper algarvian should his shrill voice made all the forthwegians start laughing he thought about blazing them he thought about blazing the tall grass that choked the paths too in the hope of roasting them alive the only thing wrong with that was he might end up roasting himself too instead after cursing all the drunks as vilely as he knew how he pushed on down the path toward the far side of the park he passed two more forthwegians both of them curled up asleep or blind drunk in the grass with jars of spirits or wine beside them one wore a tattered forthwegian army tunic seeing that made bembo laugh and he was sure his laugh was last and best worthless clots he said as if the three back by the benches were still close enough to hear this is what you get this is what all of forthweg gets and oh by the powers above do you ever deserve it every time ealstan saw a broadsheet praising plegmunds brigade he felt like tearing it from the wall to which it was pasted he didnt much care what happened to him afterwardsafter what sidroc had done to his brother and after sidroc had got away with it because hed joined the algarvians hounds ealstan ached for vengeance of any sort the only thing that held him back was fear of what would happen to vanai if he were seized and cast into prison she depended on him hed never had anyone depend on him before on the contraryhed always depended on his father and his mother and poor leofsig and even on conberge he hadnt thought about everything loving a kaunian woman meant when he started doing it hed thought about little except the most obvious but now now very much his fathers son he refused to evade the burden hed assumed and so in spite of scowling at the broadsheets he walked on toward ethelhelms flat without doing anything more scowling wouldnt land him in trouble most of the forthwegians in eoforwic scowled when they walked by broadsheets urging them to join plegmunds brigade most but not all a couple of fellows not far from ealstans age stared at one of the broadsheets their lips moving as they read its simple message that wouldnt be so bad one of them said cursed unkerlanters deserve a good boot in the balls you ask me oh aye his pal nodded the sun gleamed off the grease with which he made his hair stand up tall enough to give him an extra inch or so of apparent height the nastysweet odor of the grease didnt quite cover the reek that said neither he nor his friend had gone to the baths any time lately their tunics were grimy too if theyd ever had any luck they were down on it now i bet they feed you good there the first one said and his friend nodded again both of them eyed ealstan as he went by he didnt need to be a mage to see into their thoughts if they knocked him over the head and stole his belt pouch they might also eat well for a while he hunched his shoulders forward and let one hand fold into a fist as if to say he wouldnt be easy meat the two hungry toughs turned away to watch a girl instead when ealstan got to ethelhelms building the doorman gave him the onceover before letting him in in this prosperous part of eoforwic his own ordinary tunic seemed almost as shabby and worthy of suspicion as those of the young men whod been looking at the broadsheet but then the doorman said youre the chap who casts accounts for the band leader right thats me ealstan agreed and the flunky relaxed up the stairs ealstan went as usual he contrasted the stairwell in this block of flats with the one in his own the stairs here were clean and carpeted and didnt stink of boiled cabbage or of sour piss neither did the hallways onto which the stairs opened after he knocked ethelhelm opened the door and pumped his hand saying come in come in welcome welcome thanks ealstan said ethelhelm lived more splendidly than his own family had back in gromheort living large was part of what made a bandleader what he was while a bookkeeper who did the same would only make people wonder if he skimmed cash from his clients even had his father been a bandleader though ealstan doubted hestan would have flaunted his money powers above knew ealstan didntcouldntdo any flaunting of his own wine ethelhelm asked when ealstan nodded the musician brought him some lovely golden stuff that glowed in the goblet and sighed in his throat ealstan wished vanai could taste it calling it by the same name as the cheap harsh stuff he brought home to their flat hardly seemed fair ethelhelm by all appearances took it for granted that hardly seemed fair either the bandleader said shall i bring you tea and little cakes too so we can pretend were naked black zuwayzin no thank you ealstan laughed ethelhelm waved him to the sofa when he sat down he sank into the soft cushions there fighting against the comfort as he fought against the languor the wine brought on he asked and did this latest tour go well i think so but then ive got you to tell me whether im right ethelhelm answered everywhere we went we played to soldout houses ive got a great big leather sack full of receipts thatll let you figure out whether we made any money while we were doing it if you didnt make enough to pay me im going to be upset with you ealstan said both young men laughed they knew it wasnt a question of whether ethelhelms band had made money but of how much the bandleader and drummer said i expect youll find enough in the books for that and wholl know whether its really there or not to any honest bookkeeper that was an insult hestan would have been coldly furious to hear it regardless of whether he showed his anger ealstan forgave ethelhelm reasoning the band leader knew no better he said its a wonder the algarvians let you travel so widely they think we help keep things quiet ethelhelm answered and ill be cursed if i havent had a good many algarvian soldiers and functionaries listening to me this tour they like what were doing too do they ealstan said tonelessly aye ethelhelm didnt notice how ealstan sounded he was full of himself full of what he and the band had done everybody likes us everybody in the whole kingdom and do you know what i think its bloody wonderful more slowly than he should have ealstan realized ethelhelm had already had a good deal of wine that didnt keep his own anger from sparking and he wasnt so good at hiding it as his father would have been everybody eh ayeno doubt about it ethelhelm declared laborers noblemens sonsand daughtersrecruits for the brigade even the redheads like i said everybody loves us even kaunians ealstan asked kaunians ethelhelm spoke the word as if hed never heard it before well no he shrugged but thats not our fault if the algarvians would have let them listen to us they would have loved us too or i think so anyhow a lot of them arent that keen on forthwegian music you know so i do ealstan said remembering vanais reaction when hed smuggled her to a performance of the band but ill bet they would have liked us on this tour ethelhelm rolled on as if ealstan had sat quiet these new songs weve been doingit doesnt matter who you are these days youll like em now ealstan did sit quiet he didnt care for ethelhelms latest songs nearly so well as hed liked the earlier ones they still had the pounding rhythms that had made the band popular in the first place but the words were just words they lacked the bite that had made some of ethelhelms earlier tunes grab ealstan by the ears and refuse to let him go sadly he said let me have that sack of receipts you were talking about and ill see how much sense i can make of it of course even drunkboth on wine and on his own popularity ethelhelm remained charming let me get them for you he heaved himself up off the sofa and went back into the bedchamber wobbling a little as he walked he returned with the promised leather sack which he thumped down at ealstans feet there you go let me know where we stand as soon as you have the chance if youd be so kind ill take care of it ealstan promised ill see you soon then ethelhelm saida dismissal if ever there was one he didnt ask about vanai not a single solitary word he couldnt have forgotten her he had an excellent memory he justcouldnt be bothered that was how it seemed to ealstan he picked up the sack of receipts and headed for the door the sack felt unduly heavy as if it were more than leather and papers ealstan wondered if he were carrying ethelhelms spirit in there too he didnt say anything about that after a whileas soon as he got outside ethelhelms block of flatshe decided he was imagining things the sack weighed no more than it should every trash bin every gutter on the way home offered fresh temptation somehow ealstan managed not to fling the sack away or to drop it and then keep walking he was sure no beautiful woman no matter how wanton could arouse his desires like the sight of an empty inviting bin but he resisted though he doubted vanai would have been proud of him for it when he gave the coded knock at the door to his flat vanai opened it and let him slip inside what have you got there she asked pointing to the leather sack rubbish he answered nothing but rubbish and i cant even throw it away worse luck what are you talking about she asked those are ethelhelms things arent they of course they are what else would they be why are you calling them rubbish then why ill tell you why ealstan took a deep breath and did exactly that the more he talked the more the outrage and sense of betrayal hed had to hide while he was at ethelhelms bubbled to the surface by the time he finished he was practically in tears hes making all the money in the worldor all the money thats left in forthweg anyhowand hes stopped caring about the things that got him rich in the first place thats too bad vanai said its even worse because he probably does have some of my blood in him forgetting his own kind she grimaced probably plenty of kaunians whod like to forget their own kind if only the forthwegians and algarvians would let them she set a hand on ealstans shoulder for a moment then turned back toward the kitchen suppers almost ready ealstan ate in gloomy silence even though vanai had made a fine chicken stew after sucking the last of the meat off a drumstick he burst out ive been afraid this would happen since the first time the redheads asked his band to play for plegmunds brigade when those whoresons were training outside of eoforwic vanai said its not even treason not really hes looking out for himself thats all a lot of people have done a lot worse i know ealstan said thats all sidroc was doing too looking out for himself i mean thats how it starts the trouble is thats not how it ends he thought of what had happened to leofsig then he thought about what might happen to vanai he had been angry now all at once he was afraid nine as happened so often when pekka was intent on her work a knock on the door made her jump she came back to herself in some surprise it was time to head for home which meant that was likely her husband out there sure enough leino stood in the hallway only after she gave him a hug did she realize how grim he looked whats wrong she asked sorceries making squibs instead of fires today no the magic went about as well as it could he answered but theyre closing down my group or most of it even so the sentence made perfect grammatical sense it still didnt mean anything to pekka why would they do that she asked its crazy maybe so but maybe not too leino said they dont think so theyre calling just about every practical mage whos a man and under fifty into the military service of the seven princesinto the army or navy in other words oh pekka deflated with the word as a blownup pigs bladder might have done after a pinprick but how will they make better weapons if they send the sorcerers off to fight its a good question leino agreed the other side of the silverpiece is how can the soldiers fight without mages at the front to ward them and to use spells against the enemy but we havent got that big an army pekka said we havent now no but were going to leino said come on lets walk to the caravan stop no use getting home late because of this is there im not going in tonight or tomorrow either it wont be long though he started down the hall toward the door numbly pekka followed having olavin go into the army was one thing her brotherinlaw would keep right on being a banker hed just be a banker for kuusamo rather than for himself and his partners if leino went to war he would go to war in truth as if reading her thoughts he said you know sweetheart were only just getting started in this war were going to need a lot of soldiers to fight the gongs and the algarvians both and theyre going to need a lot of mages when the algarvians smote yliharma that was a warning about how hard this fight would be if we dont take it seriously well go under but where will the new things come from pekka repeated as her husband held the door open so she could go outside he closed the door then trotted a couple of steps to catch up with her as they walked across the campus of kajaani city college from the mages who arent men under fifty he answered from the old men like your colleagues and from women too we arent algarvians after all to think women worthless outside the bedroom will it be enough pekka asked how can i know that leino said all too reasonably it had better be enoughthats all i can tell you two students both young men strode across their path one of them looked back at pekka it meant nothing it was no more than the way almost any man would eye an attractive woman all of a sudden though pekka hated him why wasnt he going into the army instead of leino because he doesnt know anything much the thought echoed inside her head she glanced over toward her husband how unfair to have to go off and leave his family behind because hed spent years learning to master a complex difficult art knowledge was supposed to bring rewards not penalties pekka reached out and squeezed leinos hand as hard as she could he squeezed back nodding as if shed said something he understood perfectly well a goodsized crowd had gathered at the caravan stop in the center of the campus waiting to go back to their homes in town a newssheet vendor cried out headlines algarvians send dragons by the score over sulingen again town in flames thousands said to be dead if it werent for the strait of valmiera that could be us pekka said leino shrugged we have trouble fighting gyongyos and algarve at the same time mezentio wont have an easy time warring on us and lagoas and unkerlant hed better not anyhow or were all ruined thats so but then pekka remembered how shed thought the whole world was falling apart when the algarvians made their sorcerous attack on yliharma but we have scruples mezentios thrown over the side too and she clung to leino afraid of what would happen if he went to war against a kingdom whose mages didnt blink at slaughtering hundreds thousandsfor all she knew tens of thousandsto get what they wanted itll be all right leino said though he had no more certain way of knowing that than pekka did she was about to tell him as much when the leyline caravan came gliding up only a couple of people got off one of them a grizzled night watchman whod been patrolling the city college campus longer than pekka had been alive but even the kuusamans most of the time an orderly folk jostled and elbowed one another as they swarmed onto the cars pekka found herself with a seat leino stood by her hanging on to the overhead railing the caravan slid away toward the center of town and then toward the residential districts farther east the fellow sitting beside pekka got up and got off she moved over by the window leino sat down beside her till the caravan got to the stop closest to their home they held hands all the way up the little hill that led up to their house and to elimaki and olavins beside it pekka smiled at utos excited squeal when leino knocked on the front door elimaki was smiling when she opened the door toosmiling in relief unless pekka missed her guess since uto often made her feel that way she could hardly blame her sister for being glad to hand back her son uto came hurtling out leino grabbed him and tossed him in the air what did you do today his father asked nothing uto replied which if it meant anything meant nothing aunt elimaki caught me at anyhow you look tired elimaki told pekka no thats not it pekka shook her head but leinoshe touched her husband on the armhas been called into the service of the seven princes oh elimakis hand leaped up to her mouth she knew what that meant or might mean aye olavin had gone into the service too but he probably wouldnt get anywhere near real fighting not when he was as skilled at casting accounts as he was the same didnt hold for leino pekkas sister stepped forward and hugged him powers above keep you safe from your mouth to their ears leino said like everyone else he surely knew the abstract powers had no ears that didnt keep himor a lot of other peoplefrom talking as if they did uto came out onto the front porch in time to hear what was going on he had a gift for that one day he might make a fine spy papas going to go off and kill a bunch of stinking gongs he exclaimed hurray he capered about above his head his mother and father and aunt exchanged wry looks if only it were so simple pekka said sadly if only anything were so simple leino ruffled utos coarse black hair come on you bloodthirsty little savage he said his tone belying the harsh words lets go home and have some supper whats supper going to be utos tone implied that if he didnt care for what was offered he might not feel like going home but when pekka said ive got some nice crabs in the rest crate her son started capering again he liked the soft sweet flesh that lurked inside crabs shells he liked cracking the shells to get at the meat even better as usual with crabs he made a hideous mess of himself during supper odds were he liked that best of all afterwards pekka heated water on the stove to add to the cold she ran into a basin uto didnt particularly like getting a bath not least because pekka spanked his bare wet bottom if he splashed too outrageously he played for a while after the bath then leino read him a hunting story after that with only a token protest he tucked his stuffed leviathan under his chin and went to sleep pekka walked into the kitchen and came back with an old bottle of jelgavan brandy and a couple of glasses she poured drinks for herself and leino what id really like to do is get so drunk i wont be worth anything for the next two days she said ilmarinen would do itand then on the third day hed come up with something nobody else would think of in the next hundred years hes something all right leino agreed but i dont want to talk about him not tonight pekka cocked her head to one side and looked at him from the corner of her eye oh she said her voice arch what do you want to do tonight this he said and took her in his arms after theyd kissed and caressed each other for a while pekka thought he would lead her back to the bedchamber instead he pulled her tunic off over her head and lowered his lips to her breasts oh she said softly and pressed his head against her but caution reasserted itself what if uto walks in and catches us then he does thats all leino answered well send him back to bed again with a warm backside and then well get back to what we were doing most nights pekka would have kept on arguing a good deal longer not tonight she usually had a good healthy yen for her husband tonight the way she stroked him the way she took him in her mouth the way she lay down in front of the fireplace and arched her hips so he could go into her felt as much like desperation as like passion the mewling noises she made deep in her throat as her own pleasure overflowed came far louder and wilder than usual sweat slicked leinos hair it had very little to do with the fire only a few feet away he grinned down at her i ought to get called into the service of the seven princes more often she poked him in the ribs which made him grunt and twist away and pull out of her she felt him go with a stab of regret how many more chances would they have before the war swept them apart would they ever have more chances after the war swept them apart to her dismay tears dripped from the corners of her eyes and spilled down onto the rug leino brushed them away itll be all right he said everything will be all right it had better be pekka said fiercely she clutched him to her presently she felt him stir against her flank that was what shed been waiting for she rolled him onto his back and rode astride himshe knew that was easier for his second round and knew how much she wanted one it wouldnt solve anythingshe knew as much even while she threw back her head and gasped as if shed run a long way for now though she didnt have to think about all the things that might happen later and that wasnt so bad the distant mutter ahead was the surf rolling up onto the rocky beaches of southern valmiera cornelu glanced at the lagoans his leviathan had borne across the strait of valmiera from setubal he spoke two words in their tongue good luck one of them said thanks the other just nodded they both let go of the leviathans harness and struck out for the shore a few hundred yards away cornelu wondered if hed ever see either one again he doubted it the lagoans were brave but they werent showing much in the way of sense not here or maybe he had it wrong he recognized the possibility a lot was going on here in the ocean on the shore and in the air above the little valmieran village called dukstas lagoan dragons flew overhead dropping eggs all over the surrounding countryside and with luck keeping algarvian footsoldiers from coming forward along with the saboteurs and spies who rode leviathans lagoan ships had brought along several regiments of soldiers they were going up onto the beach even as cornelu watched for the first time lagoas was bringing the war home to the occupiers of valmiera but what do they expect cornelu asked his leviathan as if it knew and could answer will a few regiments throw all the algarvians out of this kingdom will the valmierans rise up and fight the occupiers will it be a great victory or are they only throwing their men away to no purpose columns of smoke rose into the sky from dukstas king vitors thrust here had caught whatever algarvian garrison the seaside hamlet held by surprise for the moment it belonged to the lagoans but now that they had it what would they do with it they do not think these things through cornelu said now that the leviathan had served him well for a while he talked to it almost as he would have to eforiel will they storm on to priekule chasing mezentios men before them as they go i have my doubts maybe the lagoans didnt have any doubts because more and more men paddled ashore in small boats cornelu supposed the lagoans had chosen to attack dukstas because a ley line ran close by the beach even if naval vessels couldnt come right up to the shore they could let soldiers off close by and they certainly had taken the algarvians by surprise even so mezentios men were fighting back eggs splashed into the water around the lagoan warships one of them burst alarmingly close to cornelu the shock wave buffeted him and the leviathan the beast which felt it far more acutely than a man would quivered in pain a burst too near a leviathan could kill as cornelu knew too well but mezentios men didnt even know he and his leviathan were there they were after the ships which they could see the naval vessels fought back with eggs of their own and with heavy sticks those set more fires on the shore despite everything the navy could do despite the dragons an algarvian egg struck home a ship staggered in the water staggered and fell off the ley line whether any more eggs hit it or not it wouldnt be going home to setubal cornelu looked up into the sky dragons wheeled and twisted there now the lagoans werent having it all their own way as they had when the attack on dukstas began the algarvians were flying in beasts of their own from the interior of valmiera if they flew in enough of themif they had enough of them to fly inthe ships here would be in a lot of trouble one of the lessons of this war was that ships needed dragons to ward them from other dragons an older lesson one dating from the six years war was that ships needed leviathans to ward them from other ships and leviathans how long would the algarvians take to start moving patrol craft from ports along the strait of valmiera to attack the lagoan interlopers not longcornelu was sure of that he urged his leviathan away from the little lagoan fleet ifno when mezentios sailors moved to the attack he wanted to be ready to give them an unpleasant surprise he knew the ley line along which the ships would be coming as for leviathans he grinned with the beast he rode he was willing and more than willing to take on any algarvian leviathan around he hadnt thought he would feel that way about any beast save eforiel but hed turned out to be wrong an algarvian dragon dove on one of the lagoan ships cornelu could see the eggs slung under the dragons belly beams from heavy sticks reached up for it one of them found it before the dragonflier let the eggs drop burning and tumbling the dragon fell into the sea the ship kept gliding along the ley line up my friend cornelu told his leviathan and it rose in the water he of course rose with it taking advantage of that he peered inland he couldnt see so much as he would have liked smoke from the fires already burning in the seaside village obscured his view but he could see that the lagoan soldiers seemed to be making for some specific place in back of dukstas not fanning out all over the countryside maybe that meant they really did know what they were doing he hoped so for their sake nobodyd bothered to tell him what they were doing though he sighed that was no tiling out of the ordinary and sure enough here came an algarvian ship from the east the first no doubt of many to assail the lagoan fleet cornelus lips skinned back from his teeth in a savage smile the algarvians had come too fast they were intrepid sometimes intrepid to a fault having got the order to attack the lagoans theyd piled into their patrol craft and charged out of whatever harbor housed it eager to be first on the scene and make king vitors men pay and here they are out ahead of everyone cornelu murmured and the next thought of leviathans they have will be their first hed sunk a leyline cruiser he had no trouble sneaking up on this smaller enemy ship mezentios men their eyes on the target ahead paid no attention to anything but the lagoan ships on their ley line the rest of the ocean they worried about it not at all cornelu secured an egg to the side of the algarvian vessel then urged his leviathan away from it when the egg burst the leviathan gave a startled jerk then swam away harder than ever after a while it had to surface to breathe cornelu looked back toward the ship hed attacked there wasnt much to see not any more that egg could have put paid to another cruiser it was ever so much more than enough to wreck a patrol craft only a few bits of flotsam floated on the water only a few men struggled in it if they kept their heads they might be able to swim to shore most of their countrymen though had gone down and would never rise again another algarvian ship had been perhaps a mile behind the first one seeing it come to grief mezentios men frantically brought their vessel to a stop eggs from the lagoan ships began landing near it and quickly scored a couple of hits cornelu cheered the algarvian vessel reversed its course and limped away from the fight but more algarvian ships were coming from the west and more and more algarvian dragons were overhead a lagoan ship caught fire and settled back to the surface of the sea unable to ride on the ley line any more another ship hit by several eggs rolled over onto its side and sank when cornelu glanced at the sun he was surprised to see how far into the northwest it had slid the fighting on land and sea around dukstas had been going on for most of the day the question was how much longer could the lagoans keep it up in the face of the superior forces algarve was marshaling against them though cornelu hopefully peered south he spied no new ships coming up from the direction of setubal whatever he and his comrades were supposed to be doing they were supposed to be doing it by themselves soldiers started trotting back toward the beach and piling into the boats from which theyd gone forth to kill and burn oars flashing they pulled out toward the ships that had brought them to valmiera but not so many of those ships were left and some of the survivors were under attack cornelu cursed to see the punishment the soldiers took it wasnt as if they were sibians but they were fighting the algarvians sailors let down nets and rope ladders to help the ones who made it out to the leyline ships come aboard as soon as all the soldiers had been taken up the ships glided east along their ley line till it crossed one leading south toward lagoas cornelu urged his leviathan south too to cover their retreat no algarvian warships pursued them which surprised himmezentios men were not usually inclined toward half measures but dragons from the mainland of derlavai dogged the fleet almost all the way back to setubal cornelu wondered how many men whod landed at dukstas would see their homes again he would have been astonished if even half were that lucky the leviathan didnt bring him to the lagoan capital till after sunrise the next day exhausted almost beyond bearing he staggered to the sibian barracks and fell asleep without even wrapping the blanket on his cot around himself no one woke him when he climbed out of the cot the sun had crawled across the sky instead of barley mush he ate fried prawns and washed them down with ale then he went out to learn what he could not in the harbor but in the taverns next door to it hed expected to find the sailors furious at such a botched assault on the algarvians instead they seemed happy enough that puzzled him but not for long he had to buy only a couple of mugs before a lagoan told him what he wanted to learn aye the fellow said we did what we came for we did and no mistake and that was cornelu asked in his halting lagoan didnt you know the sailor stared at him with something approaching pity they was building a captives camp back o that town they was would have served us the way they served yliharma they would wont be able to do that now they wont let a lot o poor cursed kaunians run free we did ah cornelu said slowly once he made sense of the lagoans dialect which took a little while so that was the game that was the game sure was the sailor agreed cost us some it did but setubal wont come crashing down around our ears it wont no it wont cornelu raised a finger to the busy fellow behind the bar and bought the lagoan sailor another mug of aleand one for himself as well the sailor gulped his cornelu sipped more thoughtfully how many more times would the lagoans have to strike across the strait of valmiera to keep the algarvians from using massacre to power magic against their capital that had an obvious answeras many as they have to cornelu nodded seen only as a raid the strike against dukstas had been expensive seen as protection for setubal it was cheap indeed he had trouble imagining lagoas staying in the fight with its greatest city ruined and lagoas has to stay in the fight he thought if she doesnt algarve likely wins however much he disliked that he saw no way around it most of the time talsu was convinced the algarvians would have been far happier had skrunda had no news sheets at all every once in a while though the redheads found them useful when enemy dragons dropped eggs on the town the news sheets had screamed and brayed about it for days now they were screaming and braying again lagoan pirates try to invade mainland of derlavai a hawker shouted waving a sheet enemy beaten back with heavy loss generals say theyre welcome to try again read it here read it here talsu gave him a copper as much to make him shut up as for any other reason the news sheet didnt tell him much more than the hawker had it just said the same things over and over each time shriller than the last when hed finished that story and the ones about the great algarvian victories in southern unkerlant he crumpled up the sheet and tossed it into the gutter then he wiped the ink from the cheap printing job off the palms of his hands and onto his trousers his mother would complain when she saw the dark smudges there but that would be later for now he wanted to get his hands somewhere close to clean more hawkers with stacks of news sheets cried out the headlines as talsu strode through the market square as far as he could tell they used the same words as had the ragged fellow from whom hed bought a sheet he wondered if hawkers all over jelgava were selling the exact same stories with the exact same words he wouldnt have been a bit surprised when he walked past the grocery store gailisas father ran he looked in the window hoping to get a glimpse of her no such luck her father ambled out from behind the counter to put jars of candied figs on the shelves talsu was heartily glad gailisa favored her mother had she been plump and doughy and hairy he wouldnt have wanted anything to do with her her father saw him through the window and waved talsu waved back more from duty than from affection he looked forward to marrying gailisa he certainly looked forward to some of the concomitants of marrying gailisa but he didnt particularly look forward to being yoked to the rest of her family as well he got round a corner before her father could come out and start yattering at him hurrying like that though gave him a painful stitch in the side it wouldnt have before the algarvian soldier stabbed him he knew as much only too well but he couldnt make that not have happened his own father had a copy of the news sheet open on the counter behind which he worked traku was cutting and sewing a tunic while he read his hands knew what to do so well that he had to glance at his work only every now and then he looked up from the news sheet when talsu came in oh its you he said were you expecting somebody else talsu asked king donalitu maybe he wouldnt have made such jokes before donalitu fled the algarvians not unless he felt like spending some time in one of the kings dungeons the redheads encouraged jokes about the king for jokes about themselves though they had dungeons of their own talsus father knowing that lowered his voice as he answered no i thought youd be one of mezentios officers ready to gloat about this he tapped the news sheet with a forefinger ive seen it talsu said even if i hadnt seen it id have heard about it the whole towns heard about it by now the way the hawkers keep bellowing like so many branded steers traku chuckled they do go on and on and on talsu agreed theyll be putting up copies for broadsheets any minute now if theres one thing the algarvians are good at its bragging about themselves they were also good all too good at war or they wouldnt have occupied skrunda and the rest of jelgava talsu didnt like thinking about that and so he didnt his father said you know what theyre telling us here dont you he tapped the news sheet again theyre telling us nobody is going to save us so well just have to save ourselves talsu shook his head thats not what they mean theyre telling us nobody is going to save us so wed bloody well get used to king mainardo he still wasnt talking very loud but he spoke with great vehemence get used to going hungry get used to shortweight coins get used to algarvians lording it over us forever thats whatll happen if we dont do something about it all right traku glanced down at the news sheet i think were saying the same thing with different words maybe talsu rubbed his side how long would the livid scar there go on paining him for the rest of his days he didnt like to think about that either but i never dreamt when the redheads came in theyd make me wish we had our own king and nobles back again who did who could have his father said but you have to be careful where you say that if you arent youll disappear and you wont have the chance to say it anymore i know talsu pointed to the tunic his father was working on are you going to use the algarvian sorcery to finish that one aye traku grimaced he couldnt get in trouble for praising the redheads not with things as they were in skrundain all jelgavathese days but that didnt mean he was happy about doing it its better than the magecraft i had before no two ways about it the magic is good the algarvians he grimaced again grimaced and shook his head thinking about the algarvians always made talsu think about the one whod stabbed him thinking about that redhead made him think about gailisa which was much more enjoyable and from gailisa his thoughts didnt have to go far to reach her father he said maybe its time you talked with the grocer changing the subject didnt bother his father think so do you traku said if i had to guess id say gailisa has thought so for quite a while what do i do when her old man asks me what took you so bloody long ears burning talsu answered tell him anything you want do you think itll matter traku laughed though talsu didnt think it was very funny no i dont suppose the stalling will queer this match the way it would some i could think of not much likelihood gailisa will turn you down is there i hope not talsu said blushing some more if she did itd be a scandal worse than any weve seen in skrunda since i was younger than you are now traku said i guess you may have heard the story of the fellow who got married to three different girls on the same day a time or two talsu said which was somewhere around a hundredth of the truth he grinned at his father must have been one tired bridegroom by the time he got done that night i wouldnt doubt it traku said with a grin of his own of course they do say he was a young man a very young man so he had some chance of bringing it off before talsu could answer that with another lewd sally his father went up the stairs he returned a moment later with a jar of apricot brandy and a couple of glasses after filling them both he gave talsu one and raised the other heres to grandchildren to grandchildren talsu echoed and drank the brandy glided down his throat and burst in his stomach like an egg he hadnt thought much about having children of his own though he certainly had thought about the process by which children came into the world traku hadnt brought the brandy down unnoticed ausra came halfway down the stairs and asked does that mean what i think it means that my sister is a snoop talsu returned aye what else could it mean ausra stuck out her tongue at him he went on we havent done any talking yet but were going to do some talking its about time ausra said echoing traku ive wanted gailisa for a sisterinlaw for a long time now i figure getting her is the only good ill ever have from you as a brother without giving him a chance to answer she hurried back upstairs again but she didnt stay there for very long after a moment she and her mother came down both of them carrying glasses traku poured brandy for them half a glass for ausra a whole one for laitsina talsus mother kissed him do you know what the best thing about having grandchildren is begetting them talsu thought but that surely wasnt what laitsina had in mind he shrugged and said tell me youre going to anyhow i certainly am and i ought to box your ears for impudence but laitsina whod gone through a lot of the brandy in a hurry was smiling and a little redfaced the best thing about grandchildren she declared with oracular wisdom is that you can give them back to their mother and father when they get to be a nuisance thats so traku agreed cant do it with your own children youre stuck with them he looked from talsu to ausra and back again then he looked at his own glass and seemed surprised to discover it empty the jar of brandy stood close by on the counter he remedied the misfortune hed found the whole family was getting merry when the front door to the tailors shop opened they all looked up in surprise as if theyd been caught doing something shameful the algarvian officer standing in the doorway twiddled with one spike of his waxed mustachios seeing happy people is good he said in fair jelgavan why am i seeing happy people a coming betrothal traku answered he didnt offer the redhead any brandy affecting not to notice that the algarvian said it is good i hope there is being much joy from it thanks talsu said grudgingly if that algarvian trooper hadnt stabbed him his chances with gailisa might not have been so good even that though didnt endear any of king mezentios men to him more grudgingly still he went on what do you want here the redhead displayed a tunic i am wanting a warm lining sewn into this i am going from here to another place to fight i will be needing a warm lining i will be needing all the warm i can be getting for unkerlant youll need more than a warm lining talsu said and the algarvian winced as if he hadnt wanted to hear his destination named too bad talsu thought thats where youre going and with any luck you wont come back i can do it traku said but my sons right youll need more than that i saw as much last winter that made the algarvian look unhappier yet traku added would you be interested in a nice thick cloak now a cloak the algarvian sighed aye i had better be having a cloak is it not so it certainly is so traku said and i have just the thing youll want to a redhead going off to unkerlant he would show sample after sample like talsu he surely hoped the algarvian would meet his end there and profit profit counted too skarnu wished he had more connections better connections hed managed to keep the fight against algarve alive in his little part of valmiera and he knew others were doing the same across the kingdom but he didnt know how well they were doing how much annoyance they were causing the occupiers not enough merkela said when he raised the subject over supper one evening not even close to enough she would have said the same thing if the valmierans had been on the point of driving king mezentios men from the kingdom tails between their legs had she known how to do it she would gladly have gone to algarve herself to bring the war home to the redheads she would have tried to kill mezentio in his palace and wouldnt have cared at all if she died so long as she brought him down skarnu was sure of that raunu set down a rib bone from which hed gnawed all the meat theyd killed a pig the day before he said the more we tie them up here the less they have to throw at the unkerlanters and if they dont beat the unkerlanters they dont win the war hed been only a sergeant but no general could have summed things up better so skarnu thought at any rate merkela tossed her head to her unkerlant was too far away too foreign to seem either real or important but vatsyunas and pernavai both nodded having come from forthweg the escaped kaunians knew in their bellies the importance and reality of unkerlant he speaketh sooth vatsyunas said still sounding antiquated as he learned valmieran after a lifetime of classical kaunian aye the former dentists wife said softly that was one word that had changed little down through the centuries how much more could we be doing though skarnu persisted how badly do you want to get yourself killed and everybody whos in this with you raunu asked if you try and get greedy thats whatll happen merkela glared at the veteran sergeant he ignored her which wasnt easy skamu feared he was right whenever the algarvians grew provoked enough to go after irregulars they could muster enough force to put them down vatsyunas said an you tell me what the game requireth so shall i right gladly undertake it though i lay down my life in the doing for i have seen horrors and long to requite them aye pernavai said again neither of them sounded as fierce as merkela but she eyed them with nothing but respect her hatred for the redheads was personal so was theirs but theyd also seen kaunianity in forthweg wrecked they never talked about going home as best skarnu could tell they didnt think they would have any home to which to return vatsyunas said ist true the tale borne hither from pavilosta that lagoas did smite the algarvians exceedingly down by the shore of the salt sea skarnu shrugged there was a fight thats all i know the lagoans couldnt have done all that well or theyd have kept a grip on the mainland he still wanted to look down his nose at the islanders if theyd done more earlier in the war maybe valmiera wouldnt have fallen and their kingdom still held out where his had given up two years before he resented them for being able to shelter behind the strait of valmiera how would they have done against swarms of algarvian behemoths none too bloody well or he missed his guess but pernavai said methinks you mistake their purpose for ist not more likely they came for to hinder the slaughter of more of my kinsfolk than intending invasion of your land now vatsyunas spoke up in support of his wife aye thats also my conception of the quarter whence bloweth the wind for surely the redheaded savages would have drained mine energies of vitality and the aforesaid of my ladys as well to hurl a stroke thaumaturgic gainst the isle across the sea slowly skarnu nodded across the table from him raunu was nodding too skarnu clicked his tongue between his teeth the western kaunians suggestion made more sense than anything hed come up with for himself he and his comrades had managed to sabotage one leyline caravan bringing kaunians from forthweg toward the shore of the strait of valmiera if others had got through if the algarvians were on the point of serving setubal as theyd served yliharma merkela spoke up after unusual silence people need to know people in these parts do know skarnu said a lot of the folks who made it off that caravan are still free people didnt turn em back to the algarvians any more than we did and all the kaunians out of forthweg have tales to tell merkela shook her head thats not what i meant people all over valmierapeople all over the worldneed to know what the algarvians are doing the more reasons they have to hate the redheads the harder theyll fight them vatsyunas and pernavai leaned toward each other and whispered back and forth in classical kaunian too soft and fast for skarnu to catch more than a couple of words then vatsyunas asked a blunt bleak question why think you this news will be of any great import to them that hear it after all tis nobbut the overthrow of so many already despised kaunians powers above tis likelier a matter for rejoicing than otherwise he picked up his mug of ale and gulped it dry were kaunians too skarnu exclaimed hed felt it like a beam through the heart when the column of victory was felled in priekule if that didnt make him a proper kaunian what could but pernavai and vatsyunas looked at each other and didnt say anything skarnu felt a slow flush rise from his neck to his cheeks and ears and on to the very top of his head till the war no one had rubbed his nose in his kaunianity every day of the year hed been one among many not one among a few no one had hated him for what he was thinking about that made him shake his head as if trying to fend off invisible gnats we have to let people know merkela repeated once she got an idea she disliked letting go how raunu asked does pavilosta even have a printers shop i dont recall seeing one no news sheeti know that skarnu said if we did up one broadsheet a mage could make copies merkela said and skarnu to his surprise found himself nodding most printing was mechanical but that was because presses were older and cheaper and needed less skill than the equivalent magecraft not because sorcery couldnt mimic what they did where do we find a mage we can trust raunu asked if he sells us out he drew this thumb across his throat skarnu nodded again the rebels he knew were farmers not wizards even merkela looked glum vatsyunas said ist a mage you need perhaps i can be of some assistance to you in this undertaking skarnu frowned every trade has its own sorcery i know that he didnt know much more than that as a rich young marquis he hadnt had to have a trade himself he went on how much has dentistry got to do with news sheets he couldnt think of any connection between the two but the kaunian from forthweg answered both involve copying which is to say the law of similarity i am most certain sure i can do that which the art requireth provided i be given ample paper for our needs and an original wherefrom to shape simulacra for whilst i can make shift to speak somewhat the jargon employed hereabouts i would not be so daft as to set my hand to writing it everyone at the table looked to skarnu raunu could read and write but he probably hadnt been able to before he joined the army during the six years war merkela too had only a nodding acquaintance with letters and pernavai like her husband was hardly at home in modern valmieran time to see whether all my schooling really taught me anything skarnu thought he knew he couldnt delay and so said ill do the best i can doing that meant putting together the story of how and why the algarvians were tormenting and killing the kaunians from forthweg skarnu understood the redheads strategy but a story that was nothing but strategy turned out to be anything but interesting he talked with pernavai and vatsyunas about what had happened to them and what had happened to people theyd known people theyd seen by the time he finished taking notes he and the exdentist and his wife were all in tears skarnu rewrote the story when he had it the way he liked it he read it to merkela and raunu they both suggested changes skarnu bristled merkela flared up at him he stomped off the picture of an offended artist the next day after hed cooled down he put in some of the changes even he had to admit they improved the piece then being without a press he had to write it out as neatly as he could when he was done it didnt look like a proper news sheet but no one who could read at all would have any trouble making out what it said he took it to vatsyunas in the barn all yours go ahead work your magic he made a fist ashamed of his own sarcasm luckily vatsyunas didnt notice he inclined his head to skarnu that shall i undertake to do his preparations seemed simple almost primitive they involved the yolks of half a dozen eggs and a cutglass bauble of merkelas that broke sunlight up into rainbows seeing skarnus curious stare he condescended to explain the yellow of the egg symbolizeth the generacynay the birth you would sayof the new whilst as this pendant here spreadeth the one light into many so shall my magecraft spread your fair copy here to all these blank leaves he patted the ream of paper raunu had brought back from pavilosta you know your business best raunu said wondering whether vatsyunas knew it at all then the kaunian from forthweg began to chant he was skarnu realized ruefully more at home in the classical tongue than any valmieran kaunian no matter how scholarly could ever hope to be for him it was birthspeech not a second language drilled in with a schoolmasters switch he could make classical kaunian do things skarnu would never have imagined because it was his and when he cried out when he laid the palm of his left hand on the ream of blank sheets skarnu could feel the power flowing through him a moment later the exdentist lifted his hand and the sheets were blank no longer skarnu saw his story set forth on the topmost one line for line word for word letter for letter as he had written it vatsyunas riffled through the ream every sheet was identical to the first identical to the copy skarnu had given him skarnu saluted him as if he were a superior officer you did better than i thought you could he said frankly now we have to get these out where people can see them and be sneaky enough while were doing it so they cant be traced back to us this i leave to you vatsyunas staggered yawned and caught himself by main force of will you will i pray forgive me i am spent fordone he lay down on the straw and went to sleep just like that as he snored skarnu saluted him again the sheets hed made would hurt the redheads far more than ambushing a nighttime patrol skarnu hoped so anyhow all things considered fernao would as soon have died down in the land of the ice people his comrades had saved himfor what for more torment was the only answer that came to him in the intervals when he was both awake and undrugged hed never been interested in medical magecraft which meant he knew less about the various distillations of the poppy than he might have some left him more or less clearheaded but did less than they might have against the pain of his broken bones and other wounds others took the pain away but took him away with it so that he seemed to be standing outside himself perceiving his battered body as if it belonged to someone else sometimes he felt ashamed to need such drugs more often he welcomed them and even began to crave them he got them less often as his body began to mend he understood the reasons for that and resented them at the same time would you rather stay in so much pain you need the poppy juice to take you out of it a nurse asked him from flat on his back he glared up at the earnest young woman id rather have stayed whole in the first place he growled she shrank away fright on her face the war or lagoas part of it was still new not many wounded men had come back to setubal to remind the folk who stayed home of what fighting really meant get used to it he thought youd better get used to it youll seeyoull hearworse than me the next dayhe thought it was the next day anyhow but the distillations sometimes made time waver toohe got a visitor he hadnt expected to see the lagoan officer still seemed absurdly young to be wearing a colonels rank badges peixoto fernao said planning to send me back to the austral continent again if youre well enough and if the kingdom needs you ill do it in a heartbeat the young colonel answered or ill go myself or ill send a fisherman or ill do whatever i think needs doing or my superiors tell me to do thats my job but i did want to say im sorry you were hurt and im glad youre on the mend he meant it fernao could see as much that obvious sincerity helped somebut only some im sorry i was hurt too the mage answered and the mending he stopped peixoto hadnt gone through it how could he understand i know peixoto said sympathetically fernao didnt rise from the bed to brain him but only because he couldnt what did peixoto know what could he know then the officer undid the top few buttons of his tunic enough to let fernao see the edges of some nasty scars fernaos rage eased he couldnt guess how peixoto had picked up those wounds but the soldier did know something about pain i hope you can keep me out of the land of the ice people when im on my feet again fernao said on his feet again how far away that seemed i have something else in mind something where i might serve the kingdom better ah colonel peixoto raised an eyebrow almost as elegantly as if he were an algarvian and that is by his tone he didnt think it could be important whatever it was he was itching to ship fernao back to the austral continent the mage could see as much but fernao said the kuusamans know something about theoretical sorcery that we dont im not sure what it isone reason im not sure is that theyve done such a good job of keeping it a secret they wouldnt be doing that if it werent important peixoto pursed his lips then slowly nodded aye he said at last i know somewhat of that though not the details which are none of my business well if the guild grandmaster agrees you should be doing this i doubt anyone from his majestys army will quarrel with him grandmaster pinhiero had already visited fernao a couple of times the mage made up his mind to make sure the grandmaster knew what he wanted pinhiero thought it was important too he wouldnt have sent fernao to kuusamo to try to learn about it if he hadnt and hadnt pinhiero said hed gone himself fernao thought so but hed been too dazed and drugged to trust his memory if he could escape eating roasted camels flesh ever again he wouldnt shed a tear thoughtfully peixoto went on and you may be needed here to help ward setubal against the algarvians magic we blocked one of their assaults when we broke up that captives camp near dukstas you know about that ive heard a thing or two the times ive been fully among those present fernao answered it could have been very bad they might have served setubal as they served yliharma this past winter peixoto said this time we got wind of it and stopped them before they could get well started but who knows if well have good luck or bad the next time fernao knew all about bad luck knew more than hed ever wanted to learn about it before he could answer peixoto a physician in a white tunic and kilt came into the chamber time for your next procedure he said cheerfully gesturing for the colonel to leave peixoto did waving to fernao as he went the mage hardly noticed he was scowling at the physician why shouldnt the whoreson sound cheerful it wasnt as if anything were going to happen to him two attendants moved fernao from his bed to a stretcher they were well practiced and gentle he cried out only once that tied his record hed never yet been shifted without at least one howl of anguish down the hall he went and into a clean white room with a piece of sorcerous apparatus resembling nothing so much as a large rest crate the spell powering it wasnt identical to the one that kept mutton chops fresh in his flat but it wasnt far removed either both the attendants and the physician draped themselves with elbowlength rubber gloves covered in silver foil to insulate themselves from the effects of the spell then the men whod borne him here lifted him once more and set him in the crate the next thing he knew they were lifting him out of the crate again he had a new pain in his broken leg and a new one in his flank too with no memory of how hed got them he also had no sure way of knowing whether theyd left him in there an hour or a couple of weeks one of the attendants offered him a little glass cup filled with a viscous purplish fluid he gulped it down it tasted nasty hed expected nothing different after what seemed forever but couldnt really have been too long the pain drifted awayor rather it stayed and he drifted away from it he dimly recalled taking the purplish stuff a few more times then instead a nurse gave him a thinner yellow liquid that didnt taste quite so vile some of the pain returned though without the raw edge it would have had absent the yellow stuff some of his wits returned too he didnt notice grandmaster pinhiero coming into his room but did recognize him after realizing he was there how are you today pinhiero asked worry on his wrinkled clever face here fernao answered more or less here anyhow he took stock he needed a little while he could think clearly under the yellow distillate but he couldnt think very fast not too bad all things considered but theres a good deal to consider too i believe that pinhiero said they tell me though they wont have to do any more really fancy repairs on you now youre truly on the mend they tell you that do they fernao thought some more slowly they didnt bother telling me of course up till not too long ago i wouldnt have had much notion of what they were talking about anyhow well im glad youre back with us and not too badly off pinhiero said which only proved he hadnt been through what fernao had the yellow drug took the edge off fernaos anger as it had taken the edge off his pain the grandmaster went on that army colonel and i have had a thing or two to say to each other lately have you that drew fernaos interest regardless of whether he was drugged what kinds of things oh this and that pinhiero sometimes delighted in being difficult who was the kuusaman mage who acted even worse ilmarinen thats what his name was dredging it up gave fernao a brief moment of triumph for instance he asked he knew he had more patience with the drug than he would have without for instance the business the kuusamans are playing with you know what i mean is that an interesting enough forinstance for you pinhiero waggled a finger at fernao i know more about it now than i did when i sent you east to yliharma too do you fernao also knew he should have been more excited but the drug wouldnt let him what do you know i know you were right pinhiero swept off his hat and gave fernao a ceremonious bow the kuusamans have indeed stumbled onto something interesting more than that i shall not say not where the walls have ears had fernao still been taking the purple distillate he might have seen or imagined he saw ears growing out of the walls with the purple stuff it wouldnt even have surprised him now his wits were working well enough to recognize a figure of speech progress he thought are they talking more than they were he asked they are the grandmaster nodded for one thing were allies now they arent neutral any more but i think the whack yliharma took counts for more thats what showed them they cant do everything all by themselves sounds sensible fernao agreedbut then pinhiero was nothing except possibly devious if not sensible after a little more slow thought the mage added when they do finally let me out of here i want to work on that i already told peixoto as much he touched one of the scarsscars now not healing scabs or open woundson the arm he hadnt broken and ive earned the right so you have lad so you have even more to the point you know where they took flight and thatll help you get off the ground heres hoping fernao said after dealing with the ice people for so long i dont know if i know anything anymore youll do fine pinhiero told him you have to do fine the kingdom needs you as peixoto had before he waved and left he could leave even with the yellow distillate dulling his senses fernao knew how jealous he was of that three days later the attendants heaved him onto his feet for the first time since hed come to setubal they gave him crutches getting one under the arm still encased in plaster wasnt easy but he managed by then he was down to a half dose of the yellow drug so everything hurt he felt like an old old man but he was upright and managed a few swaying steps without falling on his face he had to ask the attendants for help in turning him around toward the bed he made it back there too progress he thought again they weaned him from even the half dose a couple of days after that and it was not too bad he found himself craving the drugs which angered and embarrassed him when he fell asleep in spite of the pain that wouldnt go away he felt another small surge of triumph having his head clear was a pleasure in itself hed always thought well and didnt miss the mist the liquids of one color and another had cast over his mind when pinhiero came to see him again the grandmaster nodded in something like approval youre starting to look more like yourself he said i hope so fernao answered its been a while im glad i dont know anything about the time in the crate pinhiero thrust some papers at him time for you to get back into it he said read these dont say anything just read them theyre from kuusamo fernao read by the time hed got halfway down the first sheet he had to slow down because he was staring up at pinhiero every other line at last in spite of the grandmasters injunction he did speak ive been away much too long ive got a lot of catching up to do colonel lurcanio triumphant annoyed krasta more than he did any other way even importunate in bed he waved a news sheet in her face saying we have crushed them crushed themdo you hear me sulingen is bound to fall and everything beyond it right afterwards swemmel is beaten lost overthrown as surely as the kaunian empire was long ago if you say so krasta had an easier time feigning excitement in the bedchamber when she didnt feel it there but then she really did brighten that would mean the end of the war wouldnt it when she thought of the war ending she thought of the algarvians going home lurcanio disabused her of that idea no for we still have the lagoans and kuusamans to bring to heel and then we shall shape all of derlavai into the land of our hearts desire by his expression the idea made him ecstatic krasta wasnt much given to thinking in large terms but she remembered the crash as the kaunian column of victory went over and a chill ran through her in an unwontedly small voice she asked what will you do with valmiera she almost said what will you do to valmiera she didnt think lurcanio would like that on the other hand he might like it altogether too well rule it the algarvian officer answered placidly go on ruling it as we rule it now he got up from behind his desk stood in back of krastas chair and began caressing her breasts through the thin silk of her tunic she wanted to slap his hands away he wasnt usually so crude in reminding her that power not love made her take him to her bed but she didnt have the nerve which proved his point after a little while he seemed to recall himself and sat back down when he wasnt touching her her spirit revived she said derlavais too big to fill up with algarvians anyhow do you think so lurcanio laughed as if shed said something funny by the look in his eye he was going to explain just how and why he found her a fool hed done that many times she always hated it as she always hated submitting to any judgment save her own but at the last moment lurcanio checked himself and all he said was where shall we go for supper tonight so many restaurants have gone downhill these days krasta said in no small annoyance they serve up the most horrible pottages what they would be serving goes to better use lurcanio didnt elaborate but went on what do you say to the suckling pig you may rely on its food for many algarvian officers visit there all right krasta said not making the connection between her remark and lurcanios comment shall we leave here around sunset i get too hungry to wait long for supper lurcanio bowed in his seat milady i am putty in your hands even krasta knew that was overblown algarvian courtesy for lurcanios will prevailed whenever it clashed with hers he went on and now if you will be so gracious as to excuse me i must get some small bits of work done to keep my superiors content with me even krasta knew that was dismissal she got up and left not too illpleased despite his roaming hands now she knew she had something to do with her evening life in priekule wasnt what it had been before the redheads came and life in priekule without the algarvians was duller than it was with them she sighed things would have been ever so much simpler had valmiera won the war she reached the front hall just as the postman brought the afternoon delivery normally she didnt see the mail till the servants had gone through it and got rid of the advertising circulars and anything else that didnt seem interesting today just to be contrary she took it all herself and carried it upstairs as soon as she started going through it she realized how much trouble the servants saved her several pieces went into the wastepaper basket unopened one ordinarylooking envelope almost joined them there because she didnt recognize the handwriting in which it was addressed how likely was it that some stranger vulgar enough to write to her would have anything worth saying but then curiosity overcame disdain with a shrug she used a letter opener in the shape of a miniature cavalry saber to slit the envelope when she unfolded the paper inside she almost threw it out again it wasnt a letter at all but some sort of political broadside her lip curled in a sneer it wasnt even properly printed but written out by hand and then duplicated by a sorcerer who was none too good at what he didink smudged her fingers and blurred the words as she held it but some of those words seized her attention the headlinekaunianity in perilfit too well with the conversation shed just had with lurcanio lurcanio she knew would have denied every smeary word on the sheet he had denied that his countrymen were doing such things to kaunians krasta had believed him too not least because disbelieving him would have made her look at things she didnt care to face but the story that unfolded on the broadsheet certainly sounded as if it ought to be true whether it was or not the details felt convincing if they hadnt happened they seemed as if they could have and the sheet was written in a style she found very familiar though she had trouble putting her finger on why shed got about halfway through it when she realized the style wasnt the only familiar thing about it she recognized the handwriting too she shook her head no she said thats impossible skarnus dead but if she didnt know her brothers handwriting who would she stared down at the sheet then over toward the west wing where lurcanio was busy running priekule for the conquerors slowly and deliberately she tore the sheet into tiny pieces then she used the privy and flushed the pieces away she washed her hands with great care as much care as she might have used to get blood off them skarnus alive she thought dizzily alive lurcanio had asked after him not so long before hed known or at least suspected her brother hadnt perished in the fighting shed thought he had shed been wrong for once she wasnt even sorry to find out shed been wrong past that dizzy relief she thought no more about what skarnus being alive might mean till lurcanio handed her up into the carriage for the trip to the suckling pig then she realized her lover might have beenno surely had beenasking after her brother so the algarvians could hunt him down and kill him for skarnu had to be one of the brigands and bandits who showed up in news sheets every now and again what would she do if lurcanio started asking questions about skarnu now he wont she thought he cant i got rid of everything he cant know anything she relaxed a little thenand only thendid another question occur to her what would she do if skarnu asked her questions about lurcanio what are you doing sleeping with an algarvian was the first of those questions to spring to mind they won the war theyre stronger than we are surely everyone could see that but if everyone could see it why was her brother still fighting the algarvians she didnt want to think about that she didnt want to think about anything when they got to the suckling pig she ordered spirits instead of ale and with grim determination went about the business of getting drunk lurcanio raised an eyebrow that time i had you after you drank yourself blind wasnt much fun for either one of us he said thats what youve told me krasta shrugged i dont remember anything about it but the headache the next morning remembering the headache made her pause before her next sip but not for long the end of her nose turned numb she nodded she was on the way she ordered pork and red cabbage on a bed of noodles lurcanio winced i wonder that all you valmierans arent five feet wide the way you eat his own choice was crayfish cooked in a sauce flavored with apple brandy this now this is real food not just stuffing your belly full a few tables away viscount valnu in the company of a pretty valmieran girl and an even prettier algarvian officer was demolishing an enormous plate of stewed chicken seeing krasta looking his way he fluttered his fingers at her she waved back then said to lurcanio see how hes eating and hes skinnier than i am well so he is lurcanio admitted more versatile too by all appearances he rubbed his chin i wonder if i made a mistake letting him take you off that one night who knows what he had in mind nothing happened krasta said quickly though shed wanted intended something to happen to keep lurcanio from seeing that she added we both might have been killed if we hadnt gone out just before that cursed egg burst aye i remember thinking so at the time lurcanio scratched the scar on his face hed carried away from that night a lucky escape for the two of you we never have caught the son of a whore who secreted that egg there when we do his handsome features congealed into an expression that reminded krasta why she feared to cross him hesitantly she said if you algarvians worked more to make us like you and did less to lurcanio didnt let her finish he burst out laughing so uproariously that people from all over the suckling pig turned to stare at him ignoring them all he said my dear my dear my foolish dear nothing under the sun will make kaunians love algarvians any more than cats will love dogs if we do not use the strength we have your people will despise us instead you make them hate you krasta said let them hate so long as they fear lurcanio said as he had a way of doing he waggled a finger at her and with that i give you a word of advice do not believe everything that comes to you in the daily post krasta picked up her glass of spirits knocked it back and signaled for a refill i dont know what youre talking about the liquor had made her nose numb fear did the same to her lips hed made jokes about knowing what came to her before she got it what if they werent jokes at all very well he said lightly now have it your way but you had better go right on not knowing what im talking about or you will be most sorry do you understand what im telling you i think so krasta answered how did he know how could he know did he have a mage monitoring her did the servants blab they hadnt sorted the afternoon post but some of them might have seen the envelope shed got did lurcanio sort through everything that went down the commode by the powers above krasta smiled there were times when she thought he deserved to do just that whatever he knew he didnt know everything he didnt know about skarnu hed asked after her brother before when she didnt know about him either whatever he knew he hadnt pulled all the pieces together krasta hoped he never would ten marshal rathar wished he were still at the front coming back to cottbus meant coming back to king swemmels constant complaints it meant coming back to subordination too away from the capital rathar gave orders and none dared say him nay in cottbus swemmel gave the orders rathar understood that very well he also understood why hed been summoned to the capital major merovec fiddled with the decorations pinned onto rathars fanciest dressuniform tunic the ministersespecially the lagoanwill sneer at you if everything isnt perfect merovec said fussily he sniffed i dont care what anybody says the whoreson looks like a stinking algarvian to me he looks like an algarvian to me too rathar answered theres one difference though hes on our side now am i pretty enough if i am kindly let me take my place beside the king still fussing merovec reluctantly stepped aside rathar walked from the antechamber out into the throne room a murmur ran through the courtiers as they spied him they wished he were at the front too his presence meant they had less room for jockeying among themselves hed overstated things when telling merovec he would stand beside swemmel the king gorgeous in ermine and velvet and cloth of gold sat on a throne that raised him high above the mere mortals who formed his court that was how things were in unkerlant first the sovereign then a long way below everyone else but rathars place was closest to the throne horns blared harsh in a great voice a herald cried your majesty before you come the ministers of lagoas and kuusamo and down the long way from the entrance to the throne room to the throne itself came the two diplomats they walked side by side in step with each other so that neither had to acknowledge his colleague as his superior lord moisio of kuusamo bore an annoyingly ambiguous title as far as rathar was concerned he wore an embroidered tunic over baggy trousers but there his resemblance to anything kaunian stopped he was swarthier than any unkerlanter little and lithe with narrow eyes and a nose that hardly seemed there at all a few gray hairs sprouted from his chin a most halfhearted beard and major merovec had been rightbut for his ponytail count gusmao lagoas minister did look like an algarvian as he strode along beside moisio he even walked like an algarvian with the air of a man who owned the world and expected you to know it he was tall and longfaced and redheaded and wore tunic and a kilt that showed his knobby knees maybe the styles of those garments were subtly different from the ones mezentios men would have worn but few unkerlanters cared for subtleties rathar wasnt the only man who wanted to bristle at the sight of gusmao the real algarvians had come too close to swarming over the palace here still in unison gusmao and moisio bowed before king swemmel not being his subjects they didnt have to prostrate themselves moisio spoke first which had probably been decided by the toss of a coin i bring greetings your majesty from my masters the seven princes of kuusamo his unkerlanter had an odd drawl swemmel leaned forward and peered down at him most men have trouble enough serving one master we have never fathomed serving seven i manage moisio said cheerfully he nudged gusmao the nobleman who looked too much like an algarvian said and i bring greetings from king vitor who congratulates your majesty on your brave resistance against mezentios hungry pack he didnt sound like an algarvian his accent though probably thicker than moisios lacked the trilling lilt mezentios men gave to unkerlanter we greet you and vitor through you swemmel said he glared down at both diplomats more gladly though would we greet soldiers from lagoas or kuusamo fighting our common foe on the mainland of derlavai where this war will be won or lost our men fight here where are yours all over the seas gusmao answered in siaulia on the austral continent in the air above valmiera and above algarve itself everywhere but where it matters swemmel said with a sneer you had some on the derlavaian mainland and the redheadsthe other redheads i should sayran you off it what heroes you must be we shall be back gusmao answered meanwhile we tie up plenty of algarvians and yaninans who would be fighting you swemmels glance flicked fast as a striking snake at rathar ever so slightly the marshal nodded gusmao was telling the truth there or a good part of it no matter how welcome lagoan soldiers on derlavai would have been all that meant at the moment was swemmel swinging his eyes toward moisio and you sirrah what lying excuses will you give us i dont know moisio answered easily what sort of excuses would you like your majesty rathar didnt think swemmel would order a friendly lands minister boiled alive but he wasnt altogether sure few people had the nerve to talk back to the king of unkerlant even he trembled every time he had to try it but moisio went on the plain truth is we are not ready to fight on the mainland yet we would not have been in this war at all had the algarvians not started killing kaunians to power their sorcerers spells against you dont push us too far or we can still back out that was what rathar thought the kuusaman meant he hoped king swemmel understood as much swemmels storms of temper were famous but now would be a very bad time for him to have one the king glared at moisio the kuusaman minister looked steadily back in his quiet understated way he had sand after a silence that stretched swemmel said well now you have seen for yourselves what their wizards can do if you are not yet ready to fight hard you had better be soon we work toward it moisio answered as soon as we can we aim to hit algarve a good solid blow as soon as you can swemmel was sneering again though not so fiercely and what are we supposed to do in the meantime we have been bearing this burden by ourselves since last summer we bore it alone for most of a year gusmao said king swemmel looked daggers at him but mezentios men could not come to grips with you not when you hid behind the sea if they could have your kingdom would have rolled onto its belly soon enough we did not we have not we fight on rathar coughed if the king ever wanted help from kuusamo and lagoas he would be wise not to antagonize their ministers now gusmao was scowling back at the king of unkerlant lagoans werent quite so proud and touchy as their algarvian cousins but they had their limits then moisio said we need to remember the enemy we all fight and that for the first time in the audience struck the proper chord with swemmel aye he exclaimed by the powers above aye but you two your lands are all but untouched we have taken many heavy blows how many more can we take before our hearts break in his own way swemmel was clever he never would have raised the possibility of defeat to his own people if these foreigners thought unkerlant might give up though what would they not do to keep her in the fight if unkerlant went under kuusamo and lagoas would have to face a derlavaibestriding algarve allied with gyongyos rathar wouldnt have wanted to try that by their expressions neither lord moisio nor count gusmao relished the prospect gusmao said we of lagoas have not given up and we know our brave unkerlanter comrades will not give up either well help you in every way we can and we moisio agreed it would be easier if we didnt have to dodge so many algarvian ships to bring things to you but we manage every now and then a pittance swemmel said rathar suppressed a deadly dangerous urge to turn and kick his sovereign in the ankle but then the king seemed to realized hed gone too far but all aid we grant is welcome we are in danger and stretched very thin aye all aid is welcome when gusmao and moisio used we they were plainly speaking of their people with king swemmel rathar often had trouble figuring out whether he was talking about unkerlant or himself he certainly seemed stretched very thin these daysone more reason rathar wished he were back on the battlefield and away from the subtle poisons of the capital not two minutes after the ministers from kuusamo and lagoas bowed their way out of the throne roombefore most of the unkerlanter courtiers had had the chance to leavea runner came up the aisle toward rathar lord marshal he called and waved a folded sheet of paper rathar waved back i am here swemmel leaned down from the throne how now i dont know your majesty rathar could think of nowhere he less wanted to open an urgent dispatch than under the kings eye but he had no choiceand the news was urgent indeed even if it was news he would sooner not have had he looked up toward swemmel your majesty i must tell you that since you summoned me up here to attend this audience the algarvians have broken through in the direction of sulingen and why is that marshal king swemmel rasped is it because you botched the defenses while you were there or because you are the only one of our generals with any wits at all rathar bowed his head that is for your majesty to judge if swemmel still felt liverish because of the imperfectly satisfying meeting with the ministers of lagoas and kuusamo his head might answer but the king said only well youd better get back down there and tend to things then hadnt you after a long but he hoped silent breath of relief rathar answered aye your majesty he almost added thank you your majesty he didnt he was beholden to swemmel of course but not he hoped overtly so staying official was easier and safer traveling south to sulingen wasnt so easy and on one stretch of the journey algarvian dragons dropped eggs from on high trying to wreck his leyline caravan they missed but not by much when he did make it to the city on the wolter he found that general vatran had set up his headquarters in a cave in the side of a steep gully that led down to the river the only light in the place when rathar ducked inside came from a candle stuck into the mouth of an empty jar of spirits the jar sat on a folding table at which vatran was scribbling orders he looked up from his work and nodded back from the capital eh lord marshal he said well welcome home then home rathar looked around the walls of the cave were nothing but dirt when he looked back through the opening most of what he saw was rubble and wreckage smoke and the smell of death filled the air he grabbed a folding chair and sat down beside vatran thanks what do we need to do here sergeant istvan sneaked toward the forest village with nothing but suspicion most of these places were only unkerlanter strongpoints these days king swemmels soldiers looked to have forgotten about this one though maybe they didnt never know it was here maybe corporal kun was as delighted to find the village as he was if only we had a couple of light eggtossers we could knock the place flat without needing to go in there and do the job ourselves thats expensive i know theres you and me and szonyii dont think anything the stars shine on will kill szonyi any time soon istvan said but theres an awful lot of new fish too and they die easier than they should kun said were not getting the best of the levies either i heard captain tivadar grousing about that theyre sending the men they like best out to the islands in the bothnian ocean to fight the kuusamans we get whats left doesnt surprise me a bit istvan said only thing that surprises me is how long it took em back home to figure out this miserable war here isnt ever going to get anywhere kun nodded his spectacles and somehow his patchy beard made him look very wise aye i think youre right the trouble is we still have to fight it and isnt that the sad and sorry truth istvan peered through a screen of pine saplings and ferns at the village ahead all at once he went very still voice the tiniest thread of whisper he said come up here and tell me whether thats not a real woman drawing water from the well there has it been so long youve forgotten the differences kun asked but also in a whisper istvan started to plant an elbow in his ribs as he moved up to take a look but refrained the noise might give them away kuns lips pursed in a soundless whistle that is a womanmay the stars accurse me if i lie whats she doing drawing water from the well there istvan repeated patiently where theres one woman thereve got to be more wouldnt you say are the unkerlanters trying to make them into warriors kun asked if they are they must be running out of men she doesnt look like a warrior istvan said that proved nothing and he knew it if swemmels menno swemmels soldierswere setting a trap the woman naturally wouldnt look like a warrior he kept peering toward the village it didnt look like a trap either it looked like a village that had been going about its business for a long time he wondered if the people there even knew unkerlant and gyongyos were at war after a moment he wondered if the people there had ever heard of gyongyos his hand tightened on his stick if they hadnt they would a man strolled by he was an unkerlanter of course but wore a brown tunic not one of rockgray he carried a chicken carcass by the feet when he came up to the woman she said something he paused and answered she made as if to slosh the bucket of water shed just drawn up over him they both laughed thin with distance their voices floated to istvans ears he turned to kun if thats a trap its an accursed good one the unkerlanters make accursed good traps kun pointed out which was inarguably true but istvan shook his big shaggy head even so it doesnt feel like a trap he said which was a harder argument to knock over the head it feels like a village that hasnt thought about anything but its own concerns sincesince the stars first shone down on it he waited for kun to mock him mockery was one of the things the city man the mages apprentice the sophisticate was good for but when kun answered he too sounded wondering it does doesnt it its istvan groped for a word and found one its peaceful thats what it is maybe peace is a magic that wasnt the sort of thing that should have come from a man of a warrior race but it was what lay in his heart kun only nodded hed seen enough war to know what it was enough war to have had a bellyful of it himself he said you dont suppose that woman would laugh for us if we came out of the woods and tried to chat her up shed laugh if we tried doing it in unkerlanter thats certain sure istvan said wistfully he went on i havent even seen a woman since that unkerlanter i blazed in the mountains this past winter no sport in her kun said well sergeant what do we do let me think istvan plucked at his beard and tried to do just that what he wanted to do was what kun had said show himself walk up to the villagers and say hello he knew he had a better than even chance of getting blazed if he did he wanted to do it anyhow safest would be to bring the whole company forward and crush the village under an avalanche of gyongyosian might but if the village really was just a village he would be wrecking something he might enjoy he let out a soft sigh hed long since come to understand the difference between what he wanted to do and what he needed to do go back to the company encampment he said with a sigh let the captain know what weve found and tell him we want reinforcements to make sure we take it out aye sergeant kun looked as if he hated him but obeyed silent as a cat he slipped off into the woods is this part of the curse of eating goats flesh istvan wondered must i worry for the rest of my days or am i simply being led astray now he didnt know he couldnt know but he feared that sooner or later the curse would bite down hard ritual cleansing went only so far the stars had seen what hed done maybe thinking about the goats flesh was what made him step out of the forest and into the clearing that held the village if somebody there grabbed a stick and blazed him it would be expiation for what hed done if no one did maybe the stars had forgiven him after all behind him his men let out startled gasps get back sergeant szonyi hissed from a few trees away istvan shook his head theyd already seen him there in the village oh he could still duck back into cover but oddly he didnt want to whatever would happen would happen that was all the stars already knew theyd known for as long as theyd been shining now he would find out too startled cries rang out the woman at the well stared and pointed toward istvan people came tumbling out of houses and a bigger log building that might have been a tavern they all pointed and exclaimed plainly strangers here were a prodigy which proved the unkerlanter army didnt know this place existed nobody aimed a stick at him nobody was holding one they have to have them istvan thought there isnt anybody who doesnt know about sticks is there like a man in a dream he walked toward the villagers some of them came toward him too he still had hold of his stick but didnt raise it it was too light to see the stars but they were always there eclipses proved it if you want me to make amends for what i did that can happen im ready one of the villagers spoke to him in guttural unkerlanter it wasnt hands high or surrender or throw down your stickabout all he knew of the enemys language i dont follow he said in his own language and then because being polite seemed wise in a dream he added im sorry to his surprise the unkerlanter a grayhaired man answered in accented halting gyongyosian not try to talk this talk many years sometimespast timesyou people come trade for furs you want trade for furs we have furs to spare they didnt know there was a war they didnt recognize his uniform for what it was maybe i will trade for furs he said dazedly he fumbled in his belt pouch and pulled out a small silver coin can i buy some brandy first all the villagers gaped at the coin there were outoftheway valleys in gyongyos that hardly ever saw real money too the unkerlanter who spoke gyongyosian said something in his own language everyone exclaimed three young men pelted toward the big building the one who got there first came back with not just a mug but a jar he took the silver from istvan as if afraid the soldier would scream about being cheated with another coin i could buy the prettiest girl here istvan realized moneys worth a lot they must never see it at all first things first though he yanked out the stopper and took a swig sweet fire ran down his throat it was plum brandy and tasted like summer ahh he said and swigged again the grayhaired unkerlanter clapped him on the back he put an arm around the shorter mans shoulder then looked around trying to decide which girl he would offer silver the villagers exclaimed again and pointed toward the woods the soldiers in istvans squad seeing nothing bad happen to himseeing in fact the reversewere coming out too your friends asked the man who spoke gyongyosian ayemy friends istvan turned and called to his men theyre nice as can be act the same and well all stay happy they all to dress like you the unkerlanter said he sounded surprised once more didnt he know about uniforms if he didnt how long had this village been cut off from the wider world a cursed long time that was sure istvans troopers wasted no time in getting spirits for themselves a couple of them wasted no time in trying to get friendly with the village girls and their luck looked likely to be good sure enough silver was almost sorcerously potent here smiling at one of the girls istvan jingled the coins in his belt pouch she smiled back aye shes a slut he thought but it might not have been so simple an encounter with a stranger was hardly the same as lying down with a village boy whod brag of his conquest for months afterwards with dumb show they reached a bargain istvan gave the girl two coins and offered her the jar of brandy she drank from it then tilted her face up and kissed him his arms slid around her her lips were sweet on his her breasts firm and soft against his chest where he asked she might not know the word but shed understand what he meant and she did pointing back toward one of the houses but theyd taken only a few steps in that direction when more gyongyosian soldiers burst from the woods shouting war cries gyongyos ekrekek arpad they started blazing before they asked a single question or saw nothing amiss had happened to istvan and his squad the villagers screamed and ran and tried to fight back some of them made it back to their homes they did have sticks and used them bravely a beam from a comrades weapon caught the girl istvan had kissed and dropped her dead at his feet he was lucky his own friends didnt blaze him down too no he shouted but nobody on either sideand there were sides now paid him any attention when the villagers started blazing he threw himself down behind the girls corpse and blazed back finishing them off didnt take long not when captain tivadars whole company rolled down on them three or four women didnt get killed right away the gyongyosians lined up to have a go at them ignoring their shrieks istvan stayed out of the lines he found he had no taste for that sport captain tivadar came over to himpublic rape was beneath an officers dignity one village that wont trouble us tivadar said it wasnt troubling us anyhow istvan mumbled tivadar only shrugged war he said as if that explained everything maybe it did as she usually did pekka bristled when someone knocked on her office door how was she supposed to guide a caravan of thought down its proper ley line if people kept interrupting her if this was professor heikki pekka vowed to put an itching spell on the department heads drawers but it wasnt heikki as pekka discovered when she opened the door a kuusaman soldier stood there one hand on the stick at his belt the other holding a sealed envelope he eyed her you are pekka the theoretical sorcerer aye pekka said the soldier looked as if he didnt want to believe her in some exasperation she told him you can knock on any door you like along this hall and get someone to tell you who i am to her amazement he actually did only after one of her colleagues vouched for her did he give her the envelope for which he required her to write out a receipt then with a grave salute he went on his way pekka found herself tempted to throw the envelope in the trash unopened that appealed to her sense of the perverse what more fitting fate for something the soldier so obviously judged important but she shook her head the trouble was the soldier was all too likely to be right and the envelope she saw by the design of the value imprint came from lagoas one corner of her mouth turned down she still wasnt sure shed done the right thing in backing siuntio and agreeing to share some of what they knew with kuusamos island neighbors aye the lagoans were allies but they were still lagoans she opened the envelope she wasnt surprised to find the letter written in excellent classical kaunianthe last time i dropped you a line mistress pekka i did not have to send it by special courier the lagoan wrote of course the last time i dropped you a line you insisted i had no need to do so i understand why you said that but now i know it is not true i have been astonished at the discoveries you and your colleagues have made and offer my assistance in any way you might find useful i am presently recovering from wounds i received on the austral continent but should be well enough to work before too long until then and until i hear from you i remain your obedient servant fernao mage of the first rank fernao pekka murmured and slowly nodded sure enough she remembered his earlier letter hed been a snoop then and evidently remained one but now he was a snoop with a right to know she set aside her calculations not without a small irked grimace she couldnt see now where shed hoped to head before the soldier knocked on the door and reinked the pen shed been using on them i have received your letter she wrote and hope your recovery from your wounds is swift and sure my own husband went into the service of the seven princes not long ago and i worry about him pekka looked at that and frowned again was it too personal she decided to leave it in the powers above knew it was true she went on indeed we have done a good deal of interesting work since we stopped publishing in the learned journals and a man of your abilities will help us go further i cannot set down the details here but i think we may be on the edge of something intriguing as perhaps you may also be hearing from my colleagues again i wish you well and hope to hear from you again pekka at kajaani city college she put the letter into a prepaid envelope and copied out the address in setubal fernao had given her then she hesitated her letter didnt say much but neither had fernaos and hed sent his by courier could she risk hers in the maelstrom of the mailstream for all she knew half the postal workers in kajaani were algarvian spies but she hadnt the faintest idea how to order up a special courier maybe she should have told the one whod brought the letter to wait unfortunately that would have required more forethought than shed had in her the head of whatever garrison kajaani boasted could have told her but she didnt want to talk to him she didnt want to talk to anyone who didnt already know what she was involved with then she smiled ilmarinen would know siuntio would too no doubt but she still fought shy of bothering him she didnt so much with ilmarinen he lived both to bother and to be bothered when she attuned her crystal to his she found his image looking out of the glass at her a moment later well what now he asked an assignation because your husbands not at home i can be there in a few hours if you like you are a filthy old man pekka said to which the senior theoretical sorcerer responded with an enormous grin and a big nod of agreement telling herself she should have expected as much she asked how do i go about getting a courier to deliver a letter for me ilmarinen might have made more suggestive banter pekka watched him think about it and to her relief decide against it he said youd do best to talk to prince jauhainens men i think hes not half the man his uncle was but he can manage that for youhed cursed well better be able to anyhow expecting anyone to match up to prince joroinen is asking a lot pekka replied but thats still a good notionhis folk will know enough of what im doing that i wont have to do any more explaining thank you ill try it whos the letter to ilmarinen asked the lagoan named fernao pekka said she wouldnt mention fernaos trade by crystal not when emanations might be stolen she did add you know him dont you oh ayea most inquisitive fellow fernao is ilmarinen set a finger by the side of his nose i see youre arranging an assignation with him not with me i must be too old and ugly for you and too crackbrained to boot pekka snapped ilmarinen crowed laughter delighted at getting a rise out of her she glared ill have you know he was wounded down in the land of the ice people what a painful place to be hurt ilmarinen exclaimed pekka refused to acknowledge that in any way which wasnt easy ilmarinen shrugged anything else he asked pekka shook her head so long then he told her and vanished from the crystal it glowed for a moment then went back to being nothing but a glassy sphere pekka activated her crystal again sure enough prince jauhainens aide whod served prince joroinen before he died in the algarvians sorcerous assault on yliharmapromised to send a man and the fellow arrived not much later pekka gave him the letter and went back to work it went better than shed thought it would maybe that was because she like fernao had written in classical kaunian composing in a language not her own especially one so different from kuusaman forced her to think clearly or maybe though she hadnt thought so shed just needed a break from what she was doing pretty soon ill be ready to go back into the laboratory again she thought if siuntio or ilmarinen comes up with something interesting itll be sooner yet those were notions shed had several times since shed started probing the relationship at the heart of the laws of similarity and contagion now though she had a new one iwonder what fernao is making of this as he catches up to us she hoped the lagoan was well and truly impressed if he wasnt he should have been without leino to come knock on her door she had to pay more attention to leaving for home at the right time shed been very late one day when uto had been even more inventive than usual and her sister elimaki usually the bestnatured woman around had screamed at her when she finally came to get her son she didnt want that to happen again as she chanted the spells that would secure her calculations in her desk till she came for them in the morning she wondered if they were as strong as they might be oh she was sure they would foil a burglar looking for whatever he could sell for a little cash but who was more likely to want to break into her office that kind of burglar or an algarvian spy ilmarinen will know if the spells are good enough she thought ilmarinen had a raffish distrust of his fellow man siuntio couldnt come close to matching siuntio was more brilliant but ilmarinen lived inreveled inthe real world the real world hit her in the face when she walked across the kajaani city college campus to the leyline caravan stop to wait for a car to take her home the newssheet vendor at the stop was shouting word of the algarvian breakthrough into the outskirts of sulingen trapani says its so and cottbus doesnt deny it he added as if that proved everything maybe it did shed got used to evaluating war claims out of the west by splitting the difference between what the algarvians and the unkerlanters said if the unkerlanters werent saying anything pekka shook her head that wasnt a good sign and the grim look on elimakis face when pekka came to pick up uto wasnt a good sign either pekka wanted to throw up her hands what now she asked and scowled at her son what did you do today nothing uto replied as sweetly as he always did when hed committed some new enormity he learned a little spell elimaki said powers above only know where children pick these things up but they do and hes your son and leinos so he has talent tootalent for trouble thats what what did you do pekka asked uto and then realizing she wouldnt get an answer from him she turned to elimaki what did he do he animated the dogs dish thats what so it chased poor thumper all over the house and spilled table scraps everywhere thats what he did elimaki said uto looked up at the sky as if hed had nothing to do with that dish oh no pekka said doing her best to sound severe and not burst into giggles uto found such creative ways to land in trouble not many children his age could have made that spellpekka was pretty sure she knew which one it waswork so well even so even so he would have to be punished uto you cant do that kind of thing at aunt elimakis houseor at home either pekka added hastily leaving loopholes around uto wasnt safe your tiny stuffed leviathan is going to spend the night up on the mantel that brought the usual storm of tears from her son it also brought a new threat ill make him come back to me so i can sleep i can i will no you wont pekka told him you will not use magic without permission never you will not do you understand me it can be very dangerous all right uto said sulkily pekka could see he wasnt convinced she didnt care she would do whatever she had to do to convince him children playing with sorcery were at least as dangerous as children playing with fire if taking utos toy leviathan away didnt work if she had to switch his backside instead she would were leino here he surely would have pekka took her sons hand come on she said lets go home ahead of trasone sulingen burned it was a great burning the smoke rising in tall choking brownblack clouds sulingen was a bigger city than the algarvian veteran had thought it would be it sprawled for miles along the northern bank of the wolter its districts cut here and there by steep gullies day after day dragons painted in red green and white pounded it from the air eggtossers hurled more destruction at it but because it was a big city it was hard to wreck and the unkerlanters fought back as if they would fall off the edge of the world if they were forced into the wolter crouched behind a heap of bricks that had once been somebodys chimney trasone called out to sergeant panfilo i thought what with all the behemoths and such weve got we were supposed to go around the cursed unkerlanters not through em he didnt lift up his head when he spoke plenty of king swemmels soldiers would have been delighted to put a beam between his eyes if he were so foolish panfilo stayed low too in a little hole in the ground for which hed made a breastwork from the dirt dug out of it we did all that how do you think we got here now theres no more room to go around so we go forward instead an egg burst not far from them rocks and clods of earth and chunks of wood pattered down on trasone he ignored them with the resignation of a man whod known worse we ought to find some kind of way to get across the wolter he said over in his foxhole panfilo laughed only way i know is straight south he answered this is the only place where weve even come close to the bloody stinking riverand weve already got yaninans guarding our flanks trasone grunted he knew that as well as panfilo did they arent quite as hopeless as i thought theyd be he saidnot much praise but the best he could do panfilo laughed again they dont like the notion of getting killed any better than you do pal if they dont fight some they know cursed well theyll die but wouldnt you sooner see our lads doing the job instead of course i would you think im daft or something trasone shook his head which made a couple of pebbles fall from the brim of his hat into the dirt beside him and id sooner the yaninans were full strength with behemoths and eggtossers and dragons id sooner we were too now he laughed a laugh full of vitriol and while im at it ill wish for the moon it wasnt funny replacements kept filtering in to the battalion but it was still far under strength all the battalions and regiments at the thin end of the wedge were far under strength that was how it got to be the thin end of the wedge by grinding against the unkerlanters they had to be getting thin on the ground too but they always seemed to have plenty of soldiers when the battalion tried to go forward and sometimes they tried coming forward themselves more eggs fell around trasone he wanted to hide to dig down deep in the dirt so no danger could find him but he knew what was liable to happen when the unkerlanters started tossing lots of eggs they wanted the algatvians to put their heads down whereupon a wave of infantry in rockgray tunics would wash over them sure enough from off to the left major spinello shouted here they come the barefaced baldarsed buggers he didnt need to have cried out the rhythmic roars of urra urra that rose from the unkerlanters would have told the algarvians fighting in the outskirts of sulingen everything they needed to know now trasone had to peer out from behind his heap of bricks as hed seen them do outside aspang the unkerlanters were advancing in thick lines one a few feet behind another they blazed as they came some of diem had linked arms which helped steady them as they scrambled over the wreckage that had once been houses and shops they hadnt knocked out all the algarvian eggtossers eggs caught the footsoldiers out in the open knocking some of them down flinging others high into the air leaving nothing whatever of still others the eggs tore great holes in the unkerlanters ranks but trasone like his countrymen had long since learned king swemmels men had very little give in them the ones who werent felled came on urra swemmel urra along with his comrades trasone started blazing their beams made more unkerlanters stumble and fall but other men in rockgray always rushed up to take the places of those who couldnt go forward any more trasones mouth went dry the unkerlanters were going to break in among the algarvian troopers it would be every man for himself then with numbers counting as much as or more than skill a melee of blazing and sticks swinging like clubs and knives and fists and teeth sometimes the unkerlanters took prisoners more often they slaughtered them the algarvians fought the war the same way trasone had just blazed down another unkerlanter when several shadows swiftly swept over him with coughing roars half a dozen algarvian dragons flamed swemmels onrushing soldiers the unkerlanters could endure eggs they could endure beams watching their friends crisp and blacken smelling the stink of burnt flesh was more than they could bear they broke and fled or went to earth well outside the algarvian lines forward spinello ordered and blew a long blast on his officers whistle to emphasize the order wishing the battalion commander would have been content to beat back the unkerlanter attack trasone scrambled out from behind the shelter that had served him so well somebody saw him a beam charred in hole in a sunbleached board by his head it could have gone through him instead and he knew it he threw himself flat behind an overturned wagon it offered concealment but not much protection he looked ahead for a better place spying one he dashed toward it an unkerlanter broke cover and started running for the same hole they saw each other at the same instant the unkerlanter started to bring his stick up to his shoulder trasone blazed from the hip the unkerlanter went down stick falling from nerveless fingers trasone dove into the hole but the dead enemys countrymen attacked again they truly were saying thus far and no farther again algarvian dragons swooped down on the unkerlanters swemmels men could not stand in the face of flame those who could fell back those who couldnt trasone ran past a shrunken twisted black doll that had up till a few minutes before been a man who wanted to kill him now the horrid thing still smoking sent up a stink that reminded him of a pork roast forgotten on a hot hot stove he spatand spat black from all the soot he was breathing in with a broadshouldered shrug he jumped down into a new hole a moment later sergeant panfilo jumped down with him you see the dead one back there panfilo asked trasone nodded panfilo shuddered that could have been us as easy as it was him not quite as easy trasone said the unkerlanters havent got a whole lot of dragons down here what difference does that make panfilo demanded you think our own beasts wouldnt flame us theyre too stupid to care who theyre killing as long as theyre killing somebody thats why theyve got dragonfliers on their backs trasone pointed out aye so they doand half the time theyre as stupid as the beasts they ride panfilo said trasone chuckled and nodded he was always ready to listen to slander about anyone who wasnt a footsoldier before panfilo could add to the slander spinellos whistle blew an urgent blast be ready boys he called ready for what trasone asked more counterattacks the major answered crystal says theyre sending lots of men up over the wolter from the south bank they dont want us in sulingen they dont want us anywhere near sulingen if we can get them out of this place and cross the wolter ourselves theres nothing between us and the mamming hills and most of the cinnabar that isnt in the land of the ice people nothing but a few million unkerlanters who hate everything about us and want to have fun with us before they finally let us die trasone said we can lick the unkerlanters spinello said trasone envied him his blithe confidence but couldnt imagine where he got it spinello went on if we couldnt lick the buggers what would we be doing here weve done nothing but lick em for the last seven hundred miles or so and we can keep right on doing it a few miles more the algarvians hadnt done nothing but lick the unkerlanters theyd taken some lickings of their own as trasone knew and spinello should have remembered but the battalion commander had a point without a lot of victories the algarvian banner wouldnt be flying here so far from home and one thing more spinello added be ready to counterattack boys youll know when before trasone could ask any questions about that the unkerlanters started tossing eggs at his position again urra urra urra the fierce shouts they used to nerve themselves for battle rang out sometimes they nerved themselves with raw spirits too here they come someone yelled in algarvian again algarvian eggtossers caught the unkerlanters in the open again they worked a gruesome slaughter on swemmels men again the unkerlanters or those of them who lived rolled forward in spite of that and in spite of the sharp accurate blazing of the algarvians awaiting them then the ground shuddered under trasone it shuddered more under the unkerlanters fissures opened in what had been solid ground what had been holes closed up often trapping men inside them flames spurted up from the surface of the ground violet flames like nothing trasone had seen till the autumn before burned unkerlanters shrieked as the dragons had been the magic was more than king swemmels men could bear they turned and fled spinellos whistle shrilled once more come on boys he yelled theyre on the run now you dont want to make our mages spend all those kaunians for nothing do you come on scrappy as a terrier he was as usual the first to leap from cover and rush after the retreating foe trasone followed he didnt care whether kaunians were being massacred to some good purpose or for no reason at all he had no use for diem and wouldnt have been sorry to see them all dead but seeing the unkerlanters in front of him dead struck him as a lot more important at the moment he and his comrades were nearing the unkerlanters trenches when the ground shook beneath them again this time spinello cried out in fury algarvian mages werent the ones working magic here trasone cried out tooin fear he didnt run not because he didnt want to but because he didnt think it would do any good he lay down behind a riven wall and hoped no crevasse would gape wide beneath him when the shaking finally ended the battalion didnt return to the attack with the same jauntiness trasone wondered how many of their ownthey didnt use kauniansthe unkerlanters had spent to gain a respite however many it was it had worked sidroc had seen war before when the algarvian army pummeled gromheort from the air and then took it hed lost his mother when the redheads dropped an egg on his house he knew he was lucky to be breathing himself but then after the algarvians occupied eastern forthweg a routine of sorts had returned to life and the algarvians as hed seen were strong where his own people were weak and the cursed kaunians even weaker fighting in plegmunds brigade sidroc gathered strength for himself when the algarvians including their alarming physical trainer decided his regiment was ready to fight the forthwegians left the encampment in the southwest of their kingdom and went south and south again sometimes by leyline caravan sometimes by shanks mare till they reached the duchy of grelz until he joined plegmunds brigade sidroc had never been far from gromheort what he saw of southern unkerlant didnt impress him even the houses that hadnt been wrecked in the fighting struck him as shabby so did the unkerlanters especially the men their custom was to stay cleanshaven but most of them wore a few days worth of stubble giving them the look of derelicts when they spoke he could sometimes understand a word or two of their tongue which was related to his own but never a full sentence that made them seem suspicious to him too his squad leader was a scarred veteran sergeant named werferth whod fought in the algarvian army during the six years war and for forthweg in the early days of the derlavaian war werferth seemed happy as long as he was fighting for someone or perhaps against someone for or against whom as best sidroc could tell the sergeant didnt care he said youd fornicating well better be suspicious of these cursed unkerlanters turn your back and theyll cut your balls off theyll be sorry if they try at eighteen after weeks of hard training sidroc felt ready to take on the world werferth laughed in his face sidroc bristledinside where it didnt show he didnt think he was afraid of any unkerlanters but he knew he feared the sergeant werferth said youre liable to be sorry if they try on account of theyre sneaky whoresons and youre still wet behind the ears like i said the trick of it is not to give the buggers the chance sidroc nodded and did his best to look wise werferth laughed at him again which made him grind his teeth but that was all he did after one more chuckle werferth went off to terrorize some other common soldier for the first time all of plegmunds brigade assembled together just outside herborn the capital of grelz the regiments already down there were as full of cutthroats and men down on their luck as the one of which sidroc was a part but that didnt matter when the brigade drew itself up for king ranieros review algarvian officers and forthwegian underofficers scurried among the men making sure not a speck of dust lay on a tunic sleeve or a boot top not a hair was out of place to his dismay sidroc had discovered sergeants insisted on even more in the way of cleanliness and tidiness than mothers or aunts he could give them what they wanted but he resented the need drawn up to one side of plegmunds brigade stood a regiment of grelzer infantry in dark green tunics that looked to have been recently dyed like sidroc and his comrades they had algarvian officers they looked very serious and solemn about what they were doing the couple of companies of algarvians on the other side of plegmunds brigade looked anything but they stood at attention and their faces were quiet but mischief still gleamed in their eyes and blazed forth from every line of their bodies a band marched out from herborn blaring a tune that might have been the grelzer national hymnsidroc presumed it was guarded by a squad of horsemen in dark green tunics king raniero rode a fine white unicorn three or four highranking algarvian officers accompanied him he was an algarvian himself of course but wore a long tunic of the same color as his soldiers but of finer fabric and cut he swung down from the unicorn with surprising grace and began the inspection the grelzer soldiers gave him a curious little half bow by way of a salute he was half a head taller than most of them sidroc wondered what they thought of having a foreign sovereign if they had any doubts they would be wise to keep quiet about them when raniero came to plegmunds brigade he startled sidroc by speaking good forthwegian i thank you all for joining my algarvian allies in helping to assure my kingdoms safety huzzah the brigades algarvian officers shouted huzzah the forthwegian troopers echoed a moment later the redheads swept off their hats and gave raniero extravagant bows sidroc was cursed if hed do any such thing like the rest of the ordinary soldiers he stayed at stiff attention i know how brave you men are raniero went on during the six years war i commanded a regiment of forthwegians and they fought like lions sidroc hadnt done well in school but he knew algarve and unkerlant had divided forthweg between them like a couple of hungry men cutting up a slab of roast beef any forthwegians raniero commanded would have been fighting for algarveas werferth had donenot for their own kingdom and now that was so again sidroc shrugged nothing he could do about it and he didnt like unkerlanters not even a little if fighting for algarve was how he got to fight against king swemmel then it was that was all raniero said bandits and brigands still trouble my land i know you will help put them down for that you will have not only my thanks but also the thanks of all the great and ancient kingdom of grelz beside sidroc sergeant werferth snickered just loud enough to let him hear he understood what that snicker meant more from diningroom talk between his father and uncle hestan than from anything hed learned in school grelz hadnt been a kingdom for three hundred years the algarvians had revived it not for the sake of the grelzers but to complicate life for swemmel of unkerlant how many grelzers really thought of raniero as their king if the algarvians had named one of their own king of forthweg after king penda fled sidroc wouldnt have thought of him as his king hed always said pretty much what he thought but saying that struck him as a bad idea raniero strolled through the ranks of plegmunds brigade he smelled of sandalwood which almost made sidroc crack a smile but hed learned that wasnt a good idea either then raniero went over to the algarvian companies he had no compunction about joking with the redheads nor they with him guffaws floated up to the sky sidroc tried to remember his algarvian so he could find out what was funny but couldnt make out enough to tell and then the ceremony was done raniero got back onto his unicorn and rode away so did his algarvian commanders and his grelzer bodyguards the regiment of grelzers marched back toward herborn as did the algarvian companies that left plegmunds brigade alone on the vast plain of southern unkerlant they set up camp as if in the middle of hostile companywhich in fact they were or why else would raniero have wanted them sentry posts surrounded the encampment on all sides seeing them sidroc said well at least well be able to rest easy tonight sergeant werferth snickered again this time at him oh aye if you want to wake up with your throat cut you got to figure the unkerlanters for sneaky whoresons what happens if they slide past the sentries theyre liable to you know how well can you see in the dark i dont know sidroc answered i guess ill just have to be ready to get up and fight in a hurry if i have to that made werferth nod and thump him on the back aye so you will thereyou see youre not as dumb as you look worries about sleep turned out to be largely academic as soon as the sun went down mosquitoes came out by armies swarms hordes the tents the brigade had brought from forthweg lacked the netting they needed to hold the mosquitoes at bay forthweg was a drier hotter land with fewer bugs when sidroc got up the next morning he was yawning and irascible and covered with bites so was werferth who looked no happier than he did and we arent the worst of it the sergeant added cursed mosquitoes flew off with two men from another company they raise em the size of dragons around here sleepy and grouchy sidroc believed him for a moment then he snorted and went off to stand in line for breakfast the brigade broke up into regiments and then into companies and began prowling across the countryside looking for unkerlanter irregulars what they found were farmers doing their best to get a crop out of their land few of the farmers seemed very friendly but few seemed actively hostile either werferth hated all of them for no better reason sidroc could see than that they were there some of em are irregulars sure as i stand here farting the veteran sergeant said and a lot of the ones who havent got the ballocks for that will tell the irregulars where weve been and where were going bugger the bunch ofem is what ive got to say after a couple of days of marching sidrocs company went into a forest that astonished him forthweg didnt have woods like these dark and brooding and wild with the air chill and damp even in summertime under pines and beeches and firs and birches and larches and spruce sidroc kept looking around not for unkerlanter irregulars but for bears or possibly trolls he knew there were no such things as trolls but that didnt keep him from worrying about them not in a place like this without warning the trooper tramping along three men in front of him went down as if all his bones had turned to jelly sidroc hurried up to him he had a neat hole in his left temple the beam that killed him had blown off much of the right side of his skull blood soaked into the pine needles on the path by squads an algarvian officer shouted into the woods on either side we wont let the buggers get away with this into the woods sidroc went he hoped somebody in his squad could find the way back to the path because he soon lost track of it he could hear himself and his comrades blundering along he couldnt hear anyone elsebut at least one unkerlanter irregular had been there somewhere and probably more they knew the woods the whoresons if he heard them at all it would be because they were laughing their heads off back the command came in algarvian it also told sidroc where the path lay back he went he didnt care that hed caught no irregulars he just wanted to escape the woods alive he did a little village lay beyond the forest farmers and their wives looked up curiously at the bearded men in strange uniforms without a word the men of plegmunds brigade started blazing they killed as many as they could catch and left the village a smoking ruin behind them sidroc laughed welcome to grelz he said as long as were here we may as well make ourselves at home another pack of murdering goons to worry about munderic said leaning against the trunk of a spruce thats all algarves brought to grelzforeign murdering goons aye garivald said one voice in a general rumble of agreement from the irregulars another fighter said these forthwegian buggers are even nastier than the redheads powers below eat em thats bad but its not so bad garivald said people turned to look at him puzzlement on a good many faces he tried to put it into words the more people who hate these buggers the more wholl come over to our side heres hoping anyway munderic said but weve got to show folks we can stand up to the whoresons hurt em bad when we find the chance otherwise theyll just be afraid and do whatever the foreigners say we blazed that one fellow just to give em a hello like somebody said and then they wrecked a village to pay it back whatll they do if we nail a proper lot of em see theyve already put you in fear munderic said well find a time to give em a good boot in the arse see what they do then if we can prod em into something everybodys bound to hate all the better they must look like a pack of wild beasts with all that hair on their faces people talk about garivald said he had a good deal of hair on his face too chances to scrape it off were few and far between but he still thought of himself as cleanshaven which the forthwegians werent they act like a pack of wild beasts thats certain munderic said off what theyve shown so far they are worse than the algarvians a mean man will keep a meaner dog garivald said and then musingly tasting the words sometimes you have to whack it with a log he made a face that didnt work around him irregulars nudged one another and grinned they knew the signs of a man with a song coming on munderic didnt give garivald any time to work on it now he said were going to hit them were going to teach them this is our countryside and they cant come along and tear things up whenever they get the urge obilot stuck up a hand when munderic pointed to her she added besides with these cursed forthwegians beating on us here in grelz the redheads can send more of their own soldiers against our regular armies thats so munderic grinned at her you make quite a little general there most of the irregularsmost of the male irregulars anyhow grinned and chuckled too obilots jaw set though she didnt say anything most of the men viewed the handful of women whod joined them as something more than conveniences but something a good deal less than fullfledged fighters in a way garivald understood that the only reason hed gone easier on his wife back in zossen than most unkerlanter peasants did was that he had a wife of unusually forceful character but all the women here fit that billand most of them had been through worse than any of the men he sent obilot a sympathetic glance she didnt seem to notice he shrugged she probably thought he was leering at her the way the men often did someone said those forthwegians are no cursed good in the woods they dont seem to be munderic agreed theyre even worse than the algarvians i think the redheads act like they think woods ought to be parks or something but the forthwegians i think half ofem never saw a tree before in all their born days he smacked one fist into the palm of his other hand and well make em pay for it too as soon as we get the chance three days later an unkerlanter slipped into the irregulars camp with word that the forthwegians would make another sweep through the eastern part of the forest the part closest to herborn before long garivald never saw the fellow but such things happened all the time people who had to work with the algarviansand now with their forthwegian flunkieswere only too glad to let the irregulars know what was going on ive got just the spot for an ambush munderic said with a broad smile that showed broken teeth he walked over to garivald and slapped him on the shoulder its not far from where we nailed those redheads and picked you up as a matter of fact sounds good by me garivald said lets do it we will munderic declared and maybe sadoc can cast a glamour over the roadway so we make extra sure nobody spots us aye maybe garivald said and said no more before the fighting started king swemmel had sent a drunken wreck of a mage to zossen to conduct the sacrifices that powered the villages crystal next to sadoc whod joined the irregulars a couple of weeks earlier that fellow looked like addanz the archmage of unkerlant garivald didnt know where or even if sadoc had learned magecraft he did know the fellow hadnt learned much and hadnt learned it very well but munderic liked sadoc the leader of the irregulars finally had someone who could work magic no matter how feebly and sadoc was recklessly brave when he wasnt workingor more likely botchingmagic garivald liked him tooas an irregular as a mage he made a good peasant munderic at their head the irregulars moved out to await the soldiers of plegmunds brigade garivald had heard of plegmund some old songs called him the biggest thief in the world by all the signs forthwegians hadnt changed much from his day till now garivald couldnt have said whether munderics chosen spot was close to the place where hed been rescued he wasnt all that good in the woods himself though he was getting better and back then hed been too busy fearing the death he was sure lay ahead of him to take much notice of his surroundings he couldnt help agreeing the spot was a good one though the woods track widened out into a little clearing around whose edges the irregulars grouped themselves they could punish the forthwegians who tramped into the trap garivald looked forward to it he kept sneaking glances at obilot who crouched behind a thick roughbarked pine a few feet away she went right on paying no attention to him he sighed he missed annore he missed women generally speakingand he looked likely to keep on missing with obilot sadoc a big unkempt fellow chanted a spell that would with luck make the concealed unkerlanters harder for the men of plegmunds brigade to spot garivald couldnt tell whether it did anything he had his doubts from everything hed seen sadoc would have had trouble enchanting a mouse away from a blind cat munderic though munderic surely did think the world of his moreorless mage use your powers to let us know when the forthwegians draw near he said aye ill do it sadoc was eager no one could have denied that if only he were bright too garivald thought time crawled slowly past garivald kept glancing toward obilot once she was looking back at him that flustered him enough to make him keep his eyes to himself for quite a while sadoc stood some way off behind a birch with bark white as milk suddenly he stepped out into the clearing for a moment theyre coming he exclaimed and pointed up the track the men of plegmunds brigade were likely to use then for good measure he pointed off into the woods in a direction from which no one was likely to come whats that supposed to mean obilot hissed to garivald as sadoc returned to cover probably means he doesnt know which way theyre coming from garivald answered and the woman irregular nodded but the bearded forthwegians did come into the clearing from the directionthe likely directionsadoc had predicted they marched along in loose order chatting among themselves not looking as if they expected trouble garivald had expected them to look like animals or more likely demons they didnt they just looked like men doing a job he didnt know whether that made things better or worse probably worse he decided but their job was fighting and killing and dying they started dying as soon as enough of them were in the clearing to make it worthwhile for the irregulars to begin to blaze one of garivalds beams knocked a man over exulting he swung his captured algarvian stick toward another algarvian puppet like the redheads hed helped ambush between lohr and pirmasens the men of plegmunds brigade fought back hardbetter than he thought the irregulars could have done the forthwegians blazed into the woods those who could drew back toward the mouth of the clearing their comrades who hadnt yet come into the clearing went off the path and into the forest moving forward to fight the unkerlanters sadoc shouted the north the north that was the second direction to which hed pointed garivald had plenty of other things to worry about he paid the hapless mage little attention he slipped around past obilot looking for another good place from which to blaze at the retreating men of plegmunds brigade then she scuttled past him no doubt after the same thing he smiled and so did she it might almost have been a figure dance in a village square a beam slamming into a tree trunk not far from his head reminded him this was no amusement but a game either side might lose and if he lost hed never have the chance to play the game again crashing noises and yells from out of the north made garivalds head whip around he couldnt understand most of the yellsthey werent in unkerlanter but one word came through with perfect clarity plegmund powers above garivald blurted theyve got us in a trap not the other way round he looked through the trees for an avenue of escape obilot clapped a hand to her forehead that great clodpoll of a sadoc was right she said sounding disgusted with the world with sadoc and with herself hes wrong so often we didnt believe him this time but he was right break clear munderic shouted his voice cutting through the forthwegians unintelligible cries break clear you know where to gather the whoresons outfoxed us this time but our turnll come round again see if it doesnt garivald hadnt traveled through the woods enough to be sure of finding his way back to the irregulars encampment perhaps sensing as much obilot said stick close to me ill get you back now lets step lively before these buggers get a clear blaze at us i dont know about the redheads but theyre sure nastier customers than grelzer soldiers thats clear aye garivald nodded seems they really mean it when they come after us all right well now we know obilot started off toward the west he followed moving as fast and as quietly as he could he had to blaze only once and he dropped his forthwegian before the bearded man could shout then the sounds of fighting and the foreign shouts from plegmunds brigade faded behind him i think we got away he said thanks we really have to do better obilot didnt sound happy now we have to see how many of us got away and how much well be able to do for a while curse the algarvians anyhow garivald nodded again how many unkerlanters were thinking the same thing right now eleven curse the unkerlanters brigadier zerbino growled slamming his fist down on the folding table inside his tent curse the lagoans and kuusamans too for giving us such a hard time down here on the austral continent and curse the kaunians for doing everything they can to lay algarve low a chorus of aye rumbled through the officers hed assembled for this council of war colonel sabrino didnt join it instead he leaned over to captain domiziano and murmured he doesnt leave many people out does he he hasnt cursed the yaninans yet domiziano whispered back just then zerbino did and curse our alleged allies whose hands are cold in war and whose feet are swift in retreat the algarvian brigadier had not invited any yaninans to the council aye the officers chorused again this time sabrino just sat silent sooner or later zerbino would come to the point he probably wouldnt take too long either he was by nature a hearty fellow and usually said what he had to say without ornamenting it too much so it proved now we are surrounded zerbino declared all our enemies aim to attack us at once hoping we havent got enough men and behemoths and dragons to stand against the lot of them for the first time sabrino found himself nodding hed been saying things like that all along but nobody wanted to listen to him maybe mezentio had decided not to pour a whole great army down into the land of the ice people after all sure enough zerbino said we shall not get all the men or beasts weve asked for our kingdom needs them more to fight in unkerlant and to guard the southeastern coast of derlavai against more raids like the one at dukstas that massive heavyknuckled fist pounded the tabletop again but we will have the victory here by the powers above we will now sabrino stuck up a hand he couldnt help himself how will we manage that sir he asked are you going to go out and wrestle general junqueiro best two falls out of three for the austral continent zerbino grinned myself id be glad to he answered and sabrino believed him but i dont think the lagoan has the stones for it no thats not what i meant colonel however much i wish it were we arent getting the big reinforcements people had been talking abouti already said that i wish we were but we arent instead what we are getting is two squads of mages and a goodsized shipment of special personnel thats what theyre calling them back in trapani for a moment sabrino hadnt the faintest notion of what he meant no doubt the people whod come up with the bloodless phrase had that in mind but it didnt shield him from the truth for long when he realized what had to lie behind it he felt colder than the frozen ground on the far side of the barrier mountains he spoke a single horrified word kaunians aye kaunians zerbino agreed a whole great whacking lot of them just got shipped across the narrow sea to heshbon theyre on their way up here now along with our mages once they get here well make a magic to squash the lagoans like so many bugs then we mop up and then most of us can go back to derlavai and give the unkerlanters what they deserve most of the assembled officers were nodding their heads several of them said aye once more sabrino remembered king mezentio coming out of the rain and into his tent the autumn before in unkerlant to say like things in like words well do it once and it will take care of the enemy for good everything will be fine after that had everything turned out fine algarve wouldnt need to send men back to unkerlant now sabrino asked the question that had to be asked what do we do if something goes wrong sir zerbino tossed his head as if trying to scare off an annoying gnat nothing will go wrong he said nothing can go wrong or are you saying our mages dont know their business colonel his tone implied sabrino had better not be saying that sir this is the land of the ice people sabrino answered dont they say its easy for mages from the mainland of derlavai to have their spells go wrong here i assure you colonel zerbino said coldly that the men in charge of this necessary operation know everything that is required of them your task and that of your dragonfliers will be to keep the lagoans and kuusamans from flying over the encampment of the special personnel before they are committed to the necessary operation more bloodless words that is your sole task do you understand aye sir sabrino got to his feet and left zerbinos tent captain domiziano loyally followed go back if you care to sabrino told him youll do better for yourself staying than leaving besides i know you think im wrong you are my commander sir domiziano said we guard each others backs in the air and on the ground sabrino bowed touched he was gladder to see the dragons than he had been to stay in brigadier zerbinos tent a telling measure of his distress the algarvians and the handful of yaninans still with them gave him curious looks as he stalked among the dragons the beasts themselves glared and screeched at him in the same way they glared and screeched at one another they werent fussy in their mindless hostility he wasted no time in ordering extra patrols into the air zerbino was bound to be right about that if the enemy discovered kaunians were being brought up to the front they would know what was coming and might be able to take precautions against it since the army was several days march east of heshbon he had plenty of time to get the patrols as he wanted them before the kaunians arrived on the day the blonds trudged wearily into camp a clan of ice people also came in to sell camels to the algarvians the robed hairy natives watched impassively as the kaunians covered by algarvians with sticks made a separate camp for themselves the mages whod come in with the kaunians had ridden out from heshbon instead of walking they were fresh and smiling unlike the men and women in trousers sabrino didnt want to hang around the kaunians in zerbinos eyes hed already given notice he was an obstructionist hanging around only made things worse but he couldnt help himself though zerbino didnt say anything sabrino knew hed drawn his notice he also drew the notice of one of the ice people the old mansabrino assumed it was an old man though it might have been an old womanwore a robe covered with fringes and bits of dried plants and the skins of small animals and birds that made him a shaman what passed for a mage among the ice people as far as sabrino could tell though the savages of the austral continent knew as little of sorcery as they did of everything else by his voice the shaman did prove to be a man he spoke in his own guttural language sabrino spread his hands to show he didnt understand the shaman tried again this time in yaninan sabrino shook his head he turned away not wanting to waste any more time on the barbarian but the old man seized his arm in a grip of surprising strength and surprised him again by speaking lagoan you not want them to do this sabrino wasnt fluent in lagoan but he could understand it and make himself understood the shamans dark eyes bored into his he was suddenly sure exactly what the old man was talking about how did the savage know how could he know in whatever way he did know maybe there was more to the ice peoples sorcerous talents than most folk credited slowly sabrino answered no i am not wanting that make them stop the shaman said squeezing his arm harder than ever they must not do this thing the land will cry out against it i tell you this i jeush i who know this land and its gods the last word was in his own tongue gods as far as sabrino was concerned were more laughable nonsense somehow though he didnt feel like laughing at this jeush but he shook his head again i cannot be doing anything to be changing this you must be talking to brigadier zerbino he is commanding here not i sadly jeush shook his head he will no hear me he spoke with great certainty he is not hearing me either sabrino said which was all too true if this thing is done jeush shuddered the fringes on his robe swayed as they would have in a breeze so did the defunct creatures and branches tied to them in a horrid sort of way it was fascinating to watch sabrino only shrugged had he thought zerbino would listen to the shaman he would have brought jeush before the brigadier but as best he could guess the old man was right zerbino would pay no attention to a barbarian who babbled of gods what will happen sabrino asked wondering why he wanted the views of a babbling barbarian himself because youre afraid thats why he thought and he was nothing good jeush answered everything bad this is not your land these gods is not your gods you not understanding the hereness of here he waited to see if that would make sabrino change his mind when it didnt the old man turned his back with sad deliberation and slowly walked away he spoke to the leader of the band of ice people whatever he said didnt keep the nomads from selling camels to the algarvians once the bargains were done though the ice people rode south at once instead of hanging around the camp begging and stealing as they usually did sabrino seemed to be the only one who noticed or cared and he didnt care for long getting ready for the attack on the lagoans that would follow up the sorcerous onslaught took most of his time during the rest he was in the air making sure the enemys dragons didnt sniff out the new camp full of kaunians by the time the algarvian mages announced that all was in readiness hed almost forgotten about jeush and his maunderings standing before his wing of dragonfliers he said this sorcery is supposed to knock the lagoans into a cocked hat but the mages are braggarts remember so we may have a little more work than they expect be smart be careful lets win with a great thunder of wings the dragons leapt into the air one after another the algarvian army was already on the march only the mages and enough soldiers to guard and slaughter the kaunians stayed behind every beat of his dragons wings took sabrino farther from the camp that held the blonds and he was thoroughly glad of it though no mage himself he knew when the massacre and the magecraft springing from it began his dragon seemed to feel it too and staggered in the air for a moment before recovering maybe jeush had known something of what he was talking about after all but the lagoans are catching it worse sabrino muttered then he looked down at the advancing algarvian army looked down and cried out in dismay he knew what sort of sorcery the mages wrought and now he saw it visited not upon the lagoans against whom it was aimed but upon his own countrymen crevasses yawned beneath them holes closed upon them flames seared soldiers and behemoths alike in the blink of an eye the algarvians on the austral continent went from army to ruin sabrino flew on for a little while too numb for the time being to think of doing anything else somewhere down on that frozen waste a hairy old shaman was saying i told you so once upon a time sergeant leudast thought sulingen wouldnt have been a bad town in which to live oh it would get cold in the winter he had no doubt of that he came from the north of unkerlant which had a milder climate but it would have been pleasant sprawled as it was along the wolter with plenty of little patches of wood and parkland and with steeply sloping gullies to break up the blocks of homes and shops and manufactories but it wasnt pleasant any more algarvian dragons had been plastering it with eggs for weeks and many of those blocks of homes were nothing but rubble leudast as a matter of fact didnt mind rubble as terrain in which to fight it offered endless places to hide and he knew how to take advantage of them the soldiers who hadnt learned that lesson were mostly dead by now captain hawart pointed north though he was careful not to let the motion expose his arm to a beam from the enemy who lurked too close lets see the cursed algarvians outflank us and run rings around us in this he said lets see anybody do anything in this leudast answered which made his company commander laugh and nod men could move freely enough the company had spent some time digging trenches through the rubble which made them much less likely to get blazed if they scrambled from one stretch of wreckage to another but even behemoths had a hard time going where no paths had been cleared among piles of brick and stone and broken boards hawart said the only thing they can do now is come straight at us and slug theyre quicker than we are theyre more supple than we are by the powers above theyre more clever than we are too but how much good does any of that do them here do you really think theyre more clever than we are leudast asked if we were more clever wed be attacking trapanithey wouldnt be here hawart answered and leudast had a hard time finding a counterargument but hawart went on but that only takes you so far if i hit you in the head with a big rock how clever you are doesnt matter anymore and here in sulingen we can hit the redheads with lots of big rocks if they were really clever they would have made the fight somewhere else before leudast could reply the algarvians started tossing eggs at the unkerlanter front line as usual mezentios men had made sure that their eggtossers kept up with their advancing footsoldiers leudast cowered in his hole as the rubble around him got ground a little finer it occurred to him perhaps more slowly than it should have that the algarvians regardless of whether or not they were clever could hit the unkerlanters with big rocks too it also occurred to him that the algarvians could pin the unkerlanters in their holes by tossing eggs and then finish them with the horrific magic they made from the life energy of slaughtered kaunians he hoped they wouldnt think of that along this particular stretch of the line off to his right someone shrieked maybe the redheads wouldnt need to be clever to go forward maybe they could just go on killing the way theyd been doing for quite a while another cry rose this one alarm not pain theyre coming eggs kept right on landing maybe mezentios men didnt care if they killed a few of their own maybe they just figured it was a good bargain and that getting rid of the unkerlanters counted for more and maybe they were right about that too if they were coming leudast didnt wantdidnt dareto get caught in his hole he popped up and started to blaze an algarvian tumbled down and another more dove for cover some kept coming his mouth went dryquite a few were coming more than he thought he and his comrades could hold back hed already made himself expensive now he had to see how he could cost the redheads even more before they finally pulled him down and then from the rear he heard one of the sweetest sounds hed ever known officers whistles shrilling reinforcements into action urra the soldiers shouted king swemmel urra they rushed past leudast meeting the algarvian charge with one of their own they were new men unblooded ferried north over the wolter and thrown straight into the fight everything about them proclaimed as much from their clean unfaded tunics to the way they ran straight up rather than hunching forward to give the redheads smaller targets a lot of them fell before they ever came to grips with mezentios veteran troopers but enough unkerlanters lived to stop the algarvian advance before it really got going leudast was already moving forward when captain hawart shouted come onwere not going to let the new lads have all the fun it wasnt fun only a madman would have reckoned it fun it was combat at the close quarters of fornication and hardly less intimate the algarvians were as determined to go forward as the unkerlanters were to drive them back men fought one another with beams with sticks swung like clubs with knives with feet and fists and teeth no one on either side threw up his hands an algarvian who had to be out of charges for his stick tried to brain leudast with it leudast had no time to blaze him he had all he could do to duck the redhead threw the dead stick at him he knocked it aside with his own stick as the algarvian drew a knife and rushed he knocked the wickedlooking blade aside too then he could blaze could and did the algarvian howled and toppled leudast blazed him again and the howling stopped forward captain hawart shouted again forward leudast wenta handful of paces till he spied a likelylooking hole in the ground he jumped down into it without the slightest sense of shame or embarrassment aye he wanted to drive the redheads out of sulingen but he also wanted to live to see them go he didnt think that was likely not the way things stood but it was what he wanted hisses overhead and crashes behind and near the algarvians lines announced that the eggtossers on his own side werent so sleepy as usual captain hawart had been rightthe algarvians lacked the room to maneuver and deceive here out on the plains the unkerlanters eggtossers hadnt always been able to get where they were needed while they were still needed there in sulingen that problem didnt arise they were already where they needed to be all they had to do was toss they could manage that little by little the pressure from the redheads eased leudast let out a long weary sigh held em again he said to no one in particular soldiers dragged wounded men to the rear to see what mages and surgeons could do for them that held true no matter to which side the men at the front belonged no matter whether they wore gray tunics or tan kilts the algarvians rarely blazed at soldiers helping wounded comrades leudast and his countrymen usually extended the redheads the same courtesy it was one of the few courtesies both sides extended a runner came up with a big sack full of loaves of black bread leudast grabbed one and bit into it it was heavy and chewy bound to have more barley and rye flour in it than wheat he didnt care it was food and food for which he didnt have to go foraging through the rubble he didnt mind taking what had been other peoples dainties the real trouble was that he didnt find them often enough to keep his own belly full one of the raw unkerlanter soldiersa lot less raw now than he had been a couple of hours beforespoke to leudast sergeant sir he was raw im just a sergeant leudast said gruffly you dont call me sir you call officers sir have you got that aye siruh sergeant beneath his dirty swarthy hide the young soldier blushed like a girl leudast didnt much blame him for being confused hed been doing an officers work himself commanding a company and he was far from the only sergeant who could say that and not all the real officers in unkerlants army were bluebloods these days as they had been during the six years war king swemmel had killed off a lot of noblemen during and after the twinkings war and the algarvians had killed off a lot more since well what do you want then leudast asked less of a growl in his voice this time and who are you anyway oh my names aldrian sergeant the youngster beamed at doing it right what i want to know is is it always going to be like this his wave encompassed the battered worthless stretch of ground the algarvians hadnt quite been able to seize leudast considered while he considered he ate another big bite of bread slowly deliberately he chewed and swallowed then he said you figure it out the redheads want sulingen king swemmel says they cant have it if they keep throwing in soldiers and he keeps throwing in soldiers what do you think will happen by his accent aldrian came out of cottbus and again by his accent he was an educated young man he really did furrow up his unwrinkled brow and think it over leudast could tell to the heartbeat when he reached his conclusion he could also tell aldrian didnt much fancy the answer he got turning a stricken face toward leudast he asked do you think any of us will be left alive by the time its over here however it turns out after eating some more bread leudast answered well it could be worse how aldrians eyes widened we could be kaunians leudast said and drew his thumb across his throat the nail rasped on whiskers he hadnt had the chance to shave any time lately you know what mezentios mages do to them and why he waited for aldrian to nod then with deliberate brutality he went on or we could be old men and women king swemmels inspectors cant find any other use for any more you know what our mages do to them and why aye aldrian nodded again though his features were pinched as if at the smell of rotting meatnot that there wasnt plenty of that stink aroundhe still managed to bring out swemmels favorite catchword efficiency leudast spat that for efficiency back before the war heated up to its present boil he never would have dared do such a thing for fear of swemmels inspectors but they couldnt condemn him to much worse than what hed already had something more than a year of fighting the algarvians hed shocked aldrianhe could see as much where would we be if everyone said that the youngster asked hed intended it for a rhetorical question leudast wasnt long on rhetoric and so he answered it anyway where would we be about where we are anyhow i expect he looked a challenge toward aldrian defying the recruit to disagree with him aldrian opened his mouth then closed it again good fellow leudast told him if you live youll learn once upon a time the neighborhood through which bembo and oraste strolled had been among the better ones in gromheort it still showed faint signs of that as a desperately ill woman of fiftyfive might show signs of having been a beauty at twenty nothing in gromheort was very prepossessing these days bembo said i hate this place oraste yawned in his face so what there are plenty of places where youd do a lot more than hate em sulingen for instance set gromheort next to sulingen and it doesnt look so bad you know that set anything next to sulingen and it doesnt look so bad bembo said with a shudder that doesnt make gromheort look good nothing would make gromheort look good doesnt seem like anything will make you quit bellyaching either does it oraste said oh shut up bembo snarled nettled enough to forget that oraste wouldnt have a lot of trouble breaking him in two a forthwegiana middleaged man his neat beard going graywas walking along across the street with his head turned toward the constables whats so fornicating funny bembo yelled at him nothing in gromheort is funny these days the forthwegian answered in algarvian almost as fluent as the constables bembo set hands on hips and sent oraste a triumphant look there you see even a forthwegian can tell the other constable gestured dismissively what does he know about it hes not going to want to give us a bouquet any which way he glowered at the forthwegian what in blazes do you know about how things are anyway bembo expected the local to duck his head and make himself scarce that was what he would have done in the face of a couple of occupiers it was what most sensible forthwegians did and indeed the fellow started to do just that but then as if arguing with himself he shook his head and strode across the cobbles toward bembo and oraste do you want me to tell you what i know gentlemen i can do that if you care to listen is he nuts oraste whispered to bembo i dont know bembo whispered back the forthwegian wasnt acting strange except for being willing to speak his mind but in gromheort that was pretty strange in and of itself bembo let his right hand fall to the stick he wore on his belt he raised his voice a little thats close enough pal the forthwegian not only stopped he bowed almost as if he were an algarvian himself he laughed and his laugh was harsh and bitter i am not a dangerous madman it is a tempting role but not one i can play there are times i wish i could believe you me that was fancy talk it did nothing for oraste he rumbled come to the point or get lost with another bow the forthwegian said i shall my nephew beat my son to death with a chair and nobody did a thing about it nobody will do a thing about it i have no chance of getting anybody to do anything about it either should i think all is well in gromheort his tunic was pretty clean and pretty stylishnot that bembo thought the kneelength tunics forthwegian men wore had much in the way of style he spoke like an educated man he had nerve and to sparethat he was speaking so openly to algarvians proved that with money education and nerve why cant you get anybody to do anything about it bembo asked in honest bewilderment why the forthwegian said ill tell you why by the powers above because my nephew may the powers below eat him was on leave from plegmunds brigade when he did it have you any more questions sir oh youre that son of a whore oraste said i heard about you bembo nodded hed heard about this fellow too oraste shrugged no you cant do anything about that go on get lost the words stayed gruff the tone now wasnt had it come from another man bembo might even have called it sympathetic from oraste that was hard to imagine i didnt expect you to do anything the forthwegian answered but you asked why nothing was funny now i have told you good day with another bow he strode off poor bugger bembo said once youre in plegmunds brigade you can do whatever you bloody well please as long as you dont do it to an algarvian thats the truth and thats the way it ought to be too oraste said but its not how that fellow would see thingsi can see that he shrugged nobody ever said life was fair come on on they went when they turned a corner bembos gaze fell on a man walking along with the hood to his long tunic pulled up over the top of his head on a warm summers day that drew the constables eye almost as readily as a pretty girl would have the features under that hood didnt look particularly forthwegian fair skin straight nose and then bembo realized those features did look familiar powers above he exclaimed its that old kaunian from oyngestun what is oraste asked bembo pointed the other constable peered then nodded well youre right for once he knows hes not supposed to be out here too now hes fair game he sure is bembo raised his voice hold it right there aye you you ugly old kaunian sack of manure the old manbrivibas that was his namelooked as if he was thinking of bolting then his shoulders slumped he must have realized that was a mistake all too likely to prove fatal instead he turned toward bembo and oraste with a curious sort of fatalism very well you have me do your worst maybe he said something like that in the hope of softening the constables hearts it might have worked with bembo not likely but it might have with oraste such an invitation was just asking for trouble bembo tried to head off his colleague though he couldnt really have said why he had no great use for kaunians all right what sort of excuse are you going to give us for sneaking out of your district this time he demanded of the old man no excuse only the truth i am still trying to learn what has become of my granddaughter brivibas answered not good enough old man oraste said and pulled his bludgeon free the kaunian bowed his head waiting hang on a minute bembo told oraste who looked at him as if he were out of his mind to brivibas bembo said why do you think shes here i mean here in this part of town in particular if the kaunian didnt have a good answer nothing bembo could say would keep oraste from having his sport brivibas said i believe she ran off with a forthwegian youth named ealstan who lives somewhere along this street i believe youre a fool bembo said if the girl was living with a forthwegian she was bound to be better off than any of the kaunians jammed into their crowded district nobody would throw her into a caravan car and send her west or maybe east to be sacrificed either was the old fool too blind to see that to the constables surprise tears glinted in brivibas eyes she is all i have in the world do you wonder that i want to know what has become of her sometimes youre better off not knowing bembo answered brivibas stared at him as if hed just declared the world was flat or there was no such thing as magecraft knowledge is always preferable to ignorance he declared well pal heres some knowledge you didnt have before oraste said and hit brivibas in the ribs with his club the old kaunian groaned and folded up like a concertina oraste hit him again he went to one knee oraste hit him once more then seemed to lose interest you understand now he barked aye brivibas said doing his best not to let his pain show we catch you around here again the magesll never get the chance to sacrifice you oraste went on you understand that aye brivibas said again oraste kicked him not so hard as he might have get out of here then it wasnt mercy but was about as close as he came cursed old idiot bembo said as the kaunian staggered away you watch you waitsooner or later hes going to come out once too often then hell either get blazed or get stomped or get shipped west depending on who catches him and how much he frosts people and itll be his own stupid fault too blaming brivibas meant he didnt even have to think about blaming algarve for the kaunians fate oraste didnt worry about such things all he said was good riddance then his eyes green as a panthers narrowed you know i wonder if the old sods somehow connected to that other fellow we were talking withthe mouthy forthwegian i mean bembo took off his hat fanned himself with it and scratched his head how do you figure that why would a soldier in plegmunds brigade brawl with his kin oraste asked and provided his own answer maybe on account of theyre kaunianlovers and that makes him want to heave we already know the old blonds granddaughter ran off with a forthwegian right hangs together pretty good you ask me well ill be a son of a whore bembo said staring at his partner as if hed never seen him before that forthwegian looked like he had money too hed have to have money or he couldnt afford to live in this part of town if youre right we can shake him down for a bundle oraste grunted even if im wrong we can shake him down for a bundle hes not going to want that story spreading no matter what thats true bembos head bobbed up and down in eager agreement lets go track down that murder he was talking about it somebodyll know everything there is to know about it and thatll tell us who he is and how much hes liable to have he grinned constabulary work at its finest and so it was that hed be using it to fatten his belt pouch not to run down some desperate criminal bothered him not at all once he and oraste started asking questions back at the barracks they got answers in short order the only trouble was bembo didnt much like the answers they got neither did oraste youre so cursed smart he said with a fine curl of the lip sounds like this hestan buggers already paying off everybody and his mother we cant touch him not unless we want half the algarvian bigwigs in town landing on our backs how was i supposed to know bembo struck a pose of melodramatic innocence besides this was your brainstorm not mine so why are you blaming me why not oraste retorted youre handy bembo started to make a rude suggestion but held his tongue instead for one thing he was nervous about getting oraste too angry and for another his partner had a point blaming whoever looked handy was also constabulary work at its finest vanai stared out the window of her flat and worried down in the street forthwegian rioters hurled rocks and bricks and anything else they could lay their hands on at an outnumbered band of algarvian constables a constable went down clutching at his bleeding head his pals wasted no time after that but started blazing into the crowd screams rose the forthwegians scattered leaving wounded men writhing on the cobblestones and one woman who wasnt moving at all before long the rioters would attack some other algarvians somewhere else and i hope they get some more of them too vanai muttered but that wasnt why she worried ealstan had left the flat to cast accounts bright and early in the morning this latest round of riots had broken out a couple of hours later vanai had no idea why maybe the algarvians had committed another outrage maybe too the long hot summer days were making the people of eoforwic irritable whatever the causeif there was a causehow was ealstan supposed to get home through the chaos as always when things went wrong vanai wondered what would i do without ealstan she depended on him far more than she ever had on brivibas she also cared for him far more than shed cared for her grandfather if brivibas had fallen over dead one morning she could easily have gone on with her life without ealstan how could i even go out and buy food how could i make money to buy food that second question unfortunately had an obvious answer having sold or rather traded her body to keep her grandfather out of a labor gang she couldnt dismiss the notion of prostituting herself out of hand but if the redheads caught her and flung her into the tiny kaunian quarter or simply shipped her west even that wouldnt do her any good curfew an algarvian shouted in forthwegian down below sunset curfew anyone on streets after sunsetting we blazing he walked along then shouted his warningthreat promiseagain ealstan hadnt come back to the flat by the time the sun went down dully mechanically vanai went through the motions of getting supper ready she made enough for two she always did then she lowered the fire in the stove to next to nothing put some extra water in the stew to keep it from drying out and settled down to wait without looking to see what she grabbed she pulled a book out of one of the cases in the front room when she found she was holding you too can be a mage she made a horrible face and started to thrust it back onto the shelf if its spell had been worth anything she could have made herself look like a forthwegian then she wouldnt have had to worry about going out on the street but instead of putting away the book she carried it over to the sofa and sat down she opened it to the spell that had betrayed her most of it still looked as if it should have worked that part that had gone wrong was plainly a botched translation from kaunian into forthwegian all right then she said under her breath i know what its supposed to do to do that how should it have read in kaunian she was using that language it was herswhere it obviously wasnt the authors if she could reconstruct the original maybe she could do her own translation into forthwegian she decided to try whether she could or not it would help keep her from thinkingtoo muchabout where ealstan might be she quickly realized she couldnt get away with rebuilding just the garbled section she would have to start from the beginning if she was ever going to get anywhere shed just reached the part that had brought her to grief on trying the spell when she heard the knock shed been waiting for the knock shed feared she wouldnt hear again she sprang up from the sofa sending you too can be a mage flying one way and her translation another only when she reached for the bar on the door did she discover she was still holding her pen where have you been she exclaimed as ealstan walked into the flat because of her translating she spoke in kaunian not the forthwegian they used more often are you all right i am fine ealstan answered also in kaunian i am tired and hungry and thirsty but i am fine i had to move carefully to stay away from trouble and also to stay away from the redheaded barbarians he brought that phrase out with considerable relish powers above im so glad to hear it vanai said come on sit down and ill get you supper her own belly rumbled reminding her she hadnt eaten anything either she took the stew off the fire it wasnt what it would have been had ealstan got home on time but she didnt care she poured big cups of rough red wine for both of them this is all splendid thank you ealstan said when he spoke kaunian he did so with a slow seriousness that made everything he said more earnest more important than it would have in casual forthwegian only a starving man would have called the overcooked stew splendid in any language but by the way he shoveled it down he came pretty close do you know what made things burst this time vanai asked ealstan shook his head i heard four different tales as i was going through the streets one person says one thing another something else he got all his case endings right there and grinned in modest triumph the algarvians are blazing to kill out there vanai said i saw them i was frightened for you i was a little frightened myself once or twice ealstan saidno small admission from him i took a long time coming home because i did not want to run into the redheads i already told you that ealstan hesitated then added i saw several bodies in the street there was one right outside this block of flatsa woman vanai said and some wounded men too that womans body is gone i saw others ealstan changed the subject and changed languages with it what were you doing there when i got home trying to make sense out of you too can be a mage vanai switched to forthwegian too i was seeing if i could figure out where that idiot went wrong in translating his transformation spell out of kaunian and into forthwegian if i can figure out how the kaunian really ran i can do a better job of turning it back into forthwegian why bother ealstan asked if youre sure youve got the kaunian right leave it alone and use it i guess the next question is how sure are you pretty sure vanai said and felt the corners of her mouth turn down ealstan frowned too you can get into all sorts of trouble using a spell youre pretty sure is good last time you made me look kaunian instead of doing anything to yourself we dont want that to happen again and we dont want anything worse to happen either i know vanai said but if only i were free to move around in eoforwicwell after things calm down again anyhow earlier today i was thinking that being caged up here wasnt so bad i havent thought anything like that for a long time i dont think i ever thought anything like that before ealstan nodded i dont blame you its pretty bad out there some of the fighting came right up to ethelhelms block of flats and that sort of thing doesnt usually go on in the fancy parts of town what did your singer friend have to say vanai asked was he cheering the rioters on anybody with kaunian blood ought to be i dont quite know ealstan sighed he doesnt like the redheads weve seen thatbut he doesnt want to lose what hes got either to hang on to it he has to play along with them at least some and when he plays along with them he starts he groped for a phrase vanai suggested one forgiving things no that goes too far ealstan shook his head not seeing things maybe he held up a hand before vanai could say anything aye i know thats just about as bad maybe not quite though maybe vanai didnt believe it but didnt feel like starting an argument again ealstan seemed to want to change the subject if you can get the magic to work that would be wonderful it would mean wed be safe moving out of this flat since he shook his head we could move out what hadnt he said there not since you wouldnt look like a kaunian anymore if hed meant that he would have said it what then another possibility sprang into vanais mind since ethelhelm knows where we live and might blab to the algarvians ealstan wouldnt want to say that out loud he probably didnt even want to think it but maybe he hadnt changed the subject after all he cocked his head to one side i wonder what youd look like as a forthwegian would you feel different too he used his hands to sketch figures in the air contrasting her slimness to his own more solid build which was typical of forthwegians i dont know vanai answered im not really a mage remember her grandfather would have been able to say she was sure of that brivibas knew a lot about magecraft especially the history of magecraft hed used sorcery in his own historical research she wondered how much else he might use if he wanted to a good deal she suspected but would he ever think to do so that was another question altogether ealstans thoughts had been running along another and a distinctively masculine ley line with a small chuckle he said if you look different and feel different too it would almost be like making love to somebody else would it vanai eyed him from under lowered brows and do you want to be making love to somebody else he was bright enough to recognize the danger in that one and hastily shook his head of course not he answered and vanai had to hide a smile at how emphatic he sounded but he didnt quite back away from everything hed said it would just be like choosing a different posture thats all oh vanai said ealstan was fonder of different postures than she was for major spinello had forced them on her but ealstan didnt know about spinello for which vanai was heartily glad she gave her lover the benefit of the doubt all right sweetheart and then while ealstan worked on columns of figures powers above only know when ill be able to get these to my clients he said but kept working anyhow vanai went back to picking the forthwegian spell to pieces and rebuilding it in classical kaunian when she noticed her new version had a partial rhyme scheme her hopes lifted the original surely would have rhymed to make memorizing it easier she tried alternative words to give more rhymes some she discarded others fit as well as a snug pair of trousers i have it i think she told ealstan shall i try it if you want to he answered and if you think you can reverse anything that goes wrong vanai studied her new text she wasnt sure of that and ealstan she had to admit showed good sense in asking her to be she sighed ill see what i can do she said and then can you bring me some books on magecraft tomorrow no ealstan said when things settle down of course vanai sighed again but then she nodded cornelu didnt like walking through the streets of setubal for one thing he still had trouble reading lagoan which reminded him how much a stranger he was in the capital of lagoas and how much a stranger hed remain he had never wanted to be a lagoan what he wanted was to be a free sibian in a free sibiu but walking through setubal also reminded him that even a free sibiu could never hope to measure itself against lagoas again that hurt setubal alone held as many people did as much business as all the five islands of his native kingdom and while setubal was the greatest city in lagoas it was far from being the only lagoan city of consequence how do people live here without going mad cornelu wondered as lagoans streamed past him every one of them moving faster than he cared to more ley lines came together at setubal than anywhere else in the world that was why the city had blazed into prominence over the past couple of hundred years and the sorcerous energy seemed to fill the people as well as the place cornelu knew that couldnt be literally true but it felt as if it were a hawker waved a news sheet in his face and bawled something half comprehensible he caught the words ice people and supposed the headline had to do with the lagoans continuing advances on the austral continent he was all for those advances as he was all for anything that hurt the algarvians but he didnt care to spend money on a sheet he could barely puzzle out the newssheet vendor said a couple of uncomplimentary things that werent much different in lagoan from what they would have been in sibian a few blocks later cornelu turned the corner and strode up to the ornate neoclassical headquarters of the lagoan guild of mages no one stopped him from approaching the great white marble pile and no one stopped him from going inside either it wasnt so much that he looked like a lagoan he could have been as hairy as a man of the ice people and no one would have stopped him business was business he knew the way to grandmaster pinhieros offices hed been there before he hadnt got what he wanted but he did know the way the grandmasters secretary a portly fellow named brinco looked up from the papers he was methodically going through he beamed commander cornelu good to see you again he spoke algarvian which he knew cornelu understood good day cornelu answered brinco had met him only once and that months before but the mage remembered him right away that bespoke either some unobtrusive sorcery or a wellhoned recollection when cornelu said no more brinco asked and how may i serve you today your excellency he sounded as if nothing would delight him more than doing cornelus bidding cornelu knew that to be untrue but couldnt decide whether it flattered or irked him he decided to stick to the business on which hed come i have heard that the mage fernao whom i once brought back from the land of the ice people and who had the misfortune to go there again was wounded is it so and where did you hear this brinco asked nothing in his face or voice giving any sign about whether it was so cornelu stood mute when it became clear he wouldnt answer brinco shrugged said good to see you again once more and returned to his papers curse you cornelu thought but brinco had power and he had none that was part of what being an exile meant his stiffnecked sibian pride almost made him turn on his heel and walk out in the end though he growled i was in a tavern with the dragonflier who brought in a man he thought to be fernao ah brincos nod was almost conspiratorial aye dragonfliers will run on at the mouth i suppose it comes from being unable to talk with their beasts the way you leviathanriders do it could be cornelu waited for the lagoan to say more when brinco didnt cornelu folded his arms across his chest and fixed the grandmasters secretary with a cold stare i answered your question sir you might have the common courtesy to answer mine you already have a good notion as to that answer though brinco said cornelu looked at him it wasnt a glare not really but it served the same purpose a slow flush mounted to brincos cheeks very well sir aye that is true he was wounded and is recovering cornelu took from his tunic pocket an envelope i hope you will do me the honor of conveying this to him my best wishes and my hope that his health may be fully restored brinco took the envelope it would be my distinct privilege to do so he coughed discreetly you understand i trust that we may examine the note before forwarding it i intend no personal offense in telling you this i merely note that these are hard and dangerous times that they are cornelu said your kingdom trusted me to join in the raid on dukstas so of course you would assume i am engaged in sending your mage subversive messages grandmaster pinhieros secretary flushed again but said we would do the same sir were you his majestys eldest son you are cornelu broke off short hed been about to call brinco a liar but something in the mages voice compelled belief with hardly a pause cornelu went on saying fernao is involved in work of some considerable importance i am not saying any such thing brinco replied now he sent cornelu a look as chilly as the one the sibian leviathanrider had given him will there be anything more commander his clear implication was that there had better not be and in fact cornelu had done what hed come to do bowing to brinco he answered no sir and turned and strode away he was not a mage so he couldnt possibly have sensed brincos eyes boring into his back he couldnt have but he would have taken oath that he did outside the guild building he paused and considered he knew or thought he knew which leyline caravan would take him back to the harbor back to the leviathan pens back to the barracks where he and his fellow exiles had painfully built a tiny stuffy recreation of sibiu in this foreign land but that satisfied him hardly more than setubal itself did unlike some of his countrymen he recognized how artificial their life inside the barracks was he wanted the real thing he wanted to go back to tirgoviste town and have everything the way it was before the algarvians invaded his homeland wanting that and knowing he couldnt have it ate at him from the inside out instead of lining up at the caravan stop he tramped down the street looking for he didnt know what something he didnt havehe knew that much would he even recognize it if he saw it he shrugged almost as if he were an algarvian how could he know plenty of lagoans seemed to have trouble figuring out what they wanted too they paused in front of shop windows to examine the goods on display even now in wartime goods richer and more various than cornelu would have found in tirgoviste town before the fighting started cornelu wanted to shout at them didnt they know how much hardship was loose in the world here in setubal it showed in only one place the menus of the eateries local custom was to post the bill of fare outside each establishment so passersby could decide whether they cared to come in and buy cornelu approved of the custom he would have approved of it more had he made easier going of the menus lagoan names for domestic animalscows sheep swinecame from algarvic roots so he had little trouble with them but the words for the meats derived from those animalsbeef mutton porkwere of kaunian origin which meant he had to pause and contemplate them before he could figure out what was supposed to be what similar traps lurked elsewhere these days though he had fewer things to contemplate almost every eaterys menu had several items scratched out generally those involving things imported from the mainland of derlavai beef dishes were also fewer than they had been and more expensive cornelu sighed that didnt seem to be enough acknowledgment of the war when he saw an eatery offering crab cakes though he went inside for one thing the lagoan name was almost identical to its sibian equivalent so he had no doubt what hed be getting for another he liked crab cakes and couldnt remember the last time theyd served them at the barracks inside the place looked anything but fancy but it was clean enough a cook with red hair going gray cracked crabs behind the counter cornelu sat down a young woman with a family resemblance to the cook came up to him whatll it be she asked briskly crab cakes rhubarb pie ale cornelu could get along in lagoan especially on basics like food but the waitress cocked her head to one side youre from sibiu it wasnt a question it wasnt scornful either which rather surprised cornelu most lagoans thought well of themselves not so well of anyone else at his nod the woman turned to the cook hes from the old kingdom father it happens the cook said in lagoan then he switched to sibian with a lowerclass accent he wouldnt have learned in school my father was a fisherman who found he was making more money in setubal than back on the five islands so he settled here he married a lagoan lady but i grew up speaking both languages ah i got out when mezentios men overran tirgoviste town cornelu said relishing the chance to use his own tongue he nodded to the waitress really noticing her for the first time and youdo you speak sibian too i follow it she answered in lagoan speak a little that was sibian a good deal more lagoanflavored than her fathers she returned to the language with which she was obviously more familiar now lets get your dinner taken care of ill bring the ale first off it was strong and nutty and good the crab cakes when they came reminded cornelu of home he ate them and the sweet sweet rhubarb pie with real enjoyment and speaking sibian with the cook and his daughter was indeed enjoyable too the mans name was balio which might almost have been sibian his daughter was called janira a name as lagoan as any cornelu could imagine this is all wonderful he said you should have more customers he was at the moment the only one in the place which was why he could go on speaking sibian itll get livelier tonight balio said we have a pretty fair evening crowd janira winked at cornelu you just have to come back here and eat up everything weve got then well get rich she spoke lagoan but he could answer in sibian youll get rich and ill get fat he laughed he didnt laugh very often these days he could feel his face twisting in ways it wasnt used to maybe that wouldnt be so bad janira laughed too qutuz said the marquis balastro is here to see you your excellency his nostrils twitched he ached to say more hajjaj could tell as much and since his visitor was the minister from algarve let me guess hajjaj said has he come to call in what we zuwayzin would reckon proper costume aye his secretary answered and rolled his eyes its not customary hell do it now and again anyhow hajjaj said i wish he wouldnt qutuz said hes very pale the parts of him his clothes usually cover andhes mutilated you know for a moment the secretary cupped a protective hand over the organ to which he was referring algarvians have that done when they turn fourteen hajjaj said calmly they call it a rite of manhood qutuz rolled his eyes again and they reckon us barbarians because we dont drape ourselves in cloth hajjaj shrugged that had occurred to him too every now and again with a sigh his secretary said shall i show him in oh by all means by all means the zuwayzi foreign minister answered i must admit im not brokenhearted about avoiding tunic and kilt myself its a hot day in bishah home of hot days that was a statement to conjure with having seen balastros portly multicolored form undraped before hajjaj knew what to expect zuwayzin took nudity for granted balastro wore bareness as theatrically as he wore clothes good day your excellency he boomed lovely weather youre having hereif youre fond of bake ovens anyhow it is a trifle warm hajjaj replied he wouldnt admit to a foreigner what hed conceded to qutuz you will of course take tea and wine and cakes with me sir of course balastro said a little sourly the zuwayzi ritual of hospitality was designed to keep people from talking business too soon but since balastro had chosen zuwayzi costume or lack of same he could hardly object to following the other customs of hajjajs kingdom in any case balastro seldom objected to food or wine he ate and drank and sipped enough tea for politeness sakeand made small talk while the refreshments sat on a silver tray between him and hajjaj only after qutuz came in and carried away the tray did the algarvian minister lean forward from the nest of cushions hed constructed even then polite still he waited for hajjaj to speak first hajjaj wished he could avoid that but custom bound him as it had bound balastro leaning forward himself he inquired and how may i serve you today balastro laughed which mortified him he hadnt wanted his reluctance to show the algarvian minister said you think ive come to give you a hard time about the cursed kaunian refugees dont you well your excellency i would be lying if i said the thought had not crossed my mind hajjaj replied if you have not come for that reason perhaps you will tell me why you have whatever the reason may be i shall do everything in my power to accommodate you balastro laughed again this time louder and more uproariously he wiped his eyes on his hairy forearm forgive me i beg but thats the funniest thing ive heard in a long time he said youll do whatever suits you best and then youll try to convince me it was for my own good you do me too much honor sir by giving me your motives hajjaj said dryly which made balastro laugh some more smiling himself the zuwayzi foreign minister went on why have you come then now the jovial mask dropped from balastros face to speak plainly your excellency i have come to ask zuwayza to get off the fence i beg your pardon hajjaj raised a polite eyebrow get off the fence balastro repeated you have fought this war with your own interest uppermost you could have struck unkerlant harder blows than you have and you know it as well as i do youve fought swemmel aye but youve also looked to keep him in the fight against us you would sooner we wear each other out because that would mean wed leave you alone he was of course perfectly correct hajjaj had no intention of admitting as much did we not hope for an algarvian victory we should never have cooperated with king mezentios forces in the war against unkerlant he said stiffly you havent cooperated any too bloody much as is balastro said youve done what you wanted to do all along youve taken as much territory as you wanted to and youve let our dragons and our behemoths help you take it and help you hold it but when it comes to giving us a real handwell how much of a hand have you given us about this much it seems to me he thrust out two fingers in a crude algarvian gesture hajjaj had often seen and almost as often used in his university days back in trapani it is as well we have been friends hajjaj said his voice even more distant than before there are men with whom were they to offer me such insult i would continue discussions only through common friends balastro snorted wed be a fine pair for dueling wouldnt we wed probably set the notion of defending ones honor back about a hundred years if we went after each other i was serious sir hajjaj said one of the reasons he was serious was that the algarvian minister had once more spoken nothing but the truth his majesty has lived up to the guarantees he gave you through me at the beginning of this campaign and has done so in every particular if you say he has not i must tell you i would consider you a liar are you trying to get me to challenge you your excellency balastro said i might except youd probably choose something like camel dung as a weapon no i think id prefer royal proclamations hajjaj answered they are without question both more odorous and more lethal heh youre a witty fellow your excellency ive thought so for years the algarvian minister said but all your wit wont get you out of the truth the war has changed since it began it is not what it was when it began corpulence and nudity didnt keep him from striking a dramatic pose now it is plain that when all is said and done either algarve will be left standing or unkerlant will you have sought middle ground i tell you there is none to be had you may be right said hajjaj who feared balastro was but whether you are right or wrong has nothing to do with whether king shazli has met the undertakings he gave to algarve he has and you have no right to ask anything more of him or of zuwayza than he has already delivered there we differ balastro said for if the nature of the war has changed what zuwayzas undertakings mean has also changed if your kingdom gives no more than it has given you are more likely to be contributing to algarves defeat than to our victory do you not wonder that we might want something more from you than that i wonder at very little i have seen since the derlavaian war began hajjaj replied having watched a great kingdom resort to savagery that would satisfy the barbarous chieftain of some undiscovered island in the northern seas i find my capacity for surprise greatly shrunken no barbarous chieftain faces so savage and deadly a foe as algarve does in unkerlant balastro said had we not done what we did when we did it unkerlant would have done it to us such a statement is all the better for proof hajjaj observed you say what might have been i know what was do you know what will be if unkerlant beats algarve balastro demanded do you know what will become of zuwayza if that happens there he had the perfect club with which to pound hajjaj over the head he knew it too and used it without compunction with a sigh hajjaj said what you do not understand is that zuwayza also fears what may happen if algarve should beat unkerlant that would not be as bad for you balastro told him hajjaj didnt know whether to admire the honesty of the little qualifying phrase at the end of the sentence or to let it appall him he wanted to call for qutuz to bring more wine but who could guess what he might say if he got drunk as things were he contented himself with a narrow rigidly correct question what do you seek from us real cooperation balastro answered at once most notably cooperation in finally pinching off and capturing the port of glogau that would be a heavy blow to king swemmels cause why not just loose your magics against the place hajjaj said and then because balastro had well and truly nettled him he could not resist adding i am sure they would serve you as well as they did down in the land of the ice people algarvian news sheets algarvian crystal reports had said not a word about the disaster that had befallen the expeditionary force on the austral continent they admitted the foe was advancing where he had been retreating but they never said why lagoas on the other hand trumpeted the botched massacre or rather the botched magecraft for the massacre had succeededto the skies balastro glared and flushed things are not so bad there as the islanders make them out to be he said but he didnt sound as if he believed his own words how bad are they then hajjaj asked the algarvian minister didnt answer not directly instead he said here on derlavai magecraft would not turn against us as it did in the land of the ice people again this is easier to say than to prove hajjaj remarked even if it did prove true slaughtering kaunians still repelled him he took a deep breath we have done what we have done and we are doing what we are doing if that does not fully satisfy king mezentio he is welcome to take whatever steps he finds fitting marquis balastro got to his feet if you think we shall forget this insult i must tell you you are mistaken i meant no insult hajjaj said i do not wish you ill as king swemmel does but i do not wish quite so much ill upon unkerlant as algarve does either if only one great kingdom thrives as you say what room is there for the small kingdoms of the world for the zuwayzas and forthwegs and yaninas in the days of the kaunian empire the blonds had no room for us algarvians balastro answered we made room for ourselves somehow in the person of a plump naked envoy hajjaj saw a fierce kilted barbarian warrior maybe that was good acting from balastroor maybe the barbarian warrior never lay far below the surface in any algarvian hajjaj said and now you condemn zuwayza for trying to make a little room for ourselves where is the justice in that simple balastro said we were strong enough to do it good day sir the zuwayzi foreign minister said and balastro departed but watching his broad retreating back hajjaj nodded and smiled a little for all balastros bluster hajjaj didnt think the algarvians would abandon zuwayza they couldnt afford to but then hajjaj sighed zuwayza couldnt abandon algarve either hajjaj would have been willing to make the break provided he could have got decent terms from swemmel but swemmel didnt care to give decent terms hajjaj sighed again and so the cursed war goes on he said twelve a stack of small silver coins and another of big brass ones almost as shiny as gold stood in front of talsu similar stacks of coins some larger some smaller stood in front of the other jelgavans sitting at the table in a silversmiths parlor a pair of dice lay on the table if algarvian constables burst into the parlor all they would see was gambling they might keep the money for themselvesbeing redheads they probably wouldbut theyd have nothing to get very excited about so hoped talsu and all the other men some young some far from it at the table the silversmith whose name was kugu nodded to his comrades he peered at the world through thick spectacles no doubt because he did so much close work now my friends he said lets go over the endings of the declension of the aorist participle along with the others talsu recited the declensionsnominative genitive dative accusative vocativeof the participle for singular dual and plural masculine feminine and neuter he got through all the forms without a hitch and felt a certain modest pride at managing it despite getting through them he wondered how his ancient ancestors had managed to speak classical kaunian without pausing every other word to figure out the proper form of adjective noun or verb jelgavan now jelgavan was a proper language no neuter gender no dual number no fancy declensions a vastly simplified verb he hadnt realized how sensible jelgavan was till he decided to study its grandfather kugu reached out and picked up the dice on the table he rolled them and got a six and a three not a good throw not a bad one then he said we are gambling here you know and for more than money the algarvians want us to forget who we are and who our forefathers were if they know were working to remember they knocked down the imperial arch they wont be shy about knocking over a few men curse em the redheads have never been shy about knocking over a few men or more than a few talsu said somebody else said they cant kill all of us if what we hear coming out of forthweg is true theyre doing their best talsu said everyone stirred uncomfortably thinking of what had happened to kaunians in forthweg led to thoughts of what might happen to the kaunian folk of jelgava somebody said i think those stories are a pack of lies kugu shook his head lamplight reflected from the lenses of his spectacles making him look for a moment as if he had enormous blank yellow eyes he said they are true from things ive heard they are only a small part of what is true algarve doesnt aim to kill just our memories we are in danger ourselves then why arent we fighting back more talsu wanted to shout it he wanted to but he didnt aye these men were here to study classical kaunian which argued that they had no use for the redheads but talsu didnt know all of them well he hardly knew a couple of them at all any of them even kugu himself could have been an algarvian spy back before the war king donalitu had had plenty of provocateurs serving himmen who said outrageous things to get others to agree with them whereupon those others vanished into dungeons a man would have to be insanely foolhardy to think the algarvians couldnt match such ploys wed be better off if the king hadnt fled said someone who might have been thinking along with him at least in part but kugu shook his head i doubt it king gainibus still on the throne down in priekule but how much does that do our valmieran cousins theyre probably easier to rule than we are because they havent got a foreigner sitting on the throne by a foreigner he meant an algarvian several people nodded taking the point king mezentios brother wasnt the man whom talsu had in mind as a proper king of jelgava either but he just sat there doing his best to look none too bright if kugu was a provocateur talsu didnt intend to let himself be provokednot visibly anyhow with a sigh the silversmith said it would be fine if the king came back to jelgava after a dose of king mainardos rule plenty of people would flock to donalitus banner again kugu got nods again talsu wasnt one of the men who gave them he knew exactly how the redheads would judge such words as treason hearing them was dangerous being seen to agree with them was worse maybe kugu realized as much too for he said shall we go over some sentences that show how the aorist participle is used he read a sentence in the sonorous ancient tongue then pointed to talsu how would you translate that into jelgavan talsu leaped to his feet clasped his hands behind his back and looked down at the floor between his shoes memories of his brief days in school he took a deep nervous breath and said having gained the upper hand the kaunian army advanced into the forest even if he was wrong kugu wouldnt stripe his back with a switch he knew that but sweat trickled from his armpits anyhow maybe that too was left over from memories of school or maybe it just sprang from simple fear of reciting in public either way he neednt have worried for kugu beamed and nodded even so he said that is excellent lets try another one he read the sentence in classical kaunian and pointed to the fellow next to talsu a redfaced middleaged merchant how would you translate that the man made a hash of it when kugu set him straight he scowled if thats what they mean why dont they come out and say it they do kugu said patiently they just do it differently they do it more precisely and more concisely than modern jelgavan can but its confusing the merchant complained talsu wondered how many more lessons the redfaced man would come to rather to his own surprise he didnt find classical kaunian confusing himself complex aye difficult certainly but he kept managing to see how the pieces fit together after everyone had had a crack at translating a sentence or two the lesson broke up ill see you next week kugu told his scholars powers above keep you safe till then out into the night the jelgavans went scattering as they headed for their homes throughout skrunda stars shone down from the clear sky more stars than talsu was used to seeing in his home town since the raid on skrunda the redheads had required the town to stay dark at night which brought out the tiny sparkling points of light overhead it also made tripping and breaking your neck easier talsu stumbled over a cobblestone that stood up from the roadbed and almost fell on his face he nailed his arms to stay upright all the while cursing in a tiny voice though often ignored and hard to enforce because of the darkness shrouding skrunda the redheads curfew remained in force the last thing talsu wanted was to draw one of their patrols to him he picked his way through the quiet streets the first time hed come home from kugus hed got lost and wandered around for half an hour till he came into the market square quite by accident knowing where he was had let him find his home in short order a cricket chirped off in the distance a cat yowled those sounds didnt worry talsu he listened for boots thudding on cobbles the algarvians knew a lot of things but they didnt seem to know how to patrol stealthily when he got to his house he let himself in then barred the door if an enterprising burglar chose to strike on a night when he was studying classical kaunian tlie thief might clean out the downstairs of trakus shop and depart with no one the wiser to make sure talsu wasnt a burglar his father came partway down the stairs and called softly that you son aye talsu answered well what did you learn tonight traku asked having gained the upper hand the kaunian army advanced into the forest talsu declaimed letting the sounds of the classical language fill his mouth in a way modern jelgavan couldnt come close to matching isnt that posh his father said admiringly whats it mean after talsu translated traku frowned and asked what happened thenafter it advanced into the forest i mean i dont know talsu said maybe the kaunians kept on winning maybe the lousy redheads who lived in the forest ambushed them its just a sentence in a grammar book not a whole story too bad traku said youd like to know how these things turn out talsu yawned what id like to do is go to bed ill still have to get up and work tomorrow morning come to that so will you father oh aye i know traku answered but i like to be sure everythings all right before i settle downand if i didnt id hear about it in the morning from your mother he turned and went back up to the top floor talsu followed his room had seemed cramped ever since he came home from the army after jelgavas losing fight against the algarvians it still did he was too tired to care tonight he took off his tunic and trousers and lay down wearing nothing but his drawers the night was fine and mild he fell asleep with participles spinning in his mind instead of advancing into the forest the next morning he advanced on breakfast barley bread garlicflavored olive oil and the usual jelgavan wine tangy with citrus juice afterwards and before his father could chain him to a stool to work on a couple of cloaks that needed finishing he ducked out and headed over to the grocers shop to say hello to gailisa and to show off the bits of classical kaunian he was learning she didnt understand much of it herself but it impressed her not least because she did understand why he was studying it ill be back soon he promised over his shoulder as he left to keep his father from getting too annoyed at him but he broke the promise during the night somebodymore likely several somebodieshad painted death to the algarvian tyrants on walls all over skrunda not in jelgavan but in excellent classical kaunian talsu might not have been able to understand it before he started studying the old language he could now unfortunately so could the algarvians their officers as hed seen were familiar with the classical tongue and their soldiers were on the streets with jars of paint to cover up the offending slogan and with wire brushes to efface it the redheads didnt aim to do the work themselves though they grabbed jelgavan passersby talsu among them he spent the whole morning getting rid of graffiti but the more he worked to get rid of them the more he agreed with them and he didnt think he was the only jelgavan who felt that way either new songs ethelhelm shook his head and looked a little sheepish when ealstan asked the question havent got a whole lot the boys and i have been on the road so much lately we havent had very many chances to sit down and fool around with anything new ealstan nodded doing his best to seem properly sympathetic he didnt want to say something like hard to write nasty songs about the algarvians now that youve started cozying up to them even the last few new songs ethelhelm had written had lost a good deal of their bite but ealstan needed the band leaders business and ethelhelm knew he had a kaunian lady friend ealstan didnt think the musician would betray him to the redheads but he didnt want to give ethelhelm any excuse for doing something like that either good to have things quiet in eoforwic again ethelhelm said it got a little livelier than we really wanted for a while there aye ealstan said no wonder ethelhelm thought that way the riots had made it into his district for a change ealstan started to remark that the kaunian district had stayed very quiet he wanted to remind ethelhelm of the kaunian blood the band leader was said to have in the end he didnt say that either talking about kaunians with ethelhelm might also remind him of vanai when ethelhelm looked to be drifting toward the algarvians ealstan didnt want to chance that he was my friend ealstan thought and he was more than thathe was our voice the only voice forthwegians really had after the redheads overran us and now hes not any more what went wrong looking around the flat again ealstan saw what hed seen before nothing had gone wrong for ethelhelm no too many things had gone right instead the drummer and songwriter had everything he wanted he liked having everything he wanted too if the price of keeping it was going easy on the algarvians he would had some redheaded officer come up to ethelhelm and told him straight out that hed better go easy or hed end up in trouble ealstan didnt know and could hardly ask he had his doubts though the algarvians were smoother than thatunless they were dealing with kaunians in which case they didnt bother oblivious to his bookkeepers thoughts ethelhelm leaned forward and tapped the ledgers ealstan had opened on the table in front of him everything here looks very good he saidno small compliment not when hed been casting his own accounts before hiring ealstan he knew his way around money almost as well as he knew his way around drums and lyrics you havent got all the silver in the world ealstan told him but you surely do have a good chunk of it i never thought id end up with so much ethelhelm said its nice isnt it ealstan managed to nod hed been comfortablelooking back on things hed been more than comfortablein his fathers house in gromheort it certainly was nicer than the humbler circumstances in which he lived now hed saved a good deal of money here in eoforwic but what could he spend it on not much and ethelhelm didnt seem to have a hint about the sort of life ealstan lived these days he didnt act interested in learning either but then the band leader flipped the ledgers closed one after another and he took a goldpiece from his belt pouch and set it atop one of them there you go ealstan he said aye a job well done no doubt about it especially considering the state of the receipts i gave you bloody leather sack ealstan picked up the coin and hefted it it was he saw an algarvian goldpiece not a forthwegian minting it was almost worth more than twice what his fee would have been here i can make change he said and reached for his own belt pouch dont bother ethelhelm told him you can use it and i can afford it always good to know i can rely on the people close to me by the powers above ealstan thought hes buying me the same way he buys off the algarvians he wanted to throw the coin in ethelhelms face if it hadnt been for vanai he would have of course if it hadnt been for vanai hed still be living back in gromheort he put the goldpiece in his pouch and contented himself with saying bookkeepers dont blab they wouldnt keep any customers if they did i understand that ethelhelm said youve certainly shown it to me he could still be gracious he could in fact still be very much what he had been except when it came to the algarvians somehow that was particularly distressing to ealstan ethelhelm went on there youve taken it even so good aye and thanks ealstan said he got to his feet and tucked the ledgers under his arm ill see you in a couple of weeks then and odds are youll be richer there are worse problems to have ethelhelm said complacently and ealstan could hardly disagree with him since the latest round of riots the doorman at ethelhelms block of flats had taken to staying inside in the lobby he didnt position himself out where people could see him as he had beforemaybe hed had a narrow escape one more question ealstan didnt feel like asking the doorman got up and held the door open for him see you again he said oh that you will ealstan said the prospect should have made him glad especially if it meant hed see more goldpieces and it didto a degree but it saddened him too because ethelhelm inarguably wasnt what he had been only a block and a half away from ethelhelms elegant flat a labor gang was clearing away the rubble of a burntout building the laborers were kaunians some men some women had their overseers been algarvian soldiers or constables ealstan would have been angry but unsurprised but the men holding the kaunians to their tasks were forthwegians armed with nothing more than bludgeonsand the certainty that they were doing the right thing ealstan wanted to curse them he wanted to persuade them they were wrong he wanted to tell them they were playing into their conquerors hands in the end he did none of that he simply walked on free hand curled into a fist tight enough to make his nails bite into his palm belly churning with rage he dared not show more wrecked burntout buildings lay in the poorer parts of eoforwic no one had started clearing them away ealstan wondered how long that would take he also wondered if it would ever happen he didnt intend to hold his breath here and there people went through the wreckage some were folk whod lived and worked in those buildings doing their best to salvage what they could and some no doubt were nothing but scavengers ealstan glared at the gleaners which did no good at all it might have angered the people who had a right to search for what was theirs but bothered the looters not at all he stopped in a bakers shop and bought two loaves of bread it was nasty stuff and had got nastier since the latest riots hed long since grown used to wheat flour cut with barley and rye they made loaves thicker and chewier because they rose less readily than wheat but they didnt taste too strange groundup peas and beans and buckwheat groats on the other hand whats next he asked the baker sawdust if i cant get anything else the fellow answered adding listen pal i eat the same bread i sell times arent easy no ealstan agreed did the baker really eat the same bread he sold his customers ealstan doubted it from everything hed seen anyone who got a position privileged in any way took advantage of it as best he could ealstan chuckled mirthlessly if that wasnt an algarvian way of looking at the world he didnt know what was when he got back to his own part of town he paused and marveled that all the buildings on his block had come through intact oh some new windows on the bottom couple of stories were boarded up but a lot of windows had been boarded up for a long time glass these days was expensive and hard to come by feet and hooves and wheels had worn away the fresh bloodstains from the crowns of the cobbles but the redbrown still lingered between the gray and yellowbrown stones someone had left a bloody handprint on the wall of the building next to ealstans too he wondered what had happened to that fellow nothing good he feared he paused in the lobby to get his mail from the brass bank of boxes against the wall opposite the door the lock on his box was as stout and fancy as he could afford he had one key the postman the other the rest of the boxes sported similar impressive pieces of the locksmiths art few people hereabouts trusted their neighbors good intentions when ealstan saw his fathers precise familiar script on an envelope he grabbed it with a mixture of excitement and alarm he didnt hear from home very often and wrote back even less but news hed discovered when he got the letter telling of leofsigs death could be bad as easily as good ill open it upstairs he told himself iwont be able to do anything about it down here anyhow he laughed at himself again without amusement he wouldnt be able to do anything about it after he got up to his flat either he had to set down the ledgers so he could knock on the door vanai let him in what have you got there she asked pointing to the envelope its from home he answered thats all i know right now he held up the envelope to show her he hadnt opened it then added i didnt have the nerve to do it down in the lobby vanai bit her lip as she nodded let me pour some wine she hurried off to the kitchen ealstan clenched his jaw hed needed numbing after other letters from home and knew too well he might need it again he waited till vanai came back with two full glasses before he tore open the envelope and took out the letter inside he unfolded it started to read and let out a chuckle that was shaky with relief oh he said is that all what is it vanai asked a wineglass still in each hand my sisters married ealstan answered that seemed strangeconberge had been a part of the household his whole lifebut hed known it was likely to happen one day my father says everything went very well powers above be praised for that wouldnt it have been fine if sidroc walked in right in the middle of the ceremony no vanai said and handed him one of the glasses she raised the other heres to your sister may she be happy aye conberge deserves to be happy ealstan drank the wine was nowhere near so fine as the fancy vintages ethelhelm served but it would do he finished reading the letter then winced in sympathy my father says he and my mother are just rattling around in the house they never expected it to empty out so soon vanai stepped up and held him for a moment hed had to flee gromheort his brother was deadat least conberge had left the way she should have and something else occurred to him something he realized he should have thought of quite a while before he slipped his arm around vanai i wish i could marry you properly he said if i ever get the chance i will i promise she looked up at him and started to cry he wondered if hed said the wrong thing vanai spent the rest of the night finding ways to show him he hadnt down below sabrino heshbon burned in a few spots among the ruins algarvian and yaninan holdouts still struggled against the advancing lagoan army most of the men whod survived the sorcerous debacle in the land of the ice people though had long since surrendered being a dragonflier sabrino enjoyed more choices than surrender or hopeless resistance along with his wing along with all the dragons on the austral continent hed been recalled to derlavai the order still left him more than a little startled hed expected king mezentio to send another army across the narrow sea to take the place of the one his mages in their bloodthirsty arrogance had thrown away but the king had chosen to cut his losses instead that wasnt like mezentio it wasnt like him at all sabrino wondered what had happened in trapani to persuade mezentio to take such a course hed find out before long his wing was ordered to the great dragon farm outside the capital of algarve theyd get their next assignment there he assumed they would also get a few days of rest and recuperation during which he intended to learn all he could he knew he had a lot of catching up to do down on the austral continent he might as well have been cut off from what went on in the wider world his dragon eagerly flew north over the graygreen waters of the narrow sea toward the sun toward the warmth toward civilizationthough of course the beast cared nothing for that last sabrino glanced back over his shoulder no the lagoans and kuusamans werent pursuing they kept on pounding heshbon with eggs if the algarvians wanted to leave the land of the ice people they would let them before long sabrino spied a black line ahead land crawling up over the edge of the world to mar the smooth horizon between land and sea the swamps and forests of southern algarve though the homeland of his folk were not the part of the kingdom of which he was fondest theyd always struck him as dull and gloomy no wonder the ancient algarvic tribes had waged endless war against the kaunian empirethe kaunians held most of the land worth living in sabrino wasnt in the habit of talking to his dragon as leviathanriders often did with their beasts he knew too well that dragons neither knew nor cared about words but he broke his own rule now saying do you know after the land of the ice people this doesnt look so bad in among the woods and the swamps farmers grew turnips and parsnips and beets and grain along with them little by little the trees thinned out the land got drier and fields of wheat and barley supplanted the root crops with every few miles farther north sabrino flew the greens of growing things got brighter trapani lay still within the swampy belt but toward its northern edge one after another the dragons in sabrinos wing spiraled down out of the sky handlers took charge of them exclaiming at how thin and illused they were tapping himself on the chest waving toward his weary men sabrino demanded and how illused do you think we are the handlers stared at him that a dragonflier could be as illused as a dragon had never crossed their minds one of them asked colonel uh lord countsabrino as usual wore his badge of nobility on his tunicwhat went wrong down there in the land of the ice people it was a good question sabrino pondered it for a moment then answered we did the handler started to ask him something more he pushed past the fellow and strode toward the commandants office he got no satisfaction there a captain told him im very sorry sir but general borso didnt come in today due to an unfortunate indisposition in bed with his mistress or with a hangover sabrino wondered he was almost indiscreet enough to do his wondering out loud in the end all he asked was have you any idea why we were summoned home from the austral continent me sir the captain shook his head no sir no one tells me anything like that sir sabrinos scornful glance withered him hardly less than dragonfire might have done well young fellow did anyone tell you where to get hold of a carriage for me so i can get to the nearest leyline caravan and head for trapani where they are in the habit of telling people things flushing gnawing at the inside of his lower lip in mortification the captain spat out one word aye but then noting sabrinos towering temper he hastily added two more aye sir neither sabrinos wife nor his mistress knew he was in trapani he was sure of that he wondered what the news sheets had said of the algarvian disaster in the land of the ice people and how worried gismonda and fronesia were then he wondered if fronesia was worried at all except about finding a new lover with enough money to keep her in her fancy flat but she and his wife could both wait when the leyline caravan reached the center of trapani sabrino made for neither his home nor the one he maintained for fronesia instead he strode into the building near the royal palace that housed the ministry of war a building so severely classical in line it wouldnt have looked at all out of place in the kaunian empire he wondered if the soldiers serving there ever pondered that irony probably not and too bad too he hadnt bothered freshening up his stubbled chin and cheeks and wrinkled dirty uniform drew startled looks from the spruce young officers hurrying through the halls but none of them had rank enough to call him on his appearance presently he ducked into an office where a much neater colonel was peering from a map to a long column of figures and back again and swearing under his breath sabrino said hello you old fraud they havent got wise to you and shipped you off to unkerlant yet eh dont worrythey will the other colonel sprang to his feet enfolded him in a muscular embrace and kissed him on both cheeks why you son of a whore he said affectionately i figured theyd left you down there to freeze or else for dragon food dragonsll eat almost anything vasto but even they draw the line somewhere sabrino answered he cocked his head to one side you look as ugly as ever curse me if you dont vasto bowed low ill curse you any which way and you bloody well know it he and sabrino were both grinning enormously theyd fought side by side in the six years war and been fast friends ever since sit down sit down vasto said you see me ashamedyouve caught me without a bottle of brandy in my desk so i cant give you a nip the way i usually do id probably fall asleep right here if you did sabrino told him but if you can give me a couple of straight answers theyll go down smoother than brandy anyhow vasto pointed a forefinger at him as if it were a stick go aheadblaze he said theyd been giving each other straight answers for almost thirty years too and the usual rules of military secrecy had very little to do with what they said all right sabrino took a deep breath why did they pull us off the austral continent instead of sending in more soldiers after our sorcery went awry the lagoans havent got that many men down there may the powers below eat them we could have held them off for a cursed long time for the first time in many years he saw vasto reluctant to answer i wish you hadnt asked me that the other colonel said slowly ill tell you but you swear first on your mothers name youll never let anyone know where you heard it anyone you hear me even mezentio powers above sabrino said seeing his friend was serious though he twisted the fingers of his left hand into a sign algarvians had used since they skulked through the southern forests living in fear of imperial kaunian soldiers and sorcerers on my mothers name i swear it vasto good enough vasto said although he still didnt sound happy leaning toward sabrino across his desk he spoke in a rasping whisper its simple when you get down to it weve got the men to go on fighting the unkerlanters or weve got the men to send a proper new army down to the land of the ice people what we havent got are the men to do both those things at once sabrino had thought hed escaped the austral continent for good the chill that ran up his spine at vastos words made him wonder if he was wrong are things as bad as that he discovered he was whispering too they are right now but colonel vasto held out a hand and waggled it palm down to show they might not stay that way once we get past this sulingen place once we get down into the mamming hills and seize those cinnabar mines then well have old swemmel where we want him then we can start thinking about the austral continent again you know as well as i do its not as if the lagoans can give us much trouble from there well thats true enough sabrino said nobody can do much with that country its too bloody poor if it werent for furs and cinnabar the hairy savages could keep it and welcome but still we cant afford to send any men at all not a one vasto answered thats what theyre saying anyhow swemmels pulling out all the stops down in sulingen hes no foolhes crazy but hes no fool he knows as well as we do that if we get across the wolter and into the hills hes ruined so we have to give it everything weve got down there too sabrino spat on the carpeted floor of vastos comfortable office as he might have out in the field his disgust was too great for any smaller gesture bitterly he said they told us slaughtering the kaunians would crack the unkerlanters like an almond shell they told us we had plenty of men plenty of dragons to lick the lagoans off the land of the ice people and still whip swemmel too and they believed it too every time they said it and now it comes down to this now it comes down to this vasto agreed but if we break the unkerlanters this time theyre broken for good you can take that to the bank sabrino well you know more about the big picture than i do sabrino said i never worried much about anything but my piece of it whatever that happened to be so heres hoping youre right oh i am vasto spoke in his normal tone of voice for the first time once we take sulingen and the mamming hills the unkerlanters wont be able to lick us well roll em up the way you do a ball of yarn all right sabrino held up a forefinger now let me guess i bet i can see the future without being any kind of mage at all i predicthe tried to sound mystical and had no doubt he ended up sounding absurdi predict my wing will be flying west before long vasto said i havent seen your ordersi didnt even know you were back on the mainland of derlavai but i wouldnt bet an olive pit against you they say southern unkerlant is lovely this time of year but they say it gets pretty cold in another couple of months too ive seen all the cold i want thanks sabrino said well just have to beat the unkerlanters before then thats all sergeant pesaro looked over with something less than delight the squad of algarvian constables he led in gromheort come on you lugslets do it he said the sooner we take care of it the sooner we can get back to our everyday business standing there listening to pesaro bembo leaned toward oraste and murmured he doesnt much like this either orastes answering shrug showed none of the usual algarvian playfulness it was as indifferent as it was massive a mountain might have shrugged that way what difference does it make hes going to do it and so are we as if to underscore orastes words pesaro went on we go in there we grab our quota and we get out has everybody got that permission to fall out sergeant almonio asked the young constable never had been able to stand rounding up kaunians but pesaro shook his head not this time youre coming along with us by the powers above this isnt some little village in the middle of nowhere this is the kaunian quarter in the middle of gromheort you never can tell whos liable to be watching any other questions he looked around nobody said anything pesaro stuck out a meaty forefinger all right lets go off they went bootheels clattering on cobbles almonio muttered to himself and swigged from a hip flask as they tramped along pesaro affected not to notice that so did bembo though he wished hed thought to equip himself with a hip flask too they werent the only squad of constables on the march either most of the algarvians who kept order in gromheort were moving toward the kaunian quarter with a chuckle bembo said any forthwegian crooks who know what weve got laid on could rob this town blind while were busy they could try oraste said you ask me though theres not much here worth stealing a couple of kaunians saw what amounted to a company of constables bearing down on their quarter the blonds ran back toward the miserable market square theyd set up in the middle of the district calling out in alarm dont worry about it boys said the constabulary lieutenant in charge of the algarvians dont you worry about it one little bit you know what youre supposed to do dont you aye sir the constables chorused all right then the lieutenant wore a whistle on a silver chain around his neck he raised it to his lips and blew a long piercing blast go do it then my squadperimeter duty pesaro bellowed for all the world as if the constables were assaulting a fortified position down in southern unkerlant move move move dont let the blond buggers get past you bembo never liked moving fast here though he had no choice along with the rest of the constables from tricaricoand several other squads besideshe trotted two blocks into the kaunian quarter then moved along a street parallel to the one marking the districts outer border more constables fanned out through the couple of square blocks thus cut off crying kaunians come forth some kaunians did come forth the algarvian constables pounced on them and hustled them away toward the edge of the district where more algarvians took charge of them other blonds tried to hide wherever no one came forth the constables broke down the doors and went through flats and shops bembo listened to shouts and screams and the sound of blows landing so did oraste bembos burly partner kicked at the cobblestones those buggers get to have all the fun and were stuck here twiddling our thumbs he grumbled theres always next time answered bembo who was just as well pleased not to be beating peopleand not to run the risk that some desperate kaunian might fight back with a knife or even with a stick by the noises coming from the sealedoff blocks the kaunians werent doing much in the way of fighting back the algarvians descent on their district must have caught them by surprise that rather surprised bembo given the way his countrymen liked to brag and boast they werent the best folk for keeping secrets he was about to say as much when a kaunian woman fleeing from the constables dashed across the street toward the interior of the district to which the blonds had been relegated oraste let out a roar of glee hold it right there sister he shouted or youre dead the next step he leveled his stick at the woman she skidded to a stop obviously he meant what he said if his tone hadnt told her as much the fierce eagerness on his face would have why she asked bitterly in good algarvian what did i ever do to you it doesnt matter oraste said just get moving or its all over now instead of later her shoulders slumped all the fight oozed out of her bembo watched it happen she turned away and stumbled back toward the other blonds who were being rounded up oraste still didnt seem satisfied that was too easy he complained you really want to kill somebody dont you bembo said his partner nodded surewhy not thats what this business is all about isnt itkilling kaunians i mean of course they do us more good dead if the mages get to use their life energy but a couple knocked off here wont make much difference one way or the other if you say so bembo would sooner have collected bribes or favors of a more intimate sort from the blonds but nobody paid any attention to what he wanted he sighed wallowing in selfpity and then several more kaunians came dashing toward him desperation in every line of their frantically fleeing bodies oraste didnt have time for wordy challenges now halt he shouted and started blazing a kaunian man went down almost at once howling and grabbing at the wounded leg that would no longer bear his weight a woman fell a moment later she didnt howl she didnt move either red red blood pooled under her head but the rest of the blonds ran the gauntlet and vanished into buildings beyond the constables perimeter oraste turned a furious glare on bembo well youre fornicating useless arent you he snarled they caught me by surprise bembo saidnot much of an excuse but the best he could come up with he advanced on the wounded kaunian lets take charge of this son of a whore he hasnt got all he deserves yet by the powers above oraste said yanking his bludgeon from the belt loop that held it you can help me give him what for he laid into the kaunian with savage gusto every cry the wounded man let out seemed to spur him on and bembo had to beat the blond tooeither that or have oraste reckon him a slacker you stupid bugger he said again and again as he swung his own club you ugly stupid bugger he hated the kaunian for not either escaping or dying as things were the fellow had left bembo no choice but to do something for which he had no stomach when more blonds tried to break free of the algarvian net bembo got to stop beating the wounded kaunian man instead of blazing at the fugitives he ran after them rather to his own surprisehe wasnt especially fast on his feethe caught up with one of thema womanand brought her down with a tackle that surely would have started a brawl on any football pitch thats more like it oraste shouted from behind him maybe youre worth a little something after all the blond woman after letting out a shriek of despair when she fell lay still on the cobbles her shoulders shuddering with sobs after a few deep panting breaths of his own bembo said see running away didnt do you any cursed good to drive the point homeand to look good to orastehe whacked her with his bludgeon stupid bitch futter you she said in clear algarvian hate blazed from her blue eyes as she glared up at him if i hadnt been big with child you never would have caught me you turdfaced tun of suet bembo stared down at her belly sure enough it bulged all his pride at running down anyone even a woman evaporated he raised his club then lowered it again he couldnt enjoy the notion of hitting a pregnant woman either even if she cursed and reviled him get up he told her youre caught now theres nothing you can do about it no there isnt is there she answered dully as she climbed to her feet her trousers were out at both knees one of them bled theyll take me away and sooner or later theyll cut my throat and if i stay alive long enough to have the baby theyll cut its throat too or blaze it or whatever they do and they wont care at all will they get moving bembo told her it wasnt much of an answer but he didnt have to give her much of an answer he was an algarvian after all his folk had won the war here winners didnt need to give losers an accounting of themselves all they had to do was enforce obedience bembo brandished the bludgeon get moving he said again and she did she had no choicenone except dying on the spot anyhow bembo wasnt sure he could blaze her in cold blood but he hadnt the slightest doubt oraste could oraste was interested in other things how many of them do you suppose weve caught he asked bembo as the pregnant kaunian woman limped away i dont know bembo answered theyre stuffed in here pretty tight ill tell you that hundreds anyway aye i think youre right oraste said well good riddance to the lot of em and i hope they end up smashing a lot of unkerlanters when they go aye bembo did his best to keep his voice from sounding too hollow if the algarvians were going to sacrifice the kauniansand his countrymen plainly werehe couldnt do anything about it didnt it make sense then to get as much benefit from their life energy as possible that seemed logical and he wasnt like foolish almonio to get in an uproar about something he couldnt change but he couldnt take it for granted the way oraste did either well what should i do then he wondered the only thing that did any good was not thinking about it at all that wasnt easy not when he was in the middle of rounding up kaunians to send them west and sergeant pesaro didnt make it any easier bellowing come on weve got our quota lets get these whoresons over to the caravan depot the sooner were rid of them the sooner we dont have to worry about them anymore on the way to the depot forthwegians stared at the column of unhappy kaunians some showed no expression whatever maybe they like bembo were trying not to think about what would happen to the blonds a good many though knew perfectly well what they thought some jeered in their own language others cruder or just more erudite chose classical kaunian bembo understood bits of that it was about what algarvians would have said in the same circumstances most of the kaunians just shambled along a few shouted defiant curses at the folk who had been their neighbors bembo supposed he ought to admire their spirit admire it or not though he didnt think it would do them a bit of good now that sidroc had seen a little soldiering the whole business appealed to him much less than it had when he joined plegmunds brigade along with two squads of his comrades he tramped along a dusty road that led from one miserable excuse for a village to the next he yawned wishing he could fall asleep as he marched sergeant werferth saw the yawn as far as sidroc could tell sergeant werferth saw everything he didnt look as if he had eyes in the back of his head but that was the only explanation that made sense to sidroc werferth said keep your eyes open kid never can tell whats liable to be waiting for you aye sergeant sidroc said dutifully there were times when a common soldier could sass a sergeant but this didnt feel like one of them and however reluctant he was to admit it even to himself he knew werferth was right the brigands in these parts were sneaky demons they liked skulking through the woods best but theyd come out and waylay soldiers in open country too most marches were nothing but long tedious bores terror punctuated the ones that werent with no telling when it might break out a couple of unkerlantersgrelzers sidroc supposed they were in this part of the kingdomstood weeding in a field off to the side of the road they straightened up and started for a moment at the troopers of plegmunds brigade whoresons sidroc muttered as soon as weve gone by theyll find some way to let the bandits know maybe not werferth said and sidroc looked at him in surprise the milk of human kindness had long since curdled in the sergeant after a couple of strides werferth went on maybe theyre bandits themselves in that case they dont have to let anybody know oh sidroc trudged along for a couple of paces while he chewed on that aye how do we do anything about it if we cant tell the brigands from the peasants who might be on our side that makes things tougher werferths shrug had no algarvianstyle extravagance or mirth in it all it said was that he either didnt know didnt care or both the way it looks to me is he said we treat em all like enemies if were wrong some of the time so what if we treat em like our pals and they stab us in the back then weve got real trouble again sidroc kept marching while he thought makes sense he said at last they wont ever love us most ofem theyre foreigners after all werferth laughed as far as theyre concerned were the foreigners but aye thats about the size of it if we keep em afraid of us theyll do what theyre told and thats about all anybody can hope for birds chirped and trilled some of the songs were different from the ones sidroc had heard up in forthweg he knew that much though he would have been hard pressed to say anything more except for the most obvious ones like crows he didnt know which birds went with which calls off in the distance a dog barked and then another that meant something to him though it wouldnt have before he came down to grelz sounds like a village up ahead he remarked aye werferth nodded theres supposed to be one somewhere past that stand of trees there his eyes narrowed i wonder if the brigands have a surprise waiting for us in those trees sort of thing theyd try do you want to go in there and try to flush them out sidroc asked a few weeks before he would have sounded eager now he hoped werferth would tell him no and werferth did shake his head no way to guess how many of those buggers might be hiding in there no what well do is well swing wide through the fieldswe wont stay on the road and give them a clean easy blaze at us there are ways to ask for trouble you know what i mean before sidroc could answer a dark cloud covered the sun more came drifting up from out of the west looks like rain he said that sparked another thought in him i wonder what kind of mushrooms a good soaking raind bring out down here if you dont know what they are dont eat em werferth advised you watchsome cursed lackwits going to try something hes never seen before and itll kill him silly buggerll get what he deserves too you ask me up in forthweg people died every year from eating mushrooms they shouldnt have sidrocs attitude was much like werferths if they were stupid enough to do that they had it coming to them but in forthweg everybody was supposed to know what was good and what wasnt how could you do that here sidroc figured he might take a chance or two if the unkerlanters couldnt kill him with sticks odds were they couldnt kill him with mushrooms either big fat raindrops started falling about the time the troopers from plegmunds brigade went off the road and into the fields sidroc pulled his hooded rain cape out of his pack and threw it on the ground under his feet rapidly turned to mud he didnt like squelching through it but the raindrops also meant beams wouldnt carry so far which would make any attack from the woods harder to bring off give a little get a little he thought no unkerlanter hordes screaming urra burst from the trees no devious unkerlanter assassins skulked after sidroc and his comrades either he couldnt prove a single irregular had been lurking in the forest all the same he was just as well pleased werferth gave it a wide berth when he came back to the roadwhich had turned into mud even stickier than that in the fieldshe could see the unkerlanter village ahead is that a friendly village he asked some few places in grelz were conspicuously loyal to king raniero even the algarvians were supposed to leave them alone though algarvians as far as sidroc could tell did pretty much as they pleased but werferth shook his head no we can plunder there to our hearts content theyre fair game the villagers must have known they were fair game too through the rain sidroc watched them fleeing at the first sight of the men from plegmunds brigade they dont trust us he barked laughter i wonder why we ought to see if we can catch a couple and find out why werferth said but then he shrugged and shook his head not much chance is there theyve got too good a start on us not everyone had fled as the troopers discovered when they strode into the village a handful of old men and women came out to greet them one geezer tottering along on a stick even turned out to speak some forthwegian i was in your kingdom on garrison duty twenty years before the start of the six years war he quavered bully for you oldtimer werferth said wheres the rest of the people who live here whyd they hightail it he had to repeat himself the old unkerlanter was deaf as could be at last the fellow answered well you know how it is people arent friendly nowadays looking at the wrinkled toothless grannies whod come out with their menfolk sidroc didnt much feel like being friendly to them what went through his mind was if i ever get that desperate i think id sooner blaze myself maybe werferths mind was traveling along the same ley line for all he said us give us food and spirits and we wont give you a hard time after the fellow whod been in forthweg translated that into unkerlanter or grelzer or whatever they spoke hereabouts the old men and women hurried to obey black bread and pease porridge and smoked pork werent very exciting but they filled the belly instead of spirits sidroc drank ale like any proper forthwegian he would sooner have had wine but the next vineyard he saw in this part of the world would be the first king raniero good eh he asked the wizened old lady who fetched him his mug of ale good wasnt much different in unkerlanter from its forthwegian equivalent but the old woman looked at him with beady eyesone of them clouded by a cataractand said something in her own language that coupled with her outspread hands had to mean she didnt understand him sidroc didnt believe her for a minute she just didnt want to answer which meant the answer she would have given was no anger surged in sidroc he didnt have to take anything from these cursed unkerlanters if theyd been on his side most of the people in this village wouldnt have lit out as soon as they found the men from plegmunds brigade were coming we ought to have some fun here he said a nasty sort of anticipation in his voice one of his squadmates the ruffian named ceorl spoke up cant have as much fun as we might everythings too stinking wet to burn the way it should we can always slap these buggers around sidroc said pity none of the younger women hung around wed have better sport then nobody was inclined to say no to a man who carried a stick sidroc had watched algarvian soldiers making free with kaunian womenand with some forthwegians tooback in gromheort now that he carried his own stick he enjoyed imitating the redheads as he spoke he eyed the old woman whod brought him ale she couldnt hide the fear on her face even if she wouldnt admit it she understood some of what he and his pals were saying as far as he was concerned that was reason enough to slap her around in a little while till then she could bloody well keep on serving him he thrust the mug at her and growled more she understood that all right she hurried off to fill up the mug again sidroc poured the ale down his throat no it wasnt nearly as good as wine but it would do it put fire in his belly and fire in his head too he started yet another mug of ale fully intending to start raising a ruckus when he finished that he was just draining it though when a horseman came splashing up the villages main and only street the fellow called out in unmistakable forthwegian ho men of plegmunds brigade sergeant werferth was the senior underofficer he pulled his hood down low over his eyes stepped out into the rain and said were here all right whats toward were all ordered back to the encampment outside herborn the courier answered now theres a fine piece of bloody foolishness werferth said how are we supposed to hold down this stinking countryside if we sit in that cursed encampment with a thumb up our arse werferth liked fighting all right but the courier gave a blunt twoword reply were not that brought not only werferth but sidroc and ceorl and almost all the other troopers from plegmunds brigade out into the rain then what in blazes will we be doing sidroc demanded several other men threw out almost identical questions well be getting on a leyline caravan and heading south and west the courier said if the lousy grelzers want to go out and chase their own brigands fine if they dont the powers below can eat em up for all we care from now on theyre sending us off to fight the real unkerlanter armies not these odds and sods who sneak through the woods ahh werferth said a grunt of satisfaction that might almost have come from a man whod just had a woman it wont get any better than that he turned to his troopers the algarvians have decided were real soldiers after all my arse ceorl muttered to sidroc the algarvians have lost so many men of their own theyre throwing us into the fire to see if we can put it out sidroc shrugged anybody wants to kill me he wont have an easy time of it he said werferth nodded and slapped him on the back rainwater sprayed off his cape captain gradasso bowed to krasta an you be fain to closet yourself with colonel lurcanio milady i am to tell you he hath gone forth into priekule but his return is expected ere eventide krasta giggled you talk so funny she exclaimed its not quite classical kaunian anymore but its not really valmieran either its a mishmash thats what it is lurcanios new aide shrugged bit by bit i come to apprehend somewhat of the modern speech though my locutions be yet archaic i find also that i make shift for to be understood an my apprehension gaineth apace ere oermuch time elapseth i shall make of myself a fair scholar of valmieran dont hold your breath krasta advised him an idiom which perhaps fortunately he didnt catch her expression sharpened whats lurcanio doing in priekule captain gradasso shrugged again whatsoever it be i am not privy tot privy to it that set krasta giggling once more her mirth puzzled gradasso she didnt feel like explaining and took herself off when she looked back over her shoulder gradasso was staring after her scratching his head privy to it she repeated and dissolved into still more giggles oh dear the algarvians who helped lurcanio administer priekule all eyed krasta curiously as she threaded her way back past their desks they often saw her angry sometimes conspiratorial but hardly ever amused some of them the bolder ones smiled and winked at her as she went by she ignored them they were small fry not even worthy of her contempt unless they let their hands get bolder than their faces and her giggles soon subsided when she thought of the privy she thought of disposing of the pieces into which shed torn the broadsheet her brother had written skarnus alive she thought and shook her head in slow wonder she still didnt know whod sent her the broadsheet or where it had come from but she couldnt have been wrong about her brothers script as she went upstairs to her bedchamber something new occurred to her some while before lurcanio had asked her about some provincial town or other she frowned trying to remember the name it wouldnt come she kicked at a stair but her algarvian loverher algarvian keeperhad seemed to think this town whatever its name was had something to do with skarnu she couldnt ask lurcanio about it not if he was out how inconsiderate of him she thought then she realized she couldnt ask him about it even after he got back he had a cursedly suspicious mind and a cursedly retentive memory he would still know the name of that miserable little town and he was all too likely to figure out why shed started asking questions about it no she would have to stay silent curse him she snarled an imprecation aimed mostly at lurcanio but also at her brother for krasta staying silent was an act far more unnatural than any lurcanio enjoyed in the bedchamber probably even more unnatural than anything valnu enjoys in the bedchamber krasta thought that was enough to set her giggling again she never had found out what all valnu enjoyed in the bedchamber one of these days she told herself aye one of these days when lurcanio infuriates me again that shouldnt be too long shed just reached the upper floor when malya started howling krasta set her teeth bauskas bastard brat wasnt quite so annoying these days as she had been right after she was born when shed screeched all the time she didnt look so ugly either when she smiled even krasta found herself smiling back but that didnt mean she wasnt a nuisance and now krasta smiled too though she couldnt see the baby bauska bauska what are you doing come here at once she called as if she couldnt hear malya crying either her servant might had had the little squalling pest but krasta was cursed if she would let that inconvenience her bauska ill be with you in a moment milady bauska sounded as if she were forcing the words out through clenched teeth krastas smile got wider sure enough shed hit a nerve hurry up she said no she wouldnt make things easy for her maidservant and here came bauska her tunic sleeves rolled up her expression put upon but when krasta got a look atand a whiff ofbauskas hands her smile evaporated powers above go wash off that filth you did tell me to hurry milady bauska answered i always try to give satisfaction in every way by the look in her eye she thought shed won the round but krasta wasnt easily bested if you hadnt given captain mosco every satisfaction your hands wouldnt stink now she snapped bauska looked as if she were on the point of saying something more something that likely would have landed her in real trouble with her mistress and then very visibly she bit it back after a deep breath she asked how may i serve you milady krasta hadnt even thought about that shed called her maidservant to be annoying not because she wanted anything in particular she had to cast about for something bauska might do at last she came up with something familiar go down and tell the stablemen and the driver to get my carriage ready i intend to do some shopping today aye milady bauska said have i your gracious leave to wash my hands first i already told you to do that krasta said with the air of one conferring a large undeserved boon bauska departed not until she was gone did krasta wonder if shed been sarcastic the marchioness shook her head bauska wouldnt dare she was convinced of it she hadnt really planned to go into priekule but the thought of a day spent on the avenue of equestrians the principal street of shops and fine eateries was too tempting to resist downstairs she went and stood around fuming till the driver brought the carriage out of the stable when she decided to do something she always wanted to do it on the instant but even going into town didnt make her so happy as it would have in the days before the war though she was sleeping with an algarvian colonel she didnt like seeing kilted algarvian soldiers on the streets gaping like so many farmers at the sights of the big city or cuddling yellowhaired valmieran women the algarvians had even presumed to put up street signs in their language to direct the soldiers to the principal sights it was as if they thought priekule would be theirs foreverand so by all indications they did krasta also scowled every time she saw a valmieran whether man or woman in a kilt in a way that struck her as even worse than going to bed with the redheads it abandoned the very essence of kaunianity she hadnt worried about such things till she recognized her brothers handwriting on that broadsheet if skarnu worried about them she supposed she should too but set against the display windows of the avenue of equestrians kaunianity didnt seem so important let me off here she told her driver aye milady he reined in after he handed krasta down from the carriage he climbed back into his seat and took a flask from his pocket krasta hardly noticed shed already begun exploring not only did she examine the display windows she also poked her nose into every eatery on the avenue of equestrians captain gradasso had said lurcanio was here somewhere if he wasnt with his countrymen but with some little blond tart krasta would make sure he remembered it for a long time to come if he was with some little blond tart he was more likely to be in a hostel bedchamber than in an eatery krasta recognized as much but she couldnt check bedchambers while eateries were easy and lurcanio liked fancy dining he might want to impress a new valmieran girlor fatten her upbefore he took her to bed why hello you sweet thing that wasnt lurcanioit was viscount valnu who sat not far from the door of the fourth or fifth eatery into which krasta peered he sprang to his feet so he could bow come on down and take lunch with me all right krasta said and if she and valnu happened to end up in a hostel bedchamberwell it wouldnt be anything that hadnt almost happened before swinging her hips she walked downstairs and sat beside him what are you eating there boiled pork and sour cabbage he answered and then eyed her why what would you like me to be eating you are a shameless man she said she eyed him too but just then a waiter came up and asked what she wanted she ordered the same thing valnu was having and ale to go with it youre looking lovely today valnu said with another carnivorous smile im sure you say that to all the girls krasta told him which only made him grin and nod in delight she didnt want him to take anything for granted and so with a spark of malice she added and to at least half the boys as well what if i do valnu answered with an expressive shrug variety is the life of spiceisnt that what they say he gave her a limpwristed wave and some malice of his own i wouldnt say it to your precious lurcanio ill tell you that where krasta had been intent on cuckolding her algarvian lover now she found herself defending him he knows what hes doing as a matter of fact what if he does valnu shrugged again almost as an algarvian might have done and he was wearing a kiltkrasta had noticed when he rose to greet her pointing to her he went on but do you know what youre doing of course i do doubt was not among the things that troubled krasta again she might have said more without the waiters interruption but he distracted her by setting the ale on the table aye you always know valnus smile instead of being hard as it had been a moment before seemed strange and sweet almost sad youre always so surebut how much good does that do you with the avalanche thundering down on all of us now what are you talking about krasta asked impatiently avalanches there arent any mountains around priekule viscount valnu sighed no not literally but you know whats happening to us seeing krastas blank look he amplified that to our people i mean i know you know about that he studied her she didnt think to wonder how he knew its pretty bad she agreed but its worse over in the westand wont it get better if the miserable war ever ends that depends on how the war ends valnu replied a distinction too subtle to mean much to krasta the waiter set her plate of pork and cabbage in front of her put it on my bill valnu said as she dug in you dont need to do that krasta said i outrank you after all nobility obliges valnu said lightly he regained his leer and how obliging do you feel like being are you an algarvian officer to think you can buy me with a lunch krasta retorted they flirted through the meal but she didnt go to a hostel with him mentioning algarvian officers made her think of lurcanio again and she found she simply did not have the nerve to be deliberately unfaithful to him someone will have to sweep me off my feet she thought and wondered how she could arrange that thirteen skarnu enjoyed going into pavilosta with merkela in his days in priekule hed scorned such little market towns like any city sophisticate had he stayed in priekule he was sure he would have gone right on scorning them after some weeks on a farm out in the countryside though pavilostas few bright lightstaverns shops gossip in the market squareseemed to shine all the brighter to merkela pavilosta was the big city or as much of it as shed ever known lookthe ironmongers has some new tools in the front window she said she was familiar enough with what he usually displayed to recognize the additions at once since skarnu wasnt he just nodded to show hed heard a couple of doors past the ironmongers was a cordwainers but no new boots stood in his window nothing at all stood in his window in fact but three words had been whitewashed across it with savage strokes of the brush night and fog oh a pox skarnu said softly aye curse the algarvians for taking him off and merkela paused she glanced over to skarnu its worse than that isnt it he nodded he was one of us all right if they made him disappear thats one thing if they squeezed him first thats something elsesomething worse will they come after us next do you think merkela asked i dont know skarnu answered i cant know but wed better be ready to disappear or fight before long hed been striking blows at the algarvian occupiers for a couple of years ever since hed sneaked through their lines instead of surrendering but they could strike back too the day he forgot that would be the day of his ruination i want to fight merkela said ferocity filling her voice i want to fight tooif we have some chance of winning skarnu said if they land on us in the middle of the night though and paint night and fog on the front doorthats not fighting we wouldnt have a chance merkela walked along for a while kicking at the slates of the sidewalk she muttered a curse under her breath skarnu muttered one even more quietly under his when she got into one of these moods sometimes he had everything he could do to keep her from trying to murder the first algarvian soldier she saw he understood why but knew she needed the restraint if she wanted to go on fighting the redheads but then to his surpriseindeed to his astonishmentshe spoke in much milder tones than shed used before youre right of course skarnu gaped he wanted to dig a finger into one ear to make sure hed heard correctly are you feeling well he asked at first he meant it for a joke but after a moment he realized she hadnt quite been herself lately she walked on for another few paces head down hands in her trouser pockets i hadnt meant to tell you so soon she said still looking at the sidewalk and not at him but i think id better tell me what skarnu asked now she did lift her head and face him he had trouble reading her smile was she pleased rueful something of each perhaps and then all his thoughtful analysis crashed to the ground because she answered im going to have a baby not much doubt of it now a baby skarnu wondered what his own face was showing astonishment again most likely which was foolishtheyd been lovers a good while he did his best to rally thatswonderful sweetheart after a moment he nodded saying it helped make him believe it and merkela nodded too it is isnt it for me especially i meanwhen i didnt quicken with gedominu i wondered if i was barren when i didnt quicken with you i thought i must be but i was wrong now nothing but joy blazed from her smile gedominu had been an old man if anyone was to blame for merkelas not getting pregnant skarnu would have bet on him not her as for himself he shrugged hed never fathered a bastard before but who could say what that meant about his own seed nothing evidently or merkela wouldnt be with child now he also wondered if he should let the child stay a bastard in the normal course of events he never would have met merkela if he had met her and bedded her it would have been a nights amusement nothing more now thanks to the war nothing was what it had been who would call him a madman if he took a farmers widow to wife krasta would that occurred to him almost at once he shrugged again once upon a time he would have cared what his sister thought no more having let an algarvian lie in her bed krasta could hardly complain about whose bed he lay in he took merkelas hand everything will be fine he said i promise he didnt know how he would keep that promise but hed find some way and merkela nodded i know it she told him and the child will grow up free by the powers above it will skarnu nodded too though he wasnt sure how that vow would come true either holding hands they walked into the market square farmers displayed eggs and cheeses and hams and preserved fruit and gherkins and any number of other good things the eye skarnu and merkela turned on those was more competitive than acquisitive their own farmwhich seemed much more real to skarnu than the mansion he hadnt seen for so longsupplied all they needed along those lines and they sometimes sold their surplus here in the square too but pavilostas cloth merchant and potteraye and the ironmonger toohad stalls of their own in the market square merkela admired some fine green linen though she didnt admire the price the cloth merchant wanted for the bolt you might get that from a marchioness she said but how many noblewomen will you see here if i sell it for less than what i paid for it i wont do myself any good the merchant said you wont do yourself any good if you dont sell it at all either merkela retorted i think the moths will get fat on it before you move it off she went nose in the air as if she were a marchioness herselfindeed krasta could hardly have done it better skarnu followed in her wake pavilostas townsfolk sneered at the goods the farmers had brought to market the farmers whod come to shop and not to sell disparaged everything the local merchants displayed some of them were much louder and ruder than merkela algarvians prowled through the square too more of them than skarnu was used to seeing in pavilosta put together with the cordwainers disappearance that worried him werent the redheads supposed to be throwing everything they had into the fight in unkerlant if tliey were why bring so many soldiers to a little country town where nothing ever happened but pavilosta wasnt quite a little country town where nothing ever happened count enkuru whod been hand in glove with mezentios men had been assassinated here a riot had broken out at the accession of his son simanu another noble whod been too cozy with the algarvians and simanu was dead too skarnu had blazed him so maybe the redheads had their reasons after all one of their officers practically paraded through the square his uniform kilt flapping around his legs as he hurried this way and that merkela noticed him too hes trouble she whispered to skarnu any time a colonel starts poking his nose into things hes always trouble skarnu whispered back an overage lieutenant headed up the little garrison in pavilosta he trotted along after the graying colonel hands waving as he explained this or that whatever he was saying he failed to impress the senior algarvian officer at one point the colonel said something that had to be downright cruel for the lieutenant recoiled as if a beam had wounded him striking a dramatic pose he cried do please be reasonable colonel lurcanio whatever the colonel answered the lieutenant got no satisfaction from it whatever it was skarnu couldnt hear it he wasnt quite sure if the algarvian word he had heard meant reasonable or fair his command of algarvian never great was badly rusty these days but that didnt matter either as soon as he could he took merkela aside and murmured i had better make myself scarce if theyre not after me in particular id be amazed why do you say that merkela asked he didnt point he didnt want to do anything to draw the algarvian officers notice quietly still he answered because that fellow over there is my dear sisters lover merkela needed a moment to realize what that meant when she did her eyes flashed fire almost as if she were a dragon the whore didnt just sell her body to the algarviansshe sold you too skarnu didnt want to believe that of krasta of course he didnt want to believe his sister gave herself to the redhead either but he had no choice there he said whether she sold me or not this lurcanios not likely to be here by accident no not likely at all merkela frowned then grew brisk youre right youd better disappear vatsyunas and pernavai have to go with you too they cant sound like proper valmierans raunu can stayif the redheads come to the farm ill be a widow making ends meet with a hired man she marshaled the people in her life as if she were a general marshaling armies that may serve skarnu said but it may not too plenty of people in these parts can tell the algarvians ive been living with you she pondered but not for long ill say we quarreled and i cursed well threw you out then she raised her voice to a furious shout you stinking cockhound if you dont keep your eyes and your hands where they belong ill make sure you sing soprano for the rest of your days people stared lurcanio was one of those people his face twisted into an amused smirk for a moment skarnu gapeddrawing lurcanios attention was the last thing he wanted but a little slower than he should have he saw how merkela was building her alibi and remembered that at the moment lurcanio couldnt recognize him he did his best to get into the spirit of things yelling oh shut up you noisy bitch i ought to give you a good one and i will too if you dont keep quiet you try it and youll be sorrier than you ever have been merkela snarled she sounded as if she meant it too she made a fine actress and she wasnt just acting either skarnu wouldnt have wanted to be the man who laid a hand on her when she didnt care to be touched they kept on quarreling till they left pavilosta as soon as they were alone on the road back to the farm they started to laugh skarnu wasnt laughing though when he went off into the woods with vatsyunas and pernavai he felt a coward for leaving a womanand especially a woman carrying his childto face the redheads alone and the kaunians from forthweg were city folk without much notion of how to take care of themselves in what seemed very wild country to them skarnu stayed busy showing them what needed doing he tried to remember that he hadnt known either till he went into the army he could sneak back to the farm for food he didnt have to hunt about a week later merkela said they came today and sure enough that redhead who swives your sister is a dangerous man but raunu and i played the fool and sent him on his way good enough skarnu said better than good enough in fact but i wont come back to stay for a while yet what do you care to bet theyll swoop down here again to see if you were playing tricks aye that lurcanio would merkela said at once he might even come back three times curse him let him he wont catch you and the fight goes on skarnu nodded as if they were a spell he repeated the words the fight goes on istvan studied the scar on his left hand it still pained him every now and again captain tivadar had cut deep istvan didnt blame his company commander tivadar had had to let the sin out of him and out of the men of his squad istvan just hoped the cut proved expiation enough corporal kun came back through the trees toward him no sign of the unkerlanters ahead sergeant he said all rightgood well move forward then istvan said kun nodded they were oddly formal with each other all the men whod eaten goat were like that these days they had a bond it wasnt one any of them would have wanted but it was there feeling it istvan understood how and why criminals and perverts sometimes sought out goats flesh it set them apart from the rest of mankindthe rest of gyongyosian mankind at any rate they had to band together for no one else would have anything to do with them sergeant kun asked again in that oddly formal tone aye what is it istvan wanted to harass the bespectacled mages apprentice as he had before they shared the contents of that stewpot but found he couldnt he looked down at his scar again kun saw where istvans eyes went and he opened his own left hand he was similarly markedand no doubt similarly scarred on his soul as well he let out a long unhappy breath then said do you suppose the rest of the company knows what happened there back in that clearing well nobodys called me a goateater anyhow istvan answered a good thing tooanybody did call me anything like that id have to try to kill him for my honors sake either that or admit it you couldnt admit it kun exclaimed in horror the stars wouldnt shine on you if you did of course they wouldnt istvan said thats why id have to do what a warrior should do maybe people know what happened and theyre keeping quiet because they know what id have to do too or maybe they really dont know captain tivadar was the only one who came up to the clearing after all and he wouldnt blab not after he cleansed us he wouldnt slowly kun nodded i keep telling myself the same thing but the other thing i keep telling myself is that sort of business doesnt stay a secret somehow it doesnt istvan nodded too the same fear filled him having done what hed done was bad enough having otherspeople who hadnt done it who werent linked to one another by that strange bondknow would be far far worse meanwhile along with worrying about the state of his sins he also had to worry about staying alive every time he scurried from pine to birch to clump of ferns he took his life in his hands kun hadnt seen any unkerlanters in this stretch of the endless forest but that didnt mean they werent there a flick of motion caught his eye he swung his stick toward it and blazed without conscious thought had it been an unkerlanter the fellow would have died as things were a red squirrel toppled off a branch and lay feebly kicking among the pine needles after a minute or so it stopped moving nice blazing kun said ought to bring it along and throw it in the pot when we stop nothing wrong with squirrel no istvan said he didnt know whether kun meant that the meat tasted good or that the animal was ritually clean he didnt want to ask that would have involved comparisons with animals that werent ritually clean as he stopped to pick up the squirrel he realized he could have blazed a countryman as readily as a foe if in some dreadful accident or in the heat of battle captain tivadar went down and did not rise again who but for istvan and his equally guilty squadmates would know on what accursed meat theyd supped horrified he violently shook his head that was the curse speaking inside him tivadar had cleansed when he might have condemned and istvan wanted to repay him for that with death some part of the goats meat had to be working inside him corrupting him no he said aloud no what sergeant kun asked istvan didnt answer a moment later an unkerlanters beam burned a hole in a tree trunk behind him and almost burned off part of his beard too throwing himself flat and rolling toward another tree felt more like a relief than anything else compared to what had been going through his mind worries about his own death or mutilation seemed simple and clean urra the unkerlanters shouted swemmel urra either they had an accomplished mage with them to make a few men sound like a host or they outnumbered the gyongyosians approaching them again istvan saw something move this time a human howl of pain rewarded his blaze his own men were shouting too trying to sound like more than they were he yelled along with the rest of them arpad arpad he didnt know how much good crying out his sovereigns name would do but it couldnt hurt and then as if the stars chose to grant a favor he hadnt even asked for eggs began falling on the unkerlanters moving eggtossers forward along the miserable tracks through these miserable woods wasnt easy istvan hadnt known the gyongyosians had any close by for once the surprise he got was pleasant the unkerlanters didnt think so how they howled when bursts of sorcerous energy knocked down trees and sent men flyingbut not for long some of them kept on yelling swemmels name but they didnt sound nearly so fierce as they had before come on lets make them pay that was captain tivadar istvan hadnt known the company commander was so close by either the horrid thought that had sprung up like a toadstool from the rot at the bottom of his mind returned once more he shook his head again and asked the stars to hold that idea away from the minds of his squadmates going forward seemed easier as long as he was fighting he wouldnt have to think that suited him fine ekrekek arpad he cried no one asked whether hed liked the goat he ate not while the gyongyosians were advancing by what seemed another special miracle the eggtossers lengthened their range so their eggs didnt burst on men from their own side that didnt happen all the time either as istvan remembered too well from the fighting on obuda he snorted as he ran past a dead unkerlanter you could lift that island out of the bothnian ocean and throw it down anywhere in this vast forest and it would vanish without a trace he wished the stars would lift it from the ocean and throw it down somewhere near here with luck someplace where it would crush a good many of swemmels soldiers forward tivadar shouted weve punched a hole in their line if the stars shine bright we can unravel them like a cheap pair of leggings you heard the captain as a sergeant one of the things istvan had to do was back up his superiors orders keep moving you lazy lugs no time to stop and rest now weve got to keep pushing the unkerlanters earlier in the campaign he would surely have called the men of his squad a pack of useless goateaters or some similar sergeants endearment not now they wouldnt have taken it the right way he wouldnt have felt right saying it either szonyi emerged from behind the trunk of a stout spruce a few yards away from istvan we really are driving them this time arent we sergeant he said aye for now istvan answered wed better enjoy it while it lasts on account of it probably wont szonyi nodded and ran on his stick ready to blaze his eyes moving back and forth back and forth to make sure he didnt run past any unkerlanter who might still be alive istvan nodded to himself szonyi was about as good a common soldier as hed ever seensurely a better warrior than hed been when he was a common soldier himself and for once the unkerlanters didnt look to have three or four separate lines waiting for the gyongyosians with every step istvan moved forward his confidence grew aye swemmels men had put up a good fight for a long time but could they really hope to withstand a warrior race forever it didnt seem likely ever more gyongyosian troopers flooded into the gap istvans squad had forced for three days he and his countrymen had everything their own way he thought they moved farther in those three days than they had in the whole month before the unkerlanters who did keep fighting began to grow desperate some of them began to lose hope instead of fighting on after their positions were overrun they began throwing down their sticks and surrendering istvan wanted to go forward day and night i wonder where this accursed forest ends he said to kun as they pausedonly for a momentto stand in front of a tree i wonder whats on the other side of it maybe well find out instead of laughing at him kun nodded maybe we will the mages apprentice said slowly maybe the stars will show us war out in the open again istvan said dreamily wed truly trample the unkerlanters then he was setting his leggings to rights when kun cried out inalarm it sounded more like terror istvan was about to ask what was wrong when the ground began to shake under his feet not far away someone shouted earthquake no kun screamed worse as far as istvan was concerned hardly anything could be worse than a big earthquake the valley were hed grown up had known a couple of them and till hed been in combat he hadnt dreamt anything could be more terrifying kun screamed again vileness filth they defile themselves they defile the world for a moment istvan didnt know what his comrade was talking about then livid purple flames shot from the ground only a few feet in front of him some of the trees the temblor had shaken down caught fire some gyongyosians caught fire too magecraft istvan cried foul magecraft kun shouted back they slay their own to power it thank the kindly stars you cant sense what that felt like i wish my head would fall off he looked like a man with a ghastly hangover by the time the ground stopped shaking and breaking apart by the time the flames stopped spurting and the fires they started stopped spreading the spearpoint of the gyongyosian advance had been blunted the unkerlanters got enough breathing space to bring more soldiers forward and the fight went back to being hard again glad hed lived through the sorcerous onslaught istvan resigned himself to more time in the forest one of trasones comrades pointed south look he said you can see the wolter from here we cant be more than half a mile away i think youre lying through your teeth is what i think trasone said here give me that stinking thing the other algarvian trooper handed him the contraption hed made from a board and a couple of pieces of a broken mirror trasone stuck the top of the contraption above the lip of the trench in which he huddled by looking at the lower mirror trasone could use the upper one to show him what lay ahead without a doubt he would have been blazed if hed poked up his head to look well ill be a son of a whore he said softly youre right folvo there it isor the bluffs on this side of it anyhow we get there we get over to the other side and we can put this lousy war in our belt pouch ayeif we get there folvo answered whats ahead doesnt look like a whole lot of fun though and that worse luck was nothing but the truth a couple of enormous buildings lay between the leading algarvians in sulingen and the river one was a granary it had been built of massive bricks and blocks of stone to hold vermin at bay but that also made it a powerful fortress the other was larger still though of somewhat less sturdy construction far and away the biggest iron manufactory in sulingen sometimes the unkerlanters would bring behemoths across the wolter into the city load them with armor and weapons and throw them straight into the fight some of the behemoths lay dead not far from the manufactory others unfortunately for mezentios soldiers got farther and did worse a flight of dragons painted in bright algarvian colors swooped down on the ironworks dropping eggs as they dove the eggs burst on and around the building some more of the roof came down trasone didnt get excited about that as he might have a couple of weeks earlier he knew all too well that the unkerlanters those whom the bursts didnt slay went right on working in the ruins and they kept fighting back too they had a lot of heavy sticks crowded into the parts of sulingen they still heldbeams stabbed into the sky after the dragons those beams might have done more harm than they did if the smoke that rose from countless fires hadnt spread and weakened them as things were one of the dragons staggered in the air it didnt plummet as trasone had seen so many plummet but it couldnt go on with its flightmates either it did manage to come to earth in algarvianheld territory trasone hoped the dragonflier wasnt badly hurt he had to be better off than algarvian dragonfliers who fell into unkerlanter hands then trasone stopped worrying about dragonfliers the unkerlanters had dragons too flying north from farms on the far side of the wolter they seldom fought the algarvians in the air most of them lacked the skill for that but as mezentios men pounded their positions they returned the disfavor eggs fell around trasone he rolled himself into a ball in the trench as if he were a pillbug but he didnt even have an armored exterior to present to the world all he could do was make himself small and hope a shard of something bit into his little finger he yelped and pulled out a sliver of glassfolvos improvised periscope was no more trasone braced himself for the shouts of urra that were bound to follow the rockgray dragons hed long since lost track of how many unkerlanter counterattacks he and his friends had beaten back too many of his friends were wounded or dead because of them thoughhe knew that beneath him the ground shook slightly he cursed and braced himself again this time to withstand sorcerywhether from his own side or the unkerlanters he couldnt yet guess but it wasnt the onset of magecraft instead it was four or five algarvian behemoths lumbering up to the battle line huzzah trasone shouted he waved his hatthough not very high he didnt want to get blazed while celebrating after all here they come that was sergeant panfilos shout trasone couldnt see his sergeant which was all to the good he hoped the unkerlanters couldnt see panfilo either he peered up out of his own hole peered up and whooped with glee they waited too stinking long this time he said and settled down and started to blaze he would never have made a general the officers set over him had decided he wouldnt even make a good corporal hed long since stopped worrying about not getting promoted all he wanted to do was stay alive and make sure a good many unkerlanters didnt but he was no fool when it came to measuring a narrow little battlefield he could do the job as well as any nobleman with fancy rank badges here came swemmels soldiers picking their way through the rubble toward the trenches the algarvians held they were shouting urraand their kings name too as always they were game trasone wondered how many of them were drunk he knew their officers served up raw spirits before sending the men to the attack assailing a position like the one he and his comrades held he would have wanted to be drunk too an unkerlanter fell and another trasone had no idea whether his beam was the one that had knocked either of them over a lot of algarvian troopers had popped up from their shelters at the same time as he had from his and then another unkerlanter went down this one with a hole in him you could have thrown a dog through no footsoldiers weapon could have made such a wound only a heavy stick mounted on the back of a behemoth that stick found one foe after another when the unkerlanters dove for cover it blazed right through the boards and sheet metal some of them chose the rest of the behemoths carried eggtossers they rained death down on the unkerknters not death at random but death precisely aimed death that pursued them death that found them the charge faltered when his comrades lay broken and bloodied all around him not even a bellyful of raw spirits would take a man forward any more along with the behemoths fresh troops in algarvian uniform came up on the right of trasones regiment for a moment he didnt recognize the patch each newcomer wore on his left sleeve a seagreen shield with five gold crowns then he did and his jaw dropped powers above he exclaimed theyre fornicating sibs folvo nodded didnt you hear about that he said theyve recruited a couple of regiments worth of men on the five islands theyre supposed to be tough enough to suit anybody whats the world coming to trasone shook his head yaninans for flank guards now these sibs right alongside usand i did hear tell weve got forthwegians doing something or other too whats next are we going to start setting up regiments of kaunians id sooner there were kaunians here than me folvo said oh aye but all the same trasone turned and called to one of the sibians hey pal you speak my language at least as well as you do the sibian answered in cold precise algarvian probably better well you can go futter yourself too trasone muttered but not so loud as to make the newcomerwho was after all supposed to be on his side notice officers whistles screeched and wailed both among the sibians and in his own regiment at the same time the algarvian behemoths lumbered forward the heavy stick blazing unkerlanter after unkerlanter the eggtossers making the enemy burrow for his life instead of fighting back lets go major spinello shouted one more good push and were at the wolter thats where we want to be thats where we have to be if weve ever going to go any farther mezentio as usual the battalion commander was the first man out of his whole the first man rushing toward the enemy mezentio trasone shouted bent at the waist he scuttled forward too dashing from one pile of rubble to the next blazing any unkerlanters he ran past in case they were playing dead and would rise up to blaze his countrymen if they got the chance he knew the men of his regiment would go forward too they always had he trusted them with his life and they trusted him with theirs he wasnt so sure about the sibians they were foreigners after all so what could you expect from them the algarvians had licked them too which automatically made them suspect in his eyes they shouted something in their own language instead of mezentio or algarve that would get some of them blazed by their allies if they werent careful or lucky but everything folvo had said about them looked to be true they went forward just as fast and just as hard as the algarvians on their left and their companies and battalions unlike trasones were at full strength which gave their attack extra weight there it is trasone said he didnt need folvos contraption to see the wolter up ahead now there was the river and there were the piers sticking out into it at which boats coming from the far side unloaded unkerlanter reinforcements if he and his comradesor even the sibians fighting alongside themcould take those piers and hold them or burn them how would swemmels soldiers bring new men up into sulingen but it wouldnt be easy he didnt take long to discover that advancing over the ground on which the unkerlanters had attacked was easy past that ground though they had their own field works starting in the mean little workmens hovels in front of the great ironworks and extending back line after line all the way to the river unkerlanter soldiers popped up out of cellars to blaze at the algarvians then disappeared again even more than mezentios men they lived like moles tunneling from one hut to the next and only showing themselves above ground to blaze or to charge major spinellos whistle squealed come on boys reach out and grab it the way youd grab a pretty kaunian girls tits again the algarvians and sibians went forward in a desperate push toward the riverbank but the unkerlanters were desperate too they funneled more and more men into the fight for all trasone knew they had tunnels leading all the way back to the ironworks and the granary strongpoints mezentios men had yet to clear the algarvian advance stalled trasone glanced toward the sky seen through shifting plumes of smoke the sun had slid a long way down toward the western horizon it was setting earlier now than it had not so long before the start of fall couldnt be more than a few days away and after fall came winter the thought of another winter in southern unkerlant chilled trasone to the marrow wed better win now then he muttered and crawled a few feet farther forward into the crater a bursting egg had left a beam started a fire in the pile of rubble hed just vacatedthe beam from a heavy stick it had come from up ahead somewhere up there an unkerlanter behemoth prowled one of the algarvian beasts had already gone down blazed in the vulnerable belly by an unkerlanter who came out of a hole below it and then ducked down again dragons dove flaming they were unkerlanter beasts screams rang out among the sibians trasone didnt blame them no troops had an easy time facing dragons the sun set night fell the algarvians huddled in the ruins of sulingen only a couple of furlongs maybe only one from the wolter well get em tomorrow spinello called cheerfully in his gullyside headquarters marshal rathar turned to general vatran can we hold them the marshal asked anxiously we have to hold them vatran answered if we dont hold the buggers we dont hold sulingen and if we dont hold sulingen we get boiled alive and so does the kingdom rathar said vatrans grunt might have been laughter the only trouble was rathar wasnt joking the algarvians had been advancing through sulingen street by streetslowly but with grim persistence unkerlant had few streets left to lose eggs burst not far from the mouth of the cavern in which rathar and vatran made their headquarters the unkerlanters moved soldiers up from the river through the gullies piercing sulingen and the algarvians knew it their eggtossers and dragons kept pounding away at those gullies they took a horrible toll but it would have been worse had swemmels men gone forward any other way if we lose those piers were ruined vatran said what have we got there to keep the redheads from reaching the river one behemoth and a couple of battalions or whatevers left of them by now vatran told him the general scowled at the map there are a lot more algarvians in that part of town right now our men have to hold anyway rathar said weve got three good brigades waiting on the southern bank of the wolter they cant get over the river till nightfall if they try the algarvian dragons will have a field day so we have to hang on to that landing area no matter what whos in command there powers above only know vatran answered whoevers seniormost and hasnt taken a beam through the brisket aye no doubt youre right about that rathar said he turned his head and raised his voice to a shout crystallomancer how may i serve you lord marshal asked one of the military mages in charge of keeping the cave in touch with the battle raging all through sulingen rather pointed to the map get me the senior officer in this sector i dont know who hell be i only hope his crystallomancers still breathing the mage murmured over his glassy sphere moments later an image formed in it that of another crystallomancer huddled in the ruins of what had been an ironworkers hut when rathars crystallomancer told him what the marshal required he nodded and said wait he crawled off a moment later he came back with a soldier even grimier than he was here is major melot major you are to hold the algarvians away from the piers until nightfall come what may rathar said lord marshal you dont know what youre asking melot said im down to about my last hundred men here my only behemoth has a broken leg and it looks like every algarvian in the world is out there hold rathar repeated his voice deadly cold blaze the behemoth and use the carcass for a strongpoint rally your men around it if you dont hold off the redheads till the sun goes down ill have you blazed first thing tomorrow morning have you got that aye lord marshal melot shrugged well do what we can sir thats all we can do raising one shaggy eyebrow he stared at rathar the way things are im not much afraid of you blazing me the algarviansll take care of it for you never fear a moment later the crystal flared light for a moment the images of the embattled major and his mage faded rathars crystallomancer said theyve broken the link sir that fellow is insubordinate vatran grumbled hes on the spot rathar said mildly hell do what i told him to do or hell die trying he made a fist and pounded it down on his knee i dont mind if he dies trying but he has to do it if he doesnt they cut sulingen in half how long till sunset he couldnt tell by looking shadow already shrouded the far wall of the gully vatran spoke in reassuring tones only a couple of more hours lord marshal lets get some food in you first what do you say to that all right rathar realized how empty he felt he would have made sure his armys behemoths were well fed but didnt bother giving himself the same care vatran nodded as if to say he knew as much hey ysolt he shouted bring the marshal a big bowl of whatevers in the pot and a mug of spirits to go with it ill do that the cook said and she did she handed rathar a bowl of buckwheat groats and onions with bits of meat floating in it he dug in pausing now and again to swig from the mug of spirits good he said with his mouth full and then pointed at the bowl whats the meat unicorn lord marshal ysolt answered she was nearing middle age wide in the shoulder and wider in the hips her face always red from the cookfires she tended one of the ones the algarvians killed out in the gully seemed a stinking shame to let the flesh go to waste unicorn rathar echoed he wasnt sure hed ever eaten it before hed eaten horse but this was less gluey on the tongue more flavorful not bad can you fill up the bowl again why not the cook took it from him and went back to the fire her big haunches rolling as she walked vatran eyed her with appreciation rathar didnt think the general was sleeping with her but he wasnt sure the past few days nobody in this hole in the ground had been sleeping much after a while darkness did fall vatran said well we havent heard that the piers are lost anyhow would we rathar asked if everyone over there is dead nobodyd be left to tell us everything had fallen apart he raised his voice once more crystallomancer get me major melot again the mage cast his spell after what seemed a very long time someones face appeared in the crystal whose too dark to tell report your situation rathar said wondering if he was taking with an algarvian whod overrun the unkerlanter defenders were still here sir the fellow sounded like an unkerlanter anyhow wheres major melot rathar rapped out dead the unkerlanter soldier answered theres maybe fifty of us leftbut mezentios men have settled down for the night we gave em all they wanted and then some plenty of those whoresons down for good too you bet maybe he didnt know to whom he was speaking maybe he was too worn to care rathar remembered fights like that back in the twinkings war if he had to hed grab a stick and go into battle himself once morethat was how vital he reckoned holding sulingen to be good enough soldier he said gruffly and nodded to the crystallomancer who dissolved the link rathar turned to vatran what do you think if we dont send those brigades across lord marshal we may as well pack it in vatran answered even if the redheads have a trap waiting to close on em weve got to try it without em the algarvians have it all their own way in sulingen youll do what youll doyoure the marshal but thats how it looks to me and to me rathar said he tapped the crystallomancer on the shoulder get me major general canel on the southern bank of the wolter a couple of minutes later canels image appeared in the crystal the unkerlanter officer had a bloody bandage wrapped loosely around his head redheads come calling rathar asked its only a scratch canel answered they didnt hit more than a couple of boats either lord marshal i can move if you want me to stout fellow rathar said i want you to all right first thing you do is you throw the algarvians back from the pier then reinforce the ironworks and the granary and then the hill east of the ironworks canel nodded which made the bandage flop down over his left eye never a dull moment in these parts is there cursed algarvians if you wanted a nice easy job you should have chosen something quiet and safetigertaming maybe rathar said canel grinned at him lantern light shone from the major generals teeth rathar went on hit em hard he didnt think canels brigades would turn the tide by themselves he expected them to get chewed up in fact too many of mezentios men were in sulingen for anything else to be likely but canel led good troops theyd do some chewing of their own too rathar could tell just when the unkerlanters crossed from the southern bank of the wolter into sulingen the din of battle which had quieted after sunset picked up again vatran chuckled well shake the algarvians out of their feather beds by the powers above well maybe we will heres hoping anyhow rathar yawned im going back to my own feather bed now vatran laughed at that like everyone else in the gullyside headquarters rathar slept on a cot in a tiny chamber scraped from the dirt and shored up with boards to keep the earthen roof from falling in if an algarvian egg burst right overhead a curtain over the entrance was the only sign of his exalted rank not even vatran had one as he headed off to the chamber rathar looked back over his shoulder and added wake me the instant you need me dont be shy he said that whenever he went to bed as always vatran nodded aye lord marshal about a third of the time rathar got to sleep as long as he wanted he was lucky in not needing a lot of sleep a marshal who had to have eight hours every night would have been useless in wartime sure enough someone shook him in the middle of the night he came awake at once as he always did and tried to gauge the hour by the noise outside the curtain it was pretty quiet out there whats toward he asked usually that would get him a crisp explanation from vatran or from one of the junior officers in the cave tonight he was answered bya giggle whoever was there sat down on the cot beside him you threw them back lord marshal a low throaty voice said now we celebrate ysolt rathar asked he got another giggle by way of reply he reached outand touched smooth bare flesh his ears heated powers above ysolt im a married man if your wife was here shed take care of this the cook answered but shes not so ill do it for her before he could say another wordand whatever he said couldnt be very loud for he didnt want anyone outside to find out what was going on in hereysolt pushed him over onto his back she hiked up his tunic yanked down his drawers and took hold of him his ears werent what heated then ysolt chuckled you see lord marshal youre as ready as the army was tonight she straddled him and impaled herself almost of their own accord his arms came up and folded around her back in the darkness her mouth found his and then the only thing he wondered was whether the cot would collapse under the strain of two goodsized people energetically making love but it proved sturdier than hed expected and held ysolt gasped and quivered a moment later rathar groaned she kissed him on the cheek then slid off him a brief rustle was her putting on the tunic shed shed before waking him conqueror she whispered and slipped out of the tiny chamber feeling more conquered than anything else rathar set his clothes to rights had they not been disarranged he might have thought hed been dreaming a moment later he was asleep again do you think we got rid of those cursed forthwegians by ourselves garivald asked munderic he didnt think so himself not for a minute those bearded demons had given munderics band of irregulars everything they wanted and then some munderic said i cant tell you one way or the other all i can tell you is nobodys seen the buggers anywhere around for the past week or so theyre like a squall is what they are they blew in they tore things up and now theyve blown out again he spat im cursed if im going to tell you i miss em either they were trouble garivald agreed now that theyre gone what do we do have to remind folks were still around munderic said and garivald nodded the band had spent most of its time deep in the woods since the forthwegians outdid them at the game of ambush we ought to hit a grelzer patrol garivald said if we can send ranieros pups home with a jug tied to their tails well have things to ourselves for a while here thats so munderic agreed the other thing we have to do is we have to keep hitting the ley lines that run south and west the harder the time the algarvians have moving men forward the better our armies will do ley lines hardly seemed real to garivald zossen had been a long way away from any of them for all practical purposes his home village lived as it had two centuries before when all traffic moved on wheels or on the backs of beasts or men in summer and what traffic there was in winter went by sled even so he nodded and said aye makes sense to me munderics face was rarely cheerful now it went savage indeed and ill find out who sold us to the forthwegians when i do hell die but hell spend a long time wishing he was dead first garivald nodded again have to get rid of traitors he said he wasnt surprised there were some though he knew the irregulars had spies among the grelzers who followed king raniero only natural the backers of the puppet king should try to return the favor maybe sadocll be able to sniff out the son of a whore munderic said sadoc couldnt sniff out a weekdead horse if you put him ten feet downwind of it garivald said hes a good fighter munderic ill never say anything about his nerve but hes no mage and youll get hurt if you count on him to be one the leader of the irregulars glared at him he knew the forthwegians were coming down out of the north not just along the path through the woods all right have it your way you will anyhow back in zossen garivald wouldnt have got into an argument with waddo the firstman he didnt argue with munderic here arguing with a man who had more power than you did you no good even when you were right you were wrong sometimes you were especially wrong when you turned out to be especially right there was a song in that somewhere garivald felt it he wondered if he ought to go looking for it ordinary peasants would laugh themselves silly firstmen and nobles and inspectors and impressers wouldnt think it was so funny he had no trouble figuring out what theyd do to someone who sang a song mocking them about the same as the algarvians would have done to him for singing songs about them munderic and the irregulars had rescued him when he wrote songs about the redheads they wanted him to go right on doing it suppose by some miracle the war were won tomorrow suppose he went right on singing songs about firstmen and inspectors songs as biting as the ones he sang about the algarvians when king swemmels men came after him then who would rescue him nobody he could think of that made him wonder for the first time whether hed chosen the right side it also made him understand for the first time the men and women who followed raniero of grelz and not swemmel of unkerlant he shook his head raniero was an algarvian propped up by the might of the algarvians and the redheads were even harder on the peasants of unkerlant than swemmels men he looked up through the branches overhead a dragon was circling in the sky so high that it looked like nothing so much as a worm gliding on little batwings but garivald knew what sort of worm it was he also knewthough he couldnt seewhose great worm it was it would surely be painted in the green and red and white of algarve what could the man on it see down here not much garivald hoped he glanced around no campfires burning no cookfires burning nothing to draw a dragonfliers eye he hoped nothing to draw a dragonfliers eye maybe after a while the redhead up there would get sick of staring at trees and fly off if garivald hadnt been looking up at the sky maybe sadoc wouldnt have looked up either but nothing makes one man want to crane his neck like seeing another man already doing it sadoc spied the dragon in short order he shook his fist at it cursed thing he growled its a nuisance all right garivald agreed i dont think the fellow on it knows were down here though sadoc shook his fist again i ought to knock it right out of the sky thats what i ought to do garivald eyed him can you almost as if he were an algarvian sadoc struck a pose redolent of affronted dignity do you doubt me songster do you doubt my magecraft aye garivald knew he should have said it but he didnt hed already been too frank with munderic all he did say was it wouldnt be easy i dont think in a pigs arse it wouldnt sadoc snarled drawing himself up with even more offended pride i can do it i will do it by the powers above he stomped off garivald thought of running after him to stop him but sadoc was bigger than he was meaner than he was and already angry at him he didnt think he could either talk the other irregular out of trying his magecraft or beat him in a fight instead he hurried back to munderic and told him what sadoc had in mind to his dismay munderic said good for him the algarvians have been putting us in fear with their wizardry high time we paid em back in their own coin but what if something goes wrong garivald said then he wont knock the dragon down and he likely will give away where were hiding you worry too much munderic told him sadoc isnt as bad a mage as you think no hes worse garivald retorted munderic jerked his thumb in a brusque gesture of dismissal having just argued twice with the leader of the irregulars garivald supposed he understood why munderic responded as he did that didnt mean he thought munderic was right it didnt mean he thought sadoc could sorcerously bring down a dragon either but munderic wouldnt listen and sadoc gave every sign of going ahead with his wizardry a crowd of irregulars gathered round him watching his preparations garivald wanted nothing to do with them he strode away from what he feared would be the scene of a disasterand almost bowled over obilot who was coming up to see what sadoc was up to dont you want him to knock down the beast obilot asked if i thought he could i would garivald said since i dont he started to snarl something then bit it back do you think he can obilot pondered then shook her head no hes not much of a mage is he oh good garivald exclaimed heres another question for you if he tries to bring down the dragon and doesnt manage it do you want to be anywhere close by obilot considered that too but then she shrugged probably wont matter much if he botches the job this whole stretch of forest will catch it that bit of common sense made garivald stop and think he had to nod all right shall we see what happens sadoc had started a fire from the embers of one of the mornings cookfires he was throwing powders of one sort or another onto it and incanting furiously while he did each new powder made the flames flare a different coloryellow green red blueand send up a new noxious cloud of smoke if the algarvian dragonflier hadnt spotted the irregulars campsite he would in short order sure enough the circles the dragon was making in the sky suddenly stopped being lazy they grew smaller more purposeful how long before he starts talking to his pals with his crystal garivald murmured to obilot with a little luck sadoc will bring him down before he can do that obilot checked herself with a lot of luck she also spoke quietly they mightthey didboth doubt sadocs ability but they didnt want him to hear any words of ill omen while trying to work magic that would benefit them if he could bring it off he was giving it everything he had garivald couldnt deny that he pointed toward the dragon and cried out what sounded like a curse in a voice so loud garivald thought the algarvian on the beast could have heard it at the word of command the smoke from the fire started to form into a long narrow column aimed up toward the dragon awe trickled through garivaldmaybe sadoc really could do what he claimed after all but then instead of rising through the branches of the trees and enveloping the dragon the column of smoke fell apart as if a mischievous small boy had blown on it sadoc cried out again this time in fury garivald and obilot and the other irregulars cried out too in disgust the smoke stank of rotten eggs and latrines and longdead corpses and puke and sour milk and rancid butter and every other dreadful smell garivald had ever know it filled the camp with its horrible stench it filled garivalds nose too his stomach lurched an instant later he was down on his knees heaving his guts out obilot crouched beside him every bit as sick as he was you were right she wheezed between spasms we should have tried to get away who knowsif itwould have helped garivald answered tears streamed down his face they werent the only irregulars bent over and heaving hardly anyone stayed on his feet munderic kept trying to curse sadoc then interrupting himself to vomit again and sadoc kept puking in the middle of his explanations see if i ever trust you again munderic shouted before doubling up once more garivald tried to say i told you so but he kept on puking too and no more than a quarter of an hour after the sorcery went awry just when most of the irregulars could stand on their own two feet again eggs started falling from the sky they were centered on the fire with which sadoc had thought to assail the algarvian dragon men and women stumbled into the woods some of them still vomiting garivald found a hole in the ground by falling into it he lay there having no strength to look for better shelter screams rose from irregulars even less lucky than he at last the algarvians stopped pounding the encampment maybe they ran out of eggs garivald thought he couldnt think of anything else that would have made them stop he got to his feet obilot was rising from another hole a few feet away they gave each other shaky smiles glad to be alive no more magecraft munderic was screaming at sadoc no more do you hear me garivald couldnt make out what sadoc answered he just wished munderic had done his screaming sooner vanais heart thudded she hadnt known such a blend of fear and hope and excitement since that time in the oak woods when she first decided to give herself to ealstan she glanced over to him you know what to do in case this goes wrong aye he held up the leaf of paper shed given him i recite this and if the powers above are in a kindly mood it cancels the whole spell including whatevers gone awry he looked anything but sure the counterspell would perform as advertised since vanai wasnt sure it would either she said i hope you wont have to worry about it she took a deep breath i begin this time the spell was in kaunian logically she knew that didnt matter mages who worked in forthwegianor algarviancould perform as well as any others but as soon as the first words fell from her lips she felt far more confident than she had when reciting the muddy muddled forthwegian spell in you too can be a mage here in this version shed shaped was what that spell should have said rightness seemed to drip from every word she hadnt changed the passes much nor the contact between the lengtlis of golden and dark brown yarn the trouble had lain in the words shed known as much when she tried the forthwegian version now shed fixed those words or thought she had ill know soon she wanted to look at ealstan to judge by his expression how things were going but she didnt she made herself concentrate on what she was doing she was no great mage she would never make a great mage and knew as much but that was all the more reason to concentrate a great mage might get away with a lackluster bit of sorcery she never would she knew that too transform she said first in the imperativea command to the spelland then in the first person indicativea statement about herself and then she did let her eyes go to ealstan either the spell had worked or it hadnt to her intense relief ealstan still looked like his forthwegian self she hadnt given him the seeming of a kaunian as she had in her last foray into magecraft but what if anything had she done to herself she looked down at her hands they hadnt changed not to her eyes but then they wouldnt have she couldnt see the effects of a transformation spell on herself not even in a mirror ealstans eyes widened something had happened to her but what when he didnt say anything vanai asked well am i still me or do i look like a golden grasshopper he shook his head no not a golden grasshopper he answered as a matter of fact you look just like conberge your sister a forthwegian really vanai sprang out of her chair and threw herself into his lap after she kissed him she leaped up again she wanted to bounce off all the walls at once because the flat would imprison her no more a forthwegian im free hang on ealstan did his best to sound resolutely sensible youre not going out into eoforwic just yet vanai put her hands on her hips and why not she did her best to sound dangerous ive been cooped up here the past year and a half if you think im going to wait one instant longer than i have to youd better think again she glared at him as fiercely as she could instead of intimidating him the glare made him laugh now you look the way conberge does when shes mad at me but i dont care whether youre mad at me or not im not going to let you go out that door till we find out how long the spell lasts wouldnt do for you to get your own face back in front of a couple of redheaded constables would it as much as she wanted to stay angry at him vanai discovered she couldnt he was sensible and hed just proved it all right she said i dont suppose i can quarrel with that and i dont supposeshe sighed another little while in here will matter too much but ohi want to get out so much i believe it ealstan said how long do you think the spell will last she could only shrug i have no idea ive never done this beforeexcept when i turned you into a kaunian that one time i mean it might be half an hour it might be three days or even a week all right ealstan nodded well find out id bet practiced mages can tell right from the beginning how strong a spell theyre making probably but im not a practiced mage im just me vanai was still astonished and delighted the spell had worked at all and delight of one sort made her think of delight of another she gave ealstan a saucy smile remember how you were saying it would be like having a different girl if we made love while i looked like a forthwegian well now you can he usually leaped at any chance to take her to the bedchamber to her surprise he hesitated now i hadnt expected youd look quite so much like my sister he said his face reddening beneath his swarthy skin vanai blushed too and wondered if it showed she said what i look like doesnt matter her whole life and most of forthwegs history gave that the lie but she went on im not your sister im just me like i said before she stepped forward into his arms do i feel like a forthwegian too he hugged her his face was the picture of confusion he said when i see you you feel the way you would if you were a forthwegianwere made a little wider than kaunians after all but when i close my eyeshe didyou feel the way you used to thats funny isnt it if i were a better mage i bet id feel right all the time vanai tugged at him come on lets see how i feel in bed she could hardly believe shed said anything so brazen major spinello would have laughed and cheered to hear her she hoped the unkerlanters had long since made spinello incapable of laughing cheering or hearing ever again this is very strange ealstan muttered when she took off her clothes he ran his hand through the tuft of hair at the joining of her legs then before she could stop him he plucked out a hair she yelped ow that hurt it looks blond now ealstan said holding it up it didnt before you cant go to a hairdresser or youll give yourself away pay attention to what youre supposed to be doing if you please vanai said tartly ealstan did with results satisfying to both of them when they went to bed that evening vanai still looked like a forthwegian when they woke in the morning ealstan said youre a blonde again i like you fine either way do you vanai seldom felt interested early in the morning but this proved an exception how do you propose to prove that he found the way shed hoped he would afterwards he went off to cast accounts vanai used the spell again it looked to be good for several hours anyhow she started to put on trousers and short tunic then stopped feeling like a fool that wasnt what forthwegian women wore ealstan had bought her one long baggy forthwegianstyle garment she drew it down over her head thinking ill have to ask him to buy me some more clothes then she stopped again feeling even more foolish if she could go out and about in eoforwic she could buy clothes for herself why hadnt that occurred to her sooner because ive been locked away from everything for so long thats why the answer formed itself as fast as the question had because im not used to doing things for myself any more high time i start again she was so nervous she almost tripped going down the stairs what if shed done something wrong this time shed betray herself the instant she walked out the door of her block of flats i should have had ealstan tell me everything was all right but she couldnt stand going back up to the flat defiantly she threw open the door and walked down the stone steps to the sidewalk no cries of cursed kaunian rose from any of the people walking up and down the street no one paid any attention to her at all hers had to be the most unnoticed defiance in the history of forthweg vanai walked along staring in wonder at buildings and pigeons and wagons and all the other things shed had little chance to see close up lately seeing people who werent ealstan up close felt strange too and seeing forthwegians who didnt react to her kaunianity at all felt stranger than anything as far as they could tell she wasnt a kaunian two algarvian constables came round a corner and headed straight toward her she wanted to flee she couldnt that would give the game away she knew it and made herself keep walking toward them hello sweetheart one of the redheads chirped in accented forthwegian vanai stuck her nose in the air both constables laughed vanai kept walking they didnt bother her any more as they surely would have bothered a kaunian woman even before kaunians were forced into their own tiny districts and theyd told her she was at least passably pretty as a forthwegian she liked that she didnt stay out long not on her first foray into eoforwic she still wasnt sure how long she could rely on the spelland leaving the flat and going through the city threatened to overwhelm her at first she felt a pang of regret at returning to confinement but it didnt last long i can go out again she thought looking at the words of the spell shed adapted from the useless version in you too can be a mage then she looked at the paper again this time in a different way her eyes went big and round shed adapted the spell thinking of herself no one else that was selfish but selfishness had its place too without it she wouldnt have started trying to fix the spell at all since she had she found another leaf of paper and copied the spell onto it she also wrote out instructions for the passes to make for using the lengths of yarn and on what she knew about how long the spell could disguise a kaunian when ealstan got home that evening she told him what shed done and what she had in mind doing he thought it over then said that would be wonderfulif you can find a safe way to do it i have one vanai said ihope i have one but she wouldnt let ealstan hear anything but confidence in her voice he raised an eyebrow even so vanai nodded emphatically are you sure he asked she nodded again he studied her then nodded himself all right may it do some good by the powers above vanai cast the spell again the next morning and cloaked in her sorcerous disguise went to the apothecarys shop where shed bought medicines when ealstan was so sick the forthwegian behind the counter had given her what she needed even though she was a kaunian now she handed him the spell and the commentary shed written and asked can you get this into the kaunian quarter depends on what it is the apothecary answered and began to read halfway through his head came up sharply and he stared at her she looked back he couldnt have known her face did he recognize her voice hed heard it only once he finished reading then folded the paper in half ill take care of it he promised in perfect classical kaunian good vanai said and left another pair of algarvian constables leered at her as she headed back to the flat because she looked like a forthwegian they did nothing but leer if a lot of kaunians suddenly started looking like forthwegians vanai walked on a wide joyous smile on her face she didnt think she could have hurt the redheads more if shed grabbed a stick and started blazing at them fourteen leudast crouched in the ruins of the great ironworks near sulingens port on the wolter he and his countrymen held only the eastern part of the ironworks now the algarvians had finally managed to gain a lodgment inside the building one forge one anvil at a time they were clearing the unkerlanters from it what do we do sergeant one of his troopers called to him hang on as long as we can leudast answered make the redheads pay as high a price as we can for getting rid of us he coughed the air was full of smoke it was also full of the twin stenches of burnt and rotting flesh when he looked up he could see the sky almost unhindered by roof beams eggs dropped by dragons and lobbed from tossers had left only a few bits of ceiling intact he wondered why they hadnt fallen in too he sprawled behind a forge chunks of chain mail still lay on the anvil nearby the unkerlanter smith had kept working as long as he could dark stains on the floor argued that hed kept working too long for his own good ever so cautiously leudast peered westward over the top of the forge he didnt see anything moving in the eyeblink of time before he ducked back down again the algarvians were every bit as careful hereabouts as were his own countrymen fighting in a place like this even the most wary soldiers died in droves the ones who werent wary died even faster leudast someone called from behind him aye captain hawart leudast didnt turn his head watching what was in front and to either side of him mattered if he looked to the rear bad things were liable to happen before he could look back im coming up hawart said leudast blazed a couple of times almost at random to let the officer scramble up beside him in back of the solid brickwork of the forge what now sir leudast asked once again the regiment hawart was commanding had shrunk to a companys worth of men while leudasts nominal company was only a little bigger than the usual squad theyd been brought up to strength since falling back into sulingenbeen brought up to strength and then seen that strength melt away like snowdrifts when the warm north winds started to blow were going to let them have this building sergeant hawart answered holding on to even a piece of it is just costing us too dear but what about the piers sir leudast asked in no small alarm how are we going to get more men up into sulingen if we lose the ironworks here we cant hold the piers and if we cant hold the piers he shuddered if we hadnt been able to bring in those three brigades a few nights ago we would have lost the city by now hawart nodded i know all that believe me i do by now weve lost most of the men in those brigades instead a lot of them went in here and you know whats happened to this place and the rest or most of the rest went into the granary and the algarvians hold it or whats left of it those brigades probably saved sulingen but they wrecked themselves doing it wrecked plenty of algarvians too by the powers above leudast said savagely captain hawart nodded again leudast repeated the question the officer hadnt answered before if we give up the ironworks if weve lost the granary if we lose the piers toohow do we bring in reinforcements theyve run up more piers farther east in the districts we do control hawart said well have to hang on to those but we cant hold these any more some prices are too high to pay as if to underscore that the algarvians started tossing eggs into the ironworks from the west leudast and hawart huddled side by side fragments of the eggs shells hissed through the air with malignant whines so did bricks and boards and chunks of iron hurled by the blasts of sorcerous energy here and there wounded unkerlanters shrieked here and there wounded algarvians shrieked too the fighting was at quarters too close for either side to toss eggs without hurting some of its own soldiers that didnt stop the redheads and it didnt stop the unkerlanters either even while the eggs were still falling leudast and hawart looked around opposite ends of the forge sure enough the algarvians were moving forward taking their chances on being hurt by their own side while the unkerlanters had to keep their heads down the redheads were brave leudast had seen as much many times they were also clever hed seen that too this time they were too clever for their own good he blazed down three of them one after another got you you son of a whore hawart exclaimed which argued his luck was also good leudast blazed again an algarvian screamed leudast nodded well pleased with himself but his pleasure evaporated when hawart started shouting orders for the withdrawal from the ironworks the unkerlanters knew how to conduct retreats wed better leudast thought bitterly weve had enough practice they did it by odd and even numbers the same way they conducted advances half stayed behind and blazed while the rest slipped away to new positions then the first group fell back past the second while the second covered their withdrawal the redheads could move forward only slowly and cautiously were clear leudast said when he left the ruins of the iron manufactory and came out into the ruins of the rest of sulingen he stayed in the open not an instant longer than he had to but dove into the first hole in the ground he saw most of his countrymen did the same thing one trooper though crumpled and fell to the ground stick slipping from hands that could hold it no more there was a neat hole in the side of his head just above and in front of his left ear cursed sniper cried one of the unkerlanters hiding in the wreckage of what had been a block of ironworkers cottages that whoreson hides like a viper and hes got eyes like an eagle hes picked off a couple of dozen of us maybe more the past few weeks bugger him leudast said bugger him with a straight razor no matter how fiercely he spoke though he made sure he didnt expose any part of his person to the algarvian sniper we ought to bring in a sniper of our own and get rid of him captain hawart said i hate snipers theirs and ours too leudast said they arent going to change the way the battle goes all theyre good for is blazing some poor fool whos squatting somewhere taking a dump powers below eat the lot of them powers below eat the algarvians hawart answered can you see the granary without getting killed doing it i think so leudast wriggled around in his hole sure enough he could make out the top of the tall strong brick buildingand the algarvian banner lazily flapping above it leudast cursed before long those red green and white stripes would be flying above the ruins of the ironworks too he trained his stick on the battered manufactory ready to punish the first of mezentios men who pursued the retreating unkerlanters but the algarvians proved too battlewise for that instead of charging straight into the meat grinder they used their eggtossers again to make the unkerlanters stay down and their footsoldiers came at the unkerlanter defenders not straight out of the manufactory but in a pincer movement from north and south of it some of the redheads yelled mezentio and algarve others cried sibiu leudast had seen that the enemy soldier soldiers who raised that shout were uncommonly ferocious if they got in among his comrades bad things happened he turned to blaze at themand never saw the algarvian who blazed him the beam went straight through his left calf he did what hed seen and heard so many other soldiers dohe screamed in pain and clutched at himself everything else forgotten a moment later one of his comrades blazed the redhead who also screamed leudast heard him but only distantly his hurt filled the world he tried to put weight on the wounded leg and found he couldnt when he looked down he saw two neat holes in his calf each about as thick as his middle finger some stick wounds were selfcauterizing not this one blood ran down his leg from each hole and began to pool in his boot he fumbled for the length of bandage he carried in a pouch on his belt his fingers didnt want to obey him he found he did better when he didnt look at his leg even after so much horror on so many battlefields the sight of his own blood left him queasy somebody shouted the sergeants been blazed can you move sergeant somebody else asked i can crawl leudast answered he gulped that white bandage was turning red fast and binding up the wound didnt make the pain go away if anything he hurt worse than ever he tasted blood in his mouth too he must have bitten down on the inside of his lip or cheek without even noticing here sergeant ill get you away that was aldrian stooping beside him can you get your arm over my shoulder leudast wasnt sure he could when he tried he managed go on one leg if you can sergeant the youngster told him leudast tried he wasnt sure whether his awkward hops did more good than harm but aldrian didnt complain so he kept hopping they hadnt got more than a couple of furlongs from the actual fighting line before a grimfaced inspector popped out of a hole in the ground and aimed his stick at both of them show blood he said curtly he looked ready even eager to blaze if neither of them could show a wound hed kill them both for cowards but leudast used his free hand to point to the bloody bandage on his leg with a grudging nod the inspector gestured with his stick waving the two soldiers on eggs fell around them moments later aldrian tried to hold leudast up as they both dove for cover but leudast banged his calf anyhow fresh fire ran through it he howled like a lovesick hound he could no more have kept himself from howling than he could have kept his heart from beating after a journey that seemed endless but was surely less than a mile they came to one of the gullies than ran down toward the wolter fresh troops were coming up out of the gully and heading for the battle line other menphysicians orderliestook charge of leudast from aldrian how bad is it one of them asked him he glared at the fellow i died last week he snapped that startled a laugh out of the orderly who gave the wound a quick examination and delivered his verdict they can patch you up well get you down to the river then sneak you over tonight i expect youll be back at it had the orderly judged leudast wouldnt be back at it soon he got the feeling they would have cut his throat so they wouldnt have to bother with him as things were they got him through the gully moving against the stream of men coming up from the river algarvian dragons dropped eggs on the gully while they were in it most burst to either side but a couple gave the redheads gruesome successes overhanging cliffs hid the spot where the orderlies laid leudast from algarvian attention he had plenty of wounded soldiers for company youll go over tonight one of the orderlies repeated somewhat to his own surprise he did as the boat carried him south across the wolter he realized it was the first time since the war with algarve began that hed been taken away from the fighting not toward it that was almost worth getting wounded for almostthe pain in his leg said nothing could really be worth it traku gave talsu a severe look hold still curse it the tailor told his son if you were a wee bit smallerjust a wee bit mind youid box your ears but good how can i measure you for your wedding suit if you keep fidgeting like youve got a flock of fleas in your drawers im sorry talsu answered more or less sincerely werent you nervous before you married mother oh maybe a little traku said aye maybe just a little i expect thats why your grandfather said hed box my ears for me if i didnt hold still talsus eyes went to the bolt of dark blue velvet that lay on the counter seems a shame to put so much effort and so much money into an outfit i wont wear much he said powers above i hope you dont want to be the kind of fellow who puts on a wedding suit five or six times over the course of his life and each one with a different girl traku said some of our nobles are like thatreach out and grab for anything that looks good to them algarvians are like that too except most of the time they dont even bother getting married from what ive heard by their own faithlessness they condemn themselves talsu said one of the classical kaunian sentences hed studied the week before his father raised an inquiring eyebrow he translated the sentence into modern jelgavan sounds fancier in the old language i will say traku observed i think thats what the old language is mostly good forsounding fancy i mean he turned brisk again youll wear your outer tunic unbuttoned of course and youll want a fine pleated shirtfront right youll work yourself ragged father talsu protested traku had refused to let him help prepare his wedding outfit in any way and traku shook his head now no i wont ill use the spells that algarvian military mage gave us thatll cut the work in half maybe more all by itself that fellow might have been a redheaded son of a whore but he knew what he was talking about cant argue that i wish we could said talsu who wanted as little to do with the occupiers of skrunda as he could arrange he changed the subject do you know what gailisa will be wearing havent the faintest idea her father answered at once i didnt get her business because youdve found out before the day was done if i did whatever it turns out to be i expect itll be pretty on account of your sweetheartll be in it itd be prettier if you made it talsu said everybody knows youre the best in skrunda even the algarvians knew that much but talsu wanted to think about the occupiers as little as he could too his father said i thank you kindly that i do but gailisa will look just fine and you know it traku turned his head so he could glance up the stairs he evidently decided neither ausra nor laitsina was within earshot for he lowered his voice and added besides you know what a brides proper outfit on her wedding day is aye talsu said and hoped he didnt sound too eager along with talsus outfit traku was also working on his ownof somber black relieved by a white pleated shirtfront to be worn under an unbuttoned outer tunic like his sonsand his wifes and daughters laitsina had chosen pale peach linen while ausra would wear blue velvet like talsus though her tunic would flare at the hips and be buttoned buttoned snugly to show off her bust traku turned down work to get all the wedding clothes ready for the day he irked an algarvian captain till the redhead found out why he couldnt get a uniform tunic ready in a hurry ah a wedding the algarvian said kissing his bunched fingertips i am having in every town where i am stationed a wedding this is making pretty girls happy is making me happy too he leered neither talsu nor traku said anything to that it sounded like the sort of thing one of mezentios men would domaybe even worse than no weddings at all the algarvian bowed to each of them in turn and left the shop whistling one of the intricate ornate tunes that delighted his countrymen and baffled talsu and every other jelgavan he knew if music didnt have a strong thumping beat what good was it the hall where talsu and gailisa married was also the one in which before the derlavaian war veterans of the six years war had been wont to get together and drink and tell one another lies about what heroes theyd been flowers and olive and almond and walnut boughs and crepepaper streamers made it look a lot more cheerful than it had when the veterans congregated there even so talsu smelled or imagined he smelled the citrusflavored wine the veterans had swilled down by the pitcherful maybe it was only the flowers he noticed his father sniffing too though when he came into the hall one of his cousins called to him say did you invite the redhead who stabbed you hadnt been for him there probably wouldnt be a wedding now that held some truthjust how much talsu didnt know and by the nature of things would never be able to find out his mother and sister bristled at the suggestion if they hadnt he might have as things were he could laugh and shake his head and send his cousin a rude gesture that made his cousin laugh too up at the head of the hall an assistant to the burgomaster of skrunda stood waiting dressed in colorful baggy tunic and trousers from the days between the overthrow of the kaunian empire and the rise of the kingdom of jelgava for a few hundred years skrunda like most of the towns of the jelgavan peninsula had been a power in its own right the tradition lingered in ceremony though nowhere else traku murmured im glad the algarvians dont send their officials to do weddings and such so am i talsu answered i wouldnt really feel married if a redhead said the words over gailisa and me well come on traku took him by the elbow weve got to be waiting up there when your bride approachesif she approaches he grinned at talsu shes got the right to call the whole thing off you know so she does talsu refused to let his father rattle him any more than he was already instead he teased back and youd be stuck with the bills for the feast oh id probably have a thing or two to say to her father about that traku said step lively now son weve got people to impress talsu didnt know whether he stepped lively or not he imagined himself on parade in dress uniform and marched as impressively as he could the men in the audience whod been in the armymost of them odds werewould surely recognize what he was doing but nobody laughed at him which was all that mattered in his eyes a lot of them had probably gone up to wait for their brides at exactly the same slow march tempo after bowing to the burgomasters assistant talsu did a neat aboutturn and stood waiting for gailisa every once in a while a bride didnt come up and pledge herself with a prospective groom people gossiped about scandals like those for months often jilted grooms had to move away talsu was sure no such thing would happen here he was sure but he couldnt help letting out a small sigh of relief when escorted by her doughy father gailisa walked toward him in tunic and trousers of grassgreen linen that made her golden hair shine like the sun he also couldnt help glancing toward the cousin whod given him a hard time and who at the moment looked consumed with jealousy that was exactly what talsu wanted to see when gailisa came before the burgomasters assistant she bowed as talsu had done then she turned to her bridegroom she and talsu bowed to each other then she bowed to traku while talsu bowed to her father who went very red returning the courtesy we are gathered here today to celebrate in public what has been agreed upon in private the wedding of talsu and gailisa the burgomasters assistant intoned for all the excitement he showed he might have been made of clockwork talsu wondered how many times hed said these words for the town must recognize this union to make it true and binding and the town is pleased to do so confident that the two of you will live many happy years together and bring up many children who will be a delight to skrunda and an asset to the kingdom of jelgava what kingdom of jelgava talsu wondered mainardos kingdom under the thumb of the algarvians who set mezentios brother on the throne the words that solemnized the wedding neither asked nor answered any such awkward questions that was probably just as well by the power vested in me as representative of the independent community of skrunda i have the authority to make this wedding both true and legal so long as that be the wish of those entering into it the burgomasters assistant said the independent community of skrunda had been a joke before the war with algarvian occupation it was a worse joke and a sadder one now somehow that didnt matter is it your wish separately and conjointly the burgomasters assistant asked aye talsu and gailisa said together traku and the burgomasters assistant might have heard them talsu doubted anyone else did but that didnt matter either the burgomasters assistant spoke loud enough for them both it is accomplished everyone in the hall cheered talsu took gailisa in his arms and planted a decorous kiss on her mouth the cheering got louder several people shouted bawdy advice at any other time talsu would have been furious now he grinned at gailisa she smiled back was she waiting as eagerly as he was he hoped so they had a while to wait they ate and drank and danced and accepted money for luck and to set up housekeeping on their own and congratulations all the men in the crowd wanted to kiss gailisa and none of the women seemed to mind if talsu wanted to kiss them he had an enjoyable time indeed the best advice came from his father dont get too drunk boy tonight of all nights you dont want to fall asleep early after the wedding gailisa would move in with talsu for the time being even though his room crowded for one would be desperately small for two but none of that mattered the first night either theyd rented a room in a hostel not far from the hall as they went into the hostel some of the wedding guests gathered outside calling out more lewd suggestions inside the room waited a jar of wine and two glasses talsu opened the jar and poured the glasses full he gave one to gailisa and raised the other high to my wife he said and drank to my husband she drank too not very much later her fingers were exploring the scars on his flank i didnt realize it was this bad she whispered the healers left some of that they opened me up while i was slowed down so they could patch up what the cursed algarvian did talsu said his fingers wandered and explored too and liked everything they found he laughed the redhead didnt hurt anything really important gailisa lay back he soon showed her he was right sweat ran down hajjajs face as he bowed low before king shazli the autumnal equinox had come and gone but that was a small thing in bishah as indeed it was in most of zuwayza the northern kingdoms capital often had its hottest days in early fall and this year looked to be no exception not even the thick clay walls of shazlis palace could hold all the heat at bay what is your judgment your excellency shazli asked will our allies strike south over the wolter and carry all before them just in getting to the wolter your majesty they have carried all before them hajjaj replied the algarvians are a bold and formidable people anyone who thinks otherwise does so at his peril they have come a long long way from their own borderwell from the yaninan borderto sulingen on the wolter but they havent come far enough not if theyve come to sulingen shazli replied what they want what they need lies on the far side of the river can they get it hajjaj bowed again shazli had found the right question to ask which was certainly the beginning of wisdom if they are going to do it in this campaigning season they had better do it soon the zuwayzi foreign minister said ive seen cottbus in the wintertime sulingen is a long way south of cottbus i wouldnt care to try a winter campaign in those parts not against the unkerlanters what happens if they fail again shazli found the right question the less cinnabar they have the less good their dragons do them hajjaj said they made their own disaster down in the land of the ice people if the unkerlanters make one for them in sulingen he shrugged his scrawny naked shoulders the war gets harder for them which also means the war gets harder for us king shazli said and hajjaj could only incline his head in agreement the king said and what do we do under these circumstances your excellency hajjaj spread his hands if you have a better answer than the ones ive found your majesty i beg you not to be shy with it believe me as things are now i am looking for any answers i can find shazli said waiting and seeing playing unkerlant and algarve off against each other what else can we do i see no other choice hajjaj said unkerlant has raised this false reformed principality against us and if we cast ourselves altogether into algarves arms if we expel the kaunian refugees and do everything we can to help mezentios men finally seize the port of glogau shazli made a sour face i am not going to expel the refugees he declared and hajjaj had all he could do to keep from clapping his hands the king went on with the algarvians fighting so hard down in the south could they take glogau now even with our help you would do better asking general ikhshid than me hajjaj replied perhaps i shall the king said but i also want your opinion you are not a warrior but you may well know more about the workings of the world than any other man alive if that be so the world is in worse shape than even i imagined hajjaj said on the whole sincerely his sovereign raised an eyebrow waiting for him to continue after a moments thought he did in my unprofessional opinion the algarvians have put their whole striking force in the south if they win there and have anything left after the victory we may see them moving again here in the north come spring i doubt very much they can do anything before then whatever we end up doing then we need not decide at once king shazli said and hajjaj nodded shazli smiled good aye hajjaj said we have fought unkerlant and we have also fought algarve fought to stay cobelligerents and at least somewhat masters of our own fate and not helpless catspaws like the yaninans at this stage of things can you imagine king tsavellas refusing mezentio anything shazlis arched nostrils flared his lip curled in scorn if mezentio told tsavellas to send his virgin daughter to a soldiers brothel tsavellas would do it i do not want zuwayza so beholden to algarve geography makes that less likely for us than for the yaninans but i see what you are saying your majesty and i agree hajjaj said geography makes us worry about unkerlant worse luck we are free of king swemmel shazli said if this war ends with us free of swemmel and of mezentio both we shall not have done too badly whatever else happens i know you will continue working toward that end with all my heart hajjaj said and rose to his feet he recognized a dismissal when he heard one shazli nodded hajjaj bowed and left the royal presence he hadnt taken more than half a dozen paces out of the kings audience chamber before a steward sidled up to him and asked and what is his majestys will your excellency i am sure he will make it known to you at the time he deems proper hajjaj replied the stewards face fell he hadnt looked to be so smoothly rebuffed hajjaj smiled but only on the inside where it didnt show hed been fending off inquisitive courtiers for as long as the steward had been alive when the zuwayzi foreign minister returned to his own office his secretary asked anything new your excellency now hajjaj did smile for the whole world or at least for qutuz to see not very much he said we go on and we do the best we can as one day follows another what else is there with a saucy grin qutuz set those last two sentences to the tune of a traditional zuwayzi song about a camel herder longing for the lover he could not visit and may we have better fortune than he did the secretary finished that would be good hajjaj agreed you are of course every bit as much a wandering son of the desert as i am relatively few zuwayzin were nomads these days more lived in bishah and other urban centers and lived lives more like those of other settled derlavaians than those of their wandering ancestors qutuz understood that too oh indeed your excellency i spend my every free moment riding my camel from one waterhole to the next since your moments here are not free hajjaj said pray be so good as to find out whether general ikhshid is at liberty to see me for a few minutes either here or in his own office just as you say your excellency so it shall be qutuzs flowery language might have come straight from the desert too hajjaj bent over and rubbed his backside as if hed been riding a camel much too long laughing qutuz activated his crystal and spoke with one of general ikhshids aides he turned to hajjaj the general says that if you dont mind going over there he can see you directly i dont mind hajjaj said were old men ikhshid and i he wouldnt make me walk without good cause soldiers bustled in and out of ikhshids headquarters which was certainly a busierlooking place than the foreign ministry the stocky grizzled general bowed hajjaj into his own office and closed the door behind them sit make yourself comfortable he said and waited till hajjaj had arranged a mound of pillows on the floor then with military abruptness ikhshid came to the point well your excellency what wont you talk about over the crystal now you know me well hajjaj said id better after all these years general ikhshid replied and you still havent answered my question i shall never fear hajjaj said his majesty and i were discussing the algarvians chances of taking glogau either with or without our aid were you ikhshids eyebrows rose and what were your views on the subject hajjaj did his wellhoned best to keep his face from showing anything he said i would sooner have your unvarnished opinion if you please ikhshids grunt might have been laughter or anger afraid ill turn weathervane on you maybe you dont know me as well as you think hajjaj shrugged and held his face still after a wordless grumble ikhshid said they cant do it this campaigning season thats certain sure theyve stripped the north and center bare as a zuwayzi to free up dragons and behemoths and eggtossers for the push to the mamming hills theyve made unkerlant do the same too hajjaj pointed out i dont deny it ikhshid said but the unkerlanters are just trying to hold on in glogau they arent trying to break out you dont need as much to hang on because the country fights with you if you know what i mean all right hajjaj said more than a little relieved to find ikhshids judgment confirming his own another question will the algarvians take sulingen theyve already taken it or taken most of it anyhow ikhshid answered thats not what you want to ask what you want to ask is will they have anything left to throw across the wolter once theyve finished clearing the town and will swemmels men have anything left to throw at em while theyre trying to do it he waited hajjaj obediently asked him those two questions ikhshid gave him a wry grin your excellency i havent the faintest idea if we knew ahead of time how a war was going to turn out we usually wouldnt have to fight it i thank you hajjaj inclined his head to the general truly you are a font of wisdom ikhshid waggled a forefinger at him youre so cursed smart all the time hajjajdid you know who would win when the redheads took on valmiera they tried going east in the last war too and it bloody well didnt work the valmierans didnt think it would work this time either turned out they were wrong so it did after some thought hajjaj nodded again very well i take your point since we cannot know what happens till it happens we had best be as ready as we can for all the possibilities there you are now general ikhshid beamed at him i always knew you were a smart fellow your excellency and you do keep proving it do i hajjaj scratched his head easy enough to see what wants doing how to do it that is a very different question general youll find a way ikhshid said i dont know what it is yet and you dont either but you will and zuwayza will be better off with you as foreign minister than we would be without you hajjaj considered that without false modesty he decided ikhshid was likely to be right he gave the general a seated bow you pay me a great compliment youre likely to earn it ikhshid opened one of his desk drawers like hajjajs his desk stood low to the ground so he could work at it while sitting on the floor from the drawer he took a squat jar of forthwegian apricot brandy and a couple of earthenware cups he poured them both full then handed hajjaj one and now your excellency what shall we drink to this time hajjaj replied at once to survival ikhshid nodded and raised his cup in salute they both knocked back the potent spirits when ikhshid offered the jar again hajjaj did not say no ealstan and vanai walked hand in hand through the streets of eoforwic he was still bemused whenever he glanced toward her with her sorcerous disguise she could have been his sister newcome from gromheort but that she looked like conberge was in the eyes of the world a small thing that she looked like a forthwegian any forthwegian mattered far more in her free hand vanai was carrying a wickerwork basket she held it up and smiled i wonder what sort of mushrooms well find she said me too ealstan also carried a basket were probably out too early though the fall rains have hardly started things will be better in another couple of weeks i dont care vanai said we can go out then too if you want ill never say no to going after mushrooms but i want to get an early start he squeezed her hand shed been trapped inside the flat for most of a year he couldnt blame her for going out at any excuse or none and they werent the only people on the street with baskets in their hands and looks of happy anticipation on their faces in forthweg people thought any chance of getting mushrooms was worth taking theres that park i was telling you about ealstan pointed ahead the grass in the park hadnt been trimmed in a long timeprobably not since the unkerlanters took eoforwic almost certainly not since the algarvians drove the unkerlanters off to the west seeits a good big stretch of ground we might find almost anything in here vanai looked discontented ealstan knew why she did before he could say anything she did it for him i know we cant go out into the countryside things wont last long enough to let us things she wouldnt talk about the spell not in so many words not where other people could hear ealstan had no doubt that was wise a couple of algarvian constables came by just then vanai started to flinch ealstan kept on holding her hand and wouldnt let her he found a way to harass the redheads holding up the basket he smiled and said shall we get some for you the constables understood enough forthwegian to know what he meant they made horrible faces and shook their heads how can they eat those miserable nasty things one of them said to the other in their own language the second constable gave an extravagant algarvian frown ealstan didnt let on that hed understood that was wonderful vanai whispered which made ealstan feel twice as tall as he really was twice as wide through the shoulders and as heavily armored as a behemoth he leaned over and gave her a quick kiss it wasnt at all like kissing conberge we may do as well in the park as we would anywhere else ealstan said we dont know the good hunting spots here the way we did around gromheort and oyngestun maybe vanai didnt sound convinced but then she brightened look theres a little grove of oaks when she smiled that particular smile she didnt really look like conberge either no smile from his sister had ever made ealstans blood heat so with a small sigh vanai went on in the middle of the city it would probably be too crowded i suppose youre right ealstan said and the regret in his voice made vanai laugh when he thought about it he laughed too they could always go back to the flat where they would be sure of privacy and where the bed was far more comfortable than grass and fallen leaves even so looking toward the scrubby trees he had the feeling of a chance wasted well even if we cant find a chance for that here lets see what we can find vanai said she scuffed through the grass head down eyes intent the pose of a mushroom hunter on the prowl ealstan had the same posture so did a good many other people going through the park by ones and twos and in small groups theyre all forthwegians ealstan realized every year before this hed noticed occasional blond heads among the dark ones kaunians in forthweg loved mushrooms as much as forthwegians did but now the kaunians in eoforwic remained shut up in the district into which the algarvians had forced them they were easier to round up that way whenever the redheads needed to steal some life energy to power their sorceries aimed at the unkerlanters vanai stooped almost as if she were pouncing and came up with a couple of mushrooms meadow mushrooms ealstan askedalmost as common as grass they were better than no mushrooms but that was all hed say for them vanai shook her head and held up the basket so he could get a better look oh he said horse mushrooms they were near kin to meadow mushrooms but tastier with a flavor that put him in mind of crushed anise seeds ill sauté them in olive oil tonight vanai said and ealstan smiled in anticipation someone else not too far away bent and tossed mushrooms into his basket as vanai had tossed the horse mushrooms into hers nodding toward the man she murmured he could be a kaunian you know the fellow didnt look like a kaunian he looked like a forthwegian about halfway between ealstans age and his fathers but further down on his luck than theyd ever been but vanai was right quietly ealstan said you did something wonderful when you passed that on through the apothecary he wouldnt mention the spell where anyone else might hear either i hope i did vanai answered i cant know not for certain maybe he didnt do what he said he would but oh i hope perhaps buoyed by that hope they did wander into the oak grove ealstan kissed vanai there but that was all he found some oyster mushrooms on the trunk of an oak and cut them off with the little knife he wore on his belt kicking at the trees gnarled roots he said there might be truffles growing down there aye and there might be a hundred goldpieces buried there too vanai said do you think its worthwhile digging no he admitted but if there were some big truffles along that root theyd be worth a lot more than a hundred goldpieces when they came out on the far side of the oak grove they walked toward a marble equestrian statue twice life size of a warrior king facing west toward unkerlant thats plegmund isnt it vanai asked no one else ealstans mouth tightened his opinion of the great forthwegian ruler had plummeted when the algarvians named their puppet brigade after him and then again when sidroc joined it there should be a plaque on the base telling what a hero he was but there was no patinated bronze plaque only an unweathered rectangle on the stone to show where one had been and a couple of stone bases that had supported bronzes now stood alone supporting nothing vanai figured out why before ealstan did the algarvians must have taken the metal to use it in their weapons she said miserable thieves ealstan growled after three years of war he hadnt imagined mezentios men could give him new reasons to despise them but theyd done it and then from beyond the statue of king plegmund someone called his name he jumped a little few people in eoforwic knew him well enough to recognize him but there was ethelhelm coming out of a group of mushroom hunters a couple of them started to come with him but he waved them back hello he said with a broad friendly smile and clasped ealstans hand his gaze swung toward vanai and whos your pretty friend his voice had an edge to it what that edge meant was so youve dumped your kaunian lady and found yourself a nice safe forthwegian girl eh youd better not sneer at me anymore for cozying up to the algarvians then this is thelberge ealstan answered the first forthwegian name that popped into his head he hadnt expected to meet anyone who knew him and he really hadnt expected to meet anyone who knew anything about vanai he wished hed told ethelhelm less since he hadnt he had to make the best of it thelbergehe wondered how vanai would feel about his giving her a namedo you know who this is why no vanai answered maybe she was even telling the truth shed seen ethelhelm only once after all truth or not though she sounded politely curious not frightened and ealstan admired her coolness he also thought he could get away with overacting here striking a pose he said well sweetheart i told you i cast accounts for the famous ethelhelm here he is in the flesh grinning ethelhelm struck a pose too as if about to hunch over his drums vanais eyesbrown now not bluewent wide really she breathed and then started babbling about how much she loved ethelhelms songs ealstan marveled at her performance not least because he knew what she really thought of forthwegian music when she stopped gushing ethelhelm smiled at her and nodded to ealstan i wont keep you he said just wanted to let you know i spied you there and to meet your friend on the last phrase that hard edge returned to his voice ealstan wondered if vanai noticed it had she just been thelberge a sweet bit of fluff she wouldnt have ealstan was sure of that im so pleased to meet you she gushed for all the world as if she were nothing but a bit of fluff good luck with your mushroom hunting ethelhelm chuckled and waved to her as he ambled back toward his friends entourage ealstan wondered whether the band leader knew the difference these days as soon as ethelhelm was out of earshot ealstan said maybe we ought to go back to the flat he wondered if vanai would try to talk him out of it but she didnt aye maybe wed better she said they didnt flee that might have drawn ethelhelms notice but after theyd drifted into the oak grove once more she stopped and looked at ealstan thelberge eh im sorry he said to his relief she shrugged he went on i didnt think anything like that would happen powers above be praised we got away with it vanai nodded they walked on for a few steps then she said he thinks youve got rid of the kaunian girl you used to know ealstan could only nod vanais mouth tightened i dont like what hell think of you on account of that hell think im giving in the same way he is ealstan answered thats what i meant vanai said sharply she took another few strides and shrugged again maybe its for the best now he wont think he has a hold on you because youre with a blonde ealstan had to nod again he hated thinking in those terms but anyone who didnt only endangered himself not long after they left the park he bought a news sheet as much to distract them both from the alarm theyd had as for any other reason the news sheet of course printed what the algarvians wanted the forthwegians to read an address by king mezentio topped the headlines i wanted to reach the wolter and so i have ealstan read aloud were in sulingen because its a vitally important city it has a huge ironworks and its a cinnabar shipping port that was why i wanted to capture it and you know modest as we are weve got it there are only a few more tiny pockets left and well get those too time doesnt matter not a single ship comes up the wolter anymore and thats the main thing is he right now vanai sounded worried ealstan was worried too i hope not he said and wished he hadnt bought the news sheet pekka wished she hadnt had to come up to yliharma for her latest set of experiments but she could hardly have asked siuntio and ilmarinen to come down to kajaani not when they were frail old men and she young and strong and healthy the capital had far better libraries than kajaani city college too and laboratories with fancier sorcerous apparatus the trip made good logical sense she still wished she could have stayed home now elimaki had to watch uto all day long she couldnt give him back to leino in the evening for leino was learning the art of frontline magecraft pekka knew how much she was asking of her sister ihave to find a way to make it up to her she thought not for the first time as her leyline caravan pulled into the depot in the center of yliharma ilmarinen stood waiting on the platform when she got off welcome welcome he said reaching for her carpetbag with any luck at all well blast the whole world to a cinder this timeand then well teach the lagoans how to do it too his smile was wide and bright and full of vitriol would you rather have the algarvians learn first pekka replied her wave encompassed yliharma look what they did with the old magic if the new is what we think it is and if they learn it ilmarinen interrupted her we dont know how close they are we dont know if theyre working on it at all we do know the lagoans will find some way to diddle us if they learn what we know no we dont know that pekka replied in some exasperation weve been down this ley line before and we dont know enough to make the new magic work for us not yet maybe the lagoans will help us find the rest of what we need more likely theyll steal it from us ilmarinen said instead of arguing any more pekka strode past him off the platform and toward the gateways leading out of the depot that made him hurry after her and kept him too busy to complain when he leaped into the street to wave down a cab she smiled sweetly and said thank you very much youd have taken a whole bloody week before you got one ilmarinen saidgrumbling about one thing seemed to suit him as well as grumbling about another he raised his voice to give the hackman an order the principality aye sir the fellow said and flicked the reins to get his horse going workmen on scaffolds and in trenches still labored to repair the damage yliharma had suffered in the sorcerous attack the winter before but there were fewer of them than there had been on her latest visit more and more kuusamans went into the service of the seven princes every day pekka knew that all too well every night she slept alone reminded her of it she slept alone in the principality that night in more luxury than she would have enjoyed back home it failed to delight her she would have traded all of it for leino beside her but knew she would have had to make the trip to yliharma even if her husband had stayed at his kajaani city college post in the morning she ate smoked salmon and rings of red onion on a hard roll in the hotel dining room hot herb tea went well with the delicate fish it also helped fortify her against the chilly drizzle that had started falling during the night as she was eating master siuntio came into the dining room accompanied by a tall redheaded man who used a pair of crutches and one good leg to move himself along the elderly theoretical sorcerer waved to pekka hello my dear he said hurrying toward her table then he switched from kuusaman to classical kaunian mistress i have the honor to introduce to you the firstrank mage fernao of lagoas i am honored to meet you mistress pekka as any firstrank mage would fernao spoke the universal tongue of scholarship well he went on i know several languages but i fear kuusaman is not among them i apologize for my ignorance pekka rose and extended her hand a little awkwardly fernao shifted his crutch to free his own hand and clasp hers he towered over her but his injuries his courteous speech and his narrow slanted eyes made him seem safer than he might have otherwise she said no apologies needed everyone is ignorant of a great many things he inclined his head you are kind i should not be ignorant of the language of a kingdom i am visiting corresponding with you in classical kaunian is well enough but i ought to be able to use your tongue facetoface with a shrug pekka answered i read lagoan well enough but i would not care to try to speak it andshe smiledwhen we corresponded we had little to say no matter how long we took to say it will you both sit down and take breakfast with me another thought occurred to her she asked fernao can you sit down carefully he answered slowly otherwise i end up on the floor without even the pleasure of getting drunk first siuntio pulled out a chair for him he sat exactly as hed said he would too a waiter hurried over the fellow proved to know lagoan which didnt greatly surprise pekkatravelers from many lands stayed at the principality and the hostel staff had to be able to meet their needs siuntio said fernao has already offered several suggestions i think good our experiments will go forward better and faster because he is here he spoke classical kaunian as if he were big and blond and snatched by sorcery from the heyday of the empire pekka was sure he spoke fluent lagoan too but he didnt use it here you are too generous fernao said the waited brought him salmon then and a roll and butter for siuntio the lagoan mage waited till the man had gone then continued you folk here have a two years head start on the rest of the world i hurry along as best i can but i know i am still behind you you have done very well siuntio said even master ilmarinen has told me as much he has not told me as much fernao said after a bite of smoked salmon when he chose to show it he had a wry grin of course i am only a lagoan he ate some more of the salmon and onion you have no idea how much better than roastedhalf charred reallycamel hump that is he was right pekka had never tasted camel and had no great desire to do so in something else hed said though he might well have been wrong we may have a two years start on you pekka told him but are you sure we have a two years start on the algarvians i wish i were fernaos grimace suggested hed taken a bite of camel after all no i am not sure of that he admitted i have seen no algarvian journals dating from since lagoas declared war and mezentios mages may not be publishing any more than you were my belief is that the algarvians are not traveling quickly down this ley line siuntio said not for the first time they have put so much work into their murderous magic i think it occupies most of their mages that makes good sense fernao said but not everything that makes good sense is true i am painfully aware of it siuntio said were i not ilmarinens work would be plenty to prove the point he will be waiting for us at the university i suppose pekka said aye unless hes gone off in a fit of pique siuntio answered pekka bit her lip with ilmarinen that was anything but impossible but siuntio went on i do expect to find him there fernao ate fast as if afraid an algarvian mage might start experimenting while he savored his smoked salmon getting up out of his chair was an even more awkward process than sitting down in it pekka signed the chit for all three breakfasts the seven princes could afford it she and siuntio had to help fernao up into a cab he sighed saying i have not got used to being a burden to everyone around me pekka and siuntio both assured him he was nothing of the sort but he didnt seem inclined to listen he sat glumly for some little while as the cab horse clopped through the streets of yliharma at last he remarked i had heard the algarvians struck you a heavy blow but i had not realized it was as heavy as this it could have happened to setubal too pekka said it nearly did the lagoan mage answered mezentios men had set up a murder camp across the strait of valmiera from our city but we raided it and freed most of the kaunian captives there we keep close watch lest they try again thinking aloud pekka said if they work out the proper spells i wonder if they have to be as physically close as they seem to believe could they not transmit the force of the magic along a ley line she sat squeezed rather tightly between fernao and siuntio both men sent her looks full of consternation fernao said they started using their magecraft in unkerlant where ley lines are few and far between it may well be we have the powers above to thank for that and what do the sacrificed kaunians have for which to thank the powers above siuntio asked fernao looked as if hed bitten down on one of the sour citrus fruits jelgavans used to flavor wine he made no reply when they reached the sorcerous laboratory the algarvian attack had almost destroyed they did find ilmarinen waiting for them he tilted his head back so he could look downor rather uphis nose at fernao come to see how its done have you aye the lagoan mage answered equably after all what else am i but a thief ilmarinen started to come back with something sharp before he could siuntio took him aside and spoke to him in a low voice by the way he suddenly stared at pekka she was able to make a good guess as to what siuntio told him ilmarinen said thats a nasty thought my dear im the one who should have come up with it pekka smiled her most charming smile im sure you would have master ilmarinen if you hadnt been too busy fuming about fernao here theyd all spoken kuusaman but the lagoan mage caught his name what was that he asked pekka translated for him he said you need not defend me mistress i can take care of myself and i have spent some time fuming about master ilmarinen too so he is entitled to fume about me dont tell me what im entitled to ilmarinen snapped like siuntio he could use classical kaunian not just to get ideas across but almost as if it were his birthspeech shall we proceed to the experiment siuntio said in every moment we quarrel among ourselves the algarvians gain oh aye this one will solve everything ilmarinen said well have mezentio hiding under his bed in no time flat maybe we can confirm the actual consequences of the divergent series on the half of the specimens on the negative axis siuntio said you know what they are ilmarinen said you all know what they are you just dont want to admit it even when youve had your noses rubbed in it you dont want to believe it bloody cowards the lot of you i believe it fernao said i want to find out what we can do with it to pekkas surprise ilmarinen beamed well what do you know maybe youre not worthless after all the only thing different fernao had done was agree with him for two sentences contemplating that pekka had all she could to not to laugh out loud aye in many ways ilmarinen and her little son uto were very much alike cornelus leviathan snapped up a squid life of all sorts teemed in the chilly waters of the narrow sea despite his rubber suit despite the magecraft that helped ward him those waters felt unusually chilly today maybe that was his imagination imagination or not the sibian exile wished his lagoan masters had picked a warmer season of the year to send him forth whenever the leviathan surfaced cornelu looked around warily in these waters the algarvian navy and algarvian dragonfliers reigned supreme sailors and men on dragons who served king mezentio might well take him for one of their own he hoped they would but he intended to do his best to disappear if they didnt he was particularly careful when he crossed a ley line whenever his amulet detected the thin stream of sorcerous energy that formed part of the world grid he used it to search for nearby ships he hadnt found one yet but that didnt make him stop looking if he wanted to get back to setubal being careful was a good idea and i do want to get back to setubal he told his leviathan the great beast kept on swimming had it been a man it would have shrugged without a doubt it was happier out in the open ocean but then it wasnt seeing janira when he was in setubal cornelu went back to the eatery where she worked every chance he got hed taken her to a music hall and to the unicorn races hed kissed heronce only now that he was going to be away from her for a long time did he realize how smitten hed become it wasnt just that he could speak his own language and have her understand it wasnt just that he was desperately looking for a woman after costaches betrayal he told himself it wasnt anyhow he hoped it wasnt with a tap he urged the leviathan to stand on its flukes to extend his horizon as it lifted its front endand himout of the water there to the north was the mainland of derlavai he knew the little spit of land that stuck out toward himit lay just west of lungri a coastal town in the duchy of bari after the six years war bari had been split off from algarve and made selfruling but it was algarvian again now its return to algarvian allegiance had touched off the derlavaian war cornelu urged the leviathan farther south he wanted to be sure he gave the headlands of yanina which thrust far out into the narrow sea a wide berth the closer he came to land the closer he was likely to come to trouble he didnt want trouble not on this journey he wasnt hunting downed algarvian dragonfliers or algarvian floating fortresses either he had a delivery to make once he did he could hurry back to setubal as hed hoped he would he got round the yaninan headlands before the sun set in the northwest it stayed above the horizon less every day an effect magnified by the high southerly latitudes in which he found himself farther south down in the land of the ice people it would stop rising at all before long his leviathan slept in catnaps he wished he could do the same but no such luck long journeys on leviathan back often got longer because the beasts went their own way when the men who rode them slept sometimes they carried two riders on long voyages to make sure that didnt happen the lagoans hadnt seen fit to give cornelu a comrade he wondered what that said about the importance of the mission theyd given him even more to the point he wondered what the unkerlanters would think it said about the importance of the mission the lagoans had given him nothing good unless he missed his guess he shrugged he was following the orders hed been given the unkerlanters were and always had been great ones for following orders how could they blame him after he woke the first thing he did was look for the moon it was setting in the west ahead of him casting a silvery streak of radiance across the sea he patted the leviathan have you been swimming this way all the time ive been asleep he asked it i hope you have itll make things easier the leviathan didnt answer it just kept on swimming that was the purpose for which the powers above had shaped it and it admirably fulfilled its purpose not long after the sun rose he had his first anxious moment the leviathan came upon a fishing boat flying the redandwhite banner of yanina it was a sailboat and used no sorcerous energy so cornelu didnt detect it till he saw it his mouth tightened the algarvians sneaky whoresons that they were had invaded sibiu with a great fleet of sailing ships and sneaked into his kingdoms harbors precisely because no one had imagined an assault not based on magecraft but the yaninans even though they didnt use the worlds energy grid proved to have some sorcery aboard their boat as soon as they saw himor more likely saw his leviathanthey ran to an eggtosser at the stern of the fishing boat swung it toward him and let fly it wasnt much of an eggtosser the boat wasnt big enough to carry much of an eggtosser the egg the yaninans lobbed fell far short bursting about halfway between the boat and cornelus leviathan they didnt seem to care they promptly launched another one at him all right he exclaimed i believed you the first time he swung the leviathan on a course that steered well clear of the fishing boat the yaninans couldnt possibly have been worrying about lagoans in these waters maybe they feared he was an unkerlanter but for all they knew he might have been one of their own they hadnt tried to find out theyd just tried to get rid of him and theyd done it too once hed left them behind he laughed they were probably telling themselves what a great bunch of heroes they were by everything the war had shown the yaninans were better at telling themselves they were heroes than at really playing the role early the next morning the leviathan brought cornelu into the unkerlanter port of rysum a leyline patrol boat and a couple of unkerlanter leviathans paced him into the harbor a dragon flew overhead eggs slung under its belly hed told king swemmels men who he was and where hed come from they were supposed to know he was coming considering the war they were fighting with algarve he didnt suppose he could blame them for suspecting him but he thought they were carrying those suspicions further than they had to rysum wasnt much of a port none of unkerlants ports on the narrow sea was much not by the standards prevailing farther east they all iced over several months a year that kept them from matching their counterparts in yanina and algarve which lay more to the north rysum wouldnt stay clear much longer as soon as cornelu climbed a rope ladder up onto the pier by which his leviathan rested a squad of soldiers ran up and aimed sticks at him i am your friend not your enemy he said in classical kaunianhe spoke not a word of unkerlanter anywhere in eastern derlavaieven in algarve which slaughtered kaunians to fuel its sorcerieshe would have found someone who understood the old language not here the unkerlanters squat and dumpy in their long baggy tunics jabbered back and forth in their own guttural tongue he could have spoken to them in algarvian he held back fearing that would get him blazed down on the spot and then an unkerlanter officer spoke algarvian to him do you understand me aye he answered in some relief i am commander cornelu of the sibian navy an exile serving out of setubal in lagoas are you not expecting me why are you all acting like im an egg thats about to burst and fling this place to those hills yonder he pointed north and west toward the low hills that crinkled the horizon there what do you know of the mamming hills the unkerlanter rapped out nothing cornelu said after a moment he remembered the cinnabar mines in those hills but he got the idea that changing his answer would not make the officer glowering at him happy he kept quiet that proved a good idea the unkerlanter said what have you brought us i dont even know what i dont know i couldnt have told mezentios men cornelu said i did hear the kuusamans gave it to the lagoans the lagoans gave it to me and now i am giving it to you the kuusamans you say the unkerlanter officer brightened this time cornelu had managed to say the right thing aye that accords with my briefing we will take it from your leviathan he started giving orders to the soldiers in his own language cornelu didnt know what he was saying but could make a good guess theyll get eaten if they try he warned then we will kill the leviathan and take it anyhow the unkerlanter answered as if it were all the same to himand it probably was it wasnt all the same to cornelu if anything happened to the leviathan hed be stuck in southern unkerlant for the rest of his days comparing exile in setubal to exile in rysum reminded him of the difference between bad and worse wait he exclaimed if you let me ill go down there and get it for you myself you should have brought it up with you the officer said grumpily you might have thought it was an egg and blazed me cornelu said now will you trust me to do what needs doing every line of the unkerlanters body proclaimed that trusting a foreigner especially a foreigner who spoke algarvian and looked like an algarvianwas the last thing he wanted to do but his heavy features clotted with suspicion he gestured toward the rope ladder and said all right go ondo this but do it with great care or i am not liable for what will happen to you next moving slowly and carefully cornelu climbed down the rope ladder his leviathan swam toward him as he dropped into the cold water he took the small pack attached to the leviathans harness it was small aye but it was heavy cornelu had to swim hard to get back to the ladder with it strapped to his back climbing up with the added weight wasnt any fun either but he managed he set the oiledleather pack on the pier move away from it the unkerlanter officer said sharply cornelu obeyed the unkerlanter spoke in his own language again one of the soldiers came up and put the pack on his own broad back while the rest covered him he walked up the pier and onto dry land once the soldier got off the weathered planks the officer relaxed a little he even unbent so far as to ask do you need food for your voyage east when cornelu nodded the officer barked orders another soldier ran off and returned with smoked fish and hard sausagethe sort of fare that wouldnt suffer much from salt water my thanks cornelu said though he already had enough to do well unless the leviathan wandered very badly while he slept he had fresh water and to spare waving in the direction the unkerlanter with the pack had gone he asked the officer do you know whats supposed to be in there of course not the fellow replied it is not for me to know such things it is not for the likes of you to know them either the words werent too bad not coming from a military man the way he said them all at once cornelu felt something hed never imagined he would a small bit of sympathy for the algarvians fighting unkerlant fifteen for the first time since hed been injured fernao forgot the pain of his hurts without distillates of the poppy to help him do it work exciting work proved an anodyne as effective as drugs ever since grandmaster pinhiero gave him that first summary of what the kuusaman mages had done hed burned to take part in their experimental program and now at last here he was in yliharma broken leg healing arm he didnt much care courteously siuntio and ilmarinen and pekka kept speaking mostly classical kaunian among themselves as they set up their rows of rats in cages fernao wished he understood kuusaman to catch what they said in asides in their language like a lot of lagoans he hadnt taken his neighbors to the west seriously enough he also quickly discovered he hadnt taken pekka seriously enough siuntio and ilmarinen being in the same sorcerous laboratory as the two of them was an honor in itself but he didnt take long to notice that they both deferredsiuntio graciously ilmarinen with bluster masking a peculiar mocking sort of prideto the younger theoretical sorcerer she said in this experiment we shall align the cages of the related rats in parallel in the next assuming we live to make the next ilmarinen put in aye pekka nodded assuming now as i was saying in the next experiment we shall align the cages of the related rats in the reverse order to see if reversing them will strengthen the spell by emphasizing the inverse nature of the relationship between the two laws ilmarinen preened hed discovered that the relationship between the laws of similarity and contagion was inverse not direct but he never would have had the insight without the data from pekkas seminalliterally since it had involved acornsexperiment and pekka wasnt bad at coming up with startling insights herself she hadnt done a bad job of quashing ilmarinen there either fernao said i never would have thought of altering the positions of the cages pekka shrugged that is what lies at the heart of experimenting changing every variable you can imagine since we are so ignorant here we need to explore as wide a range of possibilities as we can i never would have reckoned that a variable fernao answered it would not have occurred to me it did not occur to me either siuntio said and i have some small experience in the game we are playing which game ilmarinen asked embarrassing pekka i am not embarrassed pekka said tightly but she was fernao could see as much his own praise had flustered her and siuntios rather more fernao understood that praise from the leading theoretical sorcerer of the age would have flustered him too he said it is always good to see a theoretical sorcerer who does not have to be told what the apparatus in the laboratory is for that flustered pekka too she said i have more luck than anything else in the laboratory i would sooner be back at my desk i truly know what i am doing when i am there she meant it fernao could see that he studied her he didnt usually find kuusaman women interesting next to his own taller more emphatically shaped countrywomen they struck him as boyish as far as her figure went pekka did too but hed never known a lagoan female mage he thought could outdo him he didnt just think pekka could she already had shall we get on with it now she asked her voice sharp or shall we keep playing till the algarvians come up with some new dreadful sorcery and drop yliharma into the strait of valmiera she is right of course siuntio said fernao nodded ilmarinen started to say something all three of the other mages glared at him he held his peace by the startled quality of siuntios smile that didnt happen very often master siuntio master ilmarinen you know what we shall undertake here today pekka said taking the lead as always your task is to support me if i blunderand i may she looked over to fernao had he angered her by calling her a good experimenter some theoretical sorcerers were oddly proud of being inept in the laboratory but he hadnt taken her for one of those she went on our lagoan guest is to aid you as best he can but with the spell being in kuusaman you will have to move first because he may not realize at once that i have gone astray ilmarinen said if we drop yliharma into the strait of valmiera that will be a good clue i do not think we can do that with this experiment pekka said quite she shifted to kuusaman for several rhythmic sentences fernao couldnt have claimed to understand them but he knew what they were the kuusaman claim to be the oldest most enduring folk in the world he thought that claim nonsense almost on the order of the ice peoples belief in gods but he kept quiet and then after a brief pause pekka returned to classical kaunian for two words i begin she wasnt the smoothest incantor fernao had ever seen but she was a long way from being the clumsiest because the spell was in kuusaman he couldnt tell whether it went as it shouldshed been right about that but she sounded confident and both siuntio and ilmarinen nodded approval every now and then the kuusamans hadnt been lying about the magnitude of the forces they were manipulating fernao felt that at once the air of the laboratory seemed to quiver with the energy that built as pekka chanted on ilmarinen and siuntio werent sitting back and taking it easy either they quivered too with tension if something went wrong here it would go horribly wrong and it would go horribly wrong in the blink of an eye even the rats felt something was strange the young animals in one row of cages scrabbled frantically at the iron bars trying to break free one gnawed at the bars till its front tooth broke with an audible snap the older rats in the other cages burrowed down into the sawdust and cedar shavings from which they made their nests as if trying to hide from the building sorcerous storm it would do them no good of course but they didnt know that the only knew they were afraid fernao knew he was afraid too he realized ilmarinen and pekka hadnt been joking when they talked about generating almost enough sorcerous energy to sink yliharma in the sea and that from a few rats what would the algarvians do he wondered if they tried this experiment with kaunian children and grandparents how much sorcerous energy would that yield and swemmel of unkerlant was already killing his own peasants would he worry about killing a few or more than a few more not likely will there be anything left of the world by the time this cursed war is done fernao wondered the more he saw the less hope he had it was building to a peak without understanding the words of the spell fernao could tell that from pekkas intonation and from the feeling in the air like that just before lightning flashes hardly had that thought crossed his mind before pekka cried out one last word lightning did crackle between the rows of cages then and went on and on once fast as a striking serpent siuntio rapped out a word right in the middle of that spectacular discharge fernao couldnt see that it made any difference but ilmarinen patted his fellow mage on the back as if hed done something more than considerable at last the lightnings faded pekka slumped and held herself up by hanging on to the table in front of which she stood well we got through another one she said in a gravelly voice through dazzled eyes fernao saw the sweat on her forehead saw the skin stretched tight on her high cheekbones casting that spell looked to have aged her five years maybe ten fernao started to say something but drew in a breath and coughed the breath was riperankwith the odor of corruption ilmarinen coughed too coughed and said we ought to do more work with the windows open or else work with a convergent series siuntio put in these are the older animals fernao asked a lot older now ilmarinen said actually youre smelling the way they were a while ago so to speak they dont stink at all now theyre long past that i see fernao said slowly this is what the mathematics said you would be doing but seeing the mathematics is not the same as seeing the thing itself it should be siuntios voice held a touch of disapproval he was a master mage indeed a master at a level to which fernao could only aspire if he truly did see the mathematics and the reality as one and the sameand fernao was willing to believe he didhis powers of visualization were also well beyond those of the lagoan mage somewhat cowed fernao said and what of the younger rats siuntio clucked again he said you know what the mathematics say if you must have the confirmation examine their enclosures aye master fernao said with a sigh he knew what he would find when he walked over to that row of cages and find it he did they were empty there was no sign that rats had ever lived in them he whistled one soft low note were they ever really there where did they go theyre gone now by the powers abovethats where the energy discharge came from ilmarinen said and suppose you define real for me when youve got a year youre not doing anything else with no he had no trouble being colloquially rude in classical kaunian in any case whereor whenthey may have gone is mathematically undefined and so must be meaningless siuntio said femao made a discontented noise down deep in his throat i have not been through the calculations as thoroughly as you have of course but this solution does not strike me as if it ought to be undefined pekka stirred she didnt seem quite so ravaged as she had just after she finished the spell i agree she said i believe there is a determinate solution to the question if we can find it i believe it will be important ive looked i havent found one ilmarinen said he didnt say if i cant find one it isnt there but that was what he meant it may be just as well if we dont look too hard siuntio said the implications of the convergent series are alarming enoughhow long before mages start robbing the young of time to give to the old and rich and vicious but if you youngsters are right the possibilities from the divergent series are even worse more paradoxical certainly pekka said fernao thought about the young rats he nodded the kuusaman mage had found the right word sorcery abhors paradox siuntios voice was prim most of the sorcerers here at the university abhor us ilmarinen said we scare them to death too almost literally after a couple of our experiments this one didnt even break any windows were getting better control shall we go celebrate living through another one with some food and some spirits aye pekka said as if hed thrown her a cork float while she was drowning siuntio nodded so did fernao but he ate and drank absently for the distinction between the real world and the world of calculation blurred in his mind by pekkas abstracted expression he thought her mind was going down the same ley line as his he wondered if it led anywhere trasone stood on the northern bank of the wolter and looked across the river toward the mamming hills beyond he couldnt see much of the hills snow flurries cut his vision short chunks of drift ice floated down the wolter toward the narrow sea here in sulingen the snow that stuck on the ground was gray ranging toward black so much of the city had burned as the algarvians battled block by block to seize it from king swemmels men trasone turned to sergeant panfilo who stood a few feet away he waved a magnificent allencompassing algarvian wave its ours at last he shouted isnt that bloody fornicating wonderful oh aye its terrific all right panfilo pointed east we still havent got quite all of it fresh smoke rose from the pockets where unkerlanter soldiers still stubbornly hung on the sergeant turned away from them back toward the parts of sulingen the algarvians had won fresh smoke rose from them too here and thereunkerlanter dragons and eggtossers kept reminding the algarvians the war went on panfilo gestured in disgust it wasnt supposed to be a fight about sulingen we were supposed to take this place and then go on to the cursed hills and the cinnabar in them trasone spat you know that i know that nobody bothered to tell the stinking unkerlanters now boys that was major spinellos cheery voice trasone didnt know how the battalion commander did it had he not known better he would have suspected spinello of keeping his spirits up with nostrums and potions but even food had a hard time coming into sulingen let alone drugs spinello went on arent you proud of our magnificent victory one more victory like this and we wont have any soldiers left at all trasone answered spinello didnt mind if his soldiers spoke their minds he always spoke his panfilo said even if we do finally clean out the unkerlanters we wont be able to cross the wolter and get into the mamming hills till spring thats not how it was supposed to work how many things do work out just the way you want them to spinello asked i can only think of he stopped a surprised look on his face in normal conversational tones he said ive been blazed he crumpled to the snow and sootstreaked ground sniper trasone screamed as he threw himself flat panfilo also lay on the ground he was shouting the same thing trasone crawled over to major spinello and started to drag him off toward some rubble nearby panfilo helped how bad is it sir trasone asked hurts spinello answered when the two soldiers dragged him over a broken brick he began to shriek once they got him behind the wreckageso the unkerlanter sniper wherever he was would have a harder time getting a good blaze at any of themtrasone and panfilo examined the wound it went through the right side of spinellos chest and back the major kept on shrieking and writhing while they looked him over trasone took that in stride hed helped too many wounded men to do anything else through the lung panfilo said thats not good no trasone said but hes not bleeding too much the way they do sometimes if we can get him out of here and the healers can slow him down and work on him hes got a chance hes an officer and hes a nobleif we can haul him out of here theyll sure as blazes sling him under a dragon and fly him off all right lets try it sergeant panfilo said hes not a bad fellow pretty fair officer trasone agreed as each of them draped one of spinellos arms over his shoulder of course if it was you or me wed take our chances right here in sulingen panfilo nodded they both scrambled to their feet and hauled spinello off toward the closest dragon farm a few hundred yards from the wolter perhaps mercifully the wounded major passed out before they got there well get him away the chief dragon handler promised hes not the first one that stinking snipers nailed somebody ought to give the whoreson what he deserves the algarvian slashed a forefinger across his throat to show what he meant where are our snipers the lazy buggers trasone grumbled as he and sergeant panfilo made their way toward the front once more weve got a good one in that colonel casmiro panfilo answered hes sent dozens of swemmels men down to the powers below they say he learned his business hunting big game in siaulia maybe so trasone said but the tigers and elephants and whathaveyou dont blaze back itd be a lot easier if the unkerlanters didnt they were both crawling by the time they got to the place where spinello was blazed trasone wasnt so cold as he had been the year before this time warm clothes had got to the men before snow started falling he wished that had happened the year before he and panfilo also wore white smocks not much different from those king swemmels men had that evening a couple of squads of unkerlanters sneaked out of their pocket and prowled among the algarvians doing all the damage they could till they were hunted down and killed when the wan sun of fading autumn rose in the northwest trasone was running on wine and fury for he hadnt had any sleep he was then the wrong man to greet the dapper officer who came up to the front with a fancy stick that had a spyglass screwed to the top of it is this where weve had trouble with snipers the fellow demanded what if it is trasone growled belatedlyvery belatedlyhe added sir i am colonel the count casmiro the officer replied in a snooty accent that said hed been born and raised in trapani no matter where hed hunted big game you will have heard of me he struck a pose trasone worn and filthy and burning inside was in no mood to back down from anybody blaze the bastard who bagged my battalion commander and ill have heard of you till then you can go jump off the fornicating cliffs into the fornicating wolter for all i care casmiros nose was almost as beaky as king mezentios he looked at trasone down it curb your tongue he said i can have you punished how trasone threw back his head and laughed in casmiros face what can you do to me thats worse than this the hulking trooper waited to see if colonel casmiro had an answer for him the algarvian noble pushed past him toward the front muttering i will rid the world of that unkerlanter for good and all he doesnt lack for confidence sergeant panfilo observed when trasone recounted the conversation to him the sergeant laughed why should he hes an algarvian after all hes an officer too trasone said darkly casmiro prowled the forwardmost trenches and foxholes all that day flitting from one pile of ruined brickwork to the next as if he were a ghost he did know somethingquite a bitabout moving without drawing notice at some point that afternoon trasone wrapped himself in his blanket and went to sleep when he woke night had fallenand colonel casmiro was nowhere to be found a pot full of pillaged buckwheat groats and what was probably dog meat interested trasone more anyhow only after hed filled his belly did he bother asking whered that knowitall sniper get to he crawled out toward the unkerlanters somebody answered whered he go trasone asked no one knew a soldier said you dont want to stick your head up to find out you know what i mean not when swemmels stinking whoresonsll drill you a new ear hole first chance they get thats the truthno doubt about it trasone felt better for some food in him the unkerlanters werent tossing very many eggs after their raid the night before they didnt try another one nobody ordered the algarvians forward in a night attack trasone cleaned his mess tin and went back to sleep no one bothered him till dawn that left him only about a year behind when he woke he yawned and stretched and made his slow careful way up to the front he didnt think it was light enough for swemmels soldiers to have an easy time spying him and blazing him but he didnt want to find out he was wrong either anything going on he asked when he reached the battered trenches nearest the enemy seems quiet enough answered one of the men unlucky enough to be there already any sign of the sniper trasone asked everybody shook his head cautiously trasone looked out from the rubble the algarvians occupied toward the rubble the unkerlanters still held he saw no trace of colonel casmiro with a shrug he ducked down again maybe the powers below ate him he said and his comrades laughed they had no love for snipers on either side he doubted whether even swemmels men loved snipers on either side it was a quiet day punctuated only by occasional screams he had time to wonder how major spinello was doing and if spinello was doing at all after darkness felland it fell horribly earlycolonel casmiro appeared complete with his stick with the spyglass on it for all the world as if hed been conjured up he might have been speaking of leopards or large flightless birds when he said i bagged four today where were you hiding sir trasone asked and the master sniper gave him nothing but a smug smile trasone found another question any sign of the bugger whos been blazing us not a single one casmiro answered i begin to doubt hes there anymore even in those dismal surroundings he managed a swagger he would have got on well with spinello he likely got word i was coming and fled heres hoping trasone said as long as the unkerlanter sniper wouldnt put a beam between his eyes he cared about nothing else but casmiro said no i want him dead at my hands in his last moment of pain i want him to know i am his master day after day the count and colonel went out before dawn and came back after sunset with tales of unkerlanters hed blazed but he saw no sign of the enemy sniper neither did trasonetill two of his countrymen in quick succession died after incautiously exposing a tiny part of their persons for half a heartbeat casmiro vowed a terrible revenge trasone didnt see him go out before dawn the next morning but panfilo did the veteran sergeant was wideeyed with admiration hes got a regular little nest there under a chunk of sheet iron he told trasone no wonder the unkerlanters cant spy him hed better get that lousy bugger trasone said otherwise well never be free of him trasone peered east more often than was really safe hoping to watch the unkerlanter sniper meet his end and he thought he had when an unkerlanter screamed and toppled from the second story of a burntout block of flats a couple of furlongs away an instant later though another scream rose this one from between the lines not far from the trench in which trasone stood his gaze flashed to the sheet iron under which colonel casmiro sheltered he felt like a fool how could he tell what was going on under there he found out that evening when casmiro did not come back inside the algarvian lines the chill that went through him somehow sank deeper than that from the snow gently falling on king mezentios men in sulingen during the day talsu hardly felt married he went downstairs to work with his father while gailisa walked the couple of blocks back to her fathers grocery to help him there the only difference in the days was that they both got wages out of which they paid for food and the tiny lodging that was talsus room at night though talsu wished hed got married a lot sooner he seemed to come to work every morning with an enormous grin on his face his father eyed him with amused approval if you can stay happy with your lady when youre cooped up together in a room where you couldnt swing a cat odds are youll be happy anywhere for a long time to come traku remarked one morning aye father i expect so talsu answered absently it was a cool day so he wore a wool tunic and it rubbed at the scratches gailisa had clawed in his back the night before but then thinking about that anywhere he went on weve been looking at flats everything is so cursed expensive its the war traku blamed the war for anything that went wrong not just flats are dear these days everything costs more than it should on account of the algarvians are doing so much thieving isnt enough left for decent folks i shouldnt wonder if youre right like his father talsu was willing to blame mezentios men for any iniquity even so if it werent for the redheads though wed have a lot less work ourselves and thatd mean a lot less money i wont say youre wrong traku answered and do you know what he waited for talsu to shake his head before continuing every time i turn out something in an extraheavy winter weight im not even sorry to do it of course youre notit means one more algarvian heading out of jelgava and off to unkerlant talsu thought for a moment then spoke in classical kaunian their wickedness goes before them as a shield sounds good his father said whats it mean talsu translated his father thought about it then said and with any luck at all the unkerlantersll smash that shield all to bits how long have the news sheets been bragging that the redheadsll have the last unkerlanter out of that sulingen place any minute now its been a while talsu agreed and they say its already started snowing down there he shuddered at the very idea only time i ever saw snow was up in the mountains when i was in the army nasty cold stuff it snowed here the winter before you were born traku said reminiscently it was pretty as all getout till it started melting and turning sooty but youre rightit was bloody cold before talsu could answer the front door opened the bell above the door jingled in walked an algarvian major with bushy red side whiskers with a few white hairs in them and a little chin beard good day sir traku said to him what can i do for you the algarvians had occupied skrunda for more than two years if the locals werent used to dealing with mezentios men by now they never would be i require winter gear the major said in good jelgavan i mean to say tough winter gear not winter gear for a place like this not winter gear for a place with a civilized climate i see traku nodded he said not a word about unkerlant talsu understood that some algarvians got very angry when they had to think about the place to which they were bound what have you got in mind sir the officer started ticking things off on his fingers item a white smock item a heavy cloak item a heavy kilt item several pairs of thick wool drawers reaching to the knee item several pairs of thick wool socks also reaching to the knee during the first winter of the war in the west algarvians bound for unkerlant had been a lot less certain about what they needed theyd learned no doubt from bitter experience talsu wasnt sorry the redheads had given a lot of other people bitter experience too he said how many do you reckon go into several sir say half a dozen each the algarvian answered he pointed one forefinger at talsu the other at traku now we shall argue over price youll argue with my father talsu said hes better at it than i am then i would sooner argue with you the major said but he turned to traku i have some notion of what things should cost my dear fellow i hope you will not prove too unreasonable i dont know traku answered well see though for everything you told me he named a sum very amusing the algarvian told him good day he started for the doorway and a good day to you too traku replied placidly dont forget to shut the door when you go out he picked up his needle and went back to work talsu did the same the officer hesitated with his hand on the latch maybe you are not madmen merely brigands he named a sum of his own a good deal lower than trakus dont forget to shut the door traku repeated if you want all that stuff for that price you can get it but you get what you pay for whether you think so or not how do you suppose those cheap drawers you find will hold out in an unkerlanter blizzard mentioning that name was a gamble but it paid off scowling the algarvian said very well sir let us dicker he drew himself up and approached the counter again he proved better at haggling than most of the redheads whod gone up against talsus father he kept starting for the door in theatrical disbelief that traku wouldnt bring his price down further the fourth time he did it talsu judged he really meant it so did his father who lowered the scot to something not too much higher than he would have charged one of his own countrymen there you see the algarvian said you can be reasonable it is a bargain he stuck out his hand traku shook it saying a bargain at that price after the major nodded traku said you might have screwed me down a little more yet i do not quibble over coppers the redhead said grandly silver aye coppers no you look to need coppers more than i do and so i give them to you i shall return in due course for my garments he swept out of the shop traku couldnt help chuckling some of them arent so bad he said maybe not talsu said grudgingly but ill bet he would have stabbed me if hed been in the grocers shop too traku coughed a couple of times and made a point of looking busy for a while when talsu told the story over the table the next morning gailisa said i hope all the algarvians get sent to unkerlant i hope they never come back either talsu beamed at his new bride see why i love her he asked his family and by the way he said it the world at large we think alike his sister ausra snorted well who doesnt want the algarvians gone powers above i do does that mean you want to marry me too no hed know what he was getting into then traku said this way hell be surprised dear laitsina gave her husband a reproving look let discord not come among us talsu said in the old language classical kaunian came close to making common sense worth listening to then he had to translate in jelgavan it came out sounding like wed better not squabble among ourselves thats what our nobles kept telling us gailisa said and we didnt squabble with them and so they led us into the war against algarveand right off a cliff she started to say something else in that vein but suddenly stopped and looked at talsunot at his face but toward his flank where the redhead had stuck a knife into him when she did speak again it was in a subdued voice and now the way mezentios men have treated us i wouldnt be sorry to see the nobles back again aye thats the truth talsu nodded toward his wife next to the algarvians even colonel dzirnavu seems well not too bad the rabid patriotism of a man whose kingdom groaned under the occupiers heel couldnt make him say more than that for the fat arrogant fool whod commanded his regiment traku said anyhow half the nobles have gone to the court at balvi to suck up to the king the redheads gave us if they suck up to the algarvians how are they any different than the algarvians ill tell you how ausra said hotly theyre worse thats how the algarvians are our enemies theyve never made any bones about that but our nobles are supposed to protect us from our enemies instead of sucking up like father says she looked on the point of bursting into tearstears of fury more than sorrow gailisa got to her feet id better go on over now she bent and brushed talsus lips with her own ill see you tonight sweetheart her voice was full of delicious promise talsu wondered if he were the only one who heard it by the way his mother and father and even his sister grinned at him he wasnt as soon as the door downstairs closed showing gailisa was on her way to her fathers shop ausra said you turned pink talsu she laughed at him he glared somebody ought to turn your backside red that will be enough of that his mother said as if he and ausra were a couple of small quarrelsome children she turned toward him remember what you said in the oldtime language you should have paid more attention to it she started it talsu pointed at his sister he felt like a small quarrelsome childa small quarrelsome embarrassed child enough laitsina repeated his mother could have given colonel dzirnavu lessons in command she went on now you and traku had better go on down and get some work done your poor wife shouldnt have to do it all the unfairness of that took talsus breath away before he could find a comeback traku said aye well get downstairs wont we son that we well have half a chance to hear ourselves think he left in a hurry talsu no fool followed in a hurry as they worked away on the algarvian officers winter outfit talsu said i wish our nobles werent sucking up to king mezentios pointynosed brother i wish they were doing something to get rid of the redheads i wish somebody was doing something to get rid of the miserable redheads his father finished threading a needle before answering somebody is who painted all those slogans in classical kaunian a few weeks ago algarvians havent caught anybody talsu gestured dismissively besides who cares about slogans maybe theres more to it than slogans traku said where theres smoke theres fire i havent seen any talsu went back to basting together the redheaded majors white smock after a while his silence grew thoughtful the people with whom he studied classical kaunian didnt care for the algarvians not even a little what all were they doing could he find out without putting his own neck on the line that was a good question he wondered what sort of answer it had maybe i ought to see he thought do you ever hear anything from zossen garivald asked munderic seems like ive been goneforever a cold nasty wind whipped through the forest west of herborn garivald could smell snow on the breeze it had already fallen a couple of times but hadnt stuck along with the autumn rains it left the ground under the trees a nasty oozy quagmire munderic shook his head nothing to speak of the algarvians still have their little garrison in it if thats what you mean i figured that garivald said i figured you did the leader of the band of irregulars answered but i dont know if the firstmans wife is sleeping with the redheads or whether swine fevers gone through or if the harvest is goodhavent heard anything like that too far away if the algarvians are sleeping with herka theyre a lot more desperate than anybody thought they were garivald said and munderic laughed garivald started to walk off then turned back what about the fight at that sulingen place still going on now munderic spoke with great assurance by the powers above the redheads stuck their dicks in the sausage machine there and now they cant get em out breaks my heart that it does mine too now garivald did walk away munderics voice pursued him were going after that ley line tonight remember got to keep the algarvians from moving things through i hadnt forgotten garivald paused to look back over his shoulder thatll get harder when the snow does start sticking and it wont be long cursed algarvians will be able to follow our tracks a lot easier we lived through last winter and kept fighting munderic answered we can do it again i expect maybe sadoc will figure out a way to hide our tracks garivald rolled his eyes maybe sadoc will figure out a way to get us all killed not just some of us the longer it is since hes tried to work wizardry the better the mage you misremember him to be when you work better you can pick nits munderic said angrily till then hes the only excuse for a mage weve got you said it i didnt but ill say this from everything ive seen no magecraft is better than bad magecraft garivald kept on walking this time and paid no attention to whatever munderic shouted after him he walked right out of the clearing where most of the irregulars squatted or lounged just beyond it he almost fell when his feet slipped in wet rotting leaves he had to grab for a tree trunk to keep from landing on his backside from behind another tree he heard a snicker obilot stepped out shed been on sentrygo she had a stick in her hand ive seen that done better she said you looked as clumsy as a redhead there having just quarreled with munderic garivald found himself in a sour mood instead of laughing at himself as he usually would have he growled and if youd put your foot where i did youd look even clumsier obilot glared at him i got out here without slipping and sliding like an otter going down a bank garivald glared back he bowed low almost as if he were an algarvian and not a poorly shaved unkerlanter peasant in a dirty tunic and muddy felt boots a couple of sizes too big im so sorry milady we cant all be as beautiful and graceful as you obilot went white when she started to swing the business end of her stick toward him he realized that was killing rage she realized it a moment later and lowered the stick before garivald had to decide whether to try to jump her or to dive behind the tree hed grabbed you dont know what youre saying she whispered very likely more to herself than to him she took a deep breath and got back a little color when she spoke again she did aim her words at him be thankful you dont know what youre talking about be thankful you dont know where ive heard things like that before she never had said much to him about what had driven her into the irregulars something to do with one of mezentios men he guessed her nod was jerky aye something her voice made the cutting wind seem a warm breeze out of the north something she gestured with the stick again this time in a peremptory way go on leave me in peace peace she laughed garivald all but fled compared to facing obilot going out and trying to sabotage an algarvianheld ley line seemed safe and easy to garivald or it would have had she not been one of the irregulars coming along on the raid garivald stayed as far away from her as he could he also wanted to stay away from sadoc since the wouldbe mage and obilot wouldnt stay close to each other garivald had to balance repulsions as best he could munderic was blind to all that he had other things to worry about careful with the eggs he kept telling the irregulars who carried them if youre not careful well all end up very unhappy where the eggs had come from garivald didnt know they appeared in the camp every so often almost as if they were magicked into being they had plenty of magic inside them garivald knew that the characters on their cases werent in unkerlanter he couldnt read but he could recognize the characters of his own language if these werent unkerlanter they had to be algarvian had munderic stolen them out from under the redheads noses or had the algarvians given them to puppet king ranieros grelzer troops with a grelzer soldier friendlier than he seemed passing them on to the irregulars asking munderic struck garivald as more trouble than it was worth he and the leader of the band had dickered too often to make him think he would get a straight answer he slogged along down the muddy path under the ever barer branches of the trees and then quite suddenly the irregulars werent under the shelter of the trees any more but tramping up the path through an overgrown meadow that hadnt been grazed for at least a year munderic waved the men with the eggs and a good many others with themoff the path and into the grass have a care lads he said the redheads have gone to burying eggs in the roadway again that made several more irregulars skitter off the track then obilot spoke up her voice a clear bell in the darkness sometimes they bury eggs alongside the roads too to get the clever buggers who know enough to get off onto the safe groundonly it isnt sadoc said ill douse out any eggs see if i dont carrying a forked stick he strode boldly down the middle of the road as if daring an algarvian egg to burst under him if he doesnt douse out an egg well see it all right garivald murmured to another irregular nearby the fellow chuckled though it was funny only in a grisly way garivald didnt think sadoc could find the sun at noon with or without a dowsing rod but he held his tongue if sadoc proved him right everyone would know about it he tramped along under the dark moonless sky nights grew ever longer that gave the irregulars an advantage they lacked in summertime they could travel farther under cover of darkness at this season of the year if he were back in zossen now he would be wondering if he had enough jars of spirits to keep him drunk through most of the winter unless this winter were very different from any that had gone before he would have enough too but this winter was different and zossen a long way away instead of the redheads whod garrisoned his village garivald had to worry about whatever grelzer troops were guarding the ley line for their algarvian masters he wondered how hard the men who served king raniero would fight they werent algarvians which was doubtless all to the good but they wouldnt have only the weapons they could steal or scrounge the algarvians would want to make sure they could fight whether they would or not munderic spoke in a low but urgent voice were getting near the ley line keep your eyes skinned every cursed one of you we want to slide past the grelzer traitors we dont want to get into a fight with them if we can plant our eggs and then sneak back to the woods weve done what we came for somebody said well have to kill those whoresons sooner or later might as well start now if we have to we will munderic answered but hurting the algarvians is more important now thats what we aim for first with more than a little reluctance garivald admitted to himself that munderic was right he paused and peered ahead through the night in the name of efficiency king swemmel had ordered shrubbery planted to either side of a lot of ley lines in unkerlant to keep people and animals from blundering unawares into the path of a caravan how much labor that had taken hadnt been measured against men or beasts saved garivald wondered why not but not for long because swemmel gave the order thats why he still feared the king more than he loved him but he fearedand hatedthe algarvians still more halt someone called from the darkness ahead in accents much like his own who goes there garivald went down onto his belly he couldnt see the man who had challenged and he didnt want the fellow seeing him either for all he knew the grelzer carried a crystal and was calling reinforcements but sadocs voice rang out harsh and proud free men of unkerlant thats who a beam came out of the night aimed at the loudmouthed wouldbe mage garivald and his comrades blazed back trying to hit the grelzer before he could hit any of them by the way he was shoutingscreaminghe had no crystal to summon aid a moment later the screams changed note from fear to anguish a moment after that most abruptly they cut off from behind the hedgehow had he got there so fastmunderic called stinking whoresons deadscratch one traitor but come on weve got the get these eggs planted fast now sadoc are you hale aye sadoc answered get up here then munderic snapped as irregulars dug a hole in the dirt between the hedgerows marking the ley lines path say the words over these eggs and well get out of here aye sadoc repeated say the words he did in a rapid singsong garivald didnt think it was in unkerlanter but wasnt sure with sadoc saying the words he wasnt sure they would work either as soon as they were through he helped his comrades fill in the hole theyd dug then they started for the shelter of the woods again no more grelzer soldiers came over to see what might have happened or to pursue that told garivald more than a little about the quality of the men who served raniero the irregulars were more than halfway back to the forest when a distant roar from behind them made them burst into cheers if any villagers heard them they might have taken their noise for the baying of a wolf pack that had killed they wouldnt have been far wrong either even garivald slapped sadoc on the back just outside the woods an irregular trod on an egg buried in the meadow that roar was louder more intimate his screams were more dreadful than the grelzers but faded to nothingness almost as fast obilot said one of us for one of their caravansfair exchange she was right but garivalds shiver had nothing to do with the cold marshal rathar and general vatran had a new headquarters these days the algarvians had finally overrun the gully from which theyd directed the fight for sulingen for so long this one was also a cave a cave dug into the side of the bluffs that tumbled down to the wolter runners had to make their way along a narrow twisting dangerous path to bring new from the few bits of the city to unkerlanters still held and to take back orders after one runner did make the journey vatran started cursing rathar had been studying the map the generals fury made him look up from it what now he asked ill tell you what vatran growled you know colonel chariulf of course rathar answered he finally put paid to that algarvian master sniper and a good thing toothe whoreson was bleeding us white aye well now hes had his own letter posted poor bugger vatran told him he got caught away from a hole when the algarvians started tossing eggs and theres not enough of him left to bury in a bloody jam tin this war is bleeding the whole kingdom white rathar thought hed thought the same thing during the twinkings war men a little older a little more traveled than he had surely thought the same thing during the six years war and theyd been right and hed been right and he was right again what would be left of unkerlant by the time this fight was over he hoped something would be left of unkerlant by the time this fight was over his job down here was to help make sure something would be left of his kingdom when the fight was over if the algarvians took it all if that happened they would make people long for the good old days of king swemmel which to a man whod lived through those days was a genuinely frightening thought poor chariulf he said he was good at what he did vatran grunted aye he was and thats more praise than most of us will get after were dead and gone if you and i dont get that kind of praise itll mean we lost the war rathar said maybe vatran answered but maybe not too maybe itll just mean swemmel got sick of us threw us in the soup pot when it was boiling hard and then went on and won the war anyhow with whatever other generals he scrounged up now theres a cheerful thought rathar said i like to think of myself as indispensable i like to think of myself the same bloody way vatran replied but the way i look at it and the way his majesty looks at it arent necessarily one and the same however much i wish they were he raised his voice ysolt how about another mug of tea ill fetch you one general the cook answered from the back of the cave do you want one too marshal rathar no thanks he said he had some sour ale in front of him as he examined the map and that would do well enough can i get you anything else then lord marshal she asked her voice an inviting croon if rathars ears didnt turn as red as the embers of the fire that kept the cave a little warmer than freezing he would have been astonished hed bedded her a couple of times since that first one or rather shed bedded him hed discovered he had an easier time resisting the algarvian army than his own hefty cook vatran chuckled under his breath he would have had to be a moron not to know what ysolts tone meant dont worry about it lord marshal he said in a stage whisper keeps the juices flowing or thats what they say he chuckled again never a dull moment there either even if shes no beauty no rathar said admitting what he could hardly deny hed wondered whether vatran had slept with ysoltor perhaps the better way to phrase it was whether shed slept with vatran now he knew you didnt answer me marshal she said reprovingly as she brought general vatran a steaming mug of tea and a little pitcher of milk beside it on the tray can i get you anything else no thats all right he said im fine well i thought so she answered with a girlish giggle that didnt fit her bulk then she had mercy on the marshal and turned back to general vatran its goats milk general im sorry its all i could get doesnt bother me vatran said as ysolt went back to her cooking cursed sight better than no milk at all even if the bloody gyongyosians would shit their drawers about it he poured some into the tea then nodded cursed sight better than no milk at all the zuwayzin drink their tea without milk rathar remarked they pour in the honey instead thats not my problemand if i took off my clothes in this weather itd freeze right off vatran answered i cant use it as often as i did when i was your age but ive still got a blaze left in the stick every now and again good for you rathar said like him vatran also had a wife somewhere far away from the fighting considering what rathar was doing he hardly found himself in a position to criticize the general his attention went back to the map they arent getting over the wolter now by the powers above carrying his mug vatran came to stand by him and study the situation too thats the truth unless they scramble down the bank to the river and hop from one ice floe to the next weve got plenty on the other side to stop em if they try it rathar took another pull at his ale and theyre still in play here in the city so they wont he clicked his tongue between his teeth the ice doesnt make it any easier for us to get reinforcements and supplies up here but im cursed if i know what to do about it itll all freeze solid before too long vatran answered its already doing that farther south and thatll solve the problemif its still a problem then aye if rathar made a discontented noise down deep in his throat even if they cant break into the mamming hills powers below eat the algarvians for pushing as far south as they have do you know what a demon of a time weve had moving things from hither to yon he traced what he meant with the blunt dirty callused forefinger of his right hand i wouldnt be worth bloody much if i didnt know it would i vatran said havent i been screaming at the crystallomancers and at every dunderheaded officer theyve managed to raise for as long as you have havent i been screaming even louder than you have do you think theres one officer between here and cottbus who doesnt want to wear my guts for garters i can think of one rathar said vatran gave him an indignant look but then the marshal jabbed a thumb at his own chest thats me youve been a workhorse and i thank you for it considering that you could have sacked me after durrwangen went down the drain im the one who ought to thank you and i do vatran answered but do you know what it is rathar shook his head waiting to see what the older man would say vatran went on were too cursed stubborn to quityou me the king the whole kingdom when the redheads kicked valmiera and jelgava in the balls the blonds just folded up and died weve done a lot of dyingweve done way too bloody much dyingbut we never did fold up and we could have i know rathar said and were lucky if the algarvians had used a little more honey if theyd had the wit to prop up a grelzer noble in herborn they didnt think they needed to vatran said scornfully they figured they could do whatever they pleased same as they did in the east now theyve found out they were wrongbut its a little fornicating late for that wouldnt you say heres hoping answered rather whose greatest fear all along had been that the unkerlanter peasantry after more than twenty years of king swemmels rule would prefer any other overlords even ones with red hair but that hadnt happened and it didnt look like happening now he pointed to the map north and east of sulingen before too long maybe we can start giving them back some of their own grounds not frozen hard enough yet vatran observed i said before too long rathar sighed do you know what ive had more trouble about than anything else of course i do vatran answered keeping king swemmel from ordering us to do things before were ready to do them he lowered his voice if kyot hadnt been the same way swemmel never would have won the twinkings war i know memories of that confused vicious struggled crowded forward in rathars mind he shoved them down again none taught much about the generals art but weve managed it this timeso far anyhow easier when im away from cottbus than when im there ayehis majestys not bending your ear so much vatran said only question is whos bending his ear while youre down here i do wonder about that every now and then when i have time to wonder about anything except what the algarvians are doing i mean rathar said we havent had any trouble so far so far vatran freighted the words with ominous import as if he were a fortuneteller seeing doom ahead his majesty wants this war won rathar said till you understand that you understand nothing about him he is as inflexible now as he ever was in the days when kyot offered to split the kingdom all right vatran leaned forward and spoke in a very very low voice where dyou suppose wed be if kyot had won the civil war you and i rathar didnt need long to think that over wed be dead kyot didnt love his enemies any more than swemmel diddoes they were twins after all like as two peas in a pod thats not what i meant and you bloody well know it vatran said where would the kingdom be better worse the same how can you judge rathar answered with a shrug not much different odds are the faces would be but not unkerlant or do you think otherwise no not really vatran sighed it would be nice if we could be efficient without talking about efficiency all the time if we could be a proper derlavaian kingdom instead of a great slapdash thing that never manages to get it right the first try and usually not the second one either do you know what im saying lord marshal or is this all just moonshine and hogwash to you i know what youre saying all right rathar answered anybody whos ever led troops against algarvians knows what you mean either he knows or he gets killed before he can find out but ill tell you something general whats that vatran sounded like a man whod drunk himself sad even if hed had nothing stronger than tea the more we fight the algarvians the more efficient we get rathar replied we have to either that or we go under and ill tell you something else too the redheads never figured wed last this long weve already given em one surprise now we find how many more weve got he nodded liking the sound of those words we find out pretty soon by the powers above come back here you miserable cursed thing skarnu called to a sheep that had broken away from the flock the sheep showed no interest in coming it had found some good grass near the edge of the woods and its thick woolly coat which hadnt been sheared in a while shed the cold nasty rain that pelted down out of a sky gray to begin with and now darkening toward evening skarnus hooded cape shed rain too but not so well he squelched toward the sheep temper fraying with every step he took he hefted his crook when he got close enough to the infuriating animal he intended to teach it who was boss and in no uncertain terms but the sheep might have known what he had in mindand it certainly knew just how far he could reach with that crook nimble as if it had grown up hopping from crag to crag in the bratanu mountains it skipped away from him again and again he wondered if it would try to jump the fence and cross the road so it could get in among the oaks and forage for acorns like a wild boar it didnt jump but it did evade him again almost as if it were playing with him longingly he looked back toward the farmhouse merkela would have a big pot of stew bubbling over the fire he didnt care if it was only barley and peas and beans and cabbage it would fill him up and warm him from the inside out as things were hed be lucky if he didnt come down with chest fever by the time he finally chased down this pestilential sheep youd make good mutton he growled youd make bloody wonderful mutton do you know that he wondered what merkela would say if he cut the sheeps throat when he finally caught it gutted the carcass and dragged it back to the farmhouse he sighed no he didnt really wonder what merkela would say he knew the sheep would live no matter how much he wished it dead in the driving rain and deepening gloom he didnt see the horsemen coming up the road till they were quite close they didnt see him eitherand then all at once they did one of them called out in accented valmieran you are being the peasant calling self skarnu skarnu didnt wait to admit or deny he was himself he stood only a couple of strides from the rail fence he scrambled up over it dashed across the road and ran off into the woods halting yelled the algarvian who spoke his language but skarnu had no intention of halting he could think of only one reason the redheads would want him the same one that had made him hide in the woods before he cursed his sister again for betraying him to her algarvian lover mezentios men didnt just shout at skarnu they started blazing at him too beams sizzled past boiling raindrops as they went but in weather like this the beams weakened rapidly when one struck him it had enough force left to burn through his cloak enough to burn through his trousers but not enough to do much more than scorch his backside on a rainless day it might have brought him down as things were he howled and yelped and sprang in the air and clapped a hand to the singed part almost as if he were a comic actor up on the stage he ran on for a couple of steps wondering how bad the wound was then he decided he couldnt be too badly hurt if he could keep on running so fast he dodged in and out among the trees trying to put as many trunks as he could between himself and the algarvians they pounded after him on foot calling to one another in their own language there were four or five of them he hadnt bothered to count before fleeing they all had sticks and his throbbing right buttock proclaimed they werent shy about using them but it was getting dark and he knew the woods and they didnt once he stopped running in blind panic and started using his head he had little trouble shaking them off hood drawn down over his face he sheltered in a thick clump of bushes while they ran past one came within fifteen or twenty feet but had no idea he was anywhere close by once they were all out of earshot he got up and moved off to the side away from the track they would have to take going back to their horses he was tempted to go back to the horses himself to ride off on one and lead the others away after it but he didnt know whether the redheads had left a man to watch the animals he would have in their boots and so however alluring the prospect of giving them a good tweak was he decided to content himself with escape he spent a long cold night in the woods without the cloak he might have frozen with it he was merely miserable he slept very little no matter how tired he was however much he wanted to he couldnt go back to the farm he hoped the algarvians had only been after him not after merkela and raunu and the two kaunians from forthweg whod joined them he didnt dare find out though not now what do i do where do i go the questions ate at him for the time being he wasnt going anywhere not unless he heard the algarvians coming after him in the darkness he was too likely to blunder into them instead he waited for dawn or something close to it and tried to stay as dry as he could that wasnt easy not the way the rain kept pouring down when at last he could see his outstretched hand in front of his face he got moving he struck the northbound road about where he thought he would a slow smile stretched itself across his face after a couple of years here he was starting to know his way around as well as the locals did no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than he chuckled any local to whom he was rash enough to say that would laugh himself silly the redheads had men posted about where he thought they would at the main crossroads had he been panicked they would have nabbed him with ease but he saw them before they spied him and slipped in among the trees to slide around them before long he left the road for one of the many little paths that meandered from one farm to another he stayed on the verge wherever he could the path was almost as full of water as a creek it was lower than the surrounding countryside which made it the drainage channel he wondered how long people and animals and wheels had been wearing it down since the days of the kaunian empire he wouldnt have been surprised after half a mile or so of hard wet slippery going he walked up to another farmhouse rain rivered down the wood shakes of the roof and off the eaves making a small lake around the house skarnu splashed through it went up the stairs and knocked on the front door for a few minutes nothing happened he knocked again and called its me im by myself then he had to wait some more at last though the door did swing open the farmer who stood in the doorway had a valmieran military stick in his hands behind him his hulking son held another its all right the farmer said and they both lowered their weapons the farmer stood aside come in skarnu before you catch your death my thanks maironiu skarnu answered i wont stay long the redheads were on my trail but i lost em some food maybe a chance to rest a littleand whom do you know that lives east of here shed your cloak shed your boots eat some bread maironiu said youre sure you lost the redheaded buggers at skarnus nod he relaxed a little but not much his wife brought out the bread and a mug of ale to go with it skarnu tore into the food like a starving wolf maironiu asked did they scoop up everybody at old gedominus place the way they do sometimes it would be gedominus place till the last man whod known merkelas husband died of old age skarnu had long since resigned himself to that he shook his head now i dont think so i think they were after me in particular maironiu scowled thats not good thats not even close to good how could they know about you somebody blab skarnu nodded again my sister he thought he didnt want to believe it of krasta but he didnt know what else to believe i dont think they know about anybody else in these parts he said i hope they dont anyhow theyd better not maironius son burst out lifes hard enough around here as is seeing how skarnu ate maironius wife brought him another big chunk of bread he bowed to her as he might have bowed to a duchess he didnt usually show off his court manners for one thing he seldom had the need for another he was so tired now he hardly knew what he was doing maironiu and his wife exchanged glances they knew what that bow was likely to mean maironiu asked the question with surprising subtlety you have enemies in the big city huh skarnu needed a moment to figure out what that meant hed almost forgotten about his noble blood a couple of years of farm work made him think it nothing very special after all it could be he said at last well go on out to the barn and curl up for a few hours whoever you were once upon a time maironiu told him then ill take you east i do know somebody whos not part of our regular group but hell know somebody else theyll pass you along get you away from here thanks skarnu repeated though leaving merkela leaving the child she was carrying was the last thing he wanted to do one more reason to curse the algarvians he thought calling mezentios men to mind made him ask whatll you do if the redheads come while im in the barn get you away if we can maironiu answered if we cant he shrugged broad shoulders well pretend we didnt know you were there thats all fair enough skarnu didnt think he could have come up with a better response not when he was endangering maironiu and his family by being here he picked up his sodden cloak and put it back on maironius wife exclaimed at the puddle it left on the floor skarnu hadnt slept on straw for a while not since hed started sharing merkelas bed exhausted as he was he could have slept on nails and broken glass he felt deep underwater when maironiu shook him awake the farmer had on a cloak much like his hate to do it to you pal maironiu said but some things just wont wait aye skarnu hauled himself to his feet the first few steps he took out to the barn door he stumbled like a drunken man then the cold rain hit him in the face that woke him up and sobered him up in a hurry where are we going he asked as he followed maironiu away from the farm like i told you i know somebody maironiu replied you dont really want a name do you skarnu considered then shook his head maironiu grunted approval all right then once youre out of this part of the kingdom you should be pretty safe again eh i suppose so skarnu kept looking back over his shoulder not toward maironius farm but toward merkelas old gedominus place he thought everything in the world that mattered to him was there and he couldnt go back not if he wanted to live cursing under his breath he squelched after maironiu sixteen sergeant pesaro glared at the constables lined up before him bembo looked back steadfastly holding out a shield of burnished innocence to cover up whatever he might have done to rouse pesaros anger but pesaro wasnt angry at him the sergeant seemed angry at the whole world boys weve got ourselves a problem he declared our problem is whatevers eating him bembo whispered to oraste the other constable grunted and nodded pesaro pointed to a forthwegian in a kneelength tunic walking past the barracks dyou see that bastard he said dyou see him aye sergeant the constables chorused dutifully bembo made sure his voice was a loud part of that chorus sergeant pesaro kept right on pointing at the stocky hooknosed blackbearded man you see him eh well all righthow do you know hes not a stinking kaunian because he doesnt look like a kaunian sergeant bembo said and then under his breath to oraste because were not bloody idiots sergeant oraste grunted again but pesaro was unappeased do you know what those lousy blonds have gone and done do you ill bloody well tell you what theyve done theyve found themselves a magic that lets em look like forthwegians thats what how are we supposed to tell whos a stinking kaunian snake in the grass if we cant tell whos a stinking kaunian snake in the grass bembos head started to ache if that forthwegian really was a kaunian if you couldnt tell who was who by lookinghow in blazes were you supposed to keep the blonds in their own district somebody stuck up a hand pesaro pointed to him as if relieved not to be pointing at the forthwegianif he was a forthwegiananymore the constable asked can they make themselves look like us too or only like forthwegians thats a good question pesaro said i dont have a good answer for it all i got told about was kaunians looking like forthwegians bembo stuck his hand in the air how do we know em if we do find any and what do we do if we catch one the way you know is snip off some hair if it turns blond once its cut youve caught yourself a kaunian if you catch one you take the bugger to the caravan depot and ship his arse west if hes a she you can do whatever else you want first nobodyll say boo weve got to stop this pretty miserable business all right bembo said the blonds dont want to go west so they stop looking like blonds thats not playing fair too cursed right it isnt pesaro didnt notice the joke if were going to lick the unkerlanters we need kaunians we cant let em slip out from between our fingers like snot and if you nail the whoreson who came up with this magic you can ask for the moon theyd probably give it to you any more questions no get your backsides out there and catch those buggers he didnt say how then oraste raised his hand pesaro looked at him in some surprise oraste didnt usually bother with questions but when the sergeant nodded his way he came up with a good one what shall we do take along manicure scissors to snip hair with if youve got em why not pesaro answered its a better idea than people with fancier badges than yours have come up with ill tell you that but listendont spend all your time checking the prettiest girls we want the bastards with beards too theyre likely to be more dangerous all right go on off the constables went oraste asked bembo you have a little scissors of course i do bembo was as vain of his person as most algarvians how am i supposed to keep my mustaches and imperial in proper trim without one you could gnaw em oraste said helpfully or you could let em grow out thick and bushy all over your face the way the forthwegians do thank you but no thank you bembo replied with dignity if i want fur ill buy a ruff he pointed to the first reasonably goodlooking forthwegian girl he saw and called out you there aye you stop she did and asked what do you want with me in pretty good algarvian bembo took the small scissors from his belt pouch i want a little lock of your hair sweetheart to make sure youre not a kaunian in disguise what will you do with it afterwards she asked in some alarm make nasty magic against me she started to shrink away a fat lot of good our sorcery s done in unkerlant bembo thought sourly but even the forthwegians are afraid of it no no no by the powers above he exclaimed ill give it back to you every single hair you can dispose of it she eyed him plainly trying to decide whether he was telling the truth at last grimacing she nodded bembo came up to her stroked her cheek on the pretext of brushing the hair back from it and snipped a lock the hair hed cut stayed dark he handed it back to the girl as hed promised she put it in her belt pouch and went off with her proud nose in the air you see darling bembo called after her i keep my word she kept walking nice try lover boy oraste said bembo stuck his nose in the air they tramped on through the gray battered sorrylooking streets of gromheort every so often they would stop somebody and cut off a lock of hair explaining what they wanted was a lot harder when the people they stopped didnt speak algarvian trying to explain in kaunian was hard for bembo to say nothing of the irony he couldnt help feeling while using that language to search for sorcerously disguised blonds we should have learned some forthwegian he told oraste his partner shook his head all those other languages are just a bunch of grunting noises anybody wants to know what i think these whoresons dont want to understand algarvian theyll understand a club smacked into the side of their pot they will and you can take that to the bank i like the way you think bembo said halfway between mocking admiration and the genuine article nothings ever hard for you is it by way of reply oraste grabbed his crotch bembo threw back his head and laughed he couldnt help himself he and oraste kept on prowling kept on snipping and caught not a single camouflaged kaunian when they got back to the barracks at the end of their shift though bembo had an inspiration he went up to pesaro and said what are all the crazy buggers in this whole stinking kingdom doing this time of year driving me daft pesaro said giving him a sour look nobody from his squad of constables had come up with any kaunians and he wasnt very happy about that bembo refused to let himself get too annoyed he said theyre all going out into the country to hunt fornicating mushrooms thats what the blonds are as wild for those nasty things as the real forthwegians are if the gate guards checked everybody who came in and went out slowly a smile replaced the glower on pesaros plump face well curse me he exclaimed there do you see youre not as foolish as you look who would have believed it ive had good ideas before bembo protested indignantly oh so you have pesaro said the one good idea you never could figure out was keeping your big mouth shut he pondered stroking the tuft of hair on his chin but that is smart dip me in dung if its not aye ill pass it up the line he stroked his chin again something else like that tooif we shut off a whole city block say and snipped everybody in it i bet wed catch a few blonds by surprise thats good sergeant bembo said partly because he meant it partly because pesaro was the fellow who told him what to do every day thats really good maybe well both get promoted he snapped his fingers powers above why think small maybe well both get sent home that is a big thought pesaro said too big most likely and they wont promote me not without a drop of noble blood in my whole line unless im descended from some viscounts bastard back three hundred years or so they like quality in officers so they do even constabulary officers you might get bumped up though lots of officers getting killed these days bembo observed not so many in the constabulary i grant you but lots and lots of soldiers theyll run short before too long and then theyll either promote commoners or theyll bloody well do without officers the unkerlanters dont fret too much about a mans blood by all ive heard thats on account of most of their nobles got bumped off a long time ago pesaro said besides who wants to be like the fornicating unkerlanters but the sergeants tone was thoughtful almost wistful bembo knew hed put a flea in his ear no trips back to tricarico came from either bembos suggestion or pesaros no promotions came from them either bembo cursed his superiors till the next time he got paid when he found a twogoldpiece bonus he wasnt even too resentful to find out that pesaros was twice as big pesaro was a sergeant after all a few days later he and oraste stretched a rope dead line across a narrow street the rope had a sign on it written in algarvian and forthwegian clipping station at the other end of the street two more algarvian constables stretched out another rope with an identical sign attached all the algarvians drew their sticks nobody goes by without getting snipped bembo yelled in his own language one of the other pair spoke forthwegian and translated line up bembo added again his opposite number turned the words into forthwegian oraste spoke up form your line over the rope one at a time get clipped anybody gets out of line he gets blazed once more the forthwegianspeaking constable did the honors grumbling the people trapped between the two ropes queued up bembo gestured them forward one by one oraste clipped this is all a waste of time you know a forthwegian told bembo in excellent algarvian mind your own business after a moment bembo recognized the fellow the one whod lost a son to a man from plegmunds brigade hes a fine one to tell us what to do and how to do it the plump constable said aloud he said fat lot you know about it anyhow i know youre looking for hair that turns yellow when its cut the forthwegian answered gossip was nothing to be sneezed at i also know any kaunian with half a wit would dye his hair black before he risked a trap like this bembo stared back in tricarico folk of kaunian blood had dyed their hair red to fit in with the algarvian majority black hair didnt make kaunians look like forthwegiansbut this chap was right it could further ward kaunians sorcerously disguised to look like their neighbors get out of here bembo snarled and the forthwegian with the graying beard disappeared in a hurry a man three people after him in line did turn out to be a kaunian with undyed hair bembo and oraste beat the blond with their bludgeons oraste covered him while the rest of the line went through he was the only kaunian the constables caught but even as they frogmarched him off toward the leyline caravan depot for what would likely be his last journey a question kept echoing and reechoing in bembos mind how many blonds had they missed the dye had an acrid reek vanai found distasteful she applied it twice as the directions on the jar told her to do then again following the directions she combed her hair without drying it flicking her eyes to right and left she could see the dark locks that fell damply to her tunicand would probably end up staining it instead of going for a mirror she asked ealstan what do i look like now strange he answered and then found a word that meant the same thing but sounded nicer exotic there arent any blackhaired folk on derlavai with fair skin and light eyes maybe on some of the islands in the great northern sea but i dont know of any even there there are plenty of kaunians in forthweg with dark hair now or i hope there are vanai said i wonder what went wrong and tipped off the algarvians that wed found a magic to let us look like everybody else somebody must have stayed out too long and had the magic wear off when a redhead was looking ealstan said something like that anyhow aye youre likely right vanai agreed after a little thought but can you blame whoever did it trapped in that little district never knowing if mezentios men were going to haul him away and send him west wouldnt you want to grab as much freedom as you could likely so ealstan said but i wouldnt want to do anything that could put anybody else in danger the answer was very much in character for him he thought of others ahead of himself vanai had seen that for as long as shed known him it was unusual in someone so young it was from what shed seen unusual in people of any age it was one of the things that had drawn her to him it drew her to him now she got up went over to him sat down beside him on the worn sofa and gave him a kiss what was that for he asked because i felt like it vanai answered oh really this time ealstan kissed her what else do you feel like we ought to wait till my hair is dry vanai said she lifted a lock from her shoulder and nodded see its just what i thoughtthe dyes stained my tunic i dont want to have to try to get it out of the bedclothes too he thought that over then nodded i suppose i can wait he said sounding as if he deserved a special order of merit for being able to vanai laughed a little when it came to matters that touched the bedchamber he had more trouble thinking of anyone but himself but he could do it which put him a long way ahead of major spinello maybe spinellos dead by now vanai thought hopefully maybe they sent him down to that sulingen place where the fighting goes on and on and on if they did send him there may he never come out again she had to make a deliberate effort to drive the algarvian officer out of her mind sometimes even that didnt work sometimes memories of him got between her and ealstan when they made love killing her pleasure as if blazing it with a heavy stick not tonight though afterwards she and ealstan lay side by side naked and sweaty as he had when theyd made love after she first made her sorcery succeed he reached out and plucked a hair from her bush as she had then she yelped now what was that for she demanded more than a little irate he held the hair between thumb and forefinger its still blond he said well of course it is vanai exclaimed what do you want me to do dye myself down there too to her astonishment ealstan nodded i think youd better he said seriously sooner or later mezentios men are going to figure out that kaunians are dyeing their hairthe hair on their heads i mean whatll they do then start yanking up tunics and yanking down drawers thats what they wouldnt but then vanai grimaced they might theyre algarvians curse them and algarvians have no shame not about such things memories of spinello surged upward again and of the utterly blasé way hed acted when brivibas walked in on him while he was taking his pleasure with her no she said in a low voice they have no shame at all ealstan fortunately didnt know just what an intimate knowledge of algarvian shamelessness she had but he knew her well enough to see she was troubled he took her in his arms and when he did he only held her he didnt try to make love with her again though she had no trouble telling he would have been interested in doing so she thought about lying there and letting him have hershe would have taken no pleasure from a second round then but shed done that too many times with spinello because shed had no choice now she did have one and ealstan seemed no more than slightly miffed when she got out of bed even that little bit of annoyance vanished when he discovered she was going to take him up on his suggestion applying the dye down there was an awkward business the stuff stung her tender flesh too when she was through she giggled she looked different in a way shed never expected to be exotic ealstan said again vanai let out another giggle she knew what he meant by that he meant he really did want another round being able to laugh made it easier for her to let him have one she ended up enjoying it more than shed thought she would too the next morning she worked the spell that let her look like a forthwegian for a while ealstan hadnt yet left to cast accounts he nodded confirming shed worked the spell correctly it doesnt change your looks as much now he said but it does change them all right she said and left the flat without the shiver of terror she would have felt undisguised when she got down to the street what was she as far as the eye could tell just one forthwegian among many she wished she could go out as a kaunian among forthwegians but that hadnt always been easy even before the algarvians overran forthweg when she walked into the forthwegian apothecarys shop he nodded to her from behind his high counter a good day to you mistress thelberge he said vanai had taken to using the name ealstan gave her and what can i do for you so early since you seem to have a way of doing such things sir she said you might want to pass word to people who may be using dye to use it on all their hair she waited to see if he would understand if he didnt she intended to be as blunt as she had to a couple of years before when she was still living with her grandfather embarrassment would have paralyzed her no more she was a great deal harder to embarrass than she had been after a moment the apothecary nodded i know what youre saying mistress never you fear he paused ground a powder with mortar and pestle and with quite unnecessary vehemenceand added one more word algarvians aye vanai nodded algarvians well i will pass it along he said i think it may save a life or two and as long as youre here can i try and sell you anything vanai smiled no thanks unless youve got some particularly fine mushrooms im just out enjoying the morning air being able to come out and enjoy the morning air felt very fine indeed after the words had left her mouth she realized shed all but told the apothecary she was a disguised kaunian she worried about it less than she would have with any other forthwegian save ealstan but she couldnt help worrying some then the apothecary said as a matter of fact ive got some kaunian imperials herea customer who was short of cash gave them to me to pay for a bottle of eyewash he reached under the counter and brought out the splendid orange mushrooms vanais mouth watered what do you want for them she asked bracing herself for a hard haggle take a couple the apothecary said its not always easy to get out of the city aye he knew she was a kaunian all right she bowed her head my thanks she said softly and put two of the splendid mushrooms in her belt pouch thats not the first good turn youve done me she took the mushrooms and left the shop a couple of forthwegians who looked as if they were getting paid in spirits were pasting broadsheets on the walls when vanai stepped up and read one she winced the algarvians hadnt chosen to go yanking down everyones drawers at least not yet instead in the interest of internal security they were making the manufacture and possession of black or dark brown hair dye illegal after a moment though vanai started to laugh she thought the redheads were likely to blaze off their own toes with this edict kaunians werent the only ones it would hurt plenty of vain and aging forthwegians would want to keep the frost from showing in their hair and beards she doubted whether mezentios men would be able to make the prohibition stick indeed before she got back to the flat she heard several forthwegiansat least she presumed they were forthwegianscursing the new ordinance that made her laugh again sure enough if the forthwegian majority rejected this law the occupiers could make as much noise as they chose they wouldnt change anything much and if forthwegians got dye kaunians who looked like forthwegians would be able to get it too with those things on her mind vanai paid less attention to what was going on around her than she might have and got caught by an algarvian clipping patrol she queued up with the forthwegians and for all she knew other kaunians to wait for mezentios men to finish their duty with the hair on her head and that between her legs freshly dyed she was safe unless they had a mage with them they wont a small cold voice inside her said they need their mages to make weapons of war or to kill my people and she proved right an algarvian constable looking bored with the whole business snipped off a lock of her hair thanks to the dye it stayed dark the redhead nodded and jerked a thumb down the street going on he said vanai went on she would have to jeer at ealstan the algarvians hadnt thought to start checking peoples secret hair yet but then she realized jeering wouldnt do ealstan was right that was something the redheads would come up with and they probably wouldnt take long she muttered something vile she didnt look forward to dyeing herself there every couple of weeks for now though she was free to go through the streets of eoforwic the algarvians couldnt tell what she was neither could the forthwegian majority to the eye she was one of them she still wished she could go out and about as a kaunian since she couldnt this was the next best thing she remembered the mushrooms in her pouch not everyone hates me she whisperedbut even the whisper was in forthwegian not in the ancient language shed learned from birth the kuusaman physician nodded to fernao and said good day in her own tongue good day the lagoan mage said also in kuusaman hed always had an ear for languages and was quick to pick up words and phrases but when the physician went on she did so far too fast for fernao to follow slowly i beg you he said sorry said the physician a little dark woman named juhani she went on in her own speech again fernao didnt understand a word of it seeing as much she switched to classical kaunian do you know this language aye he answered i am fluent in it so you are juhani agreed more so than i perhaps i was saying that i took you for a countryman because of your eyes some of us wear kilts too but you come out of the west then aye fernao said again juhani studied him there must have been some urgent need to bring you out of the west with the injuries to your arm and leg there was fernao answered and said no more what he was doing in yliharma was no ones business but his own when the physician saw he was going to stay quiet she shrugged well by all the signs we can free your arm from its prison anyhow good the mage said it has been in plaster so long it feels much as if it had been in prison indeed you will not like it so well once it comes out of its shell juhani warned fernao only shrugged the physician went to work getting the cast off and she turned out to be right for one thing the arm that had been broken was only a little more than half as thick as the other and it also disgusted the mage because all the dead skin that would have sloughed off had been trapped by the cast he looked like a man with a horrible disease juhani gave him a jar of ointment and some rags she even helped him clean off the dead skin after they finished the arm smelled sweet and looked no worse than emaciated will my leg be the same way fernao asked tapping the plaster there i have no doubt it will look worse the physician said which made him shudder she went on were you in a leyline caravan accident or did you have a bad fall or fernao nodded that last one i chanced to be rather too close to an egg when it burst as you see i am nearly healed now for quite some time however i did not think the healers and mages had done me any favors by saving me never give up juhani said seriously things may get better things have got better for you have they not they have fernao admitted it would have been difficult for them to get worse he reached for his crutches as he did so he tried to imagine making quick complex passes with his newly freed arm he laughed quietly he couldnt do it not to save his life then he dipped his head to the physician as he levered himself to his feet my thanks mistress and what do i owe you for your services when she told him he blinked he would have paid twice as much in setubal everything was cheaper in yliharma but few things were so much cheaper seeing his surprise she said my husband serves the seven princes how can i enrich myself off someone who has already met the foe i can think of plenty of people who would have no trouble whatever fernao replied as he steadied himself on his crutches honor is where you find it i hope your husband stays safe he swung out to the street pausing in the doorway to pull the hood on his tunic up over his head a chilly drizzle was falling on the other side of the vaatojarvi hills from what pekka said it would be snow as far as fernao was concerned rain was bad enough anything that made the sidewalks slippery was bad he kept fearing he would fall just what id need to break one leg when the other ones finally healing he planted his crutches and his good foot with great care kuusamans on the sidewalk gave way before him when they saw he had trouble getting around that never would have happened in setubal there anyone who couldnt keep up with the bustling throngs was liable to get run down and trampled he had no trouble flagging a cab the driver helped him get inside again more considerate than a lagoan would have been where to the fellow asked that was another phrase fernao had learned the principality he replied grandmaster pinhiero had grumbled about paying for his stay there but yielded in the end fernao couldnt very well impose on ilmarinen as far as he could tell no one imposed on ilmarinen or siuntio and pekka was staying at the principality the more he learned from the kuusaman mages the more he talked shop with them the better off lagoas would be so hed told the grandmaster and hed actually made pinhiero believe it several hostels in setubal might have matched the principality but fernao wasnt sure any could have beaten it the room in which he dwelt was large and luxurious the food even in wartime was outstanding and he was convinced that at least half the people who worked in the principality spoke better lagoan than he did the doorman was one of those let me give you a hand sir he said and helped fernao up the stairs to the entrance going along on flat ground fernao thought he managed pretty well when he had to climb stairs he was glad for any help he could get once he made it into the lobby he flipped back the hood on his tunic and sighed with pleasure enjoying the warmth that radiated from several coal stoves he looked around wondering whether any of his kuusaman colleagues were around hed thought he might spot siuntio or ilmarinen but didnt though he wouldnt say they werent there till he made a trip to the bar hed taken a couple of hitching steps in that direction when someone called his name he stopped and looked aroundand there sat pekka not far from one of the stoves she waved to him come and join me if you care to she said in classical kaunian i would be very glad to he answered she had a skein of dark green yarn in her lap and a length of finished green cloth into which were inserted a pair of crocheting hooks if i am not the worst crocheter in the world i pity the poor woman who is pekka said would you care for a muffler master fernao you had better say aye for i cannot make anything else aye and thank you fernao said if i asked you for something with sleeves you would probably knit me to death with those things knitting needles are different pekka said i knit even worse than i crochet which is why i do not knit at all anymore she pointed to his newly freed arm i leave knitting to you and i am glad to see you are doing it well reminded of the arm he scratched it a very able lady physician named juhani took off the cast you kuusamans worry less about the differences between men and women than my people do pekka shook her head no that is not so she answered we worry less about differences in what men and women do than most other folk we know there are differences between men and women she smiled if there were not the world would have ended a long time ago or at least our place in it that is true enough fernao smiled too pekka rolled her eyes i wonder what my son is doing now down in kajaani something to drive my sister mad i have no doubt and speaking of the differences between men and women i never behaved that way when i was seven years old no fernaos chuckle threatened to become a belly laugh would your mother and father say the same thing about you i hope so pekka exclaimed their hair is still almost altogether dark mine i think will be white as snow by the time uto grows to manhood fernao ran a hand through his own coppery hair which was just beginning to be frosted with gray i have no children he said if my hair turns white overnight it may be on account of what you kuusamans have come up with that might do it to me too before saying anything more pekka looked around to see if anyone might be listening so did fernao he spotted no one close by pekka couldnt have either but she went on i mislike speaking of this in public shall we talk further in my rooms to a lagoan that might have been an invitation of one sort or an invitation of another sort altogether fernao asked what would your husband say if he heard you asking me there he would say that he trusted me pekka answered he would also say that he had reason to trust me i presume you would not try to prove him wrong now that you have spoken so of course not fernao said but i did wonder customs differ from one kingdom to another so they do but i am telling you how things are here i said all right once fernao replied not sure whether to be annoyed or amused if you do not believe me take back the invitation if i did not believe you master fernao i would do more than take back the invitation pekka sounded sterner than hed thought she could i would do everything i could to have you sent back to setubal and i think i could do it her smile had iron in itno she wasnt a woman of the sort fernao was used to dealing with she got up but now if you will come with me we can go up to my roomsand talk of business where pinhiero grumbled about paying the price of a room at the principality the seven princes had installed pekka in a suite far larger than the flat fernao called his own back in setubal he said with all this why did you bother coming down to the lobby at all i get lonely in here with nothing to look at but the walls pekka answered i would rather see open country as i do out behind my house down in kajaani but even the lobby and the street are better than walls fernao thought nothing of looking at the walls of his own flat for days on end hostel lobbies and city streets were his natural habitat as was true of any native of setubal as for open country hed seen more than hed ever wanted in the land of the ice people the only thing he could say about it was that he hadnt quite died there he didnt want to say anything at all about the land of the ice people instead he did talk of business if the implications of your experiments are what they seem to be as ilmarinen says even if they are i do not think we can exploit them pekka said and now she sounded even more angry than she had when shed warned what she would do if she didnt trust him i do not think memory can be conserved i am not at all convinced physical existence can be conserved the amount of energy released inclines me to doubt it how could we make an experiment to test that fernao asked do we not have more obviously urgent things to do pekka returned more obvious certainly fernao said more urgent i do not know do you after a bit of thought pekka shook her head she was honest maybe that was why she insisted on honesty from him algarvian soldiers guarded king gainibus palace these days as they had for more than two years seeing redheads in kilts there still irked krasta turning to colonel lurcanio in the carriage they shared she said you should have left the king an honor guard of his own people i her algarvian lover spread his hands he had fine handsan artists hands or a surgeons with long slim fingersand was vain of them my sweet it was not my decision that put them there it was grand duke ivones or perhaps king mezentios you may take your complaint to either one of them and i wish you joy of it youre making fun of me krasta said shrilly no only of your silly idea lurcanio answered most algarvians were excitable he was often excitable himself tonight he stayed calm probably because that annoyed krasta more he went on do you not see that a valmieran honor guard might easily decide its honor lay in rebellion that would be a nuisance to us and unfortunate for king gainibu as far as krasta was concerned gainibu was already unfortunate a prisoner in his own palace with nothing better to do than drink till the fact of imprisonment blurred along with everything else but after a moment she realized exactly what lurcanio meant youd kill him i this time lurcanio shook his head my countrymen it could be mezentios brother is king of jelgava his first cousin is king of grelz i am sure he has some other near kinsman who could do duty as king of valmiera of all the nerve krasta exclaimed lurcanio only smiled he might not be so reliably excitable as some of his countrymen but he had the full measure of algarvian arrogance krasta wanted to slap him but he would slap her back and he wouldnt care that he did it in public she cursed quietly but held still one of the algarvian guards approached the carriage and called a soft challenge in his own language lurcanios driver responded also in algarvian krasta heard lurcanios name and her own but understood nothing of what the driver said the guard laughed and withdrew lurcanio also laughed under his breath krasta looked daggers at him but to no avail agile despite his years lurcanio descended from the carriage and held out his hand to help krasta down step carefully my dear he said you would not want to trip on the cobbles in the darkness and turn your pretty ankle no i certainly wouldnt krastas voice was testy if youd beaten the lagoans by now i wouldnt have to fumble around in the dark you could let lights shine without drawing dragons once we settle unkerlant you may rest assured that lagoas is next on the list lurcanio said the statement would have been more impressive had he not chosen that moment to stumble he almost fell but caught himself by flailing his arms krasta didnt laugh colonel lurcanio shed learned was as touchy about his dignity as a cat she did say i wish lagoas didnt have to wait we had plans for setubal they did not work out quite as we would have wished lurcanio shrugged such is life something in his voice warned krasta against asking questions about what sort of plans the algarvians had had plans like the ones my brother wrote about she wondered she didnt want to believe that if what skarnu had written was true she walked arm in arm with a murderer or at least with an acquiescing accomplice to his kingdoms murders one thing at least lurcanio hadnt asked her any questions lately about her brother and though hed left the mansion two or three times in the past few weeks hed always come back on the grumpy side that told her he hadnt caught skarnuif hed gone out hunting her brother it also told him he hadnt caught some young pretty valmieran commoner which relieved her nearly as much once theyd passed into the palace through doors and curtains krasta paused and blinked till she got used to the explosion of light within beside her lurcanio was doing the same thing with a wry chuckle he said the lamps in this palace were made for happier safer times i fear well then algarve should go on and win the warive told you that already krasta said that would bring back the good timessome of them anyhow things wouldnt be so good as they had been if the algarvians kept on occupying valmiera but krasta didnt know what she could do about that aye you have told me that lurcanios voice was sour what you have not told me is exactly how to gain the victory that would be helpful you know when the war was young before valmiera was overrun krasta had come to the palace to present her ideas on winning the war to king gainibus soldiers they hadnt listened to her and what had their failure to listen got them only defeat she wasnt shy about speaking her mind to lurcanio now the first thing you ought to do is quit fighting over that stupid sulingen place powers above how long can a battle for one worthless unkerlanter city go on anyhow sulingen is not worthless sulingen is far from worthless lurcanio answered and the battle shall go on until we have won the victory we deserve sounds like foolishness to me krasta said with a sniff having delivered her pronouncement she stalked down the hall with her nose in the air lurcanio had to hurry after her and couldnt give her any more of his cynical retorts she didnt miss them shed already heard too many of that sort with her nose in the air she got the chance to appreciate the ornate paintings on the ceiling of the hallway some looked back to the time of the kaunian empire others showed kings of valmiera and their courts from the days when her kingdom was strong and the algarvians to the west weak and disunited those days were gone now worse luck the paintings though were only to be properly seen with ones nose in the air to krasta that in itself justified the aristocratic attitude a valmieran functionary checked her name and lurcanios off the list of guests for king gainibus reception that cheered krasta at her previous visit a redhead had done the job but before she could twit lurcanio about this tiny sign of valmieran autonomy an algarvian came up to check what her countryman had done again she kept quiet shed been in this hall many times including the evening when gainibu along with representatives from jelgava and sibiu and forthweg declared war on king mezentio and now the algarvians occupied all those kingdoms and only lands that had stayed neutral then still carried on the fight a lesson lurked there somewhere but krasta could not find it she and lurcanio got into the receiving line that snaked toward king gainibuand toward the algarvian soldiers and penpushers who really ran valmiera these days lurcanio said we must be earlyhis majesty is hardly even weaving yet that was cruel which didnt make it wrong from even a little distance gainibu looked every inch a king tall erect handsome the chest of his tunic glittering with decorationsmost of which were earned in the six years war not honorary only when krasta got closer did she note the glass of brandy in his left hand and the broken veins in his nose and eyes that said it was not the first such glass nor the hundred and first either shed seen the king far deeper into the bottle than this here now he still showed traces of the man hed once been that wouldnt last through too many more brandies marchioness krasta the king said aye he was better than usualhe didnt always remember who she was gainibu turned his wateryor spirituousgaze on lurcanio and the marchioness friend your majesty krasta and lurcanio murmured together krasta sounded respectful as a subject should lurcanio sounded aggrieved the king hadnt bothered remembering his name he got some of his own back by chatting in algarvian with the redheads who really ran valmiera since he was ignoring her krasta ignored him too she turned back to gainibu and said there will be better days your majesty will there the kingthe king who didnt even rule in his own palace any moreknocked back his brandy and signaled for another one it arrived almost at once he knocked it back too for a moment his features went blank and slack as if hed forgotten everything but the sweet fire in his throat but then he came at least partway back to himself the powers above grant that you be right milady but i would not hold my breath waiting for them as he had a moment before he waved for a fresh glass krasta left lurcanio and made a beeline for the bar tears stung her eyes she tossed her head so no one would see them the servitor asked how may i serve you milady he didnt know she was a noblewoman plenty of algarvians had brought commoners into the palace with them flesh counted for more than blood but he took no chances either krasta said brandy with wormwood aye milady the barman gave her what she wanted that was what he was for lurcanio came up behind krasta and asked for red wine when he saw the greenish spirit in her glass he said try not to drink yourself into a stupor this evening if you would be so kind you do not show your loyalty to your king by imitating him ill do as i please krasta said since she was a child shed done exactly thattill lurcanio forced his way into her life you may do as you please he said now so long as you also please me do you understand what i am telling you she turned her back i shall do as i please she repeated if that doesnt suit you go away she thought he would tell her to enjoy her walk home or something of the sort instead he spoke in tones so reasonable they startled her because your king has become a sorry sot do you have to as well you made him into a sorry sot krasta pointed at lurcanio as if to say hed done it personally he wasnt like that before the war losing is harder than winning i would be the last to deny it lurcanio said but you can yield or you can endure krasta thought of her brother again he was doing more than enduring he still resisted the algarvians and she shed yielded every time she let lurcanio into her bedindeed every time she let him take her to a reception like this oneshe yielded again but having yielded once she didnt know what else she could do now if shed been wrong about algarve when she yielded in the first place how could she make amends now admit to herself shed been selling herself and living a lie for the past two years she couldnt and wouldnt imagine such a retreat if i want to get drunk i will get drunk she told lurcanio that measured the defiance she had in her so much but no more the algarvian officer studied her then shrugged one of his kingdoms expressive shrugs have it your way he said if you will not see you are behaving like a fool and a child i cannot show you krasta strode back to the bar and demanded a fresh glass of spiked brandy shed won her tiny victory which was more than valmiera could say against algarve pekka and fernao rode a cab to siuntios home together one of fernaos crutches fell over and bumped her knee she handed it back to him here you are she saidher spoken classical kaunian was getting better by the day because she had to use it so much with the mage from lagoas my apologies he said he also used the tongue more freely than he had when he first came to yliharma i am a nuisance a crowd all by myself you are a man who was badly hurt she said patiently you ought to thank the powers above that you have regained so much of your health i do he said and then corrected himself now i do at the time and for some time afterwards i would have thanked them more had they let me die i can understand that pekka said your wounds were very painful fernaos grin had a skeletal quality to it you might say so he replied in saying so you would discover that words are not always adequate to describe the world around us in classical kaunian the sentiment sounded noble and philosophic pekka wondered how much torment it concealed a good deal surely femao did not strike her as the sort of man who would exaggerate suffering for sympathy if anything he used a dry wit to hold sympathy at bay most of the time that is true not only of things pertaining to the body pekka observed it is also why we have the mathematics of magecraft oh no doubt fernao said you are right thoughi was not thinking in mathematical terms they might have gone on with the philosophical discussion but the cab stopped then the hackman said were here folks thatll be three in silver hearing plain ordinary kuusaman startled pekka she paid the driver collected a receipt so shed be reimbursed and helped fernao out of the cab he stared at the cottage in which siuntio lived at the ivy that was all but naked because of the fall chill at the yellowing grass in front of the home the greatest theoretical sorcerer of the day deserves better he said i thought the same the first time i came here pekka answered i thought he deserved a palace grander than the prince of yliharmas but this place suits him not least because it has room enough for all his books as long as they are where he can get at them when he needs one or wants one in particular he cares little about anything else pekka understood that feeling she had a large measure of it herself fernao said i wish i could be that way but i am too much a part of the world not to wish i had more of what it can give along with more books and more time to read them he smiled that dry smile once more what i want is more of everything i suppose before pekka could answer the front door opened siuntio waved to fernao and her come in come in welcome welcome very glad you could drop by this morning he said once more making classical kaunian sound more like a living language than one maintained by scholars you had better hurry up ilmarinen got here half an hour ago and i cannot promise how long the brandy will hold out he smiled as he spoke but pekka wondered if he were joking ilmarinen liked his drink no doubt about it like fernao he didnt pull back from life on the contraryhe grabbed with both hands pekka supposed she ought to count herself lucky that he hadnt tried to grab her with both hands fernao made his slow way toward the door pekka walked alongside him ready to help if he stumbled he didnt hed had a good deal of practice on his crutches by now siuntio said good to see the two of you both for the work we can do together andhe lowered his voicebecause the three of us together may have some chance of keeping ilmarinen under control he stepped aside to let pekka and fernao move past him and into the house fernao got to the end of the foyer and stopped pekka was behind him in the narrow entry hall so she had to stop too he muttered something in lagoan that she didnt understand then caught himself and went back to classical kaunian master siuntio you had better search me when i leave otherwise i am liable to steal as much of your library as i can carry pekka giggled i said the same thing the first time i came here i suspect every mage who comes here for the first time says the same thing ilmarinen walked in from the kitchen sure enough he had a glass of brandy in his handand a raffish grin on his face not me he said i kept quietand walked out with whatever i happened to need ive been meaning to talk to you about that siuntio said which made all the mages laugh siuntio went on when i no longer have any use for these books they will go to someone who can profit from them till then i intend to hold on to them on to all of them he gave ilmarinen a severe look ilmarinens answering gaze was as serene as if hed never named himself a thief shall we get to work pekka said who knows what they are doing right this minute in algarve murdering people ilmarinen took a goodsized swig of brandy same as theyre doing in unkerlant and do you know whats worst he finished the brandy while the other sorcerers shook their heads whats worst is we dont always wake up screaming any more when they do it were getting used to it and if that isnt a judgment on us curse me if i know what it is he stared from one mage to the next daring them to disagree with him i had not thought of it so pekka said slowly but you may well be right when something dreadful happens for the first time it is a horror that lives in the memory forever when it happens again and again the mind grows numb the mind has to i think if it did not grow numb it would go mad were all mad ilmarinens voice remained harsh mistress pekka is right we need to work siuntio said if you will come with me to my study the hallways were lined with books too pekka asked master how hard was it to pick up everything after the algarvians attacked yliharma it was quite difficult and painful my dear siuntio answered many volumes were damaged and some destroyed outright a very sad time had he been in his study when the algarvians attacked he surely would have died buried by the books he loved so well bookshelves climbed the wall from floor to ceiling there were even two shelves above the door and two more above each window a ladder helped siuntio get to books he couldnt have reached without it can we all sit down fernao asked is there room enough around that table i think so i hope so siuntio sounded anxious i cleared it off as best i could its where i work hed piled the books and papers that had been on the table onto the desk or so pekka guessedsome of the piles on the desk looked newer and neater than others she wondered how many years or was it how many decades it had been since siuntio could work at that desk here she said doing her best to be brisk and practical we shall take these three seats and leave master fernao the one closest to the door no one disagreed with her she didnt think fernao could have squeezed his way between the bookshelves and the table to get to any of the other chairs she had trouble herself and she was both smaller than the lagoan mage and unburdened by crutches plenty of paper plenty of pens plenty of ink siuntio said like any theoretical sorcerer he disliked all the jokes about absentminded mages and did his best to show they shouldnt stick to him plenty of brandy ilmarinen added and plenty of tea if the one wont get your wits working maybe the other will plenty of references too in case we need to check anything fernao said as he had in the front room he looked around the study with covetous awe but siuntio shook his head few references for where we are going what we do here will become the reference work for those who follow us we are the trailblazers in this work we are references for one another too pekka added master siuntio and master ilmarinen and i have all used one anothers work to advance our own research and you have pulled a long way ahead of everyone else because of it fernao said i have been studying hard since i came to yliharma but i know i am still a long way behind you were useful in the laboratory pekka said which was true and you have more practical experience than any of us thinking of mages with practical experience reminded her of how much she missed her husband but leino was liable to get practical experience of a much nastier sort pekka pulled her thoughts back to the business at hand adding and that makes you likely to see things we may have missed ilmarinen sniffed he was the one who saw what others missed and took pride in doing so pulling a sheet of foolscap off the pile siuntio had set in the center of the table he inked a pen and got to work after a couple of ostentatious calculations he looked up and said i aim to nail down the possibilities that spring from the divergent series the ones having to do with the younger subjects i mean siuntio coughed be practical instead if you possibly can as mistress pekka implied we need as much practicality as we can muster that is practical if only you would see it ilmarinen started calculating again more ostentatiously than ever pekka wondered if he was right fernao seemed to think so or at least that there was some chance of it lamplight glittered from the gold frames of ilmarinens reading glasses as he scribbled they were almost the only concession he made to age pekka quickly lost herself in her own work she was used to being alone when she calculated but the presence of her colleagues didnt disturb her she asked siuntio a couple of questions he knew everything that was in the reference books why not hed written a good many of them she started when fernao shoved his paper across the table to her your pardon he said she blinked and smiled suddenly recalled to the real world fernao pointed to the last four or five lines hed written i want to find out if you think this expression forbidden in the context in which i am using it let me see pekka had to go back up the page to get her bearings as she worked her way down again her eyebrows rose my compliments she said passing the leaf of paper back to fernao i never would have thought of attacking the problem from this angle and aye i think the expression is permitted here if you expand it see what you have she wrote two quick lines under his work he leaned forward to see what shed done his face lit up oh that is pretty he said i would have done it with parallels instead and would have missed what the expansion shows this is betterand you will be able to test it in the laboratory pekka shook her head for two reasons i would not try it in a laboratorywe need open space i think to make sure we can do it without wrecking ourselves and our surroundings and we will not test it she gestured at herself and her kuusaman colleagues we will this time her gesture included fernao his smile got wider pekka smiled too and told him with this you have earned your place among us ilmarinen sniffed again pekka stuck out her tongue at him every so often ealstan made a point of walking by the edge of the kaunian quarter in eoforwic looking at the blonds reminded him that however much hed done by keeping vanai safe it was only a drop in the ocean too many far too many people went on suffering the algarvian constables were jumpier than they had been before vanais cantrip got into the kaunian quarter almost every time ealstan went near it they clipped a lock from his hair that didnt worry him he really was a forthwegian after all that any of his people could like the kaunians and wish them well seemed a notion alien to the redheads they certainly didnt want forthwegians wishing kaunians well new broadsheets went up every few days this is a kaunian war one shouted showing kaunian hands reaching into algarve from all directions another cried bring down the new kaunian empire it showed ancient algarvic warriors striding through the burning ruins of a kaunian town but kaunians werent the only ones the broadsheets savaged unkerlant is forthwegs foe too one of them told passersby another was more sweeping unkerlant is derlavals enemy that one showed all the continent east of unkerlant served up on a platter before a wildeyed king swemmel who was about to devour it with a mouth full of pointed fangs another broadsheet showed algarvian soldiers and men from plegmunds brigade marching side by side above the legend we are the shield of derlavai when ealstan saw one of those on a quiet street where nobody was paying him any attention he spat on it he was lucky in his timing an algarvian constable came round the corner a moment after hed let fly seeing him the redhead asked you living here no ealstan answered just on my way somewhere getting going then the constable told him and set a hand on the bludgeon he wore on his belt ealstan left in a hurry inside the kaunian quarter life tried to go on as it always had blonds bought and sold from one another although from the glimpses ealstan got of the goods they showed for sale they had little worth having and even in the kaunian quarter all the signs were in forthwegian or algarvian mezentios men had forbidden the kaunians to write their own language not long after they overran forthweg out from the kaunian distract came a squad of algarvian constables leading several dozen glumlooking blonds men women children they headed off toward the leyline caravan depot in the center of town fight ealstan wanted to yell at them run do something but he kept quiet for fear of what would happen if he shouted shame choked him the kaunians stolidly marched along did they not believe what would happen to them once they got into a caravan car ealstan didnt see how that could be not after so long did they fear what would happen to the blonds still in the quarter if they showed fight maybe that made more sense or maybe nothing made sense any more maybe the whole world had gone mad when the war started maybe i was the one who went mad ealstan thought maybe one day ill wake up and ill be home leofiig will be fine none of this will really have happened how tempting to believe that but ealstan knew too well he couldnt what he wanted and what was real wereand would staytwo different things and if he woke up from a dream he would wake up without vanai having her at his side made everything else pretty close to bearable he walked on through eoforwic into the richer parts of town broadsheets were fewer there as if the algarvians worried more about offending prosperous folk than the poor of the city and they probably did they squeezed more taxes out of the rich and relied on them to help keep the poor quiet in exchange for being let alone otherwise welltodo forthwegians were all too often willing to work hand in glove with the redheaded occupiers and one broadsheet he saw in the prosperous districts but nowhere else put things as starkly as could be unkerlant would be worse it read a lot of forthwegiansforthwegians of nonkaunian blood of courseprobably believed that but the broadsheet said nothing about a free and independent forthweg for ealstan that was the only thing worth having the doorman at ethelhelms block of flats still hadnt resumed his post outside the building ealstan supposed the fellow could use the cool rainy fall weather as an excuse his own opinion was that the doorman lacked the nerve to show his face on the street after the latest riots but no one much cared about his opinion hed seen that too many times to have any doubts and a good day to you sir the doorman nodded to him ethelhelm told me i was to expect you and here you are if ethelhelm said it it had to be trueso his tone implied here i am ealstan agreed in a hollow voice he wished he werent but ethelhelm was too good a client to throw over even if hed turned out not to be such a good friend sighing ealstan climbed the stairs to the drummer and bandleaders flat ethelhelm swung the door open as soon as he knocked the musician didnt seem to notice that ealstans liking for him had cooled good to see you he said aye very good to see you come in drink some wine if you care to i wouldnt turn down a cup thanks ealstan said ethelhelm always had something smooth and rich to drink in the flat why not ealstan couldnt think of many forthwegians who could afford it better today he poured from a jar of a splendid tawny vintage peering into his glass he said thats just about the color of a gyongyosians beard isnt it if you say so i wont quarrel with you ealstan answered i dont think ive ever seen a gyongyosian in the flesh he paused thought and shook his head im sure i havent cant imagine what a gyongyosian would have been doing in gromheort ethelhelm already knew where he was from ah well if you want to get technical ive never seen a gyongyosian either ethelhelm admitted im just going by what everybody says people do that too often ealstan said if forthwegians didnt go so often by what everybody said the kaunians in the kingdom would have had an easier time he wished he could say so to ethelhelms face he didnt dare especially not after the bandleader had seen vanai in her forthwegian semblance and drawn his own conclusions from it ethelhelm fed him olives and crumbly white cheese that went well with the wine then he said now youd better see if ive got any money left hed made that joke before the more often he made it the more he seemed to prosper ealstan assumed the same would hold true again but when he finished casting ethelhelms accounts he stared at his client powers above wheres your silver going youre the bookkeeper you tell me ethelhelms voice had an edge to it so did his smile thats hard to do when you havent got much in the way of receipts and when youre calling most of what youve spent miscellaneous expenses ealstan studied the books hed just worked up then glanced at the musician hed seen that sharp sour smile on other people his father among them when hed seen it on hestans face are you paying the redheads that much ethelhelm started then let out a rueful chuckle well i knew you were clever i wouldnt want you working for me if you werent clever now i have to live with it aye im paying the redheads that much he bared his teeth in what wasnt a smile at all anymore ill probably be paying them twice as much before too long too but why ealstan asked bewildered up till now they werent hitting you anywhere near this hard with seeming irrelevance ethelhelm answered when i saw you in the park with your forthwegian lady friendher names thelberge isnt that righti thought you were a pretty clever fellow youd had a liability or i think you had and you disposed of it times like these thats what youve got to do if you can a liability he was talking about vanai of course she wasnt a person in his mind only a problem ealstan glanced at his wineglass it was empty if it hadnt been he might have dashed its contents in ethelhelms face whats thelberge got to do with this he asked tapping the ledger cover with a fingernail you disposed of your liability ethelhelm repeated he stood up he was several inches taller than ealstan if narrower through the shoulders aye you disposed of yours how do i get rid of mine no matter how sharp he was ealstan needed a couple of heartbeats to understand when he did ice ran through him he said theyre squeezing you on account of your blood nothing else but the bandleader agreed mournfully and once algarvians start garbage like that it never gets better no it never gets better it just gets worse his laugh might have had broken glass in it of course if i dont like them squeezing me i can always go to the kaunian district thatd be jolly wouldnt it jolly it wasnt the word ealstan would have chosen he tapped the ledger again if they squeeze you a whole lot harder than this youre going to have trouble holding on to the flat here you know i was hoping youd tell me different because thats how it added up to me too ethelhelm answered im taking the band out on tour again as soon as i canas soon as the redheads let me i make more money touring than i do sitting here ill tell you that cant play eoforwic every day id wear out my welcome pretty cursed quick if i tried that made sense ethelhelm was a good businessman as well as a good musician ealstan had seen as much but the bandleader had made his accommodations with the occupiers and what had it got him only more trouble thinking aloud ealstan said youd have to sing whatever they wanted you to dont remind me ethelhelm said sourly sometimes i wish id never he didnt finish but ealstan had no trouble doing it for him i wish id never started bending in the first placehe had to mean something like that he went on i do think they will let me tour why shouldnt they the more i make the more they can steal from me thats what they do ealstan said thats what theyve done to the whole kingdom you thought you could stay free of it because you were already rich and famous all you had to do was make a little deal but bargains with the redheads always have more teeth than you see at first be thankful your problems are smaller than mine ealstan ethelhelm said smaller now anyhow ealstan nodded he didnt laugh in the bandleaders face but for the life of him he had trouble figuring out why not seventeen snow clung to the branches of pine and fir and spruce in the endless woods of western unkerlant snow covered the leaves fallen from birch and beech and poplar snowflakes danced in the air they were very prettyfor anyone who could take the time to watch them istvan couldnt have a care he called to the men of his squad the unkerlanters will be able to spy our trails well see theirs too sergeant szonyi said and well make them pay for it corporal kun took off his spectacles so he could blow a snowflake from one of the lenses when he set them back on his nose he cursed theyre fogged up he grumbled how am i supposed to see when theyre fogged up what difference does it make istvan asked half the time you dont pay attention to what you do see he grinned at kun for one thing thats a lie kun wasnt grinning he enjoyed ruffling other peoples feathers but didnt care to have his own ruffled for another i see more than you know he peered at istvan through the possibly befogged spectacles doing his best to look clever and mysterious that best only made istvan snort you were a mages apprentice kun not a mage on your own hook if you saw as much as you want us to think you do youd have all the privileges of an officer like that dowser named borsos back on obuda i can see some things about you kun sounded hot for instance istvans temper kindled too can you see that im a sergeant youd better be able to see that by the stars you couldnt even see that he looked around everyone within earshot already know was already part of the dread secret the squad shared you couldnt even see we were eating goat before we did it dont you blame me for that kun said furiously you were the one who wanted to knock over the unkerlanters for what they had in their stewpot stuff a legging in it both of you szonyi hissed somebodys coming up to the line kun and istvan fell silent at once istvan hoped his secret would stay secret till he took it to the graveand afterwards too for they sometimes exhumed goateaters and scattered their remains he knew a certain amount of relief when he saw captain tivadar coming up to the front he couldnt betray the secret to his company commander for tivadar already knew it but the captain had someone with him a tubby fellow who looked nothing whatever like kun but put istvan in mind of him even so as soon as istvan saw the sorcerers star pinned to the strangers tunic he understood why whats up sir he asked captain tivadar i dont know tivadar answered nobody knows not exactly but the unkerlanters are up to something thats whats brought colonel farkas here up to the front to see if he can find out what it is a mage with the nominal rank of colonel was an important fellow indeed istvan wasted no time in saluting he said we havent noticed anything out of the ordinary sir his eyes slid to kun whod been bragging about how much he could see kun had the grace to look down at the snow between his boots breath smoking as he spoke szonyi asked its not the horrible magecraft the unkerlanters threw at us a while ago is it when we looked like breaking through i mean he sounded anxious as far as istvan was concerned he had a right to sound anxious istvan couldnt imagine any man wanting to go through that terrible sorcery twice he couldnt imagine anybody wanting to go through it once either but hed had no choice about that farkas jowls wobbled as he shook his head no i do not think this would be so dramatic as the accursed murderous spell swemmels men used there this would be something subtler something more devious something the average man even the average mage might have trouble noting till too late kun sent istvan a look that said there istvan ignored him he said sir the unkerlanters are a lot of different things but devious isnt any of them not the way you mean theyre sneaky fighters but their mages dont know about anything but hitting us over the head i do not think this is an unkerlanter spell colonel farkas answered i fear it may be the same one the kuusamans used this past summer to help drive us off the island of obuda istvan kun and szonyi all exclaimed then it was the first any of them had heard that gyongyos had lost the island tivadar was nodding he must have already known to farkas he said these men previously fought on obuda i see the mage said but they have been here in the east for some time tivadar nodded farkas looked disappointed too bad they might have helped me detect the cantrip were things otherwise how did the unkerknters get their hands on this spell sir if the kuusamans were the ones who made it istvan asked farkas scowled all our foes hate us all our foes plot against us it was to be hoped that our algarvian allies who also war on kuusamo and unkerlant both would have been able to keep them from joining hands to harm us but such was not the case whether by way of the broad oceans of the north or through the narrow sea the evil knowledge was passed what is the nature of the spell sir kun asked farkas seemed to notice him for the first time you have some small measure of the gift he said it was not a question kun bowed showing the military mage more respect that istvan had ever seen him give anyone else farkas said perhaps you can assist me sir it would be an honor kun replied farkas tugged at his beard which showed gray streaks in the midst of the golden brown aye perhaps you can indeed you have not met the spell but you have come to know this great brooding wood tell me what you would have me do and i will do it with all my heart kun said istvan hadnt heard him sound so eager either farkas tugged at his beard again considering after a moment he nodded and his jowls shook again very well it is not without risk but risk you are acquainted with a lucky star must have shone on your captain when he chose to bring me here now hearken to me as i said before the nature of the spell is subtle it is a lulling a dimming a weakening of the senses so that the deceitful foe may glide past our outposts and seize positions of advantage the unkerlanters ought to use it against algarve then not just us szonyi said why have we got all the luck because it was crafted against us behind the curly tangle of farkas beard the corners of his mouth turned down the algarvians are strong in certain sorceries weak in certain others as are we in most cases the differences between what one folk and another knows are of little import here his expression grew more sour still here the kuusamans are strong where we are weak and exploited our weakness with nasty cunning have we learned how to cope with it since they turned it on us istvan asked he cared nothing for the fancy details but he had a good eye for what really mattered farkas voice was dry we have hope sergeant aye we have hope would they have brought the distinguished colonel here if he could not stop the miserable unkerlanters captain tivadar asked in reproving tones who knows istvan thought back there in gyovvar does ekrekek arpad have any notion of the kind of war we re fighting here so far away he didnt know the answer to that question he did know hed end up in trouble if he opened his mouth out of turn and so he only shook his head and waited to see what the highranking mage would do what farkas did at first was put his head together with kun the sorcerers apprentice pointed east and a little south farkas nodded he said aye i gauge that to be the proper direction too nowyou will be so good as to procure for me a spiderweb behind the lenses that helped them see better kuns eyes widened he gestured at the snowy landscape in this sir farkas merely looked impatient will you help me with all your heart as you said or will you fume and complain off kun went muttering under his breath to paw through ferns and bushes and examine pine boughs istvan guessed he would be a long time volunteering again to the sergeants amazement he did find a web here you are sir he said turning the mages title of respect to one of reproach farkas said my thanks as if hed expected nothing less from kun istvan wouldnt have wanted to be on the receiving end of the look kun blazed at farkas but the military mage got to work without even noticing it that made kun angrier than ever it would have angered istvan too as far as the rich and powerful were concerned common folk might as well have been beasts of burden holding the scrap of web above his head farkas looked up to the sky through it part of his chant was in the old hieratic language of gyongyos which istvan recognized but did not understand part was in another tongue altogether in an interested voice captain tivadar asked is that kaunian from out of the east aye farkas answered on reaching a point where he could stop it is a subtle tongue and painful experience on the islands has taught us that we need subtlety to detect and neutralize this sorcery he kept looking through the spiderweb istvan wondered if it let him see the holy stars despite daylight and cloud cover if it did what were the stars showing him istvan got the answer to that in short order there are mages familiar with the nasty kuusaman spell on that bearing farkas pointed toward the southeast not quite in the same direction kun had before he did some more incanting this time all in hieratic gyongyosian kun joined him in a few of the responses if there was risk in what he did istvan couldnt see it at last farkas said the distance is just over a mile have we eggtossers far enough forward to reach them his tone said tivadar had better be able to produce such eggtossers and tivadar nodded sir we do he took a map from his belt pouch studied briefly and made a mark on it when he showed farkas the mark the military mage nodded tivadar gave szonyi the map take this back to the tossers in the clearing tell em to pound that spot with everything they have aye captain szonyi saluted and hurried away the map clutched in his big fist farkas said i notice that several men here have the identical scar on their left hands what does it mean sergeant would you tell me his goldenbrown eyes speared istvan istvan spluttered and stammered ice walked up his back telling the truth was the last thing he wanted to do his face heated taken by surprise he had trouble coming up with a plausible lie captain tivadar did it for him speaking in casual tones some few of these veterans have sworn blood brotherhood one with another you see the marks from the wounds that went with the oaths ah farkas inclined his head in grave approval the marks of warriors the marks of warriors istvan found his tongue aye sir a few minutes later eggs started bursting onhe hoped they were onthe unkerlanter position he hoped they slew those devious mages even so he had the feeling hed escaped worse danger from farkas than anything the unkerlanters could have given him goateater no the mark inside him would never go away leudasts leg twinged under him he had the feeling he would be able to foretell bad weather with his wound as long as he lived he still limped but he could get around on the leg and so the unkerlanters had handed him a stick and thrown him back into the fight against the invaders as a sergeant hed been given a platoon here in the low rolling hills northeast of sulingen his company commander was a very young lieutenant named recared recared was either impeccably shaved where most of his countrymen were bristly or else more likely couldnt raise a beard no matter what leudast missed captain hawart missed him and wondered if he still lived he doubted hed ever find out recared liked to hear himself talk as night slowly and reluctantly yielded to day he said you men know that when the sun rises behind us we attack aye leudast chorused along with the rest of the soldiers recared was haranguing he wished the lieutenant would shut up if they didnt know what they were supposed to do by now one more lecture wouldnt get it through their heads but recared went right on maybe he used lecturing to fight the fear that went with battle we attack to the west he said wenot the cursed algarvians we and all the eggtossers and behemoths and dragons we could gather here brought through the mamming hills and up over the wolter we attack to the west and marshal rathars other army miles and miles away will attack to the east we will meet in the middle and cut off all the stinking redheads down in sulingen aye the men chorused again this time with fierce hunger in their voices if everything went the way it should they would make mezentios men sorry theyd ever thrust their noses into unkerlant if but with algarvians you never could tell leudast had seen that too often to his sorrow and nearly to his destruction that made him think of something else he stuck up his hand may i say a word sir recared didnt look happy at the idea of anyone else talking but nodded go ahead sergeant thank you sir leudast turned to the waiting soldiers remember boys what weve got in front of us isnt algarvians we have a big kingdom here and theyre stretched too thin to hold all the line themselves itll be yaninans and whatever other odds and sods they can scrape up ive fought those buggers and ive fought the algarvians too give me yaninans any day the soldiers whod gone against king tsavellas men nodded and began telling their friends what cowards the yaninans were recared slapped leudast on the shoulder that was well said he told him a moment later the lieutenant turned and looked back over his shoulder he pointed to a tiny gleam seen for a moment through clouds the sun he cried leudast wasnt sure it really was the sun but officers higher than recared must have thought so too eggtossers began hurling death at the yaninans huddled in their tents and holes and trenches leudasts eyebrows flew up at the number of eggs bursting on the enemy neither his own folk nor the algarvians had managed to put so many tossers on one narrow stretch of line very often dragons painted rockgray flew low overhead some had eggs slung beneath their bellies others flew unburdened to protect their comrades and to flame the luckless yaninans leudast took off his fur hat and waved it at the dragonfliers every enemy soldier they and the eggtossers killed or wounded was an enemy who couldnt kill or wound him chainmail clattering with every great stride they took behemoths lumbered forward leudast waved his hat at their crews too he knew his countrymen had been gathering them as lieutenant recared had said as with the eggtossers he hadnt known so many had made their way here but then he hadnt been here very long himself recared proved himself an officer by blowing a long piercing blast on the whistle he wore round his neck forward he shouted forward leudast echoed he had no whistle but hed long since got used to doing without king swemmel urra urra the unkerlanter soldiers echoed as they swarmed out of their trenches swemmel urra some men linked arms with their comrades and charged on together doing their best to keep up with the behemoths what had been the yaninan lines were now a smoking cratered jumble after the pounding theyd taken leudast couldnt see how anything could remain alive in them but his countrymen started fallingnot in enormous numbers as happened when an attack went wrong but here and there now one now another eggtossers on the behemoths pounded positions where the yaninans held out in some strength footsoldiers overran the rest urra leudast roared and jumped down into a battered trench he landed on a dead yaninan noticing only because he didnt hit the ground so hard as he thought he would a moment later a live yaninan came out of a hole his hands high terror twisting his face leudast took what food he had black bread and moldy sausageand let him live urra he shouted again and ran on every so oftenalmost surely in the places where they had good officers the yaninans fought hard but tsavellas men had next to no behemoths and few heavy sticks that might penetrate the armor the unkerlanter beasts wore few enemy dragons flew either leudast looked around a little past noon and was astonished at how far hed come recared had come all that way too its a rout sir leudast exclaimed he sounded drunk but he hadnt had enough spirits in his water bottle to get him high this is what victory feels like he thought dazedly hed fought yaninans before hed beaten them before but that had been only a skirmish and part of the unkerlanter armys long retreat to sulingen his comrades and he werent retreating any more they were moving forward and the yaninans could not stand in their way king tsavellas men fought more bravely now than they had then they kept trying to hold back the unkerlanter flood and they forced pauses but never for long behemoths and dragons and eggs raining down from fastmoving tossers soon overwhelmed them it was leudast thought the way the algarvians had won so many victories against his own countrymen curse me if our officers havent learned something after all but especially after their first lines were breached most of the yaninans either ran away or threw down their sticks and threw up their hands they went into captivity with smiles on their facesrelieved smiles at still being alive or sheepish smiles at being captured in a kingdom that didnt belong to them not my war one of them said in oddly accented unkerlanter as he surrendered to leudast algarves war he spat on the dirt this for algarve aye that for algarve leudast spat too so what were you doing fighting for the redheads then i no fight they blaze me the yaninan answered to unkerlanter eyes he was a sorry scrawny little man with a mustache too big for his face he shrugged and shivered i fight till now go on leudast pointed back toward the east lots of scrawny little yaninans were shambling off into captivity they held their hands high to keep king swemmels advancing soldiers from blazing them leudast knew a certain amount of sympathy for the yaninan he hadnt wanted to go into the unkerlanter army either when the impressers grabbed him though hed had no choice king swemmels servants might not have been so gentle as just to blaze him had he tried to tell them no that night he and lieutenant recared and half a dozen soldiers crowded into an abandoned peasant hut recared was jubilant we have them on the run by the powers above he said they cant hold us back once we broke through this morning we sealed their fate aye so far so good leudast agreed rubbing his leg it ached he hadnt expected to use it so hard he wished he could rest it come tomorrow but hed be marching just as hard then and he knew it he also didnt want recared making too much of what the army had accomplished you have to remember these are only yaninans itll be a lot tougher when we have to deal with the redheads most of the men in the hut had seen more action than recared several of them nodded but recared said dont you see it doesnt matter aye the algarvians are tough but there arent enough of them to go around if we break through these weak sisters we can cement our positions and make the algarvians try to bang their way out of sulingen against us leudast didnt like the prospect of algarvians trying to bang their way out of anywhere especially not if they were going to try to do it through a position he was holding theyd already pulled off too many astounding and appalling things why wouldnt they be able to manage one more but no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than a possible answer occurred to him thoughtfully he said theres already snow on the ground mezentios men dont do so well in snow he didnt love snow himself but if he wasnt better in it than any algarvian ever born what good was he he rolled himself in his blanket huddled up against the rest of the unkerlanters in the tumbledown shack and slept if not well then well enough recared roused the soldiers before sunup we go hard today he said we go as hard tomorrow then with luck the next daywe win glory for our king this is the most efficient attack weve ever carried out there leudast could hardly argue with him most of what he ate for breakfast was what hed stolen from yaninans that was efficient too he wiped his hands on his tunic left the hut and tramped east till noon or a little after everything went as it had the day before scattered and stubborn regiments of yaninans fought hard their countrymen went right on giving up by the hundreds by the thousands then the first algarvian dragons appeared overhead some of them dropped eggs on the unkerlanters others attacked their footsoldiers and wherever they could their behemoths staring at the burnt carcass of a behemoth roasted in its own chainmail leudast cursed i knew we werent going to have it all our own way he told the cloudy sky he waited for algarvian footsoldiers to stiffen the yaninans too but no redheads came to the rescue of king tsavellas men and there were more unkerlanter dragons in the air than those belonging to their enemies the algarvian dragonfliers stung the unkerlanter army in a few places without steady soldiers on the ground to back them up they could do no more than sting recared had guessed four or five days he was young he believed things always went just as planned that made him overoptimistic but just over a week after the unkerlanters started their push leudast saw men coming toward him who did not shy away as the yaninans did they were solid blocky men in long tunics men who shouted in delight when they saw him he folded one of them into a bear hug by the powers above weve got the redheads in a sack he shouted and tears of joy streamed down his grimy unshaven cheeks step it up there sergeant werferth shouted its not a game you lugs we dont get to start over move curse you all sidroc did some cursing of his own he was cold and tired and hungry he wanted to hole up somewhere with a bottle of brandy and a roast goose he hadnt fully realized when he joined plegmunds brigade that there was no such thing as time off when the underofficers and officers set over him told him to do something he had to do it hed already seen the sorts of things that happened to men who didnt do as they were told he wasnt interested in having any of those things happen to him he scratched he itched too he itched everywhere when he complained about it the trooper nearest him the ruffian named ceorl started to laugh youre a lousy whoreson just like the rest of us he meant it literally sidroc needed a moment to realize that when he did he started cursing all over again hed grown up in a prosperous household in gromheort lice were for filthy people for poor people not for the likes of him but he was filthy he could hardly help being filthy when he slept indoors at all he slept in huts that had belonged to filthy unkerlanter peasants if they had liceand they likely didhow could he help getting them for that matter he was poor nobody got rich on the pay in plegmunds brigade come on werferth shouted again with profane embellishment swemmels bastards went and gave algarve a boot in the nuts and now its up to us to pay em back and well do it too right im going to pay somebody back for making me slog through this miserable freezing country sidroc growled ceorl laughed again even less pleasantly than before you think its cold now wait a couple months your jointll freeze off when you whip it out to take a leak powers below eat you too but sidroc made sure he spoke lightly ceorl was not a man to curse in earnest unless you intended to back up the words with fists or knife or stick an algarvian captain swaggered along looking altogether superior to the forthwegians around him sidroc didnt think he was lousy no lice would have dared crawl through that perfectly combed coppery hair but even the officer looked worried as werferth had said the unkerlanters had hit algarve where it hurt up to us to save their bacon boys the sergeant said but its our bacon too that army in sulingen goes up in flames we burn with it where nothing else had that got sidrocs attention he didnt want to die anywhere he especially didnt want to die here in the chilly wastes of southern unkerlant i see how swemmels men got to be such whoresons he said to ceorl if i lived in this miserable place id be mean too the ruffian laughed the smoke from his breath puffing out as he did im from forthweg by the powers above and im the meanest whoreson around anybody who says different ill deal with him shut up ceorl werferth said you want to be a mean son of a whore take it out on the unkerlanters not on my ears ceorl scowled at him but werferth was not only a tough customer himself he was also a sergeant if ceorl tangled with him he didnt tangle with him alone but also with the entire structure of plegmunds brigadeand ultimately with the algarvian army to which the brigade was attached keep your eyes open ears too werferth added were liable to run into irregularsand were liable to run into real unkerlanter soldiers to boot since they came swarming out at us powers above only know where theyre all at right now sidrocs head swiveled now to one side now to the other all he saw were snowcovered fields by the way his sergeant and the algarvian officers had warned the brigade those fields might hold thousands of bloodthirsty unkerlanters in white smocks every one of them ready to spring to his feet and charge with a roar of urra they might sidroc didnt believe it not for a minute the fields were just fields the barebranched woods farther away just woods he didnt see any unkerlanters anywhere nobody rose up out of the fields with fierce shouts of urraor with any other shouts for that matter the countryside having been fought over was as empty and dead as it looked and that suited him like most soldiers he was no more anxious to fight than he had to be hed enjoyed terrorizing peasant villages back in the duchyno the kingdomof grelz that was about his speed he would have been perfectly happy to go right on doing it but the unkerlanters had pissed in the stewpot of the algarvian campaign and so here he was soldiering for real dragons someone exclaimed in alarm pointing south sidroc stared that way in no small alarm himself but only for an instant the next thing he did was look around for a hole into which he might dive he wasnt thrilled with real soldiering but hed learned what mattered theyre ours werferth said in some relief ceorl challenged him how do you know he might not want to brawl with the sergeant but he didnt mind giving him a hard time but werferth had an answer for him because theyre turning away from us instead of dropping eggs on our heads thin and faint in the distance several eggs burst one after another sidroc laughed no theyre dropping em on the unkerlanters instead those bastards deserve it i hope they all get smashed to bits they wont sergeant werferth spoke with gloomy certainty and itll be up to the likes of us to stop the ones whore left you can count on that too now he pointed south wherever those eggs are bursting thats where swemmels men are at if we can hear the eggs they arent that far away you want to go home to mother in one piece stay awake going home to mother was not a choice sidroc had an algarvian egg had taken care of that back when the redheads overran gromheort and here he was doing his best to get the algarvians out of the soup he shook his head as he trudged along hed watched mezentios men ever since they entered his kingdom they were strong they had style theyd smashed forthweg into the dust by joining them didnt he make himself strong and stylish what hed made himself so far was cold and nervous he trudged up to the top of a low rise and got the chance to do some pointing himself isnt that a village up ahead here on this side of the stream that is a village an algarvian officer behind him had heard his question and chose to answer it he spoke his own language expecting sidroc to understand the name of the village is presseck the stream is also the presseck there is a bridge over the presseck in the village we will occupy the village we will hold the bridge we will keep the unkerlanters from crossing it aye sir sidroc said the redheads liked polite soldiers they had plenty of ways to make you sorry if you werent polite too sidroc had learned that back in his first training camp outside of eoforwic a few unkerlanter peasantsold men and boyscame out of their huts to gape at the troopers from plegmunds brigade their women stayed in hiding or maybe theyd run away presseck looked to be as miserable a place as any other unkerlanter village sidroc had seen the presseck however was more nearly a river than a stream and the bridge that spanned it a solid stone structure sergeant werferth pointed to that bridge you see why we may have to hold this place boys the unkerlanters could put behemoths over it easy as you please and we wouldnt have a whole lot of fun if they did along with his comradesexcept for the two squads the algarvian officers ordered across to the south side of the pressecksidroc ransacked the village the women had fled there wasnt much food in presseck either by the time the soldiers finished there was less mist rose from the stream as the sun set and day cooled toward evening it spread through the village turning the shacks into vague ghosts of themselves stay alert werferth told his squad anybody the unkerlanters kill hell answer to me the troopers had to work that one through before they chuckled or snorted sidroc drew sentry duty just before dawn he paced the narrow filthy streets of presseck wishing he could see farther through the fog once he almost blazed one of his own countrymen whod taken on too much in the way of spirits and was looking for a place to heave it got lighter little by little without clearing much sidroc was beginning to think about breakfast and maybe even a little sleep when from the south he heard heavy footfalls and the jingle of chainmail behemoths he exclaimed and ran toward the bridge he couldnt see a thing though he wasnt the only one there to try the algarvian officer whod told him the name of the village stood staring across the presseck the redhead couldnt see anything either whose beasts are those he called urgently to the men on the south side of the stream when they didnt answer fast enough to suit him he ran across the bridge to see for himself his boots clattered on the stone he hadnt got more than halfway across when a glad cry rang out theyre ours sir the algarvian kept running a moment later he too shouted happily staring through the fog sidroc saw several great shapes moving toward him on the bridge sure enough the lead behemoth wore algarvianstyle chainmail and was draped in banners of green red and white so was the second the third with sunrise the breeze picked up the mist swirled and billowed when sidroc got a good look at the third behemoth he froze for a moment in horror worse than any hed ever imagined then he shouted as loud as he could its a trick theyre unkerlanters he was right it did him no good whatever by then the first behemoth which wore captured armor and false colors had almost reached his end of the bridge its crewwho he saw had even dyed their hair to make the imposture betterstarted tossing eggs into presseck those bursts woke men sidrocs shout hadnt woke them too often to terror and torment sidroc blazed at the unkerlanters but they like their behemoths were well armored the beast thundered forward onto the north bank of the presseck then the one behind it also disguised gained the northern bank after them came a long column of behemoths honestly unkerlanter a heavy stick started a fire in one of the huts in presseck the men of plegmunds brigade fought the unkerlanters as hard as they could they slew a good many of the men aboard the behemoths and even a couple of the massive animals themselves but they had no hope of holding the bridge or driving the foe back over the presseck along with his comrades sidroc battled on till hope and a good many of the men died and at the last he and the rest of the troopers still alive did what they had to do they fled cornelu patted his leviathan not a command a gesture of affection do you see how lucky we are he said to the beast we get to go north for the winter back in the lost and distant days of peacetime many people from lagoas and kuusamoaye and from sibiu toohad gone on winter holiday to the subtropic beaches of northern jelgava to lie on the sand burdened by a minimum of clothing if by any at all and to drink the citrusflavored wines for which the kingdom was famous love affairs in jelgava had filled the pages of trashy romances but if anyone went on holiday there these days it was algarvian soldiers recuperating from the dreadful cold of unkerlant as far as the leviathan was concerned cold wasnt dreadful it preferred the waters of the narrow sea to those off the coast of jelgava why not plenty of blubber kept it warm and the narrow sea swarmed with fish and squid pickings were thinner in these parts but the leviathan didnt go hungry here when a fat tunny swam past it gave chase and ran the fish down it was a big tunny the leviathan had to make two bites of it the water turned red that might draw sharks but they would be sorry if they came at cornelus signal the leviathan stood on its tail so he could see farther two mountains were visible to his right one to his left one of the mountains to his right had a notch in its slope he nodded and signaled that the leviathan might relax back into the water we are where were supposed to be he said urging his mount closer to the shore before long he could hear waves slapping the beach he halted the leviathan at that point not wanting to get so close as to risk stranding it he hadnt come all the way to the far north with luck the beach would be desertedexcept for the man he was supposed to pick up after inflating a small rubber raft he told the leviathan stay and used the taps on the animals smooth slick hide that turned the order into something it could grasp such a command wouldnt hold it there indefinitely but he didnt intend to be gone long then he struck out for the shore at first he thought the beach altogether empty that wasnt the way things were supposed to be he wondered if something had gone wrong if the algarvians had nabbed the man he was supposed to get they were liable to be lying in wait for him too he wished his line of work had no risks attached but things didnt work that way he kept on pushing the raft toward the beach some of the waves were bigger than theyd looked from out to sea riding them on the raft gave him some hint of what a leviathan felt like when gliding effortlessly through the water certain savages on the islands of the great northern sea hed read rode the waves upright standing on boards hed thought that barbaric foolishness when he saw it in print now he realized it might be fun then a wave curled over him and plunged him into the water knocking away the raft had he not been fortified with a leviathanriders spells he might have drowned he clawed his way to the surface and recaptured the raft maybe those waveriding savages werent so smart after all water dripping from his rubber suit he splashed up onto the beach overhead a gull mewed sandpipers scurried by the oceans edge now and then pecking at something or other in the wet sand as far as he could tell he had the beach to himself but for the birds hallo he called ready to fight or to dive back into the sea and try to escape if algarvians answered him on that wide empty strand his cry seemed as small and lost as the gulls and then a moment later an answering hallo floated to his ears almost a quarter of a mile to the north a small figure came up over the top of a sand dune and waved in his direction waving back he walked toward the other man he waddled awkwardly because of the rubber paddles on his feet call me belo he said the lagoan phrase hed been given back in setubal call me bento the other man replied also in lagoan cornelu didnt think the other fellow was a lagoan though small and slight and swarthy with black hair and slanted eyes he looked like a fullblooded kuusaman whatever he was he was no fool recognizing the fivecrown emblem on the left breast of cornelus rubber suit he said sib eh how much lagoan do you speak not much cornelu switched languages classical kaunian will do aye it generally serves the man who called himself bento said in the same tongue leaving will also do and do nicely i dont think they are on my track but i dont care to wait around and find out i am wrong either i can see how you would not cornelu pointed back toward the raft we can go you are sorcerously warded against travel in the sea i came here by leviathan bento said i have not been here long enough for the protections to have staled wasting no more time on conversation he stripped off his tunic and trousers and started toward the raft pushing it out through the booming waves proved harder than riding it to the beach had been but cornelu and bento managed after theyd reached the calmer sea farther from shore cornelu helped the smaller man into the raft then swam toward the waiting leviathan pushing bento ahead of him as he swam he asked why did they send a kuusaman down into jelgava because i knew what needed doing bento answered placidly that might even have been his real name it sounded almost as kuusaman as lagoan could they not have found someone of kaunian blood who knew the same things whatever they are cornelu said he knew better than to ask spies about their missions still you are not the least conspicuous man in jelgava looking as you do bento laughed in jelgava i did not look this way to eyes there i was as pale and yellowhaired as any kaunian i abandoned the sorcerous disguise when i needed it no longer ah cornelu said so bento was a mage then that came as no real surprise i hope you put sand in the algarvians salt a lagoan might have bragged even a sibian might have bento only shrugged and answered i sowed some seeds perhaps when they will come to ripeness or if they will grow tall is anyones guess ah cornelu said again this time acknowledging that he recognized he wouldnt get much out of bento he looked around for the leviathan which obligingly surfaced just then not more than fifty yards away a fine animal bento said in tones that implied he knew leviathans but lagoan not sibianor am i mistaken no that is so cornelu said how did you know how strong a mage are you was the unspoken question behind the one he asked but bento only chuckled i could tell you all manner of fantastic lies but the truth is the animal wears lagoan harness i have seen what sibiu uses and it attaches round the flippers rather differently oh well cornelu had already seen that bento didnt miss much the fellow tabbed him for a sibian right away you notice things quickly they are there to be noticed bento replied cornelu grunted in response to that the kuusaman laughed at him and now you are thinking i am some sort of sage subsisting on melted snow and he spoke a couple of words of classical kaunian cornelu couldnt catch what was that the leviathanrider asked reindeer dung bento answered in lagoan which jerked a startled laugh from cornelu returning to the language of scholarship bento continued it is not so i like roast beef as well as any man and i like looking at pretty womenand doing other things with themas well as any man too some of the jelgavan women are pretty enough cornelu observed bento shrugged you would be likelier to think so than would i because kaunian women look more like those of sibiu than like those of kuusamo to me most of them are too big and beefy to be appealing cornelu shrugged too hed been married to a woman who suited him fine the trouble was shed suited the officers the algarvians billeted in his house too of course sibians and algarvians were closest kin maybe that proved bentos point cornelu wished he could stop thinking about costache thinking about janira helped but even thinking about the new woman in his life couldnt take away the pain of the old ones betrayal he couldnt ask bento much about what hed been doing in jelgava instead he chose a question that had to do with occupation which was also on his mind whenever he thought of costache how do the kaunians up here like living under algarvian rule about as well as you would expect they do not like it much bento answered kaunians like it even less than other folk because of what the redheaded barbarians in kilts are doing to their people in forthweg he raised an eyebrow no offense intended i assure you none taken cornelu said dryly redheaded barbarians in kilts could apply to sibians as readily as to algarvians the kaunians of imperial days doubtless had applied it impartially to cornelus ancestors and to lagoans and to other algarvic tribes that no longer kept their separate identities cornelu said were you helping them feel even happier about living under algarvian rule something like that perhaps bento said smiling at the irony if mezentio needs more men to garrison jelgava he will have a harder time getting enough for unkerlant and what is the latest from unkerlant if i may ask the news sheets in jelgava have been very quiet lately which i take to be a good sign by what i heard before i left setubal swemmels men have cut off the algarvians in sulingen from the rest of their forces cornelu answered if they cannot force their way outor if the algarvians farther north cannot force their way inmezentios dragon will have a big fang pulled from its jaw i am surprised you did not say mezentios leviathan bento remarked not i cornelu said i care what happens to leviathans dragons are nasty beasts for all of me they can lose plenty of fangs fair enough the kuusaman looked back over his shoulder no one pursues aye i may have got away clean did you expect otherwise cornelu wondered how close hed come to sticking his head into a trap one never knows bento said primly that is true cornelu agreed he thought of everything in the war that hadnt gone the way peoplepeople outside algarve anyhowexpected and now down in southern unkerlant mezentios men were learning the same hard painful lesson one never knows the leviathan swam on south toward setubal come on lads colonel sabrino called to his men weve got to get into the air again if we dont our chums down in sulingen are going to give us a hard time once we finally win this stinking war if his wing of dragons didnt get into the airand if a lot of other important things didnt happenthe algarvians in sulingen would be massacred and in no position to give anybody a hard time about what he did or didnt do and if a lot of those other important things didnt happen the war would become that much harder to win that was as close as sabrino cared to come to thinking the war might be lost he didnt think that he wouldnt think that come on he said again and his dragonfliers hurried out to their beasts he shivered as he went though his clothes were warm enough even for southern unkerlant in winterdragons flew high enough to make warm clothing a necessity that was one of the few advantages to being a dragonflier he could see but the cold made the beasts he and his fellow fliers rode even more badtempered than they were in warm weather hed been flying his own mount since the days when the war was new that was more than three years now it wasnt long enough to make the miserable beast sure it recognized him as he came up to it he could have waited an eternity for that and been disappointed at the end of it the dragon screamed and lifted its head on the end of its snaky neck and made as if to flame him but of all the training it had got being forbidden to flame except on command had been beaten into it most thoroughly and sabrino whacked it on the nose with his goad and shouted no no you stupid vicious brainless thing still screeching the dragon subsided and suffered sabrino to perch at the base of its neck all over the makeshift dragon farm fliers were cursing and beating their beasts into submission sabrino hated dragons with the intimacy of long acquaintance he didnt know a dragonflier who felt otherwise a handler trotted up and released the chain that held the dragon to its stake the beast shrieked at him too even though he fed it looking around sabrino saw most of the flight free he whacked his dragon with the goad once to the left once to the right for a wonder the dragon remembered what the signal meant its great batwings thundered as it beat them again and again until it hurtled itself into the sky sabrinos wing numbered thirtyone back in trapani the generals whod never been to the fighting front no doubt assumed he led sixtyfour men and beasts he did on paper after all and when the generals back in trapani gave him orders they assumed paper and reality matched and told him to do things he would have had trouble doing even with a full complement of men and dragons he wished wars were fought on paper they would have been a lot easier this war was being fought on the pocked battered snowstreaked plains of southern unkerlant swemmels men had a ring around sulingen and the algarvians were trying to scrape together enough men to break through the ring and either get reinforcements to the army pinned down there or that failing to get the soldiers out before the noose tightened unbearably looking down sabrino saw scattered units of footsoldiers and behemoths who flew banners of red and green and white to keep algarvian dragonfliers from flaming them and dropping eggs on them by mistake where they were going to magic up enough soldiers for an attack especially in this weather was beyond him theyd have to come from somewhere though he couldnt imagine sulingen left to wither on the vine on flew the dragons the sun came out from behind a cloud spreading a cold clear light over the countryside clad all in white the unkerlanters and their behemoths were hard to see from any height they couldnt do anything about the long shadows they cast though sabrino spotted a column of behemoths moving north and west from the presseck river as intent on widening the ring around sulingen as the algarvians were on breaking it he pulled out his crystal and spoke to his squadron commanders see em down there boys lets cook up some of those ambling roasts in their own pans aye colonel captain domiziano still sounded boyish a bold swoop down on the foe was just his meat but the unkerlanters had seen the algarvian dragons too sabrino bore a healthy respect for the heavy sticks unkerlanter behemoths carried one of them could blaze a dragon out of the skyif the crew aboard the behemoth could bring it to bear down on the ground the crews of those behemoths were going to try dive sabrino shouted he thwacked the dragon with the goad the dragon folded its wings and plummeted the order to dive was one it obeyed with a better temper than most others because even its feeble brain had learned that the order to flame would soon follow if the dragon enjoyed doing anything it enjoyed killing wind whipped past sabrinos face without his goggles it would have blinded him he steered the dragon toward a behemoth with a heavy stick the unkerlanters riding that behemoth frantically slewed the stick toward him if they got it pointed in the right direction before he came close enough to flame in that case his mistress would have to find someone else to keep her in her fancy flat and his wife might be unhappy too on the other hand she might not now he shouted as he thwacked the dragon again it roared out a great gout of firenot quite such a long gout as sabrino would have liked for cinnabar was in short supply but the flame proved long enough it washed over the behemoth and its crew and the stick as sabrino flew past overhead he heard the drying groans and shrieks of the beast and the men who had ridden it he hit the dragon with the goad again urging it to gain height for another pass against the unkerlanters his dragonfliers veterans all had had the same idea he had theyd gone for the behemoths mounting heavy sticks because those were the ones that were dangerous to them and now as best he could see all those behemoths lay on the cold ground either dead already or thrashing in mortal agony a dragon lay on the cold ground thrashing in mortal agony too sabrino cursed one behemoth crew had been a heartbeat faster than the first dragon that assailed them he wondered whod gone down whoever it was the wing couldnt afford the loss one of the things sabrino like most algarvians hadnt fully realized was how vast unkerlant really was how many men and dragons and behemoths and horses and unicorns king swemmel could summon to war any losses against such numbers hurt second round he told his squadron commanders weve got rid of the ones who could really hurt usnow we deal with the rest behemoths carrying eggtossers were deadly dangerous to footsoldiers but not to dragonfliers hitting a dragon with an egg was possible but anything but likely and the behemoth crews personal sticks werent strong enough to blaze down dragons unless they caught one in the eye of course if they blazed a dragonflier instead his dragon turned back into a wild animal on the instant the unkerlanters knew all that as well as he did the column broke up behemoths lumbering off in every direction the more scattered the target they presented the harder time the dragon would have hunting them down as sabrinos mount flew over the road where his wing had first assailed the column a stink of burnt flesh filled his nostrils for a breath sure as sure theyd roasted the behemoths in their own pans theyd roasted some unkerlanters in their own armor too charred mansflesh was part of the stench during the winter before algarvian footsoldiers had eaten slain behemoths eaten them and been glad to have them sabrinos dragon and others in the wing had fed on such flesh too as a dragonflier he hadnt had to eat of it himself rank and prestigious service had their privileges choosing an unkerlanter behemoth he urged his dragon along after it the behemoth was running as hard as it could snow and dirt flying up from its feet at every bound compared to the speed a dragon made it might as well have been standing still sabrino drew close enough to see that the unkerlanters even covered the beasts tail in a sleeve of rusty chainmail that might have warded it against a footsoldiers stick but not against dragonfire again the tongue of fire his mount loosed wasnt long enough to suit sabrino but hed deliberately waited till he was almost on top of the behemoth before freeing the dragon to flame that meant he had to lie low along the beasts neck to present as small a target as he could to the unkerlanters hed done that before he did it again now after a couple of stumbling steps the behemoth went down sabrino looked around for another one to pursue and hoped his dragon had enough flame left to do what needed doing hed just spotted a beast he thought he could reach when captain domizianos visage appeared in his crystal unkerlanters dragons the squadron commander said theyre coming up out of the south and closing fast sabrinos head whipped around domiziano was right king swemmels dragonfliers were getting closer in a hurry sabrino cursed againthey were already closer than they should have been the rockgray paint the unkerlanters slapped on them made them demonically hard to spot still cursing sabrino said well have to pull up and deal with them then if we can well get back to the behemoths once hed given the order his men knew what to do they were better trained than the unkerlanters opposing them and they flew bettertrained dragons too but swemmel kept throwing fresh dragonfliers and fresh men into the fight and algarve didnt have so many of either for a couple of minutes the skies above the plains of southern unkerlant were a mad melee the unkerlanter dragons might not have been welltrained but they were wellrested and the flames that spurted from their jaws proved their meat had been dusted with plenty of brimstone and quicksilver two algarvian dragons plummeted to the ground in quick succession then sabrinos wing though outnumbered rallied two of their dragons would attack one unkerlanter when the algarvians were attacked they came to one anothers aid quickly and without any fuss sabrino blazed an unkerlanter flier whose dragon promptly attacked the rockgray beast closest to it by the time the unkerlanters had lost half a dozen dragonfliers they decided theyd had enough off they flew back the way theyd come a good days work domiziano said in the crystal we made em pay aye but sabrinos agreement felt hollow his wing had smashed up the column of unkerlanter behemoths and theyd given better than they got in the air at the level domiziano was talking about that did make a good days work but did it bring the algarvians much closer to being able to break through to sulingen not that sabrino could see to him that was the level that mattered at that level the wing had hardly done anything at all rain pattered down on hajjajs roof and as it had a way of doing almost every winter rain pattered down through hajjajs roof the zuwayzi foreign minister stood with hands on hips watching the leaks plop into pots and pans servants had set out turning to his majordomo he said refresh my memory did we or did we not have the roofers out here last year aye young fellow we did tewfik answered in his usual gravelly tones and what sort of lying excuse will they give when we ask them why we have to call them out again hajjaj waved his hands above his head a perfect transport of temper for him theyll say the roof never leaks as long as it doesnt rain thats what theyll tell us more likely theyll just say they didnt fix this particular stretch tewfik raised one white shaggy eyebrow thats what they always say powers below eat them and their lying excuses both hajjaj snapped we need the rain the majordomo said getting so much of it at once is a bloody nuisance though by the standards of more southerly lands what the hills outside bishah got wasnt much in the way of rain hajjaj knew that in his university days in trapani hed found a land so moist hed thought he would grow mold buildings in other kingdoms were made really watertight because they had to be in zuwayza heat was the main foe with rain treated as an inconvenient afterthoughtwhen builders bothered to think of it at all which they didnt always when the roofers do get hereif they ever choose to comei aim to give them a piece of my mind hajjaj said his tone suggesting he wasnt so far removed from his desertwarrior ancestors after all before he could go into bloodthirsty detail one of his servants came up bowed low before him and said your excellency the image of your secretary has appeared in the crystal he would speak with you qutuz lived down in bishah and could not use the rain as an excuse for staying away from the foreign ministry he also knew better than to disturb hajjaj at home unless something important had come up with a sigh hajjaj went from bloodthirsty nomad to suave diplomat thank you mehdawi of course i will speak with him good day your excellency qutuz said when hajjaj sat down in front of the crystal how is your roof the one over my head here at the palace leaks so does mine the foreign minister replied i trust that is not the reason for this conversation oh no qutuz shook his head but iskakis secretary has just paid a call on me asking if you could possibly meet the yaninan minister here this afternoon a little before the hour for tea he is waiting in the outer officewhich also leaksto take your reply back to his principal well well isnt that interesting i wonder what he might want to say to me hajjaj rubbed his chin aye ill see him id better find out whats in his mind id better find out if anything is in his mind his opinion of the yaninan was not high tewfik made the predictable complaints when hajjaj proposed going out in the rain having got them out of his system the majordomo made sure the carriage was ready in truth the journey down to the city on a road muddy rather than its usual dusty self was slow and unpleasant but hajjaj endured it roofers were banging overhead when he reached the foreign ministry as always the palace could call on their services with some hope of actually getting them no one else could miserable day isnt it qutuz said it is and seeing iskakis does nothing to improve it hajjaj answered still and all if i have to wear clothes id sooner do it in winter than in summer have you got a yaninan outfit in the closet your excellency qutuz asked no ill dress in algarvian clothes hajjaj said that will show iskakis i do remember we have the same allies and right this minute i expect we both find the algarvians equally unpalatable he put on the tunic and kilttheir cut was years out of fashion which worried him not at alland waited he had a considerable wait despite having set the hour for the meeting iskakis was late when the yaninan minister finally did arrive hajjaj exacted a measure of revenge by stretching out the zuwayzi ritual of wine and tea and cakes as long as he could as he sipped and nibbled he watched the yaninan fume iskakis was in his fifties short and bald and swarthy for a lightskinned man with a big gray mustache and big gray tufts of hair sticking out of his ears in algarvian the only tongue they shared hajjaj said i trust the lovely lady your wife is well that was a commonplace of the small talk which had to accompany wine and tea and cakes it was also a barb iskakis wife was lovely and couldnt have been more than half his age maybe she didnt know the minister preferred pretty boys but everyone else in bishah did she is very well iskakis said grudgingly he shifted on the mound of pillows hed built for himself the pompoms that decorated his shoes wobbled back and forth hajjaj watched them in fascination he never had been able to figure out why the yaninans found them decorative at last any further delay would have been openly rude qutuz carried off the silver tray on which hed brought in the refreshments suppressing a sigh hajjaj got down to business and how may i serve you your excellency iskakis leaned forward his dark eyes bored into hajjajs i want to know your view of the course of the war he said his tone suggesting he would tear that view from hajjaj if the foreign minister didnt give it to him kaunians and algarvians who shared his tastes would more likely than not have seemed effeminate instead he affected an exaggerated masculinity that was familiar to hajjaj for most zuwayzi men who preferred their own sex did the same my view hajjaj said my view is as it has always been that the war is a great tragedy and i wish it had never begun as for how it will turn out i can only hope for the best the best being an algarvian triumph iskakis said again sounding as if he might spring on hajjaj if the zuwayzi presumed to disagree algarve is a better neighbor for us than is unkerlant not least because algarve is a more distant neighbor hajjaj said not for us iskakis said bitterly and hajjaj had to nod yanina lay sandwiched between algarve and unkerlant an unenviable position if ever there was one with a scowl iskakis went on things are not so good down in the southwest i have heard this aye hajjaj had heard it from his own generals from boasts by the unkerlanters in the broadsheets they sometimes rained down on zuwayzi soldiers and from the algarvian minister marquis balastro had been profanely inventive in explaining that things had gone wrong north of sulingen not least on account of yaninan cowardice hajjaj wondered if balastro had been as inventiveand as profaneto iskakis face he wouldnt have been surprised what are we to do if the algarvians piss away all the victories they have won iskakis demanded he said nothing about the yaninan armys part in the algarvians misfortunes but then he wouldnt no matter what he didnt say the question was good hajjaj answered what other choice would we have but to make the best terms we could with unkerlant iskakis tapped the back of his neck this is what swemmel would give us the gesture made hajjaj sure the yaninans used an axe or headsmans sword to dispose of miscreants the minister tapped again this if we were lucky otherwise we would go into the stewpot hajjaj would have been happier had iskakis been wrong he would also have been happier had the algarvians made more pleasant allies he doubted iskakis cared about kaunians one way or the other on the other hand king mezentios men undoubtedly had a much tighter grip on yanina than they did on zuwayza hajjaj said i have no easy answers for you what else is there to do but ride the camel we mounted till it will go no farther together have we not enough power to stop this war iskakis said no hajjaj said bluntly we can hurt algarve aye but how likely is swemmel to show proper gratitude that got through iskakis grimaced he said i shall pass your words on to my sovereign before hajjaj could have even raise a finger the yaninan minister added you may rest assured i shall pass them carefully you had better hajjaj said yaninans were good at intrigue better than they were at war but the algarvians had to know their allies felt restive iskakis got to his feet bowed and left as grandly as if his kingdoms soldiers had won triumphs by the dozen instead of embarrassing themselves far and wide hajjaj was still pondering the report he would give to king shazli when qutuz came in and said your excellency marquis balastro is fain to speak to you by crystal is he hajjaj was anything but fain to speak to the algarvian minister but no one had asked his opinion having no real choice he said im coming formal manners and polite delays went over the side in conversations by crystal without preamble balastro demanded well what did the little bald bugger want from you my recipe for a camelsmilk fondue hajjaj replied blandly balastro said something uncharitable about camelsyoung male camels and iskakis then he said if tsavellas stabs us in the back hajjaj that doesnt do you any good i never claimed it did hajjaj replied but i also never said a word about what iskakis discussed with me nor do i intend to what else would a yaninan talk about especially when things have gone sour down in the south balastro didnt bother hiding his scorn if you run low on kaunians perhaps you will be able to repair the front with the life energy you get from slaughtering the people of patras or some other yaninan town hajjaj suggested not in the least diplomatically balastro glared perhaps we will his voice was as cold as winter in sulingen perhaps you will recall on whose side you are and whose friendship has let youhelped youtake back what is rightfully yours that was unfortunately a straight blaze king tsavellas unlike my sovereign is your ally only because he fears swemmel more than you hajjaj said we zuwayzin like algarviansor we did till you began what you began manymaybe even mostof his people still did but he forbore to mention that if tsavellas tries to diddle us well give him reason to fear us by the powers above balastro snarled his eyes bored into hajjajs and the same goes for king shazli your excellency you would do well to remember it oh i do hajjaj said you may rest assured i do he wasnt sure balastro heard that the algarvian ministers image had disappeared after he delivered his threat hajjaj cursed softly he would have loved to abandon algarve the only trouble was king shazli also feared swemmel of unkerlant more than mezentioand he too had good reason to do so eighteen sleet and occasional spatters of peasized hail pelted krastas mansion on the edge of priekule the mood inside the building was as cold and nasty as the weather outside one of the things that had made algarvians appealing and attractive to the marchioness was their panache the sense that nothing could make them downhearted that sense was conspicuously absent these days so were several of the redheaded military bureaucrats who had helped administer priekule to whose leers krasta had resigned herself and when they absented themselves no one took their places their desks stood empty abandoned for day after day where have they gone and when will you get replacements for them krasta asked colonel lurcanio those desks reflect poorly on you and of course anything that reflected poorly on lurcanio also reflected poorly on her where they are on holiday in jelgava of course lurcanio snapped then seeing krasta believed him he abandoned sarcasm not without rolling his eyes and gave her a straight answer they are bound for unkerlant to fight in the west as for replacements he laughed bitterly my sweet i count myself lucky that i have not been packed aboard a leyline caravan to join them believe me i count myself lucky indeed you krasta gestured as if telling him not to be foolish how can they pack you off to unkerlant youre a colonel and a count after all aye so i am lurcanio agreed and one of the duties of a colonel and count is to command a regiment or brigade in the service of his king a good many regiments and brigades want colonels to command them these days because a good many colonels who commanded them in days gone by are dead the chill that ran through krasta had nothing to do with the weather the war hadnt come to priekule not in person king gainibu had yielded before the algarvians attacked the capital of valmiera here and now though the war was reaching into priekule through the bursting eggs and blazing sticks on the far side of the worldwhich was how she viewed unkerlant lurcanio went on a good many people are pulling all the wires they can to stay in valmiera given the choices involved i must say i understand this would you not agree no one in his right mind would go to unkerlant if he could stay in priekule krasta spoke with great conviction you are right even if you do not fully understand the reason lurcanio said with what looked to krasta like a deliberate effort of will he grew more cheerful i am given to understand that your viscount valnu is giving an entertainment this evening shall we go and see what new scandal he comes up with hes not my viscount valnu krasta said with a sniff and a toss of the head but im always game for scandal that i have seen maybe lurcanio was amused maybe not you will however do me the courtesy of not making me wait for you tonight krasta thought hard about making him do exactly that in the end she didnt dare with lurcanios temper uncertain he might grow unpleasant if crossed when she did come downstairs in good time he nodded grave approval he could be charming when he chose and he did choose charm during the carriage ride to valnus mansion he made krasta laugh he made himself laugh too if his mirth seemed a little strained krasta didnt notice hello sweetheart valnu cried when they arrived he kissed krasta on the cheek then he turned to lurcanio and cried hello sweetheart again lurcanio got a kiss identical to krastas your versatility does you credit the algarvian officer said valnu sniggered and waved him out of the entry hall and into the enormous front room an algarvian musician tinkled away on a harpsichord that made krasta want to yawn she took a glass of sparkling wine from a maidservant who circulated with a tray the servant was pretty and wore the shortest kilt krasta had ever seen on anyone man or woman when she bent down to give an algarvian in a chair a glass of wine krasta noted she wore nothing under the tunic quite a lot of valnus male guests noticed that too krasta muttered under her breath she was a long way from shocked but didnt care for such blatant invitations to infidelity as if men needed them cant you afford drawers on what he pays you dear she asked when the maidservant came by again valnu was in earshot shed made sure of that but the serving girl only sighed and replied he pays me more when i dont wear them milady krasta scowled and turned away there was no sport in an answer like that and there was no sport at the entertainment either it was as flat as a glass of sparkling wine left out too long now and again it would come close to livening up but then someone somewhere in the big room would say the name sulingen and the freeze that had come to the algarvian wing of krastas mansion would fall over the entertainment as well it was as frustrating as a clumsy lovers caresses having drunk several glasses of wine by the time she noticed that krasta wasnt shy about tracking down valnu and complaining youll ruin your reputation for proper parties as thoroughly as youll ruin that serving wenchs reputation forwell for anything she said valnu laughed at her darling i didnt think you thought servants could even have reputations to ruin in the normal run of things krasta didnt but this wasnt normal she said shell have more fingerprints on her backside than a shop window does when they put a big sale sign in it youd better be careful valnu warned her laughing still people will say youre growing a conscience and where would you be then i know what im doing krasta said loudly she waved a forefinger under valnus long bladethin nose and i know what youre doing too powers below eat me if i dont she meant no more than that he was mocking her to her astonishment he reached out and clapped the palm of his hand over her mouth hissing then shut up about it will you you stupid little slut krasta opened her mouth to bite him he jerked his hand away what are you talking about she demanded i might ask you the same question he replied suddenly his lean face acquired a grin that seemed altogether too wide for it instead i think ill do this he gathered her in and kissed her with a passion that struck her as altogether unfeigned she started to bite his probing tongue as shed almost bitten his hand but discovered she was enjoying herself with a small nasty purr she pressed her body against his he made the most of the embrace clutching her backside with both hands and sliding his fingers toward her secret place she rocked her hips forward and back and from side to side whatever viscount valnus other tastes might have been she was utterly certain he wanted her at the moment and she wanted him too as much to score one off colonel lurcanio as for himself having an algarvian protector was useful even vital at timesall the more reason for krasta to chafe at the short leash lurcanio set her or so she told herself at any rate well here we have a charming picture dont we the amused contempt in that trillingly accented voice made krasta spring away from valnu like a soaked cat she stared at lurcanio with fear and defiance in her eyes fear won and quickly pointing an accusing finger at valnu she exclaimed he molested me oh i doubt it not at all lurcanio rocked back on his heels as he laughed mockingly were you any more molested you would have been wearing lingerie instead of your outonthetown clothes my dear count valnu began colonel lurcanio waved him to silence i am not your dear regardless of whether or not certain of my countrymen can make the same statement i do not particularly blame youa man will try to get it in you i gather will try to get it in almost anywhere he paused aye you still wish to say something viscount only that variety as i am in the habit of remarking is the life of spice a point to which my sweet companion would surely agree lurcanio turned toand turned onkrasta and bowed algarvians could be most wounding when they were most polite and now milady what have you got to say for yourself krasta didnt usually think fast but selfpreservation gave her strong incentive haughtily drawing herself up she replied only that i was having a good time isnt that why one comes to an entertainment to have a good time lurcanio bowed again i do admire your nerve your good sense leaves something to be desired i am certain i am not the first to tell you this i am just as certain i am unlikely to be the last but i am also certain that if you embarrass me in public i must do the same to you without warning without wasted motion he slapped her face heads whipped around at the sound of the slap then very quickly everyone pretended not to notice such things happened now and again krasta had seen them shed laughed at women foolish enough to get caught now no doubt other women would laugh at her she hated that but she didnt think of slapping lurcanio back not even for a moment shed slapped him once when she still thought of him as a social inferior rather than a conqueror hed slapped her back then stunning her and establishing a dominance hed held ever since what would he do if she dared rebel in any real way she didnt have the nerve to find out to valnu lurcanio said as for you sir try your luck elsewhere valnu bowed low he wore an algarvianstyle kilt tonight as he often did and he also aped algarvian manners as you say my lord count so shall it be of course it shall now lurcanio sounded as smug as if algarve truly were on top of the world in every way as if her armies had not fallen short outside of cottbus the winter before as if king swemmels men werent squeezing another algarvian army in a mailed fist now far off in the southwest he believed in himself because he did he made krasta believe in him too and he made her forget all about whatever it was shed said that had so alarmed valnu in the bathroom she splashed cold water on the red mark on her cheek then she had to spend more time repairing her powder and paint she got drunk afterwards as she often did at entertainments but stayed more circumspect than she was otherwise likely to have done after the driver brought her and lurcanio back to the mansion through the cold slippery streets of priekule the algarvian went up to her bedchamber with her that took her by surprise shed thought he would sleep in his own bed as a sign of his anger instead he used hands and mouth to bring her to a quick abrupt peak of pleasure he was always scrupulous about such things and then he surprised her again by rolling her onto her belly when he began she let out an indignant squawk be still he snapped let us call this a salute to valnu she had to lie there and endure it it hurtnot too much but it did and it humiliated her as lurcanio no doubt intended when it was over he patted her on one bare cheek and laughed a little then dressed and left the bedchamber go ahead and laugh krasta thought you dont know everything there is to know and ill never ever tell you exile in essence skarnu had been in exile from his own way of life ever since he joined king gainibus army when the war against algarve was young and fresh and still held the possibility of glory after he found out what that possibility was worth hed made another life for himself one in most ways more satisfying than that which hed left behind and now hed had that one yanked out from under him too curse you krasta he thought staring up at the badly plastered ceiling of the cheap flat the irregulars in ventspils had found for him if not for his sister how would that cursed lurcanio have known to come hunting for him he hoped merkela was all right merkela and the child she was carrying hope was all he could do he didnt dare to post her even the most innocuous letter lest some algarvian mage use it to track him down here in ventspils he felt suspended betwixt and between back in priekule hed been a person of the capital a man of the big city whod enjoyed everything it had to offer on the farm even in pavilosta hed learned to find simpler contentments a good crop of beans in the garden a laying hen the envy of all his neighbors a mug of ale after a hard days work and hed learned the difference between pleasure and love a distinction hed never bother drawing in priekule he had no work in ventspils not yet he had no friends here only a handful of acquaintances among the irregulars whod installed him in the flat and ventspils off to the east of priekule had to be the most boring town in valmiera if it wasnt he pitied the place that was after a while staring at the ceiling threatened to drive him mad he got up and put on the coat the irregulars had given him to replace the sheepskin jacket hed brought from the farm with its wide lapels the coat would have been years out of fashion in priekule but hed seen plenty of people here wearing and even showing off equally unstylish garments he also put on a broadbrimmed felt hat and wished for one with earflaps like those the unkerlanters wore not many people were on the streets the freezing rain had stopped a couple of hours before but glare ice was everywhere shining and treacherous city workers should have been spreading salt to help melt it and to give better footing but where were they nowhere skarnu could see he slipped and had to grab a lamp post to keep from falling a couple of algarvian soldiers in hobnailed boots laughed at him they had no trouble keeping their feet i hope you get sent to unkerlant he muttered i hope your toes freeze and turn black and fall off he made sure the redheads didnt hear him though they might have spoken valmieran he took no needless chances a newssheet vendor shouted his wares and no doubt shouted all the more lustily to help keep his teeth from chattering another algarvian victory north of sulingen he bellowed his breath steaming at every word king swemmels barbarous hordes hurled back in dismay skarnus laughter sent smoke steaming from his mouth and nose too mezentios men were good liars but not good enough they had supposedly won all the battles north of sulingen long ago why were they fighting there again if they werent in trouble but how many people would notice that how many people would care if they did notice the algarvians had to be winning the war didnt they of course they did theyd beaten valmiera that meant they had to beat everyone else if they didnt beat everyone else how could a valmieran sleep easy after lying down on his back to expose his throat to the conquerors or lying down on her back to expose something else krasta sometimes skarnu wanted to kill his sister sometimes he wanted to slap some sense into her silly head he sighed somebody should have tried that years before too late now more likely than not sometimes he just wanted to sit down beside her and ask her why because i felt like it he could hear her voice in his mind she wouldnt think past that he knew her too well she wouldnt think much about betraying him to the algarvian colonel to whom she gave herself either skarnu would have guessed that beneath her but evidently he was wrong he walked past the newssheet vendor brusquely shaking his head when the fellow waved a sheet at him to try to tempt him to buy the man couldnt even curse him for he might lay out a couple of coppers another time the vendor could only shake his head and go on calling out the news in the hope that someone else would want to read it half a block farther on a beggar stood out in front of a jewelers even though he couldnt have been more than twelve years old the place was as much his as the shop full of trinkets belonged to the jeweler hed already driven off a couple of grown men one after the other to keep it the placard by his little tin cup read my father never came home from the war please help skarnu tossed him a coin powers above bless you sir the beggar boy cried as it rattled into the cup skarnu kept walking he didnt know whether the boy was telling the truth or not but didnt care to take the chance he was lying either he turned and went into a tavern that called itself the lion and the mouse these days its signboard was newer than most of those on the frowzy street before the war before the valmieran collapse it had been known as the imperial lion valmierans had been proud to remember the days of the kaunian empire the algarvian occupiers though wanted them to forget thanks to a coal fire the tavern was warm inside skarnu sighed with pleasure and shrugged off the jacket with the wide lapels a couple of men stood at the bar one of them was trying to chat up a raddledlooking woman he wasnt having much luck not least because he looked poor three more men sat at a table two of them drinking ale one nursing a glass of spirits the fellow with the spirits nodded to skarnu and waved for him to join them he did setting his backside on a stool that creaked the raddledlooking woman turned out to be a barmaid moving no faster than she had to she ambled over and asked him whatll it be by the way she leaned toward him and by the number of toggles undone on her tunic he could have had her as long as he had the price too ale he answered just ale she gave him a sour look then went off to fetch him a mug hello pavilosta said the man with the glass of spirits names were in short supply among the irregulars they called him by that of the village from whose neighborhood hed had to flee considering how urgent his departure had been even that came too close to identifying him to leave him quite comfortable with it hello yourself painter he said no one could make much out of a nickname taken from a fellows job he nodded to the other men butcher cordwainer they raised their mugs in greeting and salute the barmaid came back with skarnus ale she pointedly stood by the table till he paid her then her face still pinched with disapproval she a walked back to the bar in a low voice the fellow who made boots said youre smart not to want any of her shes so cold youd freeze your joint off once you got it in there he sipped from his own mug then added i ought to know you bragging or complaining asked the man who painted houses skarnu tried his ale it wasnt bad he sat and waited ventspils wasnt his town not even by adoption he couldnt make plans here as he had back near pavilosta he had to be part of other peoples plans he didnt care for that but he didnt know what to do about it either tell him what you heard the bootmaker said instead of coming back with a sally of his own ill get round to it never fear as skarnu had been a power round pavilosta so the painter was a power in ventspils he did things his way not the way anyone told him to do them as if to say he wouldnt be rushed he finished his drink and waved for another one only after hed got it did he remark the redheads will be bringing some captured lagoan dragonfliers through town tonight on the way to the captives camp outside priekule lagoans were redheads too but nobody used the word to include them skarnu asked can we filch em were going to try the painter answered i know you can use a stick so i want you in on it skarnu nodded the underground knew hed blazed count simanu count enkurus even more unsavory son unfortunately that meant the algarvians were also good bets to know traitors everywhere he thought but some traitor to the algarvian cause had let them know the dragonfliers would be coming it evened outthough even wasnt good enough to suit skarnu the man from ventspils went on well meet behind the clock tower a little before midnight meeting before midnight sounded romantic in reality it was bloody cold men straggled in a couple at a time they got sticks easily concealable down a trouser legnot the sort of weapon skarnu would have wanted to take to war but one with which he could walk through the streets of the town theyre not coming by leyline caravan he asked the painter not from what i heard the local answered i dont know whether they got blazed down someplace where there arent any ley lines or mezentios men didnt feel like laying on a caravan but theyre not just a carriage if theyre coming up through town theyll get in by duchess maza road up from the southeast having come into ventspils from the southwest skarnu knew nothing of duchess maza road he tagged along with the other valmierans who hadnt given up on their kingdom he wondered what they would do if they ran into an algarvian patrol but they didnt with the war in unkerlant sucking men west fewer algarvians were left to watch the streets keep an eye out for valmieran constables too the painter warned too many of them are in bed with the redheads that made skarnu think of krasta again but he shook his head too many valmierans of all sorts were in bed with the redheads they spied only one pair of constables on the way to the road into town from the southeast and ducked out of sight before the constables saw them then it was on to duchess maza road into ambush positions behind tree trunks and fences and wait skarnu wondered how they would know the right carriage but they had no trouble four algarvian horsemen guarded it two in front two behind but by the way they rode they thought they were there to make a fine procession nothing more because they werent looking for danger it found them now the painter said in a low savage voice his double handful of followers blazed the redheads off their horses and the driver off his carriage the algarvians managed only startled squawks before they went down the next group of redheads who came through ventspils with captives would doubtless be more alert but that did these men no good at all skarnu ran toward the carriage he paused a moment to finish an algarvian who still writhed on the cobbles then seized a horses head to keep the beast from bolting another man blazed off the stout padlock that held the carriage door closed as it fell with a clank he spoke in lagoan the door opened a couple of men jumped down from the carriage away the painter said urgently the men of the underground scattered one of them led off the rescued dragonfliers the rest headed back to their homes skarnu moved slowly through the dark streets of ventspils not wanting to get lost another lick against algarve he thought and wondered what the next one would be what was left of plegmunds battered brigade welcomed two new regiments hurried down from forthweg with all the charm veterans usually showed new fish now a veteran himself sidroc jeered along with his comrades does your mother know youre here he asked a recruit obviously several years older than he was does your mother know theyre going to bury you here he howled laughter so did his comrades they were all a little or more than a little drunk having liberated several jars of spirits from a village the unkerlanters had abandoned in haste had the unkerlanters abandoned it in something less than haste they would have taken their popskull with them sergeant werferth said nobody told him that when he comes down here the buggers on the other side blaze back that set the survivors of overrun presseck into fresh gales of laughter the recruits stared at them as if theyd gone mad maybe we have sidroc thought he didnt much care one way or the other he swigged from his canteen more raw spirits ran hot down his throat those spirits gave him most of the warmth he felt the tents of plegmunds brigade sat on the vast plains of southern unkerlant out in the middle of nowhere so the frigid wind could get a running start before it blew through them he said one thingthe algarvians with us are every bit as cold as we are serves em right ceorl said together we and the algarvians will drive swemmels barbarians back into the trackless west the recruit said stiffly together sidroc werferth and ceorl howled laughter well try and stay alive sidroc said and well try and kill some unkerlanters because thatll help us stay alive dont waste your time on him werferth said hes a virgin hell find out and if he lives through it hell be telling the new recruits what they need to know next summer if he doesnt he shrugged sidrocs head ached the next morning ache or not he drew himself to attention to listen to an algarvian officer harangue the men of the brigade we are part of something larger than ourselves the officer declared we shall rescue our brave algarvian comrades down in sulingen we and this force king mezentios might has gathered he let loose with a typically extravagant typically expansive algarvian gesture sure enough the tents of plegmunds brigade werent the only ones on the plain several brigades of algarvians had been mustered with them and troop after troop of behemoths it was a formidable assemblage whether it was formidable enough to punch through the cordon the unkerlanters had drawn around sulingen sidroc didnt know he knew it would do all it could we must do this the algarvian officer said we must and so we can and so we shall where the will is strong victory follows redheads were drawn up getting their marching orders too mezentio they shouted with as much spirit as if they were going on parade through trapani to show off for pretty girls not to be outdone the forthwegians whod taken service with algarve shouted plegmund as loud as they could doing their best to outyell the men whod taught them what they knew of war the algarvians yelled back louder than ever it was a goodnatured contest nothing like the one that lay ahead snow swirled through the air as sidroc tramped south loose order officers and underofficers called he knew why to keep too many of them from getting killed at once if things went wrong he had a heavy cloak and a white snow smock over it he wore a fur hat some unkerlanter soldier didnt need any more the weather was colder than any hed ever known but he wouldnt freeze he hoped he wouldnt freezing soon proved to be that least of his worries the soldiers set over him had known what they were talking about when they warned their charges to spread out the relief force had been moving for only a couple of hours when unkerlanter dragons appeared overhead they dropped a few eggs flamed a few soldiers and flew away a pinprickbut the force hadnt been overstrong to begin with now it was a little weaker about noon they neared another of those unkerlanter peasant villages scattered across the plain swemmels men held it warning shouts of behemoths echoed through the army sure enough sidroc saw them moving inside the village perhaps milling about in the square some of them began lobbing eggs at the advancing algarviansand at plegmunds brigade as well out trotted a force of algarvian behemoths whose crews skirmished at long range with the unkerlanters even at a glance sidroc could see that the unkerlanters outnumbered them king swemmels men saw the same thing they didnt come charging out after the algarvians as they might have when the war was newfrom some of the stories the redheads told theyd been very stupid in the early days but they did forget about the footsoldiers they forgot about everything in fact except what the algarvian commander showed them and they paid for it the officer in charge of the algarvians had more than one string for his bow while the unkerlanters were busy fighting and seemingly repelling the behemoths in front of them another force entered the village from behind the fight that followed was sharp but very short the relief force kept moving south on toward sulingen weve got a smart general sergeant werferth said thats good thats mighty good he buggered swemmels boys just as pretty as you please sidroc snorted then guffawed when he realized how apt the figure was aye bugger em he didcame right up their backside but it stopped being easy after that sidroc had found in presseck how dangerous the unkerlanters could be when they had numbers and power on their side now he discovered they didnt need numbers to be dangerous they knew what the algarvians were trying to do and threw everything they had into stopping them as so many had before him sidroc grew to hate and dread the cheer urra single unkerlanters would pop up out of the snow shouting it and blaze down a manor two or three or fourbefore they died themselves companies would fight like grim death in villages bellowing defiance till the last man was slain and regiment after regiment would charge across the plain at the relief force sometimes with their arms linked all the soldiers roaring urra nor would those regiments charge alone unsupported the unkerlanters threw behemoths and dragons and eggtossers into the fight with the same air they threw men into it aye they seemed to say you ii smash these up but we ve got plenty more and the algarvians did not have plenty more sidroc needed only a day or two to see that relief forces came in by dribs and drabs when they came in at all if the army couldnt relieve the men in sulingen with what it had now it couldnt relieve them when are they going to break out toward us sidroc asked six days into the move south by then hed taken to wrapping the lower part of his face in wool rags so that only his eyes showed hed thought he knew how cold unkerlant could get every new day proved him wrong i dont know what theyre doing down there sergeant werferth told him i dont give a dragon turd what theyre doing either its too soon to worry whatever theyve got in mind right now it doesnt change my job one fornicating bit sidroc started to bristle ceorl would have because ceorl was the sort who bristled at anything but sidroc realized werferth was just giving good advice worrying about what he couldnt help wouldnt couldnt change things at dawn the next morning the unkerlanters attacked the relief force before it could get moving by the time swemmels men sullenly withdrew the sun was halfway across the sky the unkerlanters left hundreds of bodies lying in the snow but theyd robbed the relief force of men and of time and it could recover neither despite the troops swemmel and his generals kept throwing at them the soldiers and behemoths of the relieving force managed to keep moving south they crossed the presseck from whose banks the men of plegmunds brigade had been so rudely expelled not long before and they also forced their way over the neddemin the next river to the south in a sharp battle with the unkerlanters trying to keep them from gaining the fords whats the river after this one sidroc asked that night as he toasted a gobbet of horsemeat on a stick hed never imagined eating horse up in forthweg compared to going hungry it was tasty as could be thats the britz werferth answered if we make it over the britz the fellows in sulingen should be able to fight their way out to meet us hed come far enough he was willing to look ahead a bit theyd better be able to fight their way out to meet us sidroc said curse me if i know how weve made it this far i dont know how much further we can go other question is how far can they come werferth asked what have their behemoths and horses and unicorns been eating down there mostly nothing or i miss my guess odds are the men havent had much more either sidroc took a bite of horseflesh juice running down his chin he said its not like weve got a lot the sergeant nodded but they both knew the men down in sulingen had less on toward the britz they went the unkerlanters attacked again and again from south and east and west swemmels cavalry forces nipped in to raid the supply wagons that kept the relieving force fed and supplied with eggs and with sorcerous charges for their sticks in spite of everything the algarvians and the men of plegmunds brigade kept pushing south and then about a day and a half before they would have reached the britz most of their behemoths left the army and headed north have they gone out of their fornicating minds sidroc shouted the unkerlanters still have their behemoths curse them how are we supposed to lick em without ours no one had an answer for him till later in the day then werferth who as a sergeant heard things said swemmels whoresons are mounting a big push on durrwangen north of here if they take the place then theyve got us in the bag along with the boys down in sulingen cant have that it doesnt work getting over the britz isnt going to work either not without those behemoths sidroc said weve got to try werferth answered sidroc grimaced and nodded deserting and going north on his own was sure death advancing with his comrades was only deadly dangerous knowing the odds the men of the relieving force went on they reached the river they couldnt cross the unkerlanters had too many men in front of it too many eggtossers on the southern bank and they had behemoths left to throw into the fight behemoths the relieving force could no longer withstand the algarvians and the men of plegmunds brigade fell back from the britz retreating across the frozen plains of unkerlant a blizzard howled through the woods where munderics band of irregulars took shelter from their foes as far as garivald was concerned the tent pitched above a hole in the ground was no substitute for the warm hut in which hed passed previous winters with his wife and children and livestock he didnt have enough spirits to stay drunk through the winter as he normally would have either and he couldnt even stay in his inadequate shelter and feed the fire a few twigs at a time as far as munderic was concerned blizzards were the ideal time for the irregulars to be out and doing most of the time we leave tracks in the snow the commander declared not now by the powers abovethe wind will blow them away as fast as we make em of course it will garivald said and itll blow us away just as fast perhaps fortunately for him the wind also blew his words away so no one but him heard them when munderic gave orders it was either obey or raise a mutiny against him garivald didnt want to do that he didnt much want to go tramping through the snow either but nobody asked what he thought about it the only people whod ever asked what he thought of anything were his wife and a few close friends and they were all far away in zossen munderic led almost the whole band out against the village of kluftern which had a small algarvian garrison and which also sat close to a ley line if we can wipe out the redheads there we can sabotage that line in a dozen different placestake our time and do it properly munderic said thatll keep mezentios mages scratching like theyre covered with lice he was right if they could bring it off that would happen but garivald turned to the man closest to him and asked how often do these things turn out just the way theyre planned next time will be the first as far as i can see the man next to him turned out to be a woman obilot answered at least he isnt counting on magecraft this time around thats something garivald agreed the two of them were on wary speaking terms again obilot hated the algarvians too much to stay furious at anyone else who also hated them as for garivald he wasnt by nature a particularly quarrelsome man hed kept speaking softly not making things worse than they were already till obilots temper softened once the irregulars left the shelter of the woods the wind tore at them harder than ever algarvians out in such weather might well have frozen every one of the unkerlanters though had been through worse they trudged along grumbling but not particularly put out well catch the redheads all cozied up to the fire somebody said then well make em pay for being soft that brought a rumble of agreement from everyone who heard it garivald rumbled agreement too but he didnt really feel it had the algarvians truly been soft they never would have overrun the duchy of grelz or penetrated unkerlant to sulingen and to the outskirts of cottbus snow swirled around garivald and blew into his face he cursed wearily and kept walking he hoped munderic was keeping track of the direction in which kluftern lay he couldnt have found it himself on a bet snow bleeding the redheads white he muttered under his breath feeling for the lines of a song brave man putting thieves to flight he played with metrical feet while his own feet even in felt boots got colder confused shouts from up ahead broke into his thoughts he cursed again this time in real anger there went the song and most of it would be gone for good then he stopped worrying about the song for one of those shouts was a shriek of agony if that wasnt a man whod just been blazed hed never heard one then he heard other shouts they were battle cries raniero the kingdom of grelz he peered ahead through the snow the last set of grelzer troops the irregulars ran into hadnt proved to be worth much some grelzer soldiers passed information on to munderics band from all that hed assumed none of the men who fought for king mezentios cousin would be worth anything that turned out to be a mistake these fellows came at munderics men as fiercely as if their hair were red not dark they kept right on shouting ranieros name too and they cursed king swemmel as vilely as garivald had ever cursed the algarvians garivald expected munderic would try to break away his target had been kluftern not a platoon of grelzers but the irregular leader shouted kill the traitors and ordered his men forward with as little hesitation as marshal rathar might have shown forward garivald went wishing munderic had shown more sense fighting these fellows was different from fighting algarvians the soldiers who followed raniero looked like the irregulars sounded like them and wore clothes much like theirs tooone snow smock couldnt differ much from another and with snowflakes blowing every which way nobody got a clear look at anybody more than a couple of paces away anyhow munderic rapidly proved marshal rathar had nothing to worry about from his generalship the only thing he had going for himthe thing that had held his band of irregulars togetherwas his enthusiasm in this fight it got in the way he sent men running now here now there till garivald wasnt sure where he was supposed to be and who if anyone was supposed to be there with him had a competent soldiersay a veteran algarvian captainbeen leading king ranieros troopers they would have made short work of the irregulars but the big fight the fight against the real unkerlanter army sucked competent soldiers toward the front whoever was in charge of the grelzers had no more idea of how to handle his men than did munderic what resulted wasnt so much a battle even a small one as a series of skirmishes men fighting first in this place then in that one as they happened to collide garivald flopped down in the snow behind some bushes he blazed at a couple of men he was pretty sure were grelzer soldiers neither of them fell either the snow which blew more thickly by the minute was attenuating his beam or he wasnt so handy with a stick as he might have been a couple of minutes later somebody else skidded down behind the same bushes stinking whoresons he growled and blazed at the same men garivald had tried to knock over hate those stinking traitors serving the false king aye garivald blazed again though by then he could hardly see his targets he cursed might as well throw rocks at em for all the good our sticks are doing us its a stinking war thats the truth the other fellow said like a lot of the irregulars he had a length of wool wrapped around the lower part of his face to keep his nose and mouth from freezing bits of vapor came out through it more had formed icicles in front of where his lips were bound to be wish i were back in my own village getting drunk garivald said i miss my wife i miss my brats i miss my firstman well maybe not the other fighter laughed i know just what you mean firstman in the place i grew up chewed nails for funthats what everybody said anyhow mines just a sneak and a spy hed suck up to inspectors and then take it out on everybody else no garivald didnt miss waddo not a bit theyre like that all right the other fellow said ought to hang every cursed one of them give a man a little room to live they spent the next few minutes maligning firstmen neither of them did any more blazing they had no targets worth blazing at not with the blizzard closing the walls of the world around them then a couple of shapes did appear through the snow both men behind the bush raised their sticks but one of the newcomers could only have been big shambling sadoc take it easy garivald said theyre ours suits me his companion replied and lowered his stick again maybe sadoc heard them maybe the bumbling mage did have enough skill to sense them there he started to raise his own stick swemmel garivald called not wanting a fellow irregular to blaze him swemmel and unkerlant the words were almost the last ones that ever passed his lips out of the corner of his eye he saw the fighter with whom hed been chatting and cursing roll away to bring his stick to bear on him without conscious thought garivald leaped after him and knocked the stick out of his hands it flew off into the snow grelz his erstwhile companion yelled kicking out at garivald and catching his stick with a boot heel it also flew away garivald didnt dare scramble for itthe man whod chosen the algarvian puppet might get the other one first instead garivald grappled with the fellow who till the war began had been a peasant just like him whoreson the word came from both their mouths at the same time they punched and kneed and gouged and kicked at each other the grelzer soldier was smaller than garivald but lithe and quick he gave at least as good as he got had garivald not twisted aside as the last instant the fellow would have thumbed out his eye as neatly as if he were scraping the meat from a freshwater mussel hold it right there the both of you or well blaze your balls off that shout froze garivald and his foe ever so cautiously garivald turned his head standing over them were sadoc and another irregular garivald pushed himself away from the fighter whod chosen the path opposite his hes one of ran he began but the fellow wasted no time showing what he was fast as a striking serpent he grabbed for one of the sticks in the snow he might have been fast as a serpent but he wasnt he couldnt be faster than two beams at that range the blowing snow didnt weaken them enough to matter one caught him in the chest the other in the head he thrashed and died still reaching for the stick a couple of feet away his blood stained the white with red he was still thrashing when sadoc kicked him filthy bugger the makeshift mage said if wed taken him captive wedve made him pay proper we couldve stretched him out for a day or two easy im just glad hes dead garivald said i dont care how it happened little by little his thudding heart slowed toward normal i thought he was one of usand he thought i was one of them he touched his face with a mittened hand the mitten came away wet with blood he could fight all these fellows could fightcan fight they hate swemmel as much as we hate the redheads he kicked at the snow he hadnt really believed that was true now he saw hed been wrong sadoc pointed in the direction of the main fighting weve given this here pack of bastards all they wanted anyhow sure enough the men loyal to raniero sullenly withdrew from the fields but after munderic found what losses the irregulars had taken he ordered them back toward the woods too we arent going to do anything at kluftern not beat up like we are he said well have to wait till the grelzers and the algarvians chase some more men into our camp and they will powers above know they will garivald thought he was bound to be right but the river ran both ways if swemmel and the thought of staying under the rule of unkerlant roused such passion in the breasts of at least some who fought for raniero the river ran both ways he saw the beginning of a song there but deliberately chose not to shape it hed already decided which way he was going in the ruins of sulingen trasone and sergeant panfilo lined up in front of a steaming kettle you know what trasone said as the queue snaked forward tell me panfilo urged both algarvians by now sported full bushy beards their mustaches and side whiskers and chin strips all but lost in the rest of the coppery growth they had almost no hot water with which to help stay trim moreover the beards went some way toward keeping their cheeks and chins warm im bloody jealous of major spinello thats what trasone said for all you know hes dead panfilo said so what trasone said id still be jealous of him panfilo considered that then slowly nodded something to it he admitted this isnt where id come on holiday ill tell you not even the snow could make the wreckage of sulingen look anything but hideous and the algarvian soldiers whod trudged all the way to the banks of the wolter were hardly more lovely than the ruins theyd helped create filthy unshaven scrawny hungrier by the day dressed in clothes half their own and half scrounged from unkerlanter corpses they would have cause apoplexy had they paraded through the streets of trapani all they had left all that hadnt changed was their spirit when trasone got to the kettle a cook slapped a chunknot a very big chunkof boiled meat onto his mess tin what is it he asked suspiciously and poked it with his knife he eyed the cook its too tender to be your sister id say it was jackass but here you are in front of me the cook retorted trasone collected a slab of breada very small slabfrom another cook and sat down on the stone steps of a house that wasnt there anymore as panfilo came over and sat beside him he took a bite of the meat when he did he made a horrible face maybe it is jackass he said to panfilo or else horse or behemoth what do you think panfilo ate a little himself after some thought he said whatever it is its been dead for a while like thats a surprise trasone said with a snort only meat we get these days near enough is from our own beasts the unkerlanters killor from the ones that just fall over dead because they havent got anything to eat either itd all be a lot gamier than it is if this lousy place werent cold enough to do duty for a rest crate after another bite panfilo said im pretty sure its not dragon anyhow if i had a choice between starving and eating dragon im buggered if id know which one to pick having choked down dead dragon the winter before trasone nodded you eat too much of that stuff the quicksilverll poison you or thats what they say i dont know how youd eat that much though he paused his mess tin was empty hed disposed of the bread in two bites too with a sigh he said when we were hungry enough though it didnt seem that bad you know oh it seemed bad panfilo had finished his meager meal too but youre right i guess hungry was worse he took a handful of snow and scrubbed at his mess tin were liable to be that hungry again pretty soon if we dont break out of here were going to be that hungry again afraid youre right trasone raised an eyebrow at the sergeant we get hungry like that again i will be jealous of spinello even if hes dead before panfilo could answer shouts came from the north dragons our dragons trasone and panfilo both scrambled to their feet and trotted toward the dragon farm in what had been the city square these days it was the only part of sulingen that unkerlanter eggtossers couldnt reach when the city was first cut off dragons had come fairly close to bringing in enough supplies to keep the algarvian army there fighting as well as it ever had these days though the dragons had to fly a lot farther than they had then worse the unkerlanters knew the routes they had to use and often lay in wait for them every day it seemed fewer ran the gauntlet lifes bloody wonderful you know trasone remarked as the dragons began spiraling down toward the battered square hows that panfilo asked if they fly in charges for our sticks and eggs for the tossers well starve but well be able to keep fighting while we do it trasone answered if they fly in food well have enough to eatwell almostbut swemmels whoresonsll ride roughshod over us and if they bring in some of each well sink a couple of inches at a time the way weve been doing what i wish theyd fly in is enough kaunians to make a magic thatd fry the unkerlanters toes off panfilo said but it doesnt look like they can do that either it didnt look as if the algarvians outside of sulingen could do enough of anything to stave off defeat here trasone resolutely didnt think about that along with the rest of the algarvian soldiers in the square he unloaded crates of food and other crates full of eggs and charges loaded them onto sledges and hauled them away soldiers were draft animals in sulingen these days for most of the real draft animals were dead most of the dragons that flew north out of the square bore only their fliers some carried wounded men slung beneath them as the crates of supplies had been trasone sighed as he watched one of them get off the ground just about worth taking a beam in the brisket he remarked in thoughtful tones panfilo replied these days theyve got mages checking the wounded if you blaze yourself you dont go thats fair trasone said at once and then hotly and futter you too sergeant if you think id do that to myself i dont panfilo chuckled and you cant get out by being courtmartialed for cursing a superior either unkerlanter dragons visited the square as the last of the algarvian beasts were leaving heavy sticks around the farm blazed down a couple of the rockgray dragons others attacked the algarvian dragons in the air still others dropped eggs on the square huddled in a hole trasone said if they were as efficient as they like to brag on being they would have hit us while our dragons were still on the ground here if they were as efficient as they like to brag on being they would have killed the lot of us a long time ago panfilo said and trasone could hardly argue with him a few days later he and trasone along with most of the soldiers whod been holding the line in the east against the unkerlanters theyd never quite managed to drive from sulingen trudged north toward the outskirts of the city the great belt of rubble theyd created that now sheltered them against the worst the unkerlanters could do you think we can break out trasone asked panfilo one professional talking to another figuring the odds sixty eighty miles maybe more than that for all i know against all the unkerlanters in the world and most of the behemoths wont be easy panfilo gave a professional answer still he added if were going to try wed better try now we probably should have tried two weeks ago or longer than that but ill tell you something weve got a better chance now than we would in another couple of weeks and if we dont break out its only a matter of time that was professional commentary too trasone thought it over after a few paces he kicked at the snow panfilo nodded as if hed answered in words all the algarviansand the sibians and yaninans trapped in sulingen with themlooked as ragged as trasone did he was surprised to see theyd managed to muster a couple of troops of behemoths he hadnt thought so many were left alive in the ruined city on the wolter an officer not far away was haranguing his men every one of you lousy buggers is a stinking nasty son of a whore you ever want to get between your mistresses legs again youre going to have to fight like it just remember these fornicators who fight for swemmel are standing between you and all the pussy in algarve the soldiers cheered trasone joined in the officer swept off his hat and bowed he knew how to get his countrymen ready to fight all right eggtossers sent their cargoes of death flying toward the unkerlanters entrenched out beyond the northern edge of the city chainmail clanking on them the behemoths lumbered forward to batter a way through the enemys lines and footsoldiers went forward with them to protect them from unkerlanter soldiers going forward in the open seemed wonderful to trasone after so long scuttling among the ruins like a rat and for the first few hours the algarvians did nothing but go forward smashing through one unkerlanter line after another they didnt think we had it in us trasone exclaimed they dont know what were made of but the unkerlanters though they buckled did not break they fought fiercely even when taken by surprise and soon began throwing swarms of behemoths at the algarvians panfilo had been exaggerating when he said they had most of the behemoths in the world around sulingen but not it seemed by much the algarvian crews were better trained than their unkerlanter counterparts but that mattered only so much swemmels men could afford to lose three four five behemoths for every one they slew and still come out ahead in the game despite everything the algarvians kept making progress to the north through most of the second day of the attack by that afternoon they were down to a bare handful of behemoths the unkerlanters still had plenty and dragons painted rockgray appeared overhead in large numbers they dropped eggs on the algarvians and swooped low to flame soldiers caught out in the open i dont know how were going to go any further tomorrow trasone told panfilo got to try the sergeant answered try they did the next morning a convulsive desperate attack that carried them another couple of miles farther north and then try as they would they could advance no more when the unkerlanters counterattacked behemoths leading the way the algarvians fell back before them they retreated faster than theyd advanced by the time the sun rose yet again theyor those of them who still livedwere back among the ruins of sulingen the unkerlanters had fought for those ruins street by street now mezentios men would have to do the same having beaten the algarvians into the city once more swemmels men showed no great eagerness for a final struggle among the ruins trasone understood that it would have cost them more men than even swemmel might feel comfortable paying they gave the algarvians three days of near quiet to rebuild their defenses as best they could on the fourth morninga freezing cold onetrasone stood sentry at the northern outskirts of the city when he spied a lone unkerlanter coming toward him the fellow wasnt a solitary madman or an infiltrator he carried a whiteand greenstriped flag of truce parley he shouted in algarvian i come from marshal rathar with a message for your commanders what kind of message trasone asked a call on them to surrender the unkerlanter answered if they yield now they and all of you will be well fed well housed generally well treated so marshal rathar swears by the powers above but if you go on with this senseless useless fight he cannot answer for what will happen to you well i cant answer for my generals trasone replied he stood up in his trench and waved the unkerlanter forward come ahead pass through ill take you to themor ill take you to somebody wholl take you to them anyhow he didnt suppose thered be any fighting till the generals made up their minds if nothing else that bought a little more time and what did the algarvian generals say captain friam marshal rathar asked when the young officer whod gone into sulingen with his surrender demand came into his presence once more lord marshal they rejected your call out of hand friam answered they were full of oily politenessyou know how algarvians arebut they said no and they didnt say anything else theyre out of their fornicating minds general vatran burst out theyre crazy if they think they can hold us back very long and theyre worse than crazy if they think they can lick us my guess is they dont think either of those things rathar said but they know how many men well have to use to slam the lid onto their coffin and nail it down tight if they give up we can take all those men and throw them at the algarvians farther north the ones who arent surrounded vatran rumbled something deep in his chest after a moment he nodded aye that makes a deal of sense however much i wish it didnt theyre good soldiers curse them theyd be a lot less trouble if they werent thats all too true rathar gave his attention back to captain friam take a chair young fellow dont stand there stiff as a poker he raised his voice ysolt bring the captain some tea and pour some brandy in it aye lord marshal ysolt had a real hearth to work with now after the attack that cut the algarvians in sulingen off from their comrades rathar had moved out of the cave overlooking the wolter and into a village halfway between the encircled city and the unkerlanter attacks farther north this surely had been the firstmans house the cook gave the captain his tea and an alarmingly predatory smile to go with it after friam had gulped down the steaming contents of the mug rathar asked him what did you see how did things look there inside sulingen well as to the city itself lord marshal theres no city left not to speak of friam answered its all rubble and wreckage far as the eye can see rathar nodded hed already known as much what about the algarvians he said what sort of shape are they in theyre worn friam said theyre scruffy and theyre hungry and their peckers are drooping on account of they didnt break through to the north they never had a chance to break through to the north rathar declared that was the public face he put on the fighting that had followed the redheads desperate push it was in fact likely true but considering what the algarvians had had with which to attack theyd come appallingly close to success vatran hadnt been wrongno indeed mezentios men made good soldiers what happens if we hit em a good lick vatran asked friam will they fold up and make things easy for us sir i dont think so the young captain replied we all know how algarvians arewhen theyre down they dont show it much but i think theyve still got fight in em and the field works theyve built in sulingen theyre formidable people even trapped even driven back into their den after daring to stick their noses outside mezentios men still exerted a malign influence on the unkerlanters who fought them rathar knew too well they exerted a malign influence on him because they were so good they made their enemies believe they were even better have they got any behemoths left he asked i saw some friam replied i wouldnt be surprised if they led me past em so i would see and i saw dragons flying in more supplies and flying out wounded men we havent been able to cut them off rathar said discontentedly but i think we will soonweve finally got eggtossers up to where they can bear on all the parts of sulingen they hold they wont land many dragons once they see the beasts going up in bursts of sorcerous energy as soon as they touch how long can they go on fighting without supplies vatran asked rathars smile was even more predatory than ysolts had been thats what were going to find out he said and vatran and friam smiled in a way that echoed his he slapped friam on the back you did very well captain if they wont yield they wont and if they dont well just have to make them youre dismissed go on get some rest weve got more fighting ahead of us as the captain saluted and left one of rathars crystallomancers said lord marshal ive got a report from the force moving on durrwangen by his tone rathar knew the report wouldnt be good tell me he said they brought up behemoths from down this way and smashed up our attacking column pretty well the crystallomancer said looks like theyll be able to hold west of the city oh a pestilence the marshal exclaimed in disgust general vatran cursed with a good deal more imagination than that rathar said i wanted to trap that second army too and now those whoresonsll be able to get out through durrwangen if youd pulled off the double pocket youd have gone down in history forever vatran said im not going to lose any sleep about history rathar said if id shut both pockets on the redheads we could have had the war within shouting distance of being won king swemmel had wanted the war wonhad insisted on ita year before that hadnt happened unkerlant was lucky the war hadnt been lost this past summer that rathar could speak of such possibilities meant nothing at all because his soldiers hadnt been able to bag the second army as they had the one down in sulingen vatran said weve got some more work to do sure enough well grind the army in sulingen to dust well run the redheads out of durrwangen and well see how far we can chase them before the spring thaw stops everything and well see what sort of surprises mezentios boys pull out from under their hats in the meantime rathar said do you really think we can just chase them and have them go too much to hope for i suppose vatran said next time the algarvians do just what we want em toll be the first as if to underscore that a few eggs fell in and around the village rathar wondered if the redheads had somehow learned he was headquartered here or if mezentios dragonfliers had simply spied soldiers and behemoths in the streets and decided to leave their calling cards if an egg burst on this house the hows and whys wouldnt matter the marshal refused to dwell on that he studied the map to see what sort of reinforcements he could send to the unkerlanter army west of durrwangen the only men he saw were the ones involved in the attack on sulingen he grimaced the algarvians there had done right by not surrendering vatran was making similar calculations he said even if we pull soldiers out of the south weve got no guarantee that well take durrwangen mezentios menll hang on to it tooth and toenail not only for itself but because its the key to their road north is it worth risking sulingen for a chance at seizing durrwangen i dont think wed risk sulingen but rathar wasnt happy as he turned back to the map still and all if the redheads in there found we had nothing but a little screen up against them theyd be liable to break out and make trouble all over the landscape and isnt that the sad and sorry truth vatran said you just cant trust algarvians to sit there and let themselves get massacred heh rathar said though it wasnt really funny vatran had a point if the initiative was there to seize mezentios men would without fail seize it he wished the unkerlanters showed as much drive as much willingness to do things on their own if they saw the chance he knew of too many times when theyd let the algarvians outmaneuver them simply because they didnt think to do any maneuvering of their own of course the algarvians werent so burdened with inspectors and impressers they didnt need so many people like that more of them lived in towns and more of them had their letters rathar didnt know how king swemmel could run his vast sprawling ignorant kingdom without hordes of functionaries to make sure his orders were carried out having those functionaries over them though meant the peasants didntwouldntdo much thinking on their own they waited for orders instead if we take the sure thing rathar said slowly we clear the algarvians from a big chunk of the south vatran nodded rathar went on as long as we make sure they never get to the mamming hills we go a long way toward winning the war vatran nodded again rathar continued we cant take any chances about that we cant let them get into a position of driving deep into the south again well take the sure thing and then well bang heads with them farther north i hate that but i dont see that we can do anything else for whatever its worth to you lord marshal i think youre right vatran said and after sulingen goes down then we can throw everything weve got at durrwangen and when we do that i dont think the algarvians can hold it no not in the wintertime rathar agreed theyre better at that game than they were last year but theyre not good enough i wonder when well be able to go forward in summer vatran sounded wistful hardly seems fair the things the algarvians do to us when the weathers good it isnt fair rathar said but were getting better too they still have more skill than we do but were gaining and were throwing more men into the fight than they can were throwing more of everything into the fight than they can sooner or later thats bound to pay off sooner or later vatran echoed gloomily but then he brightened i think youre right their big hope was to knock us out of the fight that first summer when they didnt do it they found themselves with a problem on their hands he pointed at rathar how does it feel to be a problem lord marshal a lot better than not being a problem would rathar eyed the map once more now that hed made up his mind he wasted no time on half measures in that he was much like his sovereign if were going to take out sulingen lets throw everything we have at it the sooner the redheads yield or the sooner they die vatran broke in aye or the sooner they die the sooner they stop fighting down there anyhow the sooner we can shift men to the north again rathar drummed his fingers on the tabletop and they know it too curse them otherwise they would have surrendered they wont get terms that good again they dont deserve em vatran said and im amazed the king didnt pitch a fit when you offered them truth to tell i didnt ask him rathar said which made vatrans bushy white eyebrows fly upward but if they had surrendered hed have gone along that would have gone a long way toward winning the war too and winning the war is what he wants one of the things he wants vatran said the other thing is he wants to grind mezentios pointy nose in the dirt youd better not try to take that away from him i wasnt rathar said but he did wonder if swemmel would see things the same way nineteen these days bembo had a hard time swaggering through the streets of gromheort even oraste as stolid and unflinching as any algarvian ever bornhe might almost have been an unkerlanter as far as temper wenthad trouble swaggering through the streets of the occupied forthwegian town too many walls had a single word scrawled on them sulingen its still ours bembo said stubbornly as long as its still ours these stinking forthwegians have no business mocking us and they ought to know it he kicked at the slates of the sidewalk he didnt even convince himself let alone oraste let alone the forthwegians oraste said were going to lose it we couldnt push soldiers down there and the ones who were down there couldnt get out he spat its not an easy war that was a sizable understatement bembo said i wonder what theyll do when they run out of kaunians here in forthweg good question oraste shrugged probably start hauling em out of jelgava and valmiera plenty of the blond buggers in those places his chuckle was nasty and they cant get away with magicking their looks or dyeing their hair black there either nothing but blonds in the far east well thats so bembo tried swinging his truncheon but even that couldnt give him the panache he wanted but wholl get em on the caravan cars and send em west do we have enough men in the east to do the job oraste spat again we can have the constablesthe blond constables i meando it for us why not theyd be glad to i betand glad nobody was shipping them off instead of the whoresons theyre catching you think even a kaunian would stoop so low bembo asked kaunians are kaunians oraste sounded very surebut then oraste always sounded very sure about everything their hair may be blond but their hearts are black for that matter their hair may be black too at least in gromheort bembo said id like to get my hands on the bastard who thought of that wouldnt he squeal when i was done with him what we need are mages to nail the ones using those spells army needs em more than we do oraste said army gets what it needs we get whats leftif theres anything left usually we just get hind tit somebody behind the two algarvian constables shouted sulingen bembo and oraste both whirled bembo raised his truncheon as if to break a head oraste grabbed for his stick both gestures were useless the forthwegians they saw were all just walking along the street no way to tell which one of them had shouted and they were all smiling enjoying the occupiers discomfiture ought to blaze a couple of em just for fun oraste growled thatd teach em not to get gay itd probably touch off a riot too bembo pointed out and if the bigwigs ever found out who did that theyd throw us in the army and ship us off to unkerlant all they want is for things to stay quiet here he sighed with relief when oraste reluctantly nodded of course the occupiers wanted peace and quiet in forthweg anything but peace and quiet would have required more men algarve had no men to spare anybody who wasnt doing something vitally important somewhere else was off in the freezing trackless west fighting king swemmels men i bet it was a kaunian who shouted that oraste said maybe bembo answered of course the forthwegians love us too they just dont love us quite as much as bembo had used love to mean something else so oraste said something that could have meant love the forthwegians the burly badtempered constable went on those whoresons didnt have the balls to get rid of their own kaunians but do they thank us for doing it for em fat chance bembo said when does anybody ever thank a constable part of that was his usual selfpity part a cynical understanding of the way the world worked then around a corner he heard a cacophony of shouts and screams he and oraste looked at each other they both yanked their sticks off their belts and started running by the time bembo turned that corner he was puffing hed always been happier about sitting in a tavern eating and drinking than about any other part of constabulary work and his girthespecially now that the constables werent marching out to the villages around gromheort to bring back kauniansreflected that all the yelling was in forthwegian which he didnt understand but pointing fingers were obvious enough so were the three men running down the street as fast as they could go knocking over anybody who got in their way robbers bembo exclaimed a brilliant bit of deduction if ever there was one he raised his voice to a shout halt in the name of the law he shouted inevitably in algarvian it might have been gyongyosian for all the good it did oraste wasted no time on yelling he lowered his stick sighted along it and started blazing buggers wont go anywhere if we kill them he said what if we hit a bystander bembo asked the street was crowded what if we do bembo answered with a scornful shrug who cares you think this is tricarico and somebodyll call out his pet solicitor if we singe his pinkie not fornicating likely he was right of course bembo also sighted along his stick by the time he did so two of the robbers had vanished around a corner but the third one or a man bembo presumed to be the third one sprawled motionless on the slates of the sidewalk good blazing bembo told oraste i should have killed all of them his partner answered he started toward the man he had killed lets see what weve got before some lightfingered forthwegian walks off with the loot whatever it is a crowd had formed around the corpse people were pointing at it and exclaiming in their unintelligible language move aside curse you move aside bembo said and made sure people moved aside with a few wellplaced elbows then he got a good look at the body and said well ill be a son of a whore what else is new oraste pointed down to the dead man and said what do you bet the other two were the same i wouldnt touch that bembo said the corpse had black hairhair that surely had to be dyed for the mans build skin tone and long face were all typically kaunian i bet he looked like a forthwegian till your beam caught him bembo added of course he did oraste said now lets see what he was trying to lift bembo picked up the leather sack that lay by the dead mans outflung right hand he looked inside and whistled softly all sorts of pretties rings and necklaces and earrings and bracelets and i dont know what he hefted the sack it was heavy all right good stuffgold and silver or i dont know anything you dont know bloody muchyouve made that plain enough oraste said but ill believe you know whats worth something and what isnt a forthwegian spoke up in good algarvian thats my jewelry gentlemen ill have you know he held out a hand for the sack at the same time asking where are the other two bandits they said theyd cut my throat if i didnt give them everything i had on display i believed them too theyre long gone pal oraste didnt sound particularly brokenhearted about that either youre cursed lucky you had constables around otherwise you never would have seen any of your stuff again this way you get some of it back and one of the bad eggs is dead he spat on the corpse stinking kaunian you get some of your pretties back eventually bembo added for now its evidence of a crimeand serious crime and even more serious because these outlaws were kaunians with illegal very illegal sorcerous disguises maybe the jeweler had been robbed before maybe he just knew how the minds of algarvian constables worked his expression sour he said you mean youll make the stuff disappear for good if i dont pay you off i never said that bembo answered righteously everyone else gathered around the dead kaunian was listening being corrupt was one thing getting caught being corrupt something else again still more righteously he went on what youre saying violates our regulations oraste gave him a horrible look having killed a robber he wanted to make a profit on the deal too fortunately the jeweler wasnt so naive as to take bembo seriously he said come back to my shop boys and we can talk this over like reasonable people once inside the shopwhich had several glass cases opened and several others smashedbembo said all right pal just how reasonable do you propose to be he and oraste left without the sack of trinkets but with a couple of goldpieces each that hadnt been in their belt pouches before if id thought getting rid of robbers was such good business idve tried harder before oraste said if youd listened more to me youd have known that bembo answered your trouble is half the time you care more about smashing heads than making a good deal this time you got to do both what if i did oraste said wed better see if we can find out who that dead kaunian sack of turds iswas if we can get a name for him maybe we can find out who his pals are thats true bembo gave his partner a puzzled look oraste wasnt usually so diligent why do you want em so bad were you born that stupid or did you have to practice oraste asked whichever youre a champion why do you suppose the cursed kaunians were after a jeweler just for the take maybe but not bloody likely you ask me whos getting the money theyd take in from unloading those jewels nobody who likes algarvians any too well or im a naked black zuwayzi bembo saw nasty greedy men everywhere he looked years as a constable had taught him to do that he didnt see plots everywhere he looked here in gromheort maybe that meant he was missing things youd look good as a naked black zuwayzi he remarked youd look good as a mountain ape oraste replied its about the only way you would look good he turned to the people who were gawking at the robbers body anybody here know this filthy kaunian son of a whore hes liable to come from one of the villages bembo said but oraste shook his head hell be a townman you wait and see if he wasnt how would his pals and him know which place to hit bembos only answer was a grunt he hated it when oraste outthought him and oraste had done it twice in a row now nobody in the crowd spoke up bembo said i know you people dont much like algarvians but do you love kaunians do you want them robbing you next someone said isnt that the fellow named gippias bembo didnt see whod chosen to open his mouth but oraste did he knifed through the crowd and grabbed the forthwegian the man looked anything but happy about having to say more but that was just too bloody bad bembo and oraste looked at each other and nodded they had a name theyd find out more and if there was a plot theyd find out about that too more and more these days ealstan thought of vanai as thelberge things were safer that way even inside their flat they spoke more forthwegian and less kaunian than they had before shed turned the botched spell in you too can be a mage into one that really did what it was supposed to do when the spell that made her swarthy and stocky lapsed and she got her own features back for a while he would look at her sidelong a little curious a little surprised maybe that was because he wasnt used to seeing kaunian looks under her dark hair for her hair of course being dyed didnt go back to blond but maybe it was because he wasnt so used to her real looks any more too do you know what we can do he asked one evening after supper if you want to i mean vanai set down the dirty dish shed been washing no what he took a deep breath once hed said what he was going to say he couldnt back away from it we could go down to the hall of laws and get married if you want to i mean for a long moment vanai didnt say anything she looked away from ealstan fear ran through him was she going to turn him down but then she looked back tears streaked her face youd marry me in spite ofeverything she asked everything of course boiled down to one thing her blood no ealstan said i just asked you that to watch you jump and then fearful lest she take him seriously he went on im marrying youor i will marry you if you want to marry mebecause of everything i cant imagine finding anybody else id rather spend the rest of my life with im glad to marry you vanai said after all if it werent for you id probably be dead she shook her head dissatisfied with the way shed answered and i love you that sounds like a good reason to me ealstan walked over and kissed her one thing led to another and the dishes ended up getting finished rather later than they would have if he hadnt proposed when they woke the next morning vanais sorcery had slipped so that she looked like herself or herself with dark hair she quickly set the spell to rights waiting for ealstans nod to let her know shed done it correctly once she was sure of that she meticulously redyed her hair both above and below you dont suppose theyll have mages at the hall of laws do you she asked anxiously i wouldnt think so ealstan answered unless im daft any redhead with enough magic in him to make a flower open two days early is off fighting the unkerlanters his smile held a fierce delight and theyre not doing too bloody well even so thats why you find sulingen scrawled on every other wall lets see how many times we see it before we get to the hall of laws vanai said at least as happy at the idea of algarvian disasters as ealstan was they counted fourteen graffiti on the walk through eoforwic twice the name of the unkerlanter city had been painted over recruiting broadsheets for plegmunds brigade the combination made ealstan thoughtful i wonder if sidrocs down in sulingen he said hopefully the only thing wrong with that would be getting my revenge through an unkerlanter instead of all by myself would it do vanai asked after a little thought ealstan nodded aye it would do the hall of laws lay not far from king pendas palace in the days before the war judges and barristers and functionaries would have gone back and forth from one building to the other they still did the only difference being that most of them and all the highranking ones were algarvians now forthwegians did remain in the hall of lawsas clerks and other minor officials not worth the occupiers while to replace one of those clerks who looked so bored he should have been covered with dust handed a form to ealstan and another to vanai fill these out and return them to me with the fee indicated on the sign on the wall he droned not even bothering to point at the sign hed mentioned ealstan filled in his own true name and his place of residence that was where the truth stopped for him he invented his fathers name and declared that his fictitious forebear had been born and raised in eoforwic he didnt know whether the constables were still looking for ealstan son of hestan of gromheort but he didnt know that they werent either and didnt care to find out by experiment glancing over at vanais form he saw that the only truth shed told on it was her place of residence shed invented a fine forthwegian pedigree for herself their eyes met they both grinned this was all part of the masquerade when they went back to the counter the clerk barely glanced at the forms he was more interested in making sure ealstan had paid the proper fee on that he was meticulous ealstan supposed the algarvians would take it out of his pay if he came up short there having satisfied himself the clerk said there is one more formality do you both swear by the powers above that you are pure forthwegian blood without the slightest taint of vile kaunianity aye ealstan and vanai spoke together she must have expected something like this ealstan thought for not even a flicker of anger showed in her eyes but the occupiers required more than oaths a couple of burly forthwegian men came up to ealstan a couple of almost equally burly women approached vanai one of the men said step into this anteroom with us if you please he sounded polite enough but not like somebody who would take no for an answer as ealstan headed for the antechamber the women led vanai off in the other direction whats all this about he asked though he thought he already knew and sure enough the bruiser said ward against oathbreakers he closed the door to the antechamber then took a small scissors from his belt pouch im going to snip a lock of hair from your head he did then nodded when it failed to change color thats all right but you wouldnt believe what some of the stinking kaunians try and get away with im going to have to ask you to hike up your tunic and drop your drawers this is an outrage ealstan exclaimed he wondered what vanai was saying in the other room with any luck something more memorable than that with a shrug the forthwegian tough said youve got to do it if you want to get married otherwise you throw away your fee and you get the redheads poking and prodding at you not just fellows like me still fuming ealstan did what he had to do the tough with the scissors snipped again with surprising delicacy he looked at the little tuft of hair between his fingers nodded and tossed it into a wastepaper basket ealstan yanked his drawers back up i hope youre satisfied i am and now you can be the bruiser chuckled at his own wit so did his pal ealstan maintained what he hoped was a dignified silence vanai came out of her anteroom at the same time as he came out of his she looked furious like a cat that had just been forced to take a bath the two blocky women whod escorted her in there were both smirking but they werent restraining her ealstan assumed that meant shed passed her test he asked the clerk what do we have to go through now nothing the man answered youre married congratulations he sounded as bored saying that as he had through the rest of the proceedings ealstan didnt much care how he sounded turning he embraced vanai and gave her a kiss the two bruisers whod taken him away snickered so did the women whod examined vanaibut not closely enough the newlyweds left the hall of laws as quickly as they could not all of vanais fury turned out to be acting those those she came out with a classical kaunian word ealstan had never heard before id almost sooner have had your pair they couldnt have been worse about letting their hands wander where they didnt belong and they kept looking at me as if they thought i was enjoying it she said that kaunian word in a low voice but even more hotly than before now ealstan had a pretty fair notion of what it meant he said the ones who got hold of me werent interested like that they just wanted to make sure i was a real forthwegian well im a real forthwegian toonow i am vanai said and i took an oath to prove it she sighed i hate being forsworn but what choice had i none it was a wicked oath ealstan said if the oath is wicked how can you do wrong by swearing falsely he wasnt sorry when vanai didnt pursue that he saw the slippery slope ahead who decided when an oath was wicked whoever he was how did he decide this one seemed obvious to ealstan but it must have looked different to the algarvians married vanai said in wondering tones then she chuckled not altogether pleasantly my grandfather would pitch a fit i hope hes alive to pitch a fit ealstan said on the whole so do i vanai answered and he shut up in a hurry when they got back to the flat he unlatched the door he motioned for vanai to go in ahead of him while she was in the doorway he stepped in beside her took her arm so she couldnt fully pass into the flat and gave her a kiss she squeaked thats what we do at proper forthwegian weddings he said not the kind where the fee is the only thing that makes it real i knew that ive seen forthwegian weddings in oyngestun vanai said at a proper kaunian wedding there would be flowers and there would be olives and almonds and walnutsoh and mushrooms too of coursefor fruitfulness she sighed and shrugged however we did it im glad im married to you ealstan hadnt thought anything could make up for the shabby ceremonyno ceremony at all reallyand for the goons whod tried to make sure he and vanai werent kaunians in sorcerous disguise but that double handful of words did the job he kissed her again this time for the sake of the kiss not for anything else then he said i bet theres one part of the weddingor right after the weddingthats the same for forthwegians and kaunians vanai cocked her head to one side oh she said which part do you mean he wanted to grab her he wanted to take her hand and set it on the part of him he had in mind he did neither hed seen she didnt care for such thingsin fact she sometimes froze for a moment when he did them he still didnt know exactly what had happened to her before they came together but he thought something bad had one day she might decide to tell him if she did fine if she didnt he would live with that too and she was still standing there smiling waiting for his answer come into the bedchamber he said and ill show you he did she showed him too they lay side by side waiting for him to rise for another round he was eighteen it wouldnt take long stroking her he said thats better magic than any the sorcerers work it is isnt it vanai said i wonder if it was the very first magic and everything else grew out of it i dont know i dont suppose anyone else knows either ealstan said after a little while they began again the oldest magic of all if that was what it was had them well and trulyand happilyensnared talsu got up from the supper table im off he said in jelgavan and then in classical kaunian i go to learn my lesson gailisa beamed at him you sound so smart when you speak the old language only goes to show you cant always tell ausra remarked trying to smile at his wife and glare at his sister at the same time talsu feared he ended up looking foolish dont bother waiting up for me he said and went downstairs out the front door and onto the dark quiet streets of skrunda with the winter solstice not long past nightfall came early so it seemed to talsu at any rate from what hed read about how things worked down in places like kuusamo and southern unkerlant though he knew they had it worse and in the land of the ice people the sun didnt come up for days sometimes for weeks if you went far enough southat a time he tried to imagine that tried and felt himself failing a constable strode past twirling his truncheon he was a jelgavan but no jelgavan before the war would have swaggered that way learned something from the algarvians who give you orders talsu thought almost as if the constable had heard the thought he barked at talsu curfews coming soon youd better be off the streets aye sir i will talsu said that was true hed get to the house of kugu the silversmith before the curfew hour and then because skrunda would only get darker to foil any dragons that might fly overhead he would sneak home again the constables hadnt caught him yet and he didnt expect that they would even in the dark he knew the way to kugus hed been there many times now when he rapped on the door kugu opened it and peered out into the gloom through his thick spectacles ah talsu trakus son he said in the classical tongue come in you are very welcome i thank you sir talsu answered also in classical kaunian i am glad to be here i am glad to learn and that was true he hadnt worried much about kaunianity before the war as far as hed thought about such thingswhich wasnt very farjelgavans were jelgavans valmierans were valmierans and not to be trusted because they talked funny and the blond folk left in the far west were mere unfortunates and they talked even funnier they still used the classical tongue among themselves but if many of the algarvians knew classical kaunian and if they were so eager to destroy monuments from the days of the kaunian empire in jelgava and valmiera didnt that have to mean there was something to the matter of kaunianity of all folk of kaunian descent being in some sense one that was how it looked to talsu and he wasnt the only one in skrunda to whom it looked that way as usual he sat down at the big table bedecked with dice and with stacks of coins if the algarvians suddenly burst in it would look as if the students were in fact nothing but gamblers talsu wondered if mezentios menor the jelgavan constables who served under mezentios menwould care he doubted it if the redheads or their stooges came bursting in someone would have betrayed kugu and those who learned from him he exchanged nods and greetings sometimes in jelgavan sometimes in the old speech with the others who visited kugu every week everyone watched everyone else talsu wondered which of his fellow students had painted slogans on the walls of skrunda in classical kaunian he wondered if they had any real organization he rather thought so most of all he wondered how to join it how to say he wanted to join it without running the risk of betrayal to the algarvians let us begin kugu said and talsu knew that verb form was a hortatory subjunctive a bit of knowledge he couldnt have imagined having a year earlier the silversmith went on still in classical kaunian we shall continue with indirect discourse today i shall give a sentence in direct speech and your task will be to turn it into indirect discourse his eyes darted from one man to the next talsu we shall begin with you talsu sprang to his feet sir he knew kugu wouldnt take a switch to him if he erred but memories of his brief schooling lingered even so your sentence in direct speech is the teacher will educate the boy kugu said he said the teacher would educate the boy talsu said carefully and sat down he was beaming he knew hed done it right hed shifted teacher into the accusative case from the nominative and hed remembered to make would educate a future infinitive because the conjugated verb in the original sentence was in the future tense and kugu nodded that is correct let us try another one bishu this time he pointed at a baker bishu botched his sentence kugu didnt take a switch to him either he patiently explained the error bishu had made around the room the sentences went talsu did make a small mistake on his second one since others had done worse before him he didnt feel too embarrassed he didnt think hed make that mistake again either no one wrote anything down that wasnt because instruction in the days of the kaunian empire had been oral though it had but if there were no papers the algarvians would have a harder time proving the men at kugus house were learning what the occupiers did not want learned talsus memory exercised as it had never been before had put on more muscles than hed known it could hed also noticed he was speaking better more educatedsounding jelgavan than he had before learning classical kaunian gave him the foundation in the grammar of the modern language hed never had at last kugu lapsed into jelgavan that will do for this evening my friends my thanks for helping to keep the torch of kaunianity alive the more the algarvians want us to forget the more we need to remember go home safe and ill see you again next week his students about a dozen all told drifted out by ones and twos talsu contrived to be the last master may i ask you a question he said a point of grammar the silversmith asked can it keep till our next session the hour is not early and we both have to work in the morning no sir not a point of grammar talsu replied something else something where i trust you to know the answer he put a little extra stress on the word trust kugu a sharp fellow heard that behind the lenses of his spectacles his eyesa pale graybluewidened slightly he nodded say on sometimes even when speaking jelgavan he contrived to sound as if he were using the old language taking a deep breath talsu plunged i trust you sir where i wouldnt trust any of the other scholars here youre no fool you know what the algarvians are like kugu nodded again but said nothing more talsu went on i wish i knew some kind of way i could hit back at themi mean not by myself but one of a bunch of people working together do you know what im saying aye i know what youre saying the silversmith answered slowly what i dont know is how far to trust you if at all these are dangerous times even if i knew something you might be trying to learn it to betray me to the redheaded barbarians not to strike at them talsu yanked up his tunic and showed kugu the long fresh scar on his flank an algarvian knife did this to me sir by the powers above i have no reason to love mezentios men no reason to love them and plenty of reasons to hate them kugu rubbed his chin he wore a little goatee so pale as to be almost invisible in some light he sighed you are not the first to approach me you know whenever someone does i always wonder if i am sowing the seeds of my own downfall but now that you bring it to my mind i remember hearing of what you suffered and how unjustly at that algarvians hands if anyone may be relied upon i believe you to be that man sir talsu said earnestly i would lay down my life to see jelgava free of the invaders no kugu shook his head the idea is to make the algarvians lay down theirs at that talsu grinned ferociously eyeing him the silversmith smiled a thin smile of his own do you know the street where the arch from the days of the kaunian empire once stood i had better i was there when the algarvians wrecked the arch talsu answered all right good on that street half a dozen houses past where the arch used to begoing out from the town square i meanis a deserted house with two dormers kugu said come there night after next about two hours after sunset come alone and tell no one where you are going or why knock three times then once then twice then do what i or the other men waiting inside tell you to do have you got all that night after next two hours past sunset dont blab knock three one two follow orders talsu reached out and pumped the silversmiths hand i can do all that sir thank you so much for giving me the chance youve earned it you deserve it kugu answered now go back to your own home and dont let the constables nab you on the way dont you worry about that talsu said i can slide around those buggers slide around them he did he was very full of himself the next two days but he was often full of himself when he came back from his lessons in classical kaunian he wanted to tell gailisa where he would be going what he would be doing but he remembered kugus warning and held his peace on the appointed night he said i have to go out for a bit i should be back before too long though a likely story gailisa winked if you come back reeking of wine you can sleep on the floor the kiss she gave him suggested what hed be missing if he were rash enough to stagger home drunk thoughts of what he didnt intend to miss made him extra careful to dodge patrolling jelgavan constables he had no trouble finding the house kugu had named its whitewashed front made it seem to glow in the dark no light showed in either of the dormers talsu knocked three pause one pause two the door opened starlight gleamed off the lenses of kugus spectacles he carried no lamp nor even a candle good he said you are punctual come with me he turned and started into the pitchblack interior of the house over his shoulder he added close the door behind you we dont want to let anyone know this building is in use talsu obeyed as he shut the door he felt rather than hearing someone moving toward him he started to whirl but something smacked into the side of his head he saw a brief burst of light though there was no true light to see then darkness more profound than any in the dark dark house washed over him and swept him away when he woke pain and nausea filled him he needed a while to realize not all the rattling and shaking were inside his battered head he lay in a wagon clattering along over cobbles he tried to sit and discovered his hands and feet were tied someone slipped the hood off a lantern that little beam pierced him worse than the fiercest sun after the nastiest hangover hed ever had kugu he croaked laughter answered him the fellow holding the lantern said no the silversmith is trolling for more foolish fireeaters you deal with us now he spoke jelgavan with an algarvian accent partly from the anguish of the betrayal that implied partly from physical misery talsu heaved up his guts his algarvian captor let him lie in it as the reindeerdrawn sleighs carried pekka and her comrades through a stretch of southeastern kuusamo where no ley lines ran she began to grasp how little of her own homeland shed seen sitting beside her in the sleigh both of them bundled beneath thick fur robes fernao might have magicked that thought right out of her head in classical kaunian he said this might almost be southern unkerlant or even the land of the ice people i do not know those places she answered also in kaunian and until now i did not know the district of naantali either she stuck a mittened hand out from under the furs for a moment to wave on a map this is nothing but a blank spot fernao said of course pekka said that is why we are here after all wherever exactly here might be one stretch of low rolling snowcovered hills looked much like another here not even the forests of pine and spruce and larch and fir that clothed the hills around kajaani could survive she shook her head no that wasnt quite true as shed seen at a recent stop but the trees on these hills werent trees at all but bushes stunted things the eternal cold and wind would not suffer to grow above the height of a man does anyone actually live here fernao asked as pekkas had his wave encompassed the whole naantali district if you mean are there towns here or even villages the answer is no pekka told him if you mean do some of our nomads drive their herds through this country every now and againwell of course they do beneath the foxfur hat that was close to the coppery shade of his own hair fernaos narrow eyessure proof of kuusaman bloodnarrowed further they had better not not while we are here he said they will not pekka said reassuringly we have soldiers on snowshoes and skids patrolling a perimeter wider than any we could possibly need for this experiment she suspected some nomads could slip past patrolling soldiers even if the troopers went arm in arm but didnt mention that to fernao his thoughts this time glided along a different ley line a perimeter wider than any we could need for this experiment unless things go badly wrong if they go that badly wrong pekka answered none of us will be in any condition to worry about it a point fernao admitted a distinct point he started to say something else then pointed ahead instead is that where we are going i think so pekka said so far as i know it is the only real building in this whole district was it once a hunting lodge fernao asked no i do not think there is anything to hunt in these partsthere has not been since we cleaned out the last of the wolves hundreds of years ago pekka answered you have master siuntio to thank for the building he went to the seven princes and told them we might need a headquarters in some isolated place for our experiments here is a headquarters in an isolated place isolated is hardly the word the lagoan mage said desolate might come closer he had a point but pekka didnt feel like admitting it to her this structure here in the middle of nowhere was a sign of kuusamos might and also a sign of the importance of the work in which they were engaged but she was glad wolves had been hunted out of the land of the seven princes were any still here she felt sure she would have heard them howling of nights fernao said our experiments had better go well if they do not the sleighs will stop coming we shall quietly starve and no one will ever find us again no matter how hard people may look stop that pekka told him this is a civilized land no one would do any such thing and you know it he dipped his head to her mischief glinted in his eyes i will believe it but only because you say it their driver who up till then might have been operated by sorcery or clockwork chose that moment to speak up here we are he used kuusaman of course pekka wondered if he understood classical kaunian most sleigh drivers wouldnt have but he might have been chosen for something other than how well he could handle reindeer the hostelfor lack of a better word pekka thought of it as suchdid nothing to remind guests of the principality or of any other fine establishment back in yliharma it had been hastily built from yellow pine the timber so fresh it hadnt yet aged and weathered even in this harsh climate the roof climbed steep to keep snow from clinging smoke rose from the redbrick chimney though the wind swept it away almost at once soot here didnt stain the snow as it would have in a town there wasnt enough of it to matter how cold do you think it is fernao asked as he unswaddled himself and climbed out of the sleigh not cold enough to freeze quicksilver i dont think pekka also descended taking fernaos hand to steady herself on the way down the injured mage shifted his crutches for courtesys sake with both of them wearing thick mittens it was hardly a touch at all with help from their driver siuntio and ilmarinen were alighting from the other sleigh ilmarinen looked at the raw building set down in the middle of the raw land in perfect idiomatic kaunian he exclaimed everybody always told me id end up somewhere bad if i stayed on the ley line i was traveling but i never thought it would be as bad as this you didnt come here by ley line siuntio pointed out and you still have the chance of escaping ilmarinen shook his head the only way to escape is through failure if we fail one way they will send us back in disgrace to lands where people actually live and if we fail another way they wont find enough of us to send anywherebut theyll send more poor fools after us to see if they can get it right you have left out the possibility of success pekka reminded him oh no by no means ilmarinen replied success and escape have nothing to do with each other i assure you if we succeed if everything goes exactly as planned aside from being a miracle what will that do ill tell you what itll make the seven princes keep us here so we can go right on succeeding doesnt that sound like a delightful prospect it is what we have come here to do pekka answered of course it is the cantankerous mage said but pray pay attention pretty lady for thats not the question i asked you pekka looked around she didnt like the idea of being cooped up here but she was less worried about it than ilmarinen they will not keep us here for too long a time she said for they cannot keep us here for too long a time her kaunian was grammatically accurate but try as she would she couldnt make the old language come to life in her mouth ilmarinen blew her a kiss what an innocent soul you are siuntio was shivering standing there in the snow had pekka told him to go indoors he would have been too proud to listen instead she said i am cold and went inside herself that let siuntio and the other mages follow fernao was laughing a little he must have seen what she was up to fires laid by servitors roared in the hearths pekka took off her fur hat opened her coat and shed it a moment later to her relief siuntio needed no urging to go stand in front of a fireplace to her even greater relief the sleighs carrying their baggage the experimental animals and the sorcerous apparatus came up to the hostel just then so did the other sleighs in which rode the secondary sorcerersthe ones who would keep the animals alive in the cold and transmit spells from where they were cast to where they were needed the experiments would go forward then with that settled pekka claimed a room on the ground floor it too was about as far removed from the comfort and elegance of the principality as it could be it had a cotwith she saw plenty of thick wool blanketsa chest of drawers a stool and a small bookshelf filled with standard sorcerous reference books that last was a nice touch and almost made up for the basin and pitcher that stood on the dresser and the lidded chamber pot under the iron bed she couldnt have had a stronger reminder that they were out in the countryside still shaking her head in bemusement pekka went out and got her trunk she manhandled it back into the hostel doing her best not to get in the way of the secondary sorcerers who were bringing cage after cage in out of the cold fernao managed to get his own case inside and said something in lagoan what was that pekka asked it does not translate into kaunian i am afraid he replied in the classical tongue i said if i live out of my trunk any longer i shall turn into an elephant pekka scratched her head you are right it does not translate i do not understand at all in lagoan the word for a piece of luggage like this and the word for an elephants nose sound the same fernao explained it is a punnot a verygood one i fear i see pekka sighed any joke where you need an explanation will not be fanny afterwards a great and profound philosophic truth fernao said do you not feel as if we have fallen back through time to the days of the kaunian empire here we are speaking the old language getting all our light from fire without even a proper privy to our names i do think that pekka said till i also think of the sorcery we will be trying before long they would not have imagined the like in the days of the empireand how lucky they were not to have to worry about it i feel no power point close by fernao said that will make the magic harder to bring off we shall have to put all the initial energy into it ourselves which may be just as well pekka remarked considering how easily it can get out of hand fernao did not argue with her after supperplain food plainly cookedpekka was studying in her own room and making a hard job of it by candlelight when someone knocked on the door she opened it there stood fernao by kuusaman standards almost forbiddingly tall i would like to review some of the things we will be undertaking he said do you mind pekka considered the lagoan mage did not look as if he had anything else in mind she stepped aside no come in i thank you he perched on the stool a gangly redheaded stork pekka wished leino were there instead loneliness pierced her like iron like ice but her husband these days had worries of his own where shall we begin she asked i have found that the beginning is often the best place fernao replied his voice perfectly serious leino might have said the very same thing the only difference being that he would have used kuusaman not classical kaunian pekka snorted as she would have with leino hearing fernao say something her husband might have made part of her less lonely part of her more very well she said from the beginning fernao supposed it was possible that the wild southern uplands of lagoas held districts as barren and deserted as naantali but those districts if they existed would surely have been much smaller the journey to the hostel in the middle of nowhere had driven home to him how much larger than his own kingdom kuusamo was and now he and the kuusaman mages with whom he was working and the animal handlers and the team of secondary sorcerers in charge of the apparatus were on the move again he was quite certain no one in lagoas traveled by reindeerdrawn sleigh these days but the sleighs slid smoothly over the snow and the reindeer seemed more nearly tireless than horses would have been things could be worse he reminded himself the kuusamans could have tamed camels but the only specimens of those illtempered beasts on the island kuusamo and lagoas shared dwelt in zoological gardens having become more intimately acquainted with camels than hed ever wanted to down on the austral continent fernao missed them not at all beside him pekka said if we have not got enough empty land for the experiment here there is no kingdom save unkerlant that has got enough i think we will be all right fernao answered that would have been sarcasm except none of the three kuusaman mages seemed to think such jokes were funny they took this conjuration very seriously indeed if they got the energy release theyd calculated they had reason to take it seriously too if fernao was still not altogether convinced they would he shifted in the sleigh trying to get his healing leg somewhere close to comfortable the kuusaman physicians had promised the cast could come off when he got back to yliharma hed stay on crutches for a while after that though while the wasted muscles now under plaster got back their strength is it troubling you pekka asked a little he answered it is not too bad though not really not nearly so bad as it was just after it was broken the potions hed swallowed left his memories of those days blurry but not blurry enough i am glad you are healing pekka told him so am i now that you mention it fernao said which made her laugh he was also glad the two of them traveled in the same sleigh ilmarinen still famed with resentment over his presence like a volcano warning it might erupt at any time siuntio would have been a more congenial companion but his intellect intimidated fernao more than he was willing to admit even to himself he glanced over toward pekka he could see hardly anything but her eyes she had her fur hat pulled down low on her forehead and the fur robe pulled up over her nose no matter how little he could see of her though he knew she was prettier than siuntio and ilmarinen put together i wonder what it would be like she said to live out your days as a nomad in this kind of country fernao had had his fill of nomads as of camels down in the land of the ice people unpleasant he said at once for one thing consider how seldom you would have the chance to bathe pekkas nose must have wrinkled the fur robe stirred a little if it is the same to you i would rather not she said before fernao could mention any other reasons why he didnt care for the nomads life the sleighs stopped in the middle of a stretch of snowcovered waste not visibly different from the snowcovered waste over which theyd been traveling for the past couple of hours this is the place the driver said in kuusaman fernao was beginning to understand the language of lagoas eastern neighbors though he still made a hash of it when he tried speaking now we shall see what we shall see excitement crackled in pekkas voice do we have something here or have we spent a goodly sum of the seven princes money for nothing they did not see quite on the instant the animal handlers set up wooden racks to hold the cages of the beasts that would be involved in this exploration of what lay at the bottom of the way the world worked as the handlers set the cages on the racks some of the secondary sorcerers started the spells that would keep the rats and rabbits from freezing to death before the main magecraft began over this way called the kuusaman whod driven siuntio and ilmarinen out here fernao made his way through the snow planting his crutches and his broken leg with great care pekka paced along beside him he didnt know whether she could save him if he started to slip but she plainly intended to try to his relief she didnt have to moving slowly and cautiously he stayed upright for the quarter of a mile or so till he came to what he first thought to be an upswelling of earth under the snow but it proved rather more than that it was a low hut with thick walls of stone the doorway which one of the drivers shoveled clean faced away from the animals this was also readied in advance he asked pekka of course she answered the secondary sorcerers not involved in keeping the animals alive also came over to the stone blockhouse fernao decided was the best name for it siuntio said they will transmit to the beasts the spell we shape fernao hadnt thought about all the consequences of their sorcery now he realized he should have if this spell released as much energy as the kuusamans thought it would not being in the immediate neighborhood of that energy release looked like an excellent idea only one drawback occurred to him i hope they will not introduce any garbling that could be unfortunate it should not prove a difficulty pekka said they are skilled at what they do and if they do make a mess of things its liable to end up saving their necksand ours too ilmarinen put in we are going to succeed pekka said we are going to succeed and we are going to be safe while we are succeeding and if you think differently master ilmarinen i am sure the sleigh will take you out of all possible danger death is the only thing that will take me out of all possible danger ilmarinen retorted and stuck out his tongue at pekka that was something no one would have seen before a sorcerous experiment in lagoas instead of getting angryor at least instead of letting her anger showpekka stuck out her tongue too and started to laugh but she didnt laugh for long she walked out into the center of the blockhouse and chanted the ritual words with which kuusamans began any magical operation fernao still didnt believe those claims of kuusaman antiquity but he discovered he understood much more of the chant than he had when he first came to the land of the seven princes when pekka finished she turned to the secondary sorcerers and asked are you ready they nodded she asked the same question of ilmarinen and siuntio both master mages nodded too pekka turned to fernao and you as ready as i can be he replied because of his limited grasp of kuusaman his role in the conjuration could only be trying to stave off disaster once it was already loose he didnt think he would be able to do that and hopedhoped with all his hearthe wouldnt have to try i begin pekka said this time not just to steady herself but also to warn the secondary sorcerers the chant and passes were mostly familiar but this spell was more potent than any theyd tried before fernao had suggested some of the improvements he hoped they would serve siuntio and ilmarinen remained alert they were the first line of defense if pekka faltered fernao studied her hed never had much use for theoretical sorcerers when they did step into the laboratory they too often forgot which hand was their left and which their right but pekka had an air of calm that suggested she really did know what she was doing as she incantedand that she wouldnt panic if she did make a mistake the secondary sorcerers also seemed very competent as they relayed pekkas magic to where it would be most needed the rows of animal cages fernao hoped the other group of secondary sorcerers the ones whod been keeping the animals warm had known when to depart if they hadnt they would be in danger now he assumed they had the kuusamans would be neither so heartless nor so slipshod as to leave them had he fallen in among unkerlanters now pekka incanted with ever greater urgency despite the work of the secondary sorcerers fernao felt the energies inside the blockhouse build and build his hair tried to stand on end that wasnt fright it was sorcerous energy on the loose the other mages hair also started to stand up straight as if lightning had struck nearby it hadntnot yet out in the cages on the snowy plain though the rats and rabbits would surely be getting frantic here it comes fernao thought he wanted to say it out loudhe wanted to scream itbut held back for fear of hurting pekkas concentration she cried out one last word of kuusaman fernao had learned what that final command meant let it be accomplished and it was accomplished the thunderous roar from the direction of the racks of cages was astonishing overwhelming the ground shook beneath fernaos feet brilliant white light appeared for a moment between the planks of the roofplanks that had till then been thickly covered with snow fernao wondered if the blockhouse would come down on the mages heads it held the shaking cease the light faded fernao bowed to the kuusamans it appears your calculations were accurate i thought you optimistic i see i was wrong we did what we set out to do as always in the aftermath of such conjurations pekka looked and sounded ghastly food and rest would revive her but for now she was fordone fernao wished he could tell her to lean on him but he probably would have fallen over had she tried we did it aye ilmarinen said and now half the mages in the world will know weve done something large even if they dont know what we dont know what siuntio pointed out maybe we had better go see he was the first one out the door the kuusamans whod built the blockhouse had known what they were doing when they made that door face away from the racks of experimental animals fernao made his own slow way out and then stopped in astonishment no dragon could have carried an egg anywhere near big enough to gouge such a crater in the ground the burst of energy had flung snow back far past the blockhouse leaving bare ground behind ilmarinen ran toward the center itself be careful fernao called after him but he wasnt listening the kuusaman master mage paused at the edge of the crater picked something up and violently waved it about fernao had to get closer to see what it was when at last he did awe and dread prickled through him ilmarinen held a bright green clump of fresh spring grass handlers fastened loads to the dragons of sabrinos wing the dragons bellowed and hissed at the idea of being made into beasts of burdenor perhaps just from general bad temper sabrino had little sympathy for them at the best of times and none whatsoever now he waved to the chief dragon handler can you make them carry a little more to his disappointment the fellow shook his head colonel id love to but i dont dare youll be flying a long way and the beasts are anything but in the pink of condition the idea is for them to come back and fly more loads not to try and do too much all at once and break down reluctantly sabrino nodded all right that makes more sense than i wish it did he bowed to the handler sweeping off his fur cap as he did so i am glad enough to own that you know your business like i say i wish i could do what you want the handler answered i know what our comrades need down there same as any algarvian does well were going to bring diem as much as we can sabrino raised his voice to a great fullbodied shout to me you whoresons to me we run the gauntlet one more time out of their tents came the men who werent already standing by or mounted on their dragons not very many since most of the dragonfliers were as eager to fare south as was their commander when the handlers finished the job of loading the dragons they waved sabrino by then atop his own mount waved back he whacked the beast with his goad it screamed in outrage beat its great wings and all but hurled itself into the air despite the heavy burden it carried one after another the remaining dragons in the wing followed their farm lay close to the fighting front before long they flew south out of the land the algarvians still held and into the terrain unkerlanters had seized in this second winter counteroffensive footsoldiers on the ground blazed at them without a doubt crystallomancers sent word of them farther southin the direction of sulingen sabrino let out a glum weary curse he had to fly a nearly straight path to the besieged city had it been much farther from his dragon farm the dragons wouldnt have been able to get there at all not if they carried anything worthwhile clouds scudded through the air getting thicker as the dragons flew farther south sabrino spoke into his crystal lets use those to hide in the less swemmels whoresons see of us the less chance theyll have to try to blaze us down dragons didnt care about clouds one way or the other sabrino was glad these were intermittent otherwise he would have had a hard time making sure he was flying south as things were he got glimpses of the terrain below every so often he didnt need more than glimpses hed flown this route a great many times and so it was when he passed over the presseck river that he warned the men of his wing dont fly too straight and smooth and stupid around these parts the unkerlanters have a lot of heavy sticks waiting down there give em a good target and youll pay for it his own dragon didnt take kindly to dodging now this way now that to speeding up and slowing down or indeed to much of anything else he didnt care whether the beast took kindly to it or not so long as the dragon obeyed that sufficed sure enough beams came to life below the wing he watched the flashes with respectful attention none came particularly close to him none brought down a dragon he knew better than to rejoice too soon the unkerlanters would have another blaze at the wing on the way back his dragons would be unladen then but they would also be very worn somewhere up ahead unkerlanter dragons fresh ones would be flying back and forth across the route he and his comrades would have to take sometimes they found the algarvians sometimes they didnt sabrino doubted that was the most efficient way to use dragons but king swemmel hadnt asked for his advice this time he and his countrymen were lucky if the unkerlanters had spotted them it would have meant a running fight in the air all the way down to sulingen as things were the algarvian dragons flew on undisturbed toward the stillburning pyre of the muchbattered city unkerlanter footsoldiersthe men besieging the algarvians trapped in the wreckage of sulingenstarted blazing at the dragons that didnt worry sabrino much footsoldiers brought down dragons only by the strangest of chances but swemmels army would have heavy sticks too and those were truly dangerous as he did on every trip into sulingen sabrino marveled that anything there was left to burn his countrymen had fought their way into the place in late summer had fought their way through it as summer gave way to autumn and had been trapped inside it since the middle of autumn since not long after snow began to fall down here now one block at a time the unkerlanters were taking back what theyd previously lost the same way a big green white and red banner marked a badly pocked city square up till a couple of weeks before that had been the place where dragons landed to unload supplies and to take wounded men off to safety algarvian dragons didnt land in sulingen anymore no part of the city that mezentios men still held was out of range of unkerlanter eggtossers landing these days was suicidally risky but that banner still made a useful beacon sabrino spoke into his crystal all right boys you can see where the goodies are supposed to go put em down as close as you can he used his sawedged knife to cut the cord that attached the crates of food and charges and medicine to his dragon those crates plummeted down he placed them as carefully as if he were dropping eggs on the unkerlanters and he clapped his hands with glee when they came down in the square where algarvian soldiers could recover them most of his men were as careful or nearly as careful as he he cursed when a few crates fell well wide of the mark the soldiers on the ground had given his wing king swemmels men would probably get their hands on those but he clapped again to see algarvian soldiers tiny as ants from the height at which he watched them run out to grab the supplies they needed so desperately some of them waved or blew kisses to the dragons overhead behind sabrinos goggles tears stung his eyes he spoke into the crystal again weve done what we came for now lets get back give our beasts as much rest as we can spare themgrab a little ourselves too come to thatand then come down here and do it all over again aye colonel that was captain domiziano smiling out at sabrino from the crystal who knows we may find a way to lick those unkerlanter buggers down there so we may sabrino answered he would not say anything that might hurt the wings morale not in public in the privacy of his own mind he wondered how domiziano managed to hold on to such boyish optimism for a little while though he could be optimistic himself freed of so much weight his dragon flew like a young fresh beast which it assuredly was not or maybe he thought i havent flow a young fresh dragon for so bloody long ive forgotten what its like he found the answer to that riddle sooner than he would have liked his wing hadnt got very far north of sulingen when unkerlanter dragons assailed them as often happened his men were slower to spot the unkerlanters than they might have beenin rockgray paint the enemy dragons looked like nothing so much as detached hostile bits of cloud powers above theyre fast he muttered as the unkerlanter squadron closed with the men and dragons he commanded after a moment he realized they werent so very fast after all it was just that his own dragons couldnt come close to matching the foes turn of speed had the unkerlanters been able to equal his dragonfiiers in skill his wing would have suffered badly for swemmels men flew fresher beasts but no matter how fast they were none of the unkerlanters had seen much action they didnt dive from on high as they might have and they did start blazing too soon when they werent close enough to their targets to have much chance of hitting no matter how fresh and fast their dragons were they paid for those mistakes sabrino and his men were veterans they knew what they could do what they couldnt and how to help one another when they got in trouble had it been a tavern brawl the unkerlanters would have complained that the algarvians didnt fight fair as things were rockgray dragons and the men who flew them tumbled toward the snow far below one after another in quick succession one of those unkerlanters intent on some other algarvian flew right in front of sabrinos dragon as if he werent there at all from fifty yards perhaps less even a poor blazer could hardly have missed sabrino was as good with a stick from dragonback as any man breathing a quick blaze and the unkerlanter dragonfiier no longer was breathing his dragon suddenly out of control went wild by luck the first beast it attacked belonged to another unkerlanter sabrino nodded in sober satisfaction but his men did not have it all their own way two of their number also plummeted to the ground before the unkerlanters had enough and broke off their attack one of the algarvian dragons wounded but not ruined came down gently in the snow the flier aboard it might well have survived the landing how long he would survive once unkerlanter footsoldiers got their hands on him was unfortunately another question heavy weather closed in around the algarvians as they kept flying north the clouds shielded them from more unkerlanter dragons and from the heavy sticks down on the ground sabrino would have liked that better if those clouds hadnt been a harbinger of more dreadful weather blowing in from the trackless west a great roaring bonfire on the ground led him back to the dragon farm when he landed his dragons wings drooped limply so did the small head on the end of its long neck the beast didnt even protest when a handler came up and chained it to a stake sabrino knew exactly how the dragon felt he felt every one of his years as he unfastened the harness securing him in place and slid down to the frozen ground ever so slowly he walked toward the tents at the edge of the dragon farm he wanted a tender slice of veal and a fine brandy what hed get was a chunk of sausage and a mug of raw spirits cooked up from turnips or beets that would have to do colonel the call made him pause and turn his head up came captain orosio goggles shoved up onto his forehead sabrino waited for him when orosio had caught up with his wing commander he asked sir how much longer do you think well be flying down to sulingen orosio wasnt domiziano he had a notion of the way the world really worked sabrino was speaking to him alone not to all the squadron commanders through the crystal the truth here wouldnt hurt sabrino spoke it without joy but without hesitation not much longer orosio grimaced but didnt contradict him twenty have you ever smashed in a vipers head tewfik and then watched it die hajjaj asked oh aye your excellencya couple of times as a matter of fact his majordomo answered i wouldnt have lived to get all these white hairs if i hadnt especially once cursed thing was coiled up in my hat the zuwayzi foreign minister nodded all right youll know what im talking about the snake thrashes and thrashes for what seems like forever if you get too close or if you poke it with your finger youre liable to get bitten no matter how well youve smashed it am i right or am i wrong oh youre right lad no doubt about it tewfik said that almost happened to me matter of fact i was a young man and not so very patient tewfik was close to twenty years older than hajjaj who had trouble imagining him as a young man nodding again hajjaj said the point is though once its head is smashed in it will die regardless of how much it thrashes and even if it manages to get in a bite or two thats so your excellency tewfik cocked his head to one side and studied hajjaj youre not just talking about vipers are you what you accuse me of allegory hajjaj laughed but not for long no im not just talking about vipers im talking about the algarvian army down in sulingen or whats left of it ah tewfik weighed that news from those parts isnt good i will say news from those parts could hardly be worse hajjaj answered to his majordomo and to his senior wife he could speak freely with everyone else even with king shazli he guarded his words the algarvians will soon be crushed they cannot help being crushed and what will that do to the course of the war tewfik asked he had not spent upwards of half a century as majordomo to a leading zuwayzi house without acquiring a good deal of knowledge and without getting a feel for which questions were the important ones no question right then was more important for zuwayzafor the whole of derlavai come to that but hajjaj naturally put his own kingdom first it means the algarvians are going to have a demon of a time knocking unkerlant out of the war now he answered and if they dont if they dont swemmels men are going to do some knocking of their own tewfik predicted he needed no magecraft to see what lay ahead there how right you are hajjaj said and how very much i wish you were wrong what will you do your excellency tewfik asked i know you will do something to keep us safe everyone in zuwayza knew hajjaj would do some such thing hajjaj only wished he knew it himself or had some idea of where such an escape might lie he understood why his countrymen relied on him he had after all been the kingdoms foreign minister throughout its independent history sometimes he said with a sigh life offers a choice between good and better more often it offers a choice between good and bad and sometimes the only choice one has is between bad and worse i fear we are in one of those times now youll lead us through it lad tewfik said confidently i know you will you got the unkerlanter garrison out of bishah after all if you can do that you can do anything in the chaos that followed the six years war hajjaj had indeed persuaded the unkerlanter officer in charge of bishah to leave the city in the hands of its own people whod promptly raised shazlis father to the throne of a newly free zuwayza but that case wasnt comparable to this one the unkerlanters had been eager to go so they could throw themselves into the twinkings war then engulfing their whole vast kingdom these days hajjaj had no such convenient levers with which to manipulate affairs he saw that only too clearly why couldnt anyone else see it at all eager to escape tewfiks unbridled optimism he said i am going down into bishah please have my carriage readied as soon as may be of course the majordomo gave him a creaking bow you will want to be close to the news as it comes in so i will hajjaj agreed some folk down in the city knew better than to think him a master mage of foreign affairs his mouth twisted he wished king shazli were one of those people since it hadnt rained for a few dayseven in winter rain around bishah was only intermittentthe road had firmed up the journey down to the city in fact struck hajjaj as quite pleasant the road wasnt dusty as it always was in summer and the rains that had fallen made longdormant plants spring up all over so the hillsides were green with occasional speckles of orange or red or blue flowers bees buzzed everywhere down at the palace people buzzed everywhere hajjaj was not unduly surprised when his secretary said marquis balastro craves an audience at your earliest convenience your excellency tell him he may come qutuz hajjaj answered i will be interested to hear how he turns this latest disaster into a triumph of algarvian arms i wish he could your excellency qutuz said and hajjaj had to nod a couple of hour later the zuwayzi foreign minister greeted king mezentios envoy in bishah you have terrible taste in clothes your excellency balastro said considering how seldom i wear them that should hardly surprise you hajjaj replied qutuz brought in tea and wine and cakes then hajjaj didnt use the refreshments to string things out to the degree he sometimes had he wanted to find out what was in balastros mind after hurrying through the ritual sips and nibbles he asked and how fare things with you and your kingdom were making the unkerlanters pay a fearful price for sulingen balastro said hajjaj inclined his head without answering the algarvians hadnt come to sulingen for that purpose and balastro admitted as much its not the way we would have had things turn out there which i can hardly deny well hit swemmel more hard licks yet see if we dont may it be so hajjaj murmured algarve made an imperious demanding unpleasant ally but if the unkerlanters took the bit firmly between their teeth who could guess what theyd do to algarve and to zuwayza then to hajjajs surprise balastro said but that isnt what i came to discuss with you today no hajjaj said tell me what is in your thoughts by all means do if he wouldnt have to listen to balastro haranguing him about how algarvian victory was just around the corner despite whatever misfortunes the redheads had suffered at the moment he would face anything else with heightened equanimity leaning forward a little balastro said and so i shall your excellency youve taxed my kingdom for being first to use certain strong sorceries in the derlavaian war is it not so hajjaj had never before heard multiple murder mentioned so delicately he almost twitted balastro about that but held back all he said was aye i have taxed you about it and with reason i think why do you mention it now because my kingdoms mages tell me that down in kuusamo or lagoas our foes have done something even more vicious balastro answered they do not even know just where hajjaj asked and balastro shook his head hajjaj went on do they know just what the algarvian minister shook his head again hajjaj stared at him in some exasperation then why should i not believe you are weaving this from whole cloth for no other reason than to make me happier with you and more inflamed against your enemies because if the reports i get from trapani are anywhere close to true half the mages in algarve are tearing their hair out trying to figure out what in blazes the islanders have gone and done balastro answered hajjaj studied him he didnt think balastro was lying though the algarvian minister wouldnt have let an untruth or six stop him from doing what he judged would serve his kingdom best hajjaj asked do your mages think theyll be able to learn how should i know balastro returned theyve got a war to fight too they cant very well go haring after everything anybody else does but this was big enough to set them in a tizzy over it and i figured you ought to know by which he surely meant he had instructions from trapani to let hajjaj know the zuwayzi foreign minister said i shall consult with my own kingdoms mages depending on what they say i may or may not have more questions for you all right your excellency balastro got up from the nest of cushions hed made for himself on the floor of hajjajs office hajjaj rose too they exchanged bows balastro went on ive come to tell you what i had to tell you so now ill be on my way he bowed again and left he hadnt come to talk about the military situation or the politics that sprang from it hed come to talk about this lagoan or kuusaman magecraft whatever it was isnt that interesting hajjaj thought if balastro had some ulterior motive he was putting a lot of art and effort into keeping it hidden before hajjaj could do more than scrawl a note to himself to check with some leading zuwayzi mages qutuz came into his office his secretary for once looked quite humanly astonished well hajjaj said whatever it is youd better tell me i just had delivered to me a letter from hadadezer of ortah requesting a few minutes of your time this afternoon qutuz replied that is something out of the ordinary hajjaj agreed of course i will see the ortaho minister how else am i to satisfy my own curiosity hadadezer has been minister to zuwayza for twenty years and i am not sure i have seen him twenty times in all those years and i can count the times he has sought an audience on the fingers of one hand some kingdoms are lucky in their geography qutuz observed to which hajjaj could only nod ortah lay between algarve and unkerlant but its mountains and the swamps surrounding them had always made it impossible to invade and overrun thanks to them the ortahoin had dwelt there undisturbed since before the days of the kaunian empire hadadezer came at precisely the appointed hour he had a white beard that rode high on his cheeks and white hair that came down low on his forehead some folk wondered if the ortahoin were kin to the ice people ethnography though would have to wait after a polite exchange of greetings hajjaj spoke in algarvian how may i serve you your excellency i would ask a question hadadezer answered in the same language hajjaj nodded the ortaho said my sovereign king ahinadab sees war all around him with algarve in retreat he sees war coming toward him it is a very great war we have not got much skill in diplomacy for long and long we have had no need of such now how do we keep the flames of war from setting our homeland ablaze you are a most able diplomatist perhaps you will be able to tell me oh my dear fellow hajjaj exclaimed oh my dear dear fellow if i knew the answer i would tell my own king first and after that would gladly share what i knew with youand with the whole world youve stayed neutral so far perhaps you can keep it up and if not if not your excellency be as strong as you can for strength will let you save more than pity ever would hadadezer bowed that is good advice i shall convey it to king ahinadab he paused and sighed do not be offended but i wish you had something better still to offer offended not i sir hajjaj replied i wish i did too leudast had seen the algarvians running strong like the floods that sent rivers out of their banks theyd rolled west across unkerlant two summers in a row hed seen them in stubborn defense damming up the counterflow of swemmels men the winter before now here in sulingen he saw them in despair they had to know they were doomed a man hardly needed the acumen of marshal rathar to see they were trapped their comrades farther north had tried to reach them tried and failed the redheads in sulingen had tried to break out tried and failed algarvians dragons had tried to bring them the supplies they needed tried and failed no real hope remained for them yet they fought on and they still fought as only algarvians seemed to know how to fight every one of mezentios troopers had his own all but invisible hiding place every one of them had comrades sited so they could get in a good blaze at anybody who attacked him when they died they died very hard but die they did leudast stirred a corpse with his foot the algarvian his coppery whiskers all awry had the look of a scrawny red fox that had been torn by a wolf tough whoresons leudast remarked the admiration in his voice was grudging but it was real aye they are young lieutenant recared spoke with more wonder than admiration when we trained they said the algarvians werent so much he shook his head i cant imagine why they told us that probably didnt want to make you afraid too soon leudast thought but he didnt say it out loud recared had learned fast and made a pretty good officer now if he hadnt learned fast he would have been dead by now even if he had learned fast he might well have died the war didnt always respect such learning leudast had seen that too many times he pointed ahead toward the ruins of what had been a leyline caravan depot a good many of the buggers holed up there he remarked if we can drive em out of that strongpoint theyll have to pull back to right and left too recared nodded making their perimeter shrink is a good thing but by the powers above sergeantthe price well pay he wasnt hardened yet his face still showed a good deal of what he thought the poor men leudast nodded the regiment had taken a beating cutting off the algarvians in sulingen and another one fighting its way into the city weve got to make them pay sir thats the idea you know oh aye recared nodded but reluctantly he too pointed ahead carefully so as not to expose himself to snipers not much cover up ahead there though the boys would take a horrible pounding before they could close with the redheads can we get em to toss eggs at the ruins while we move forward leudast asked that would make the algarvians keep their heads down anyhow let me go back and ask our brigadier recared said youre right sergeantit would be splendid if we could he hurried off through the maze of holes and trenches that led to brigade headquarters when he returned he was grinning from ear to ear you got the eggtossers sir leudast asked eagerly no but i got something about as good recared answered a penal battalion just came to the front and theyll throw it in right here ah leudast said good enough better than good enough in fact those poor buggers arent going to be around at the end of the war any which way might as well get something out of them while theyre being used up then we go in after theyve taken the edge off the algarvians thats how i see it recared said theyll start the job and well finish it the men from the penal battalion started coming up to the front line a little before sunset almost all of them were leaner than the poor starveling algarvian corpse leudast had kicked some wore rags some wore the fine cloaks and greatcoats that went only to highranking officers though none showed rank badges some wore what had been fine cloaks and greatcoats now reduced to rags all of them stared ahead in glum grim silence an invisible wall seemed to separate them from the ordinary algarvian soldiers and that invisible wall wasnt the only thing separating them from their countrymen coming up to the front with them were a couple of sections of wellfed wellclothed guards if the men of the penal battalion tried to go back instead of forward when ordered into action the guards were there to take care of what the enemy would not in a low voice recared asked does anybody ever come out of a penal battalion i think so leudast said fight well enough long enough and you might even get your old rank back thats what they say anyhow of course if youre the kind of officer who runs away or does something else to get yourself stuck in a penal battalion how likely are you to fight that well he was only a sergeant if he ran away they wouldnt bother putting him in one of those battalions theyd just blaze him and get on with the war it started to snow again during the night dawn was a dark gray uncertain thing the men of the penal battalion passed flasks back and forth leudast had drunk some courage before going into action a good many times himself over in the ruins of the caravan depot what did the algarvians have to drink whistles shrilled the broken officers who made up the penal battalion sprang to their feet and grabbed their sticks without a word without a sound but those of their felt boots dully thudding on snow they swarmed toward the algarvian strongpoint no cries of urrano cries of swemmel either it was the eeriest attack leudast had ever seen perhaps because it went in so silently it surprised the redheads more than an ordinary assault might have the men of the penal battalion got a long way toward the caravan depot before they started to fall peering out ever so cautiously from behind what had been an ornamental limestone carving leudast watched the unkerlanters who didnt fall get in among the algarvians in the wreckage of the depot glancing over toward recared he asked now sir not quite yet recared answered well let them develop the enemy a little more first i think tactically that made good sense it was hard on the penal battalion though leudast considered then shrugged the battalion was there to be expended it existed for no other real reason officers restored to their posts were lucky accidents nothing more they waited the algarvians in the ruins of the caravan depot put up a ferocious fight leudast had expected nothing less the algarvians always fought hard here they had even less choice than usual those ruins were a linchpin for their line in the northern part of sulingen if mezentios men lost them they would have to pull back on a broad front and they couldnt afford that leudast pointed do you see sir there by the wreckage of the tower thats one of their strongpoints the attacks bogged down in front of it youre right sergeant recared agreed if it werent for the penal battalion we would have found that out the hard way the penal battalion was finding out the hard way but leudast understood what recared meant someone always got it in the neck if you were an unkerlanter you knew that better somebody else than you one of these days your turn would come no matter what you did now that we know where theyre strongest we ought to take another blaze at getting some eggtossers to give em what for leudast said thats what the penal battalions supposed to do recared said but then he relented youve got a point ill send a runner back well see what we can manage before long eggs did start falling on that algarvian concentration unkerlant had plenty of eggtossers around sulingen king swemmels men still didnt maneuver them as smartly as the redheads but this wasnt a war of quick movement not here it wasnt all they had to do was pound at the algarvians and pound they did after a while recared said i think were about ready now there was a little doubt in his mind as if he was asking leudasts opinion leudast nodded he thought they were ready too recared get to his feet and blew a long earsplitting blast on his whistle forward lads he shouted though he was more nearly a lad than most of his soldiers forward for king swemmel urra he was brave leudast had already seen that he charged toward the caravan depot at the head of his regiment urra leudast yelled as he too broke from cover king swemmel urra a few eggs burst among the unkerlanters as they surged forward but only a few the algarvians didnt have many tossers left and didnt have many eggs left to fling from them either theyd also buried eggs in front of their position the penal battalion had discovered that the hard way so did a couple of luckless men from recareds regiment dowsers could have found paths past the buried eggs but dowsers like trained men of all sort were in short supply in unkerlant king swemmel had plenty of footsoldiers though leudast dashed past dead men from the penal battalion then flung himself down behind a pile of bricks up ahead the algarvians were still shouting mezentios name they had spunk and to spare but there werent enough of them and they didnt have enough of anything but spunk one by one their battle cries fell silent a beam struck snow off to leudasts left raising a puff of steam he scrambled to the right and then bent low at the waist forward again a man from the penal battalion and an algarvian thrashed on the ground in a death struggle two fierce skinny miserable creatures both intent on living neither with much of anything left to live for which one had suffered worse in this war leudast wouldnt have wanted to guess he knew which one was on his side though as soon as he got the chance he blazed the algarvian thank you friend the unkerlanter from the penal battalion said in educated accents that belied his pinched halfstarved face and his fiercely glittering eyes he cut the dead redheads belt pouch open with his knife exclaimed in triumph and stuffed the little chunk of sausage he found there into his mouth only after hed gulped it down did he seem to remember leudast again you have no idea how good that is leudast started to say hed been hungry but something in the other mans expression warned hed get only scornful laughter if he did he contented himself with lets go get some more of those buggers then a moment later he did something smarter he gave the soldier from the penal battalion some of the black bread he had in his own belt pouch he felt ashamed that he hadnt thought of it right away the other unkerlanter made it disappear faster than a man should have been able to then he warned dont let an inspector see you do anything like that you could end up in my outfit easy as you please shoutsunkerlanter shoutsrose in triumph weve broken them leudast exclaimed aye so we have the man from the penal battalion sounded pleased but far from overjoyed it only means theyll kill me somewhere else with a nod to leudast he ran forward looking for the place cornelu lay asleep in the sibian exiles barracks next to the harbor in setubal the woman he was dreaming about was the most exciting hed ever imagined he was sure of it one moment she had costaches face the next janiras he was about to do what he most wanted to do when algarvian eggs began bursting not far away he tried to incorporate those roars into his dream but had no luck his eyes came open he sat up on his cot the rest of the men from the sibian navy whod escaped when the algarvians overran their island kingdom were likewise sitting up and cursing what good does this do them somebody said they cant send over enough dragons to make it likely theyll do lagoas any real harm it ruins our sleep cornelu said as far as he was concerned that was crime enough at the moment it gives them something to print in their news sheets too somebody else added something besides sulingen i mean my guess is they stopped printing much about sulingen a while ago cornelu said they dont like to let bad news out poor dears the other sibian said powers above grant them blank news sheets for years to come then several sibians laughed cornelu among them before cornelu could say anything morehe would cheerfully go on casting scorn on the algarvians as long as his body held breathan egg burst all too close to the barracks windows blew in shards of glass hissing through the air like hundreds of flying knives of all sizes one sliced the left sleeve of cornelus tunicand he realized a moment later sliced his arm as well he cursed his comrades were cursing too some those hurt worse than he were shrieking he opened and closed his left fist when he discovered he could do that he tore a strip from his blanket and bound up his bleeding arm then he set about helping his more badly wounded countrymen another egg burst almost on top of the spot where the first one had landed hardly any more glass flew the first egg had taken out most of what was in the windows but the barracks building itself groaned and shuddered like an old tree in a strong wind wed better get out cornelu shouted i dont know if its going to stay up no one argued with him more than one man shouted aye in various tones of agreement and alarm cornelu and another officer grabbed a bleeding comrade and half dragged half carried him out of the barracks the other officer set to work bandaging the bleeding man cornelu ran back into the building to get someone else out he had some light by which to see the algarvian eggs raining down on setubal had started fires here and there he grabbed a man who lay groaning by his cot and dragged him toward the door beams from heavy sticks shot up into the night seeking the enemy dragons overhead cornelu cursed again this time at how little good they were doing mezentio hadnt sent so many dragons south across the strait of valmiera for a long time eggs kept falling some farther away some closer cornelu looked up into the night sky and shook his fist at the foes he could not see as if in answer an egg landed on the barracks hed left only a minute or so before the burst of sorcerous energy knocked him off his feetknocked him head over heels in fact a brick shattered on the cobbles inches from his face spraying chips into his eyes he rubbed at them till his vision cleared but he hardly needed to see to know he would never sleep in that barracks hall again he could feel the heat of flames on his back the building was burning burning as the fire grew he dragged the wounded man farther from the wreckage lagoans ran this way and that intent on their own concerns the barracks was far from the only building afire along the waterfront some of cornelus comrades whod learned more lagoan in exile than he called out to the locals after a while the lagoans deigned to notice them parties of stretcher bearers came and took the men with the worst hurts off to the surgeons and mages who might help them that done though the lagoans left the exiles alone once more if the barracks werent burning down wed be freezing and would they care a sibian demanded indignantly not even a little they wouldnt they toss us at the algarvians like so many eggs and it doesnt matter to them if we burst oh it matters a little cornelu said it would even matter to king swemmel after all its more efficient when we die while were killing algarvians and after weve killed some than here uselessly in setubal then another lagoan shouted something incomprehensible at them in his own language whats that you say somebody shouted back in sibian the fellow took it for algarvian lagoans had a demon of a time telling the two languages apart but when he answered also in algarvian the sibian exiles managed to understand him bucket brigade from then till dawn cornelu passed buckets back and forth he stood between one of his countrymen and a lagoan with whom he had trouble speaking the work needed no words at all though he just sent full buckets one way and empties the other thick clouds spoiled the sunrise only very gradually did cornelu realize he was seeing by more than the light of the flames the bucket brigade battled not long after he did so a hard cold rain began to fall the weary men raised a weary cheer the rain would do more to stifle the fires than anything they could achieve on their own before long a lagoan officer blew his whistle and shouted a word even cornelu understood dismissed he didnt realize how truly worn he was till he stopped working he turned his face up to the rain and let it wash sweat and soot from his forehead and cheeks that felt goodpowers above it felt wonderfulfor a little while then he realized he was shivering and no wonder all he had on were the light tunic and kilt hed worn to bed and the rainwhich was starting to have peasized hail mixed in with ithad already got them good and soaked the lagoan whod labored beside him for so long put a hand on his shoulder and said youcome with me food he rubbed his belly tea he mimed bringing a mug up to his face hot good come cornelu understood all that every single word of it sounded wonderful aye he said in the best lagoan he had his new friend led him to a mess hall most of the men in there were dripping and more than a few of them wore only nightclothes roaring fires heated the hall past what would have been comfortable most of the time but it felt splendid now cornelu queued up for big salty fried herrings for buttery oatmeal nearly as thick and sticky as wet cement and for steaming tea so full of honey the spoon almost stood up without touching the side of the mug he ate as intently as he ever had while in the woodcutting gang back on his home island of tirgoviste herring wasnt reckoned a breakfast food in sibiu but he wouldnt have complained under any circumstances not as hungry as he wasand hed been doing so much hard work for so long the meal scarcely seemed like breakfast anyhow he went back for seconds so did the lagoan whod brought him here the fellow wore a petty officers uniform and had the breezy efficiencythe real sort not the artificial kind swemmel tried to instill into the unkerlantersof a good underofficer in any navy he spent a lot of time cursing the algarvians not so much for being the enemy in general or even for what theyd just done to setubal as for costing him half a nights sleep after rubbing his belly again this time in real satisfaction he glanced across the table at cornelu and remarked your clothesfftt that last wasnt a word in any language cornelu knew but he understood it he liked the sound of it too aye he said clothes fftt the lagoan got to his feet come with me he said again in the tones of a man giving an order he couldnt have known cornelu was a commander clothes went a long way toward making a man or in the case of sodden nightclothes toward unmaking him on the other hand he might not have cared had he known some petty officers got so used to bullying sailors around that they bullied their superiors too inside of another half hour he had cornelu outfitted in a lagoan sailors uniform complete with a heavy coat and a broadbrimmed hat to shed the rain i thank you cornelu said in sibian the phrased remained similar in all the algarvic languages its nothing the petty officer answered catching his drift then he said something cornelu couldnt precisely follow but it included mezentios name and several obscenities and vulgarities having taken care of cornelu the lagoan went on his way cornelu walked back to the crumpled sibian barracks the sour smell of wet smoke still hung in the air despite the rain but cornelus uniform all his effects the whole building were indeed fftt a sibian lieutenant still wearing nothing but soaked nightclothes gave him a look full of lacerating jealousy and said you seem to have landed on your feet better than anyone sir as far as i can see were on our own till the lagoans get around to providing for us all right that was what cornelu had hoped to hear im going into town then i want to make sure some friends are all right janira mattered to him balio her father mattered to him because he mattered to her after only a few strides toward the closest leyline caravan stop cornelu paused and cursed himself for a fool how could he get aboard without money but when he jammed his hands into the pockets of his new navy coat he found coins in one of themplenty of silver he discovered for the fare and for a good meal afterwards whod put it there the petty officer the quartermaster whod given him the coat he had no way of knowing he did know hed have a harder time looking down his nose at lagoans from now on he got out of the caravan car at the stop near the grand hall of the lagoan guild of mages hed passed several new stretches of wreckage on the way there the algarvians had hit setubal hard but cornelu knew it could have been worsemezentios men could have massacred kaunians instead of coming over and risking themselves people were standing around in the street near balios cafe cornelu didnt think that a good sign he pushed his way through the crowd a couple of men sent him resentful looks but gave way when they saw him in lagoan naval uniform he grimaced when he got to see the cafe it was a burntout ruin an egg had burst a few doors down burst and started a fire and there stood balio staring at the ruins of his business im glad to see you well cornelu told him and then asked the really important question is janira all right aye balio nodded vaguely shes around somewhere powers above only know how well make a living now though he cursed the algarvians in lagoan and sibian both cornelu joined him hed been cursing the algarvians for years he expected to go on doing it for years more and now he had a brand new reason news sheets in eoforwic had stopped talking about the battle for sulingen from that vanai concluded it was going badly for the algarvians the quieter they got she assumed the more they had to hide and the more they had to hide the better she liked it may they all fall she said savagely at breakfast one morning aye and take all their puppets down with them ealstan agreed powers below eat king mezentio powers below eat all his soldiers and powers below eat plegmunds brigade starting with my accursed cousin if the algarvians are ruined everyone who follows them will be ruined too vanai said she understood why ealstan hated plegmunds brigade as he did but one thing her grandfather had taught her that still seemed good was to search for root causes first the algarvians had caused forthwegs misery plegmunds brigade was only a symptom of it ealstan thought about arguing with her she could see it on his face instead he took a last bite of bread and gulped down the rough red wine in his mug pausing only to give her a kiss that landed half on her mouth half on her cheek he headed for the door saying its not worth the quarrel and i havent got time for one anyhow im off to see if i can help some men pay the redheads a little less thats worth doing vanai said her husband nodded and left my husband vanai thought it still bemused her it would have horrified brivibas not just because ealstan was a forthwegian though that alone would have been plenty but because of the mean little ceremony with which theyd been formally joined and what her grandfather would have thought about the two womanloving matrons whod checked the hair on her secret place she laughed imagining the look on his face if she ever told him about that she knew exactly what had let her get through it without smacking them it was simple the algarvians had already shown her worse what ealstan wished on his cousin she wished on major spinello for a long time after shed had to start giving herself to him shed doubted she would ever feel clean again falling in love with ealstan had gone a long way toward curing her there but after the two of them came to eoforwic shed had trouble feeling clean in the literal sense of the word washing with a pitcher and basin here in the flat wasnt a patch even on oyngestuns public bath and oyngestun was only a village eoforwic had the finest baths in all of forthweg up till very recently of course theyd done her no good at all she hadnt been able to show her face in public let alone her body now though she looked like a fortliwegian to everyone around her as long as her magic held when she looked in a mirror she saw her familiar kaunian features framed by much less familiar dark hair what she saw didnt matter so long as no one else could see it she went through the spell again to make sure it wouldnt wear off while she was out and about in eoforwic then she put some coppers in her belt pouch and left the flat now that she could head for the public baths she did usually every other day she had trouble thinking of anything she enjoyed more about the freedom shed sorcerously found with a sneer she walked past the bathhouse closest to her block of flats oyngestuns was better whoeverd built this one seemed to have thought well its plenty good enough for poor people here unlike in oyngestun she had other choices the bathhouse not far from the farmers market was a great deal finer she strode up the stairs that led to the womens side paid her little fee to the boredlooking attendant who sat there with a coin box and went inside she stripped off her tunic and gave it and her belt pouch and her shoes to another attendant who put them on a shelf and handed her a numbered token with which she could claim them when she finished bathing a couple of forthwegian women stripped off as casually as she had they didnt give her a second glance for which she was grateful but went off chatting with each other she followed a little more slowly in her own eyes she remained too thin and far too pale to make a proper forthwegian and her black bush seemed even more unnatural than the hair on her head but nobody else could see her fair skin and her pink nipples were that untrue she would have long since been caught one of the forthwegian women slid down into the warm pool its not what it used to be is it she said to her friend time was when you got in here it didnt matter how things were outsideyoud be warm nowadays a curl of her lips said what she thought of nowadays vanai had known warmer pools too but this wasnt so bad and eoforwic like most of forthweg had a mild climate even in winter she was also sure the soap had been finer once upon a time though that would come later in the bath it was always harsh and alkaline these days and varied between a nasty stink and an almost equally nasty cloying perfume today it was perfumed vanai could smell it across the bathhouse she tried not to notice that wasnt too hard she had plenty of water here and didnt need to worry about dripping all over the kitchen floor she ducked down under the surface of the warm pool running her fingers through her hair when she stood up straight again the two forthwegian women in the pool with her were making shocked noises for a dreadful moment she feared shed botched her magecraft and the charm had worn off much too soon then she realized the forthwegians werent staring at her but back toward the vestibule the nerve one of them said the brazen hussies the other agreed if the two algarvian women approaching the pool understood forthwegian they didnt show it forthwegiansand kaunians in forthwegtook nudity in the baths for granted these women didnt they walkedstruttedas if they were on display and both of them had a good deal to display even if the women in the plunge werent the ideal audience for their charms vanai wondered why theyd come to eoforwic were they officers wives officers mistresses wouldnt algarvian officers have found new mistresses here whatever they were they giggled as they slid down into the water giggling still they rubbed each other that wasnt the custom in public baths the forthwegian women looked scandalized and hastily got out of the hot pool vanai followed she didnt want to seem like an abnormal forthwegian in any way evidently she didnt for one of the forthwegian women turned back to her and said arent they disgraceful she kept her voice down but not well enough if the algarvian women did know forthwegian they would have had no trouble catching the disparaging comment vanai just nodded that wouldnt get her into any trouble unless the redheads chanced to look straight at her she and the forthwegian women jumped into the cold plunge together they all yipped the warm pool had been only indifferently warm the plunge was anything but indifferently cold some people stayed out of the warm pool altogether and did all their soaking in the cold plunge vanai thought such folk were out of their minds the two forthwegians must have agreed with her for they scrambled out as fast as she did all over gooseflesh they hurried toward the soaping area up close the scent of the soap was even more irksome than it had been at a distance vanai had a couple of little scrapes the suds stung fiercely she was lathering her legs when a splash and a couple of small shrieks came from the cold plunge maybe they didnt expect that she remarked hope not one of the forthwegian women said serve em right if they didnt you dont suppose the other forthwegian paused with left leg sudsy and right leg not you dont suppose theyll put soap on each other too after her unfortunate experience with the forthwegian matrons vanai had no interest in learning more about such things she finished soaping herself in a hurry then she grabbed a bucket with a perforated bottom filled it in a great tub of lukewarm water and hung it on a hook that came down from the ceiling she stood under it to rinse the soap off her skin and out of her hair rubbing at her hair after that first bucket went dry she discovered she still had some suds in it with a small sigh she took the bucket off the hook refilled it and got back under it once more she was still under it when the two algarvian women soapy all over came up and got their own buckets the forthwegian women had already gone off to swaddle themselves in towels one of the algarvians nodded to vanai and asked do you speak this language in pretty good kaunian no vanai answered more sharply than shed intendedwere they trying to entrap her she wouldnt fall for that both redheads shrugged and went back to getting themselves clean as they filled buckets and stood under them they talked back and forth in algarvian thanks to her grandfather vanai could read it after a fashion but she didnt speak much and didnt understand much when she heard it spoken but she did hear the word kaunians several times mostly in the mouth of the woman whod asked her if she spoke the classical tongue the other one pointed to vanai and said something more in algarvian vanai thought she knew what it meant something like why expect her to speak it theyre all gone if she let on she had any idea what they were saying it would only land her in trouble she knew that and kept rinsing her hair what she wanted to do was scream at the algarvians or better bash out their brains with a bucket had only one of them been there with her she might have tried that she didnt think she could kill two no matter how enraged she was both algarvian women laughed why because they thought all the kaunians in forthweg were dead and gone she wouldnt have been surprised but they were wrong curse them wrong she wanted to scream that too wanted to but didnt she only finished rinsing and went off to get a towel of her own she dried quickly threw the towel into a wickerwork hamper and handed her claim token back to the woman in charge of bathers clothes the women gave back her garments which she put on as quickly as she could she didnt want to be there when the algarvians came out to dress but she was theyd done a faster job of rinsing than she had out they came outwardly conforming to the forthwegian custom of nudity but in truth flouting it by flaunting their bodies instead of taking no special notice of them in the baths even the attendant noticed and she was as bovine a woman as vanai had ever seen she scowled and snapped at the redheads as she passed them their tunics and kilts they only laughed as if to say nothing a mere forthwegian did could matter to them and the worst of it was in ordinary times as far as the title could be applied to the war nothing the forthwegians did would or could let them rise up in numbers that would make them more than a nuisance to mezentios men and women in ordinary times what if times werent ordinary what if the unkerlanters ran the redheads out of sulingen what if the algarvians didnt look so much like winning the war would the forthwegians decide they werent going to stay quiet under the algarvian yoke forever if they did decide that how much trouble could they cause the redheads vanai didnt know she hoped she would get the chance to find out meanwhile shed go right on cursing the algarvians another winter istvan said another selfevident truth too what else would this be with snow filtering down through the trees of the trackless apparently endless forest of western unkerlant corporal kun said and where would we be if this werent another winter up among the stars with the other spirits of the dead thats where taking a sergeants privilege istvan said oh shut up kun sent him a wounded look he didnt usually take such privileges with a man beside whom hed fought for years istvan refused to let that stare bother him he knew what hed meant since kun didnt he set it out in large characters another winter here another winter away from my home valley away from my clansfolk i havent even had leave in most of a year he held his hands out to the little fire around which he and his men sat trying to get some warmth back into them then he looked down at his palms the scar from the wound captain tivadar had given him remained fresh easy to see despite calluses and dirt he didnt say anything about it not all the soldiers crouched around the fire had eaten goats flesh with him if he came home to the little village of kunhegyes on leave his family wouldnt know what the scar meant they would welcome him into their bosom with glad cries and open arms as they had the last time hed got away from the war for a little while they would have no idea he was at best only marginally purified from the uncleanness into which hed fallen if he didnt tell them they would never learn he could live out his life in the valley with no one the wiser he looked at the scar again whether his kinsfolk knew or not he would know he could imagine the knowledge eating away at him day by day month by month year by year he could imagine himself screaming out the truth one day just because he couldnt stand to hold it in any more what he knew counted for more than what anyone else knew szonyi spat into the flames his saliva sizzled for a moment and then was gone he said were a warrior race were here because were a warrior race sooner or later well win because were a warrior race were too stubborn to quit by the stars aye istvan said in a way that was the other side of the coin to his own thoughts gyongyosians did what they did because of what was inside of them not because of any outside force and then kun spat too in utter contempt oh aye thats why well be marching into cottbus week after next he said there arent enough of us here istvan protested more of us than there are unkerlanters the onetime mages apprentice said well but istvans wave encompassed the forest or as much of it as remained visible through the drifting swirling snow id call this place the arsehole of the world but you need to know where your arsehole is once or twice a day nobodys needed to know where these woods are since the stars made them we wouldnt have come as far as we have if we werent a warrior race szonyi said stubbornly some of us still believe in things we do next thing you know some of us will say weve stopped believing in the stars he stared a challenge back at kun but istvan took him up on it no nobody is going to say anything like that i didnt mean anything like that and kun didnt mean anything like that either if kun did mean something like that istvan didnt want to hear about it and he didnt want anybody else to hear about it he went on even a warrior can have enough of war for a while i suppose so szonyis voice was grudging if you dont see that thats true youre a bigger twit than anyone gives you credit for kun said wed be fighting among ourselves all the time if it werent enough istvan said and used his own rank to make sure it was enough still as far as he was concerned kun proved he came from a warrior race by the way he stood up to szonyi the hulking common soldier made two of the corporal but kun didnt back away from him off in the distance a couple of eggs burst everyones head came up are those ours or theirs somebody asked well find out kun said probably the hard way istvan wanted to contradict him but found he couldnt he did say those are more likely to be theirs than ours the unkerlanters have an easier time bringing eggtossers into the forest across the flatlands than we do hauling them over the cursed mountains that made it harder for the gyongyosians to show their full mettle as a warrior race too though istvan didnt suppose kun would ever admit as much more eggs burst these closer to the fire istvan grimaced then shoveled snow over the flames nobody said anything the soldiers all looked to their sticks some of them took positions behind trees from which theyd be able to blaze eastward if the unkerlanters really did have an attack laid on along with the thunder of bursting eggsrather muffled by the snow came shouts istvan couldnt tell what language they were in but they kept getting closer too he found a place behind a spruce of his own trouble was heading this way he didnt know whod started it but he doubted whether that mattered out of the snow came the first unkerlanters white smocks over their tunics and snowshoes on their feet istvan didnt think they knew he and his men were in place waiting for them from what hed heard the unkerlanters had the edge against the algarvians in the far east during the winter that wasnt so here he and his fellow gyongyosians knew as much about snow and ice and fighting in them as any unkerlanter ever born he waited till the first unkerlanter was almost on top of him before he started blazing that way he made sure he couldnt miss and that the blowing snow wouldnt attenuate his beam the unkerlanter gave a startled grunt and toppled the rest of the men who fought for swemmel stopped in alarm one of them pointed west past istvan deeper into the woods they thought the beam had come from that direction when no more of them fell for a little while they started moving forward again this time istvan wasnt the only one who blazed at them down they went one after another like oxen slaughtered for a nobles wedding feast a few of them let out howls of pain as they fell most simply died death taking them by surprise istvan had the feeling hed just disrupted the advance of at least a company after a bit the unkerlanters decided they wanted no part of the position he and his squad were defending they fell back he decided not to stay around and try to hold in place back he ordered urgently next things theyll do is theyll hit this place with everything theyve got as he knew winter so he knew the unkerlanters they didnt withdraw from a position because theyd lost hope of taking it they withdrew because they wanted to hit it a different harder blow runnerswell waddlers in this countrywere surely going back to their officers with the bad news some of those officers would have crystallomancers before too long fury would fall on the fighters whod presumed to slow swemmels soldiers and so for now retreat it galled istvan his instinct like the unkerlanters was to go forward first but he didnt know how many of the foe pressed against him and so he fell back a quarter of a mile having advanced through that stretch of the wood he knew what was there before long he and his men took a position as strong as the one theyd just left theyd hardly settled in when eggs started falling on the little clearing theyd abandoned the sergeant knows whats what szonyi said cheerfully if nothing had happened to that clearing istvan would have lost respect as things were he gained it being no less selfish than any other man he liked this better after a while silence returned up ahead what now sergeant kun asked the question was half serious half challenginga demand for istvan to prove he was as smart as szonyi said he was now we go forward again istvan answered at once both the warriors response and he was sure the right tactical choice theyll advance again and theyll be sure were all dead heres our chance to show em theyre wrong but weve got to move fast moving fast was easy enough till they got near the clearing theyd left the eggs had knocked down a good many trees and the gyongyosians had to scramble over or around them to get close to their previous position istvan didnt mind or not very much look at all the fine hiding places theyve handed us boys he said snuggle down and then well blaze them right out of their boots that wouldnt be bad szonyi said those big felt ones they wear hold the cold out better than anything we issue having seen a fair number of gyongyosians wearing felt boots whose original owners didnt need them anymore istvan could hardly disagree here they come kun snarled maybe hed used his little magic for detecting people moving toward him maybe he just had good ears and thanks to his spectaclessharp eyes the unkerlanters came on openly confidentlythey seemed sure their eggs had cleaned up whatever enemies might be waiting for them fools istvan thought they had to be new men men without much experience in battle veterans would have taken less for granted some fools lived and learned and became veterans istvan was determined that these men wouldnt again he chose to wait till the unkerlanters were almost on top of him before he started blazing again his men imitated him again they worked a frightful slaughter on swemmels troopers this time it was too much for the unkerlanters to bear they fled leaving dead and wounded behind them boots szonyi said happily and proceeded to strip them off the corpse closest to him and put them on his own feet those are too big istvan said theyre supposed to be big szonyi insisted that way you can stuff them full of cloth or whatever youve got so they keep your feet warm even better but whenever he moved the boots tried to slide off at last cursing he kicked them away and allowed well maybe they are a little too big let me try them istvan said i think my feet are bigger than yours he sat down on a tree trunk pulled off his own gyongyosianissue boots and put on the ones the dead unkerlanter had worn they fit him better than they had szonyi and they were warmer and more flexible than the ones hed had on he walked a few steps ill keep em let me see if i can find a pair to fit me kun said he had plenty of unkerlanter corpses from which to choose swemmels men had paid a heavy price for gaining not an inch of ground before long all the gyongyosians who wanted felt boots had pairs to suit them istvan nodded in no small satisfaction if you had to fight a war this was the way to go about it sometimes things ended as they began these days pinned back against the wolter in the many times ruined wreckage of sulingen trasone had plenty of chances to think about that he turned to sergeant panfilo who crouched beside him in the remains of what had been an ironworkers hut the last time we were here he said we were facing south not north aye so we were panfilo answered and we were wondering how we were going to pry the stinking unkerlanters out of those bloody big ironworks thatre behind us now before long theyll be wondering how to pry us out only thing im wondering right now is where in blazes im going to get some food trasone said and panfilo nodded neither of them had eaten for a while only a handful of algarvian dragons made it down to sulingen these days and the algarvian pocket in the city had grown so small a lot of the supplies they dropped ended up in the enemys hands in the trenches less than a furlong away the unkerlanters had their peckers up they knew they were going to overwhelm the algarvians here as surely as trasone did every so often they would burst into hoarse song the only thing they didnt do was stick their heads up out of the trenches to jeer at the algarvians who had come so far but not quite far enough the ones who tried that wouldnt live long enough to celebrate their victory just as trasone had learned a few words and phrases of unkerlanter so some of swemmels mean had picked up a little algarvian surrender one of them shouted now in a moment the cry resounded up and down the line surrender surrender surrender here and there algarvian soldiers yelled back their answers were uniformly negative and mostly obscene what do you suppose theyd do to us if we were stupid enough to give ourselves up panfilo asked i dont much want to find out trasone answered as long as i have a choice id sooner die quick and cleanif i can anyhow im with you panfilo said theyd have fun their mages would have fun his shiver had nothing to do with the bitterly cold winter day no id sooner make em earn it the unkerlanters were ready to do just that as if the algarvians refusal to give up angered them they plastered the frontline trenches with eggs they had plenty of tossers and plenty of eggs to toss the algarvians couldnt reply in kind they had to hoard the few eggs left to them for the moments when those eggs would be most desperately needed huddled in the wreckage of the hut sorcerous energy searing the air not far from him deadly fragments of metal and wood and stone hissing every which way trasone reckoned the present moment quite desperate enough for all ordinary purposes and then just when he thought things could grow no worse somebody behind him called weve got soup in the pot he groaned no matter how hungry he was nothing could make him enthusiastic about what passed for food among the algarvians in sulingen these days panfilo made a horrible face too and asked whats in it you dont want to know that trasone exclaimed about what youd figure the soldier at the soup pot answered old bones a few turnip peelings that meant it was a good batch a lot of the time lately it hadnt had any peelings to thicken it sometimes it hadnt had any bones either and was only hot water flavored by whatever had stuck to the sides of the pot from the previous batch what kind of bones panfilo persisted trasone shook his head the less he knew about what he poured down his throat the better but panfilo morbidly or not was curious and how old are they whatever we could dig up came the reply and theyve been frozen since whatever beasts they belonged to got killed so what difference does it make come back and have some if you want otherwise you can go on starving we go on starving even if weve got the soup on account of theres nothing real in it trasone said panfilo nodded he knew that too the trooper went on is it any wonder we sneak out and murder the unkerlanter pickets for the sake of whatever black bread and sausage theyve got on em he sighed he was on the front line which meant he was supposed to get a couple of ounces of bread every day sometimes he did more often he didnt panfilo said im going back there the way my bellys gnawing my spine anything is better than nothing not with whatll be in that pot trasone predicted but his own belly was growling like one of the wolves that prowled the unkerlanter plains and forests cursing the unkerlanters and his own officers impartially he crawled after the sergeant eggs continued to burst all around he was by now without fear or nearly so if one burst on top of him and finished him off it wouldnt be finishing much panfilo was already pouring down a mess tin full of soup when trasone got back to the hole in the ground that housed the cookfire the sergeant finished wiped his mouth on a filthy tunic sleeve and said youre rightits pretty bad im still glad i got it trasone sniffed the pot the cook hadnt told all of the truth some of the bones in there had had time to start going bad before they froze nothing else could have accounted for the faint reek of corruption that reached his nose but he held out his mess tin too if the soup poisoned him it wouldnt be poisoning much either as panfilo had he gulped the stuff down it tasted nasty but maybe not quite so nasty as hed expected and there were turnip peelings in there he actually had to chew a couple of times the cook hadnt been lying after all the peelings might create some small part of the illusion of fullness and the soup was hot that at least was real when hed emptied the mess tin he said powers above that hit the spot it sure did now wheres the sparkling wine and the beautiful broads to go with it no such thing as beautiful unkerlanter broads the cook said and trasone and panfilo both nodded that was an article of faith among algarvian soldiers in the west it hadnt kept trasone from visiting the brothels his superiors set up in unkerlant though hed usually picked kaunian women when there were any no brothels in sulingen no women at all in sulingen unless a few unkerlanters still survived in hidden cellars back to our position panfilo said trasone nodded it was no more dangerous there than here they hadnt been back in the ruined hut for long before the barrage of eggs already heavy got worse throughperhaps aroundthe bursts trasone heard unkerlanter officers whistles shrilling theyre coming he shouted and his was far from the only cry going up along the algarvian line and the unkerlanters were coming scampering through the wreckage of what had been a quiet riverside city diving into holes and behind clumps of rubble and then coming out blazing some ran bent at the waist others straight up and down trasone blazed at the men who tried to make themselves smaller targets they were the ones likely to be veterans the ones likely to be more dangerous if they got in among the algarvians swemmels soldiers tried one of these assaults every few days sometimes mezentios men threw them back with heavy losses sometimes they got in among the algarvians and bit off another chunk of sulingen at first trasone thought this would be another time when the unkerlanters spent lives and came away with nothing to show for it they fell in large numbers every advance they made came over the bodies of their slain they spent lives the way he spent his money when he got leave he didnt think hed get much more leave and he realized things werent going so well as he thought when algarvian eggtossers went into action over to his right unless things went badly his countrymen hoarded the eggs they had left they might as well have hoarded them for the unkerlanters broke into the algarvian trenches despite the pallid answer to their own almost ceaseless barrage urra they shouted swemmel now that the fighting was hot again they stopped asking if the algarvians wanted to surrender we have to hold them sergeant panfilo shouted to as many of the men in his squad as might still be alive we have to hold them right here if they break past us and make it to the wolter they cut the army in half besides trasone added in a low voice we havent got anywhere to run to anyway the ironworks panfilo said but his heart wasnt in it a lot of algarvian soldiers were already holed up there as they were in the ruins of the massive granary not far away but even if the frontline soldiers ran back there how likely were they to make it before the algarvians rolled over them not very and trasone and panfilo both knew as much turning trasone blazed at an unkerlanter coming at him from the east sure enough swemmels men had cracked the algarvian line the man went down whether blazed or only diving for cover trasone didnt know the unkerlanter didnt blaze back so maybe trasone had nailed him in a brief stretch of quiet he asked panfilo remember tealdo aye poor bugger the sergeant answered hes dead a year nowmore than that i suppose whyd you think of him all of a sudden he was in sight of cottbus when he went down thats how close he came thats how close we came trasone added for no algarvian had got more than a glimpse of the towers of the capital of unkerlant here anyway we got all the way into sulingen aye we got all the way in panfilo said we got all the way in but we arent coming out again before trasone could say anything several squadrons of unkerlanter dragons flew low over the embattled algarvians dropping more eggs on them and burning soldiers with flames all the stronger because they were fueled with quicksilver from the mamming hillsquicksilver that had brought the algarvians to sulingen and that algarve would never use now swemmels men were getting better at putting the pieces of their attacks together they werent as good as the algarvians but they didnt have to be they had more margin for error a cleverly concealed heavy stick blazed a couple of dragons out of the sky the algarvians still had a few fangs left in the long run though what did it matter it might make the battle last a little longer it wouldnt change who won behemoths panfilo shouted the yell held no terror not any more the algarvians left alive in sulingen were beyond that it was just a warning trasone wondered why panfilo bothered nobody could do much about behemoths not here not now the great armored beasts lumbered forward unkerlanter footsoldiers trotted among them the behemoths crews started tossing eggs at the spots where resistance stayed strong one flew straight toward trasone he watched it rise he watched it fall he dove for cover knowing there was no cover and he was too slow anyhow the egg burst a few minutes later the unkerlanter behemoths tramped past and over what had been a strongpoint and slogged on toward the wolter
