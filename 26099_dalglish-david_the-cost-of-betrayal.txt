the cost of betrayal david dalglish prologue t he room was dark and plain a strange combination for a supposed holy place take my hand child aresh said he stood inside the doorway the noisy streets of veldaren behind him his polished armor shone bright and the chainmail beneath the large sections of plate clinked from the movement of his outstretched arm im no child the woman said refusing his hand but entering anyway on either side of the wood walls were hard oak benches covered with thin blankets stitched golden mountains across their lengths there were no windows and only the one door she knew she should be worried a girl trapped alone with a strange man but he was a priest of ashhur and she was no normal girl she smiled at the priest he was middleaged with thinning hair around his ears and a nose much too large for his face to be attractive he smiled back his lips parting to reveal clean straight teeth we use this room for confession and difficult talk aresh said as he closed the door his voice sounded weak in the empty air and a bit eager many are not comfortable voicing their fears where others may hear there are matters that demand privacy even secrecy of course she said what about you tessanna is there anything you want to confess she noticed he had taken off the bulkier part of his armor and set it aside a part of her deep in the back of her conscience told her to be wary she wasnt ive done plenty she said her voice still soft and shy sounding much younger than her eighteen years but i wouldnt ever confess that implies i think it was bad or dont want to do it again i like the bad stuff ive done i liked it a lot areshs breathing had grown a bit louder and tessanna held in a laugh that is because you are sick he said your mind is broken tessanna shattered into pieces i have discussed this with my fellow priests even our high priest calan and we all agree your mind is like a puzzle someone must put the pieces back in the right order and that someone is you she asked the bench was cold and uncomfortable when she sat on it she crossed her arms over her chest and gave him a knowing wink can you put me back together she noticed how smooth he was even with her direct approach he was not smooth enough however to hide the fact that he had loosened the belt at his waist ashhurs grace is something we must all receive he said the glory of his light heals all wounds and it would be blasphemous to believe that you are beyond healing as some have said you are a beautiful girl tess she lay on her back her arms stretched over her head she was slender her skin milky white and smooth as polished stone her long black hair curled about her waist her eyes pierced areshs attraction stirring a bit of guilt and worry her irises were solid black so that her eyes were giant black orbs with hints of white at the edges and under her gaze he felt naked his smooth words seemed like childish lies unneeded and unconvincing can you fix me she asked a smirk touching the corners of her mouth close your eyes he said and do not be afraid i will give you my healing ashhur has blessed man and woman and through his blessing i will make you whole with her eyes closed she listened as his armor and belt hit the floor she felt a part of her retreating inward toward the center while the childish frightened girl remained on the outside passive and gullible when he climbed on top of her she dared believe it might work because she wasnt whole she was many she was sick and she had killed more people than aresh would believe he grunted and moaned and his jerky movements only elicited a tighter clenching of her eyes his hands fumbled across her breasts he tried to be gentle but she didnt care the pieces twirling in her mind waited and waited but they felt nothing ashhurs salvation aresh said before kissing her those words ignited something inside her something opposite what he intended salvation she said opening her eyes and looking at him with a cold stare that shriveled his stomach this is your salvation this is what ashhur can offer me he rolled off her short of breath and seeming small and weak without his armor and white tunic she giggled and the sound froze him where he stood i should have known she said i didnt want to know i tried not to know but you lied to me you shoved lies down my throat and kissed me to keep them down aresh pulled up his pants feeling a chill race up and down his spine tessanna slid off the bench and approached all childishness had left her vanishing as if it had never been it seemed an entirely new creature stalked him cruel and angry he towered over her by a full foot but still he felt terrified i have made you whole he said his voice quivering you filled a hole she said and you did a poor job at that she grabbed his wrist he couldnt tear away she weighed next to nothing she was so rail thin and bony why could he not pull away the muscles in his arm tensed then relaxed he felt a strange presence like a worm crawling in his brain when she spoke there was no trace of a smile no hint of shyness how many girls have you taken here she asked her hair lifted as if a strong wind blew through the room but aresh felt nothing only the icy grip of her hand and the digging squirming sensation behind his eyes ive neveryou dontlet go of me child i have done ashhurs work tessanna laughed but there was not a shred of joy in it if you do ashhurs work then let me do karaks she said aresh took a step back those eyes he thought why can i not look away from those damn eyes you dont want to do karaks work he said karak is evil and darkness those who worship him will spend eternity in the fires of the abyss is that true tessanna said lets find out he had no chance to scream before fire burst from tessannas fingers she bathed him in flame and when he finally did scream she laughed praise be to ashhur she shouted bathe in his light the light from her hands seared his flesh and when he was nothing but ash and bone a strong wind blew open the door and scattered his remains as the wind died tessanna knelt her hands clasped against her chest im sorry she said her cold anger was gone she was the shy young girl once more you said you could fix me you lied you hurt me ive been hurt enough i wont let anyone hurt me anymore mind still broken she walked out into the streets of veldaren unworried about her hiked up dress and exposed left breast when an old lady finally commented tessanna smiled thanked her and fixed her dress not a care in the world the lady muttered as tessanna walked on qurrah was the last to wake the sun was high in the sky dawn several hours past he kept his eyes closed and his body still every muscle ached from the battle of woodhaven the day before he thought of his escape with his masterformer master he corrected mentally velixar had died his body riddled with elven arrows tipped with blessed water abandoned and alone qurrah had staggered through the fire and corpses bitter and angry at his brother harruq for not being there in his time of need at the thought of his brother qurrah felt his stomach tighten he could hear harruq talking with aurelia an elf he had befriended over the past few months he was smitten though he seemed oblivious as to how badly their talk was of small things purposefully avoiding the conflicts of the prior day a pleasant smell teased his nostrils his stomach rumbled noisily qurrah finally coughed and stirred alerting the two to his awakening noticing the movements harruq trudged over food in hand morning he said handing him a plate full of sausage lettuce and buttered bread did you abduct a cook while i slept qurrah asked courtesy of the elf aurelia said walking over and finally youre awake hurry and eat qurrah took the plate and sampled a bit of sausage the warm food stirred his stomach he couldnt remember when he had last eaten he rammed food into his mouth not caring about any sort of manners aurelia watched him a small frown tugging at the corners of her mouth qurrah seemed pale and drained his muscles almost nonexistent as they clung to his bones he looked like a pathetic caricature of his brother one drained of warmth joy and trust but not strength aurelia knew well the strength the halforc hid powerful necromancy honed to a fearful precision at the hands of his master velixar both brothers were halforc halfelf and that mixture seemed to have unlocked a strange reservoir of power for the two of them many elves had fallen to them in battle overwhelmed by blade and magic careful there aurelia said as qurrah nearly choked on some lettuce i can make more if youre hungry i never expected you to outeat your brother a wave of her hand and the plate refilled the brown sausage steamed as if just taken from a fire qurrah stared and shook his head how a simple spell i could teach you if you wished the halforc resumed eating nodding as he did i would appreciate it harruq sighed remembering all the meager meals many stolen that he and qurrah had shared over the many years too bad you never learned that spell ages ago he grumbled after qurrah finished the three prepared for travel it didnt take very long considering their meager possessions qurrah had his magic whip which he wrapped around his arm and his pouch of bones and other components for his spells harruq buckled his swords to his belt ran a hand through his hair and then declared himself ready so where are we to go she asked her own few things tucked away in secret pockets of her dress we know little of this world qurrah said we have been exiled twice once for our blood and once for the blood we spilled aurelia winced still uncomfortable with mention of the battle harruq and qurrah had fought against her elven kin and slaughtered many but she had protected harruq and even helped him escape a day later she still was not sure why she just remembered the panicked desperate look in harruqs eyes when he thought she might die murdered by his own hands mordan banished my kind aurelia said and it seems now neldar has done the same east or west there is no home for me you said yesterday you could get us into veldaren harruq said is that true veldaren was the capital of the kingdom of neldar and had been the brothers previous home before they had been expelled only if you both play along aurelia said how we live once were in though will depend on you it might not be comfortable qurrah said my brother and i are used to the dark and the filth could you say the same dont treat me like a prissy child princess aurelia said ive lived longer than the two of you combined i can endure a bit of hardship now close your eyes harruq she placed her hands on his face as he stared at her with wide eyes um what are you doing aurry be quiet can you remember what veldaren looks like from beyond the gates yeah but why i said close your eyes concentrate on that image itll be hard knowing you but try anyway qurrah smirked as harruq did as he was told he remembered the great wall surrounding the city made of stacked stones each one taller and wider than several men he remembered the great oak doors lined with metal and steel he remembered the castle proper looming over the city with its great collection of towering spires and crenellated walls it was an awesome sight crafted by the hand of the dark god karak aurelia focused on these images lifting them from harruqs mind akin to a ladle drawing water from a well she focused on the fields of grass stretching from the front entrance on either side of a worn path perfect eyes still closed she let go of harruq and stepped back words of magic slipped through her lips the air before her ripped open into a flat whirling blue essence and there we go she said opening her eyes veldaren she stepped through the portal and vanished the two halforcs glanced at one another you first my brother qurrah said id hate to leave you again ill follow after get in there you child fine harruq grumbled he took a deep breath took another and then stepped through qurrah followed both felt the same sensation of flying over a great distance yet to their minds they had taken a single step the gentle hills north of woodhaven were gone replaced by the walls of neldar the city of stone that was easy enough harruq said he decided not to mention his insides felt like they were doing loops we have been banished as has your kind qurrah said how do you plan to sneak us in through the front gate of course aurelia said just give me a moment she chanted again the words far different than any spell qurrah was used to hearing this was no magic of destruction or death no it was a much subtler magic aurelias dress changed from a simple green to an elegant mix of reds and violets the gold of her skin faded pink her ears lost their upturned tips enlarging and rounding out into human ears after a quick snap of her fingers white gloves appeared covering up to her elbows i look the definition of a rich noble of mordeina do you not agree my servants she asked servants qurrah said surely you jest why else would you two accompany me keep your mouths shut and agree with anything i say oh and here another snap of her fingers and suddenly large leather bags clipped together by gold and silver buckles appeared at their feet the elf winked a noble doesnt travel empty handed you mean a nobles servants harruq grumbled he picked up two grunting at their weight what is in here rocks and you forgot a bag he looked at the third sitting in front of qurrah i am but an advisor and protector the weaker halforc said you would not think i would be forced into physical labor would you aurelia laughed into her glove as harruq shifted two bags to his right hand and grabbed the third with his left laugh all you want im dropping these things the second were inside you poor dear now hurry we dont want my delicate skin in the sun for too long they were far enough away from the entrance that aurelias shift in clothes and facial design went unnoticed harruq grunted and groaned with every step his arms bulging with muscle he felt they would pop out of their sockets if he travelled much farther he dropped the bags as they halted before the two gate guards who had barred the entrance with their crossed spears im sorry milady but those things have been banned from the city said one guard aurelia scoffed at the two guards as if they were children i dont know how since i and they have never been here before only human blood is allowed entrance said the other i suggest you leave them outside during your stay i most certainly will not aurelia huffed you dont expect a frail thing such as myself to carry these bags on my own do you im sure you could hire she interrupted him by snapping her fingers in front of his nose i have already hired my servants and if i recall you have banned elves not orcs milady we may turn away any we wish i am telling you those things behind you are not coming inside servants or otherwise qurrah put a hand on harruqs arm which was shaking with slowly building rage calm brother he whispered save your anger for when it may do good aurelia untied a coin purse from her sash hoping neither of the gate guards heard qurrahs words now then she said her mood brightening you say i can hire new servants well how about i hire you two the guards exchanged glances and did so a second time with much wider eyes when the disguised elf opened the purse to reveal a pile of shiny gold coins id say three a piece is fair dont you she asked more than fair the first guard said oh yes said the second good she said dropping the thick coins into each outstretched hand she tied the purse back to her sash a flick of her finger and harruq picked up the bags well my servants i could use such armed and competent men as yourselves ive been afraid of thieves the past few days could you stare off that way and make sure none chase after me ill sleep better tonight if you do welcome to veldaren both guards said in unison they uncrossed their spears and pointedly ignored the two halforcs as they entered the city since when are you a rich little elf harruq asked once they were beyond earshot since never she laughed in about an hour those two will find themselves three copper pieces richer i hope it is enough to buy them a drink to drown their sorrow and i thought i was the devious one qurrah said a few peddlers eagerly brought out their wares as the trio passed by aurelia waved them off without slowing for the most part however they were ignored the southern districts of veldaren were filled with homes of the poorer inhabitants it wasnt until the center of the city that the real merchants set up shop a beautiful fountain carved as a statue of a crowned man wielding a sword marked where the roads leading from the southern and western gates met aurelia paused before the statue reading aloud the writing beneath valius kren first great king of neldar she chuckled at the blurred writing underneath knowing full well what it originally said to be appointed by the hand of glorious karak himself she finished harruq gave her a funny look but qurrah seemed far more intrigued how is it you know this he asked about sixty years ago some priests of ashhur demanded the statue be destroyed or the words below erased karak founded this entire nation and placed the stones with his hands yet it seems many would like to forget such an allegiance it was all the talk among the elves many fearing the humans would soon forget and then repeat the mistakes of their past i would not have expected empathy for karak from one such as you qurrah said aurelia frowned at him in her foreign face it is not empathy i just wonder at the foolishness of humans before karak and ashhur warred both were loving benevolent deities if anything mankind should remember that all may fall fascinating but my arms are really starting to hurt harruq said from behind them where the abyss are we going didnt you two used to have a home here she asked him yeah but you dont want to live there it was just a small shed we hardly fit inside milady of mordan may i interest you in the finest silks this side of the rivers interrupted a shouting voice oh celestia help us aurelia moaned as a chubby man with a mustache waddled over purple cloth in his hand not interested buddy harruq growled intercepting the merchant go bug someone else do i know you the merchant asked giving both brothers an inquisitive look theyre my pets and you know all orcs look the same aurelia said gently pushing harruq aside and forgive us but i would like to delay until i have rented my room of course he said bowing deeply qurrah crossed his arms his mouth locked in a frown what is it the elf asked him once the merchant marched back to his stand propped against the side of a building qurrah dipped his hand into the fountain and drank his eyes never left me and my brother he said once finished any merchant worth his wares knows to never break contact with the buyer he nodded again his eyes darting to the side and he watches us even now a thief perhaps aurelia asked there are no thieves harruq said shifting a bag from his right hand to his left guess you dont know about the guilds here do you another time qurrah said someone else is watching us we need to leave well harruq said taking the initiative nowhere else to go but home if it still stands anyone follows us well know harruq led the way following the western road for a quarter mile before darting south fewer and fewer people traveled the streets and those that did stared openly at aurelia it wasnt often a noble of worth came anywhere near their homes harruq led them deeper south into the old decaying part of the city is anyone still following us aurelia asked not that i see qurrah said but i feel it still eyes watching from afar come on were almost there harruq said id say we already look suspicious enough think i can dump the bags no need a wave of her hand and the bags vanished into nothing harruq stretched his arms moaning with approval much better his hands fell to his swords follow me with harruq no longer carrying the bags they made a faster pace aurelia took in as much as she could as they weaved through homes and back alleys they were so close to the prosperous northern districts yet here it seemed the sun shone less the faces bore little happiness and no sign of wealth dared let itself show with each turn harruq led them on things grew worse there are no places such as these in woodhaven aurelia said softly welcome to the dark parts of mankind qurrah muttered with strange amusement drunk men wandered the street in daytime a few whores catcalled to them the air stank of feces and urine for the thin sewers on each side of the street were clogged and overflowing lying beside a ditch crowned with a halo of flies was a bloodspattered corpse no one seemed to notice qurrah glanced back barely catching sight of a yellow robe find us a building he said to harruq make it large and empty the big halforc approached what had once been a storehouse a shove of his arm and the weathered door collapsed dust erupted as it hit the ground harruq led the way aurelia and qurrah following after cheerful place harruq said as he looked about the mostly empty building dust covered the floor and splintered boards hung from the windows feces and dried urine filled one corner and stacked hay filled another a few crates and some rotting wood decorated the place who chases us aurelia asked frowning at the sight around her are your spells ready qurrah asked her im a sorceress my spells are always ready good because i fear we have a mage nearby as he said those words aurelias robe faded back to its deep green her ears returned to their sharp points and her face back to its exotic beauty uh oh she said it was then that a wide blanket of interlaced webs fell on top of all three now im pissed harruq said yanking at the web surrounding his body he yanked one of his swords out from its sheathed the black blade easily cut him free aurelia remained perfectly still her eyes closed qurrah let his whip drop the fire burning away all webbing that it touched just stay put you durn idiots a voice cried out a short stocky human dressed in full platemail stood at the door his chest nearly covered by his black beard each hand held a nasty looking punch dagger arent your swords a little tiny to be calling us idiots the halforc shouted tearing loose from the web and storming toward him now what in blazes do you want harruq look out qurrah shouted harruq glanced back but was too late a figure leapt from atop a pile of crates and crashed down on the burly warrior the butts of two sabers smacked his skull dropping him like a sack of grain the attacker landed without a sound his entire figure shrouded by swirling gray cloaks enough of this aurelia said still shrouded in webs twin lightning bolts arced out from her hands tearing through webbing as they streaked toward the ambushers the man in gray cloaks whirled dodging the blast the shorter fellow did not fare as well the lightning hit him square in the chest lifted him off his feet and deposited him outside in a gasping lump of metal dirt and flesh aurelia followed with two more bolts of lightning the man in gray dodged back and forth leaping off walls and crates so that each strike just barely missed qurrah lashed his whip burning away more of the webs he heard soft chanting from within the darkness high above his head and he recognized it for what it was a wizard casting a spell darkness is no haven here he said invisible forces gripped his arms and legs slowing their movements qurrah ignored them knowing they were mental illusions he kept his hands looping through the semantic motions for his spell the darkness covering the ceiling suddenly recoiled and fled as if it were a living thing standing there illuminated in no light but still clearly visible was a middleaged wizard dressed in yellow robes a yellow cloak and a tall yellow hat in his left hand he held a long knotted staff hello there he said realizing his cover was gone clever fellow arent you a ball of fire leapt from his hands to convey his appreciation aurelia qurrah cried as the fire approached the elf stopped her barrage of lightning just long enough to place a warding spell around them the fireball hit the ground and detonated the flame swirled about aurelia and qurrah held at bay by aurelias spell when the fire dissipated the halforc laughed at the wizard in yellow surely you can do better than that qurrah said aye that i can but why should i asked the wizard because you gave me one mother of a headache and that makes me cranky harruq said he staggered to his feet his swords drawn but flailing wildly as he tried to gain his balance before he could move the points of two blades pressed against his back move and youre gonna get more than just a headache a rough voice said from behind youre a short little guy arent you harruq asked he shifted his hips slightly tightening the grips on his swords as he did whats that got to do with anything nothing the halforc leapt forward and away qurrah covered his flight with a sharp burst of cold air aurelia whirled on the yellow wizard red light on her fingertips several bolts of pure magic flew outward fizzling into smoke as they struck an invisible shield harruq found little reprieve for the man in the gray cloaks assaulted him with a wicked barrage of doublestabs and feints he batted away what he could furious and confused as he watched what should have been killing cuts repeatedly deflect off his armor or cut no deeper than a scratch youre gonna pay for that one ya pansy caster the short warrior said a bit of frost sticking to his beard he charged across the warehouse with his punch daggers pumping the air qurrah laughed a snap of his whip took out his attackers feet he crashed across the floor a rolling jumbling mess of armor im a pansy caster too dont forget the wizard in yellow said smiling down at aurelia even as she launched a swirling blue cone of ice back up at him he pointed his staff toward her summoning a clear shield of pure magic the cold swarmed about him doing no harm she opened her mouth to cast again only to feel the curved tip of a sword press against her lower lip do not give me cause to harm such beauty the cloaked man whispered he shifted using the elf as a shield between him and harruq dont you dare touch her harruq said lower your weapons the wizard said we have no desire to hurt you the fire left qurrahs whip harruq sheathed his swords glaring at the cloaked man with open hatred goddamned pansytripping cowardly weaselwhipusing orckisser the short warrior jumped to his feet fuming dont worry brug the wizard said being useless in this battle doesnt make you useless as a whole harruq raised an eyebrow at the yellowgarbed wizard who was levitating down to join them a nod from him and the cloaked man removed the sword from aurelias face is there a reason you attacked us aurelia asked or did you just feel like a little fun one could have a lot of fun with you the wizard said blatantly examining her lithe and firm body but it would be impolite without first knowing my name i am tarlak eschaton at your service did i miss something here harruq asked you missed a few of haerns swings by the looks of your face tarlak said dont worry well get you a healer if you want qurrah joined his brothers side his whip dragging along the ground he put another hand on the burly halforcs arm hoping for patience but not expecting it state your purpose qurrah said its simple really the king has banned elves from veldaren elves also happen to be a sneaky bunch they can disguise themselves as say a noble woman from a far off country so our little gang of mercenaries was hired to flush out and remove any such sneaky elves he bowed again to aurelia my apologies but you must leave a woman entered through the doorway dressed in the white robes of ashhur red hair fell down past her shoulders her face had soft curved features and she bore a strong resemblance to tarlak should i attend to brug first as usual tarlak the priestess asked tarlak glanced back to her a smile flashing across his face do you have to ask delysia brug got himself and then a whip wrapped around his neck haern drew his sabers but qurrah glared at him prepared for his speed with but a thought i can surround my whip with fire he told him move and i burn him alive id greatly prefer you stay still for now haern tarlak said the muscles in his neck taut haern sheathed his swords of course he whispered his voice barely audible let me know when you want them dead qurrah release him he intends us no harm aurelia said he means to order us around qurrah said i do not appreciate that besides if you go we go and i happen to like this city touching brug grumbled his knuckles white as they gripped his punch daggers but youre a fool thinking you got yourself a bargaining chip ill gut any who cause him harm delysia slowly approached standing at brugs side with her arms crossed i do not like stalemates qurrah said his eyes jumping from one to the other so i propose that you four pretend you never saw us and no one will be the wiser bad idea tarlak replied wincing slightly halfexpecting fire to engulf his neck none did so he continued we let you go and someone finds out or even worse you go off and kill someone our heads would find themselves a nice new spike for a home personally my head likes my neck so we need a solution that addresses that particular worry dont sound like there is one harruq said drawing his swords because were not leaving the cloaked man drifted around so fluidly that qurrah did not realize he had moved until he was almost gone order him where i can see him qurrah said i need no assassins at my back well that is what you have my friend tarlak replied and quite frankly i cant order him to do anything youre the one with the fiery whip after all qurrah im not liking this harruq said shifting attention back and forth from the short warrior and the cloaked man nice to know his brother said i believe i have a solution delysia said all eyes turned to her let them join the eschaton harruq qurrah and aurelia all glanced about in confusion at this but this hardly matched the confusion of their counterparts join us brug roared by ashhur ill join em in a grave before i join em in eschaton may i ask what the eschaton is aurelia said the eschaton mercenaries tarlak answered named after my sister and i the four of us in front of you would be the eschaton we do a few jobs kill a few people and get paid outrageous sums for it they are skilled haern whispered from behind startling all three the sharp end of a saber curled around qurrahs neck skilled enough to be trained how does this solve the problem with my elven blood aurelia asked vaelors edict ordered the veldaren guard and the eschaton mercenaries to remove all elves from his city delysia replied it did not order elves to be removed from the eschaton itself our home is not located within veldarens walls it is a weak argument qurrah said his eyes locked with tarlaks and a tough decision to make at the point of a blade well i have to decide at the point of a well whip so go ahead you three seem more than capable feel like becoming part of the happy family more like the black sheep of the family brug grumbled delysia swatted him on the head i will trust your judgment qurrah aurelia said softly qurrah nodded a flick of his wrist and the whip returned slithering underneath the arm of his robe haerns sword vanished just as quickly well tarlak said rubbing his neck glad that is over with so i guess i should be the first to welcome you honored harruq muttered he looked about seeing an angry man storming out of the warehouse the priestess following him in midargument and no sign of the cloaked one odd mess of a family well we just added two halforcs and an elf it seems diversity is now our strong suit by the way do you three have names it helps with the bonding process im harruq tun the halforc said this here is my brother qurrah tun and i am aurelia thyne the elf said offering a tiny curtsey wonderful tarlak said follow me ill show you your new home he followed brug and delysia out the warehouse not stopping to see if the three followed we really gonna do this harruq asked we have no home and no lawful standing to be here aurelia said dont forget you two have elven blood as well i see no reason not to give this a try i can think of plenty qurrah said he offered none when aurelia gave him a look well off we go then harruq said with a shrug t he road leading from the west gate of neldaren forked north and south less than a hundred yards from the city the southern road followed the banks of the kinel river leading to a multitude of farming villages beyond while the southern road traveled for hundreds of miles the north road was far shorter the kings forest surrounded all of northern veldaren and built against the southwest curve loomed an old sentry tower back when orc armies could still cross the bone ditch the small stone structure housed a powerful scrying device permanently aimed west years ago the magic of the scrying device had failed the sentry tower was abandoned and when an enterprising mage in curious yellow robes offered to purchase the structure king vaelor had been more than receptive welcome to your new home tarlak said gesturing grandly before the stone edifice its well a little better than our last home harruq said staring at the tower in surprise the building rose far above the tops of the trees looking like a cylindrical piece of stone growing out of the earth twin doors barred entrance inside windows marked each floor which qurrah counted to be more than six tarlak continued talking clearly proud of his tower its a little drafty come the winter months but a brilliant man designed the heating and an even more brilliant man me decorated the place and made it livable by the way can you all share a room aurelias frown was by far the biggest of the three excuse me tarlak but if you havent noticed i have some important differences from these fine gentlemen here the wizard laughed yes two stand out immediately aurelia glared do you know any polymorph spells tarlak no why because i do another comment like that and you will have to admire my figure through the eyes of a mudskipper for a long moment the wizard paused mulling over the concept with a blank stare moving on he said when finished marching toward the oak doors harruq shook his head odd guy he would most likely prefer eccentric qurrah said ill go with lecherous aurelia chipped in the doors creaked open with a rustic sound and then the three followed the wizard in b eautiful isnt she tarlak said smiling as he led them through the large bottom floor filling nearly half of it was a giant wood fireplace a myriad of pipes stretching out from the top entering the higher levels of the tower through snug holes in the ceiling still in the early stages of summer there was no need for a fire yet but harruq smiled at the thought of spending his first winter warm and cozy instead of miserably shivering in some rundown home on their left stone stairs wound upward on the right split logs were stacked neatly two old but sturdy couches faced the fireplace next to the couches a long table stretched from wall to wall the couches the drapes over two windows and the carpet were all a deep luxurious red the contrast with the dark stone was sharp to say the least still the place had an undeniable simplistic charm to harruq and qurrah who had lived in total squalor the place seemed a castle what are all the pipes for aurelia asked gesturing to the fireplace that is my wonderful brilliance put into action tarlak said beaming as if the furnace were his own son when i first moved in one large pipe acted as a chimney for the smoke now however each of the pipes leads to the different levels heating them all where does the smoke go asked harruq gotta use this tarlak said tapping his forehead i have a few magic spells in me the heat goes through all the pipes except that big one in the center which funnels cold air in and smoke out trust me come winter youll be ready to worship me for how toasty my home stays your home asked delysia as she came down the stairs i do believe it was my money you purchased this place with dear brother our home tarlak said duly corrected after the nasty business with the citadel i needed a new place to start my dear sister here was kind enough to lend a hand qurrahs eyes narrowed at mention of the citadel but he kept his questions to himself giving the grand tour delysia asked of course i need to show them where theyll be living speaking of do you think you can share a room with lovely aurelia here delysia glanced around tarlak to look at aurelia is that fine with you she asked the elf shrugged better than rooming with these two lugs excellent she said still smiling follow me upstairs well make room for you while tarlak gives the boys the rest of the tour youre gonna leave us harruq asked as aurelia stepped around a frowning tarlak im sure youll be just fine she replied i would prefer she stay with me sis tarlak said a tiny pout crossed his face oh i dont want to be a bother aurelia said locking her arm in delysias a huge grin on her face the priestess laughed and batted her eyelashes at her brother byebye oh great and wise eschaton the two dashed up the stairs leaving an unhappy tarlak and harruq watching after them qurrah amused by the whole ordeal could not keep silent so who exactly is in charge here the women or the men the women just like everywhere else in the civilized world tarlak sighed oh well lets get on with it they followed him up the stairs which slowly curled about the wall tarlak stopped on the first floor which appeared to be nothing more than a wall and a door less than two feet from the stairs i added walls and doors to give every room some privacy he explained this is my sisters and now your elf girls room dont expect to be inside there much same goes for you i would say qurrah said quiet you tarlak said although his voice hardly carried any conviction lets go to a more interesting floor shall we the second floors door was wide open when they peered inside they saw a mess of a place with pieces of armor littering the floor buried underneath a particular deep pile was what appeared to be a bed various weapons axes swords and daggers lined the walls in front of a large grinding wheel in the corner grumbling to himself sat brug afternoon brug tarlak shouted brug in the middle of sharpening one of his daggers startled so badly he fell off his chair and onto his rump dadgum idjit wizard i told you not to do that precisely why i do the wizard beamed i want you to meet the newest members of the eschaton brug glared over before returning to his stool i already met em yes but i would prefer you meet them without trying to kill them dont care to youll win him over tarlak semiwhispered to the other two hes always cranky after he gets his ass handed to him in a fight what did you say brug roared spinning in his seat so fast it sent him toppling this time on his head next floor tarlak said slamming the door shut and dashing up the stairs the next door was shut tight this is my room the wizard said nothing exciting here next floor w hen tarlak stopped at the fifth floor he turned to the other two his face serious this is haerns floor he said as a bit of warning do not enter unless you want an attempt on your life say again harruq asked that guy is an assassin through and through he likes to sneak up on anyone entering his room ive tried catching him sleeping eating practicing no luck had plenty of sabers poked into my back and neck though he pushed the door open a crack and gestured for them to enter guests first he said how kind qurrah said shoving the door the rest of the way open harruq followed his eyes searching the corners for the cloaked man the entire room was barren but for a small chest and a simple bed at one side there was no sign of haern let me know how it goes tarlak said before banging the door shut harruq turned and shoved but could not make it budge i hate this place he said he joined his brothers side other than the bed and the thick curtains over the window there appeared no place for the man to hide you sure hes here harruq yelled im sure came tarlaks muffled reply he hones his skills at all times to remain ready qurrah said methodically searching the room with his eyes this is a test draw your blades brother if he does not obtain the kill with his first strike he will have failed you certain the halforc asked as he drew condemnation and salvation very they slowly left the door shadows blanketed the walls but none looked deep enough to hide a man harruq knelt and checked under the bed nothing hate to have to let this guy know breakfast is ready he grumbled he looked back to his brother and then paused something was wrong he could see the door closed behind qurrah could see the blank walls but his gut knew different brother he said and that was all it took qurrah spun as haern charged a few words dashed off his tongue as he completed the turn a saber lashed out resting on his throat in the blink of an eye you could be dead haern whispered all but his mouth and chin hidden behind the low cowl of his cloak as could you qurrah said drawing the mans attention to a piece of bone hovering in the air an inch from his chest stalemate the saber slipped beneath the multitude of cloaks as the bone dropped into qurrahs hand haern abandoned his battle posture and stood erect the cowl remained low but his eyes shone through its shadow a piercing blue color that reminded qurrah of deep waters i welcome you to the eschaton haern said his voice never above a whisper his gaze shifted to harruq i have fought you in battle and i find you lacking the halforcs eyes bulged my life may one day depend upon your skill meet me behind the tower at sunrise bring your blades and armor harruq was so flustered and angry he didnt know what to say so he said a whole bunch at once how dare youi couldyou never beat me haern pointed to the many cuts lining harruqs face and arms every one of those could have been lethal stop lying you never my brother agrees qurrah interrupted stepping between the two i thank you for the offer to train him qurrah harruq gasped qurrah whirled on him shut up you fool now lets go when they tried to open the door it swung in easily tarlak grinned at them as he leaned against the back wall so howd you do he asked as a furious harruq followed his brother out slamming the door shut behind him a draw qurrah said to the final floor to the final floor t he final floor was a bit different from the others there were no beds no chests no drawers and no current occupants instead piles upon piles of boxes and crates were stacked everywhere yeah this is where we store most of our potions armor stuff like that tarlak explained where will we sleep harruq asked will the floor do for now i can purchase some beds tomorrow ill just loan it out from your next cut next cut qurrah asked of your payment of course we are mercenaries harruq rubbed his lower lip a few things connecting correctly into place so were going to make some gold here not enough to be rich but we carry a decent reputation here in veldaren tarlak explained we have little competition were dependable and now more than ever were incredibly versatile a tenth of all our contracts go to fund the organization and the rest we split evenly sound fair more than fair qurrah said i thank you for taking us in it is more than we had hoped for well you might have hoped for beds tarlak said gesturing to the crates but well see what we can do harruq waved an arm at all the miscellaneous things wheres this going to go good question ever seen a portable hole both shook their heads well neither have i but i plan on buying one tomorrow ill consider it a onetime cost to hire you into our fold for now just shove aside all our crap and make yourselves at home i doubt this place will ever feel like home harruq said yes the roof doesnt leak qurrah muttered give it a shot tarlak said we might surprise you probably already have given our past few days its just one surprise of many harruq said surveying the junk that filled his room his room of his home surprising didnt begin to describe it all t arlak sat on one of the couches before the fireplace a muchneeded drink in hand his hat lay next to him his shoes kicked off about time you poked your head out he said when his sister appeared her priestess robes switched out for a more simple and comfortable tunic so many lonely hours down here eagerly awaiting feminine company i doubt it is my company you were hoping for delysia teased she scooted his hat over and sat down next to him is that necessary she asked nodding at the drink absolutely he said i just invited a whole collection of freaks into my little home and on what grounds you know why delysia said do i tarlak asked before draining the rest of the glass are you sure thats them maybe ashhur wanted some other group im sure delysia said i dont know about the elf but the two men are damaged we do them much good by giving them a home yeah tarlak said still not convinced youre probably right at least about the damaged part mentally and physically but were acting on a dream delysia frowned and her small face curled up in a clear expression of hurt no dream she said and no hallucination prayer quiet and certain theyre the ones we were to help and help them we will it is not my fault ashhur is more comfortable talking to me than you tarlak laughed ashhurs just scared that if he says hello to me hell find himself missing a few lovely angels speaking of lovely angels delysia said you should go check on your new friends as you wish milady tarlak said w hen tarlak returned to the upstairs room he was pleasantly surprised by the halforcs progress qurrah had supervised while harruq did the grunt work as was common between them crates originally stacked against the wall they piled twice as high and any empty crack did not remain empty after about an hour of pushing and stacking they had cleared a small space in the heart of the tangled jungle id say its about suppertime wouldnt you tarlak said whistling at the sight by the way remind me to have you two do my heavy lifting from now on whats to eat harruq asked come and see the wizard said with a mischievous look the two were more than willing to comply supper was a feast that put many feasts before it to shame evidently aurelia and delysia both skilled in forms of magic had spent a good half hour conjuring up the most exotic rare and mouthwatering cakes meats crumpets pastries bread and fruits most of which the halforcs had never seen before great leapfrogging karak harruq said when seeing the food splayed out on the table we eat well here in my tower tarlak said with a huge grin on his face impressed harruq did not have chance to answer his mouth was already full a urelia joined the halforcs as they were preparing to bunk for the night you two busy she asked poking her head through their door come on in harruq said here to see our lovely living conditions whiners ill be sleeping on the floor as well dont you mean hovering above it qurrah asked the elf shrugged same thing i just wanted to make sure this was fine with you two qurrah tilted his head and gave her a funny look we would not have joined if we did not so wish the elf shook her head and poked harruq you might not have but i get the distinct impression this big lug would follow me around wherever i go and i dont see you abandoning your brother either qurrah so humor me is all of this good harruq walked over put his arms on her shoulders and very very slowly spoke down to her wearegood good aurelia said with a smile before zapping him with electricity from her forefinger she kissed his forehead as he lay on the ground tiny bits of smoke trailing from his skin nini harruq nini qurrah sleep well lady thyne nighters harruq groaned from the floor you certainly have an interesting way with women brother qurrah said as he closed the door you think i insulted her he asked seems likely by the way you need another haircut very funny t hat night as the two lay on bedrolls and stared at the ceiling harruq broke the silence hey brother yes harruq this whole thingthings are gonna be different now arent they yes qurrah said softly i think they will be harruq rolled onto his side and stared at the floor yes things were different now he wasnt sure how he wasnt sure why but a new chapter had begun the question was what awaited him in those unwritten pages and more importantly why was he so troubled by it qurrah fidgeted remembering the death of velixar and remembering the dust his master had become nothing but a swirl of gray and white piled underneath garbs of black it was the fate of all things to become ash and earth he knew but what fate lay beyond he remembered velixars haunting words and the thought of meeting him again did little to warm his heart a soft voice tiny and often ignored dared speak up in his mind all men turned to dust perhaps his life determined whether his soul if it existed would also turn to dust the path he walked dark and distant from so many could it turn him to where the road faded into lightless forests of thorns and graves neither slept well that night despite their full bellies and warm blankets a swift kick stirred harruq from his dreams he grunted forced open a single eye and then shut it when he saw qurrah frowning down at him what do you want he asked the phrase coming out as a single drowsy word sunrise nears get up then qurrah dropped harruqs heavy leather armor onto his head the warrior groaned in response why should my life depends on you qurrah said youve never been trained before here is your chance now get up fine fine fine the bleary halforc rolled the armor off his face and glared up at his brother remember im doing this for you i doubt you will let me forget qurrah said vanishing down the stairs n o games harruq said he stood behind the tower his armor buckled tight and his blades in hand dew covered his boots a soft breeze sifted through his hair the scent of morning awakening his mind it was still cold in the shadow of the tower the grass short and thick the kings forest stretched out before him the woods wide their branches intertwined along the top canopy this is no game haern whispered his body an inch behind harruqs the halforc startled then blushed red with anger and embarrassment you said youd be waiting for me out here he said do you always expect people to be where they say they will only those not trying to kill me he grumbled haern approached the forest pulling his hood lower on his face the most deadly are the ones you think wish you no harm he whispered yeah yeah harruq said motioning with his two swords arent you all smart so we going to fight or what the assassins hands emerged from within his cloaks his sabers drawn and ready have you ever been beaten before he asked of course not would i still be alive if i had haerns saber was on his throat before he could move yes the assassin whispered his breath warm on the halforcs ear because i have beaten you yet you still live he turned away blatantly putting his back to the furious halforc harruqs temper flared roaring he charged condemnation and salvation hungered in his hands haern waited until the halforc was almost to him before leaping into the air high above harruqs head his knees curled to his chest as he looped around when he landed both his sabers stabbed forward jabbing into armor without penetrating your hatred gives you strength but it renders you stupid he whispered from underneath his hood an elbow shot back trying to smash the assassins nose it caught air instead haern ducked underneath spun on his feet and froze his sabers once again resting on harruqs throat when i ask you something i want a real answer not some cocky bullshit he said through clenched teeth do you understand me now have you ever been beaten yeah harruq said his hate still churning like a trapped fire just once to an elf what was his name i dont know he had the strangest weapon i ever saw it was a bow with blades along every which way haern stepped back his sabers vanishing beneath his cloaks once more dieredon you fought dieredon and lived harruq shrugged guess i have a soft chuckle escaped the assassin you have fought one of the very best there is halforc your swords never came close did they he ambushed me the halforc countered wasnt a fair fight of course he ambushed you haern whispered slowly shifting his body left and right his cloaks swaying an intelligent fighter doesnt give his opponent a fair chance you think it fair you have the muscles of an ox while your other foes are mere mortals his movements picked up speed haerns cloaks whipped back and forth through the air what the abyss is your problem harruq shouted you haern leapt his body rotating at blinding speed cloaks whipped up and down harruq brought up his swords to block but had no clue where the assassins sabers were instinctively he crossed them and braced his legs one saber slid over the top nicking his chin when the mass of gray landed the other saber cut upward separating the two swords the first still high in the air sliced straight back down between the small opening the other had created then thrust forward unblocked harruq stood there swords shaking in his hands as the tip pressed against his throat a drop of blood trickled down his neck why did you bring me out here he asked to humiliate me so you may survive haern replied your strength is great and your speed decent but you are reckless all your attacks are obvious beginner routines i dont need to listen to this you will listen the assassins leg snapped forward smashing his foot against harruqs groin the halforc dropped to his knees haern bent down grabbed him by the hair and yanked his head back so that he stared straight into his burning blue eyes we are to be a team he whispered we must trust each other youve seen and felt what i can do i have fought impossible odds and i have escaped without a scratch you possess greater strength than most alive and ancient blades from a time long past and you act as if these alone will grant you victory it is arrogance harruq tun nothing more go burn in the abyss harruq spat haerns kick broke his nose he continued whispering as the halforc moaned i consider my point proven i am the greater fighter halforc i do not possess greater strength my blades do not contain the magic yours do i have spent a lifetime in training and i have learned from those better than me he chuckled softly my very first master broke my nose on our opening day of practice i guess i have passed on that tradition harruq struggled into a sitting position glaring at the assassin as blood ran down his lips and neck haern tossed him a white rag neither spoke as he cleaned himself then held the rag to his nose the morning dew vanished as the sun climbed higher in the sky are you ready to listen haern asked the halforc nodded good i hold no anger against you so hold none against me it will simply lengthen things go inside and ask delysia for a healing spell then if you are willing come back outside ill be here in the open harruq asked yes he replied his smile hidden right here in the open harruq stood and sheathed his blades he dropped haerns rag as blood continued to drip down his face youre a bastard you know that harruq said haern nodded yeah i know with that the halforc went in search of delysia s omethings not right brug tarlak said staring at a map of veldaren divided into several colored districts what you mean tar brug asked he was dressed in his bed robes and his eyes were still dark from sleep before the wizard answered there was a knock at the door come on in were decent tarlak answered qurrah stuck his head inside his robes clean and his hair straightened i will be in veldaren for a bit he said oh alright well you better take this then the wizard pulled open a drawer closed it pulled open another and then took out a metallic pendant which he tossed to qurrah a quick examination showed it to be a rectangle with a small yellow square in the center what is this qurrah asked thatll let people know youre one of us tarlak explained itll also get you in and out the gates without too much hassle from the guards qurrah bowed in thanks and then slipped back out when the door shut the wizard turned back to his map lolas not sent word to me since spring he said continuing where he left off the muggly brothers havent contacted me since summer and jerends offered no useful information for months now perhaps because things are quiet brug said from his seat in a comfortable padded chair thief guilds dont stay quiet tarlak said with a shake of his head not even the neutered ones the nobles have created here in veldaren then what are you thinking im thinking the wizard said tapping his red goatee that somehow my contacts are expecting more money by not talking to me you think theyre being bribed tarlak glanced at brug who seemed disgusted with the prospect i hope that is the case if it is haern can get us new contacts ive got a more worrisome idea though which is tarlak frowned at the multicolored districts representing the territory of veldarens thief guilds that somehow the guilds have developed plans that make feeding me information no longer worth the copper brug scratched at his beard thinking over the idea cant be planning something that big without us knowing he said besides haerns the watcher any one of them guilds gets out of line and hell come and set things right a scary thought though the guilds working together i hate thieves tarlak moaned pulling his tall yellow hat down past his eyes half our business is keeping them in line brug said hopping from the chair youre like a miner saying he hates the mountain but loves the gold inside thats why i prefer to pay others to mine for me tarlak said with a grin have you finished the pendants for our new members brug shook his head had trouble deciding the animal figured harruqs would be a scorpion saw that one on his chest so that makes sense what about qurrah though make it a scorpion as well tarlak said theyre brothers and the elf the wizard shrugged go ask her she seems a bit friendlier brug halfsaluted then left tarlak leaned over the map pondering schemes that might simultaneous earn every thief guild higher profits any that came to mind were either too farfetched or too frightening brug popped his head back in five minutes later strange girl that elfie is he said what animal did she pick brug made a gofigure motion with his hands she wants a spider as well as a kitten as in one creature or both never heard of a spiderkitty before so yeah both tarlak chuckled compromise make one but have it be both a spider and a kitten how am i supposed to do that youll figure it out brug rolled his eyes and slammed the door q urrah wandered through the streets of veldaren blessedly silent in the early hour no merchants hawked their wares and the few men and women that wandered about were busy with whatever task forced them from their beds qurrah preferred the company and secrecy of cities to the green of the forests he always felt uneasy amid the tall trees as if part of his blood recognized them as home but the other half rejected all their comforts it was in the dust dirt and stone of a city that he felt he could go about unnoticed more importantly he could let his mind wander his path led him straight to the fountain in the center of town he stared at the great king of old whose loyalty to karak had been unfailing what purpose do you have in my life now he asked that statue the stone gave no answer which was no surprise it was a relic of an era many seemed desperate to forget what if the stone could talk qurrah wondered what if its mouth opened and words of a god came through he stared wondering until he thought he saw the lips of the statue begin to crack as if desperate to open he stepped back frightened and that was when he saw the girl she sat atop the edge of the fountain one leg dipping in and out of the water her black hair hung over one shoulder trailing down to her waist his eyes took in her soft face and pale skin she hunched over her legs which were exposed below the knee by a fairly common skirt cut uncommonly high her right arm extended outward she clenched her fist and the veins in her arm swelled in her left hand she held a dagger qurrahs reaction was a mixture of shock and curiosity as he watched her cut the flesh of her arm the movements of her dagger were not random she turned the blade this way and that forming separate runes she showed no sign of pain or pleasure the girl seemed completely apathetic to her mutilations as her bright blood dripped into the fountain staining the water scarlet the halforc glanced around realizing he had been staring he was intrigued by how the few people passing by showed no surprise at what the girl did a few frowned as they went on their way but most ignored her qurrah walked away then turned about resting his back against a small shop facing the fountain his curiosity awakened he patiently waited for what he did not know as time passed and more and more people filled the center the girl ceased her cutting she raised her arm to the sky turning it so she could better see the runes she had carved a smile creased her face and she giggled she put the dagger into her pocket not caring her sleeve and dress were soaked with her own blood the girl hopped down turned to the fountain and splashed the statue king qurrahs stomach twisted as she drank the waters a man swore at her as he walked past but this only elicited another giggle as faint red water dripped down her lips and neck staring at tess eh asked a voice behind qurrah the halforc glanced back at a powdercovered baker standing next to him both watched as she left the fountain and traveled south drops of blood trickling off the end of her fingers is that her name qurrah asked tessanna actually tess rolls off the tongue easier i take it youve never seen her before no i have not qurrah said shes a weird one the baker said guards keep telling her to stop but she keeps on anyway she scares me and im not too easily spooked if you know what im saying bloodletting has been done in your apothecaries for centuries why should that frighten you so the baker chuckled and cracked his knuckles you seen her eyes he asked what of them no good telling you then greet her sometime look her in the eye and if you dont get shivers then ashhur made you of sterner stuff than i qurrah smirked at the final comment but gave no reply he started toward home but then stopped that girl he asked the baker tessanna does she come here every morning certain as the sun the man replied by the time i get here the fountains always colored red and shes dancing off like a little princess thank you qurrah said dipping his head in respect he wandered the rundown parts of southern veldaren lost in thought he had come to veldaren to think of his future but tessanna had given him far more immediate concerns with the sun high in the sky he returned to the tower his mind decided that next day he would not miss tessannas arrival when the blood began to flow he would be there to watch t he sound of sword hitting sword was clear and loud from behind the tower so qurrah circled around remaining quiet and pressed against the stone in hopes of catching the battle unseen he succeeded and the sight was a worthy reward harruq stood panting before haern his arms low and dragging as if the weight of his swords was too great to bear sweat dripped off his face his entire body shuddered with each breath haern faced him his face and body covered with an elaborate combination of cloaks the tips of his sabers poked out from the folds movements have slowed with your exhaustion the assassin was saying as qurrah neared you were not fast enough when we started what hope have you now you should be sucking air yourself assuming youre human harruq said weve been out here since sunrise do you see my movements slowing haern asked he struck his sabers a blur harruq blocked the first couple before a desperate parry missed its mark steel pressed against his throat not possible the halforc said you cant be less tired than me you just cant when was the last time you were fully exhausted haern asked pulling back his blade without warning he thrust it straight at his chest harruq slapped the thrust wide he countered with his other hand only to have it brutally blocked pushed aside and then ignored metal thwacked against harruqs chest armor haern did not halt though instead repeatedly slashing that exact same spot all the while he spoke when was the last time you were beaten the last time you felt no chance of victory tell me halforc when was the last time you were a coward and surrendered never harruq screamed slashing with all his remaining strength haern rolled the powerful swords smashing the dirt exactly haern whispered his voice soft yet still heard in the commotion his foot shot upward nailing harruqs kidney the follow up kick mashed his already sensitive nose qurrah winced as blood ran freely i will exhaust you i will defeat you i will make you collapse in surrender convinced you cannot win the butts of the sabers cracked against harruqs thick skull condemnation and salvation remained stiff in the dirt as the halforc fell onto his side silent but for his gasps of air in this silence haerns words were clear and powerful yet still soft and quiet despite his distance qurrah heard every word convincing him there was magic involved with haerns constant whisper you will learn to fight me haern said even after defeat after exhaustion after hurt and humiliation when you can stand against me to the very limit of your body then we may truly begin your speed your strength your mind they will all grow these coming days if you are willing that is the one thing i cannot help you with he left harruq lying there dazed exhausted and furious tell delysia your brother needs more healing the assassin said as he walked past qurrah not at all surprised by his presence will he learn or will you merely increase his scars qurrah asked his words dripping with sarcasm you know him better than i haern said gesturing back to his protege why ask me qurrah glanced at his brother who was an ugly mess a grin spread over his face because youre conscious and hes not he said before retrieving the priestess t hroughout the rest of the day harruq nursed his injuries and sulked in silence even aurelias attempts to cheer him up were ineffective i have never seen him like this she said to qurrah who in an uncharacteristically kind act had asked the elf to cheer him up in the first place his pride has been broken more than his face qurrah said hes never lost a fight not that i know of he will meet this challenge i trust him there were no contracts or assignments so the day passed uneventfully dinner was quiet qurrah expected a fight when brug made a joke about harruqs nose yet his brother let it pass they exchanged no words as they settled in their bedrolls tarlak promising them beds by the following night qurrah looked over harruq who lay with his back to him several bruises lined his bare skin a few inexperienced words of comfort died in his ruined throat he rolled the other way closed his eyes and dreamt of the girl with the black hair and of a knife dripping with the lifeblood that flowed through her veins t hat next morning harruq woke qurrah with his stirrings it is not yet dawn qurrah said yeah i know he likes games i do too he stormed down the stairs his armor shining and his swords already drawn the necromancer watched him go a smile on his face dont get yourself killed he whispered before rising h arruq slowed his breathing as he pressed against haerns door it felt loose against his shoulder his muscles tensed several deep breaths later he kicked it open and rushed in weapons drawn the bed was empty as was the room the halforc scanned everywhere continually turning so his back never faced one direction for too long still no sign of haern already out there waiting for me arent you he said as he shut the door he felt the sharp point of a blade touch the back of his neck did you really think i would sleep with the door unbarred haern whispered into his ear will my nose get broken if i say yes he asked he braced for pain but instead received laughter the tip left his neck the halforc faced his teacher who grinned at him from underneath his hood much better harruq much better perhaps delysia will not be required for todays sparring says you i plan on breaking the first thing i get a hold of as i said haern whispered urging the halforc down the stairs with a shove delysia will not be required q urrah watched them spar before leaving much of their combat was similar to the day before haern repeatedly batted aside his brothers best attack combinations his sabers invariably touching gray flesh harruqs anger grew but something was different he no longer aimed his anger at haern he aimed it at himself very good brother qurrah said quietly he left for veldaren t he moon still shone dim in the red sky when qurrah arrived at the center of veldaren the place was barren but for an early shopkeeper and two women hurrying down the street fear rolled off the women in tangible waves qurrah closed his eyes and let his mind touch their fear the loss of a brother he said opening his eyes the women young and dressed in cheap clothes were gone such cowardly feelings toward death you two shame your deceased a thorn pierced his mind the halforc reeled backward smacking his head against hard stone he was hidden between two buildings no one should have known he was there someone did though and someone was curious as to why you want in he asked aloud very well come to my dark corners he grabbed the thorn and pulled it deep inside he swarmed it with memories of his childhood sitting hungry and cold as masters experiments snarled gagged and shrieked in the cages all about him he altered the memory replacing it with his nightmares the unseen cage doors opened the creatures bellowed their joy in fearful howls they would feed and the feast would be bloody painful and eternal qurrah expected this to drive away the intruding mental presence but instead the image twisted his unseen nightmare creatures walked into visible light revealing each one as a large man with belly heavy from a life of drink their mouths were sewn shut the men tore at the thread with their hands flesh ripped and shards of bloody glass spewed from their mouths you killed mommy the men said in unison as lungs and intestines followed each punctured with glass qurrah tried to run but instead his hands moved of their own accord for he was hungry so hungry and in his lap was food the taste was phenomenal so youll be quiet the men continued youll be good and you can replace mommy now shut up i dont want to hear crying qurrah glanced down to see a female arm in his hands cold and pale blood filled his mouth the thorn seemed to shudder and from it infinite sadness and anger poured into his mind he tried to pull away as rough hands seized his shoulders the thorn dug deeper and the halforc curled into a ball as he felt the hands of the men tear away his clothes he was powerless his past his choices his sins it all seeped into that thorn now grown into a great root sucking out the wretched parts of his soul q urrah stirred in the alley waking from a sleep he never remembered entering the city was still peaceful and the sun remained low above the horizon so it appeared his slumber had been no longer than several minutes the only change he could see was that tessanna now sat upon the edge of the fountain her right arm scarred from the day before traced the dagger along her left drawing thin lines of blood across her pale white skin it couldnt have been you he said from within the alley the girl glanced up and stared straight at him as if she had heard then she laughed her smile lit up her face she looked eighteen nineteen at the most and she was beautiful beautiful even as she drew the dagger back down to let the blood flow beautiful even as she watched mesmerized at the drops staining the clear water below she carved four runes before the guards appeared this is the last time tessanna he heard one of them say weve warned you enough get off no guard touched her even though they towered over her small thin form qurrahs curiosity grew tessanna stood licked the back of her hand and then gave one of the guards a flirty smile when he made no movement she flicked her wrist spraying his armor with her blood still no guards moved she waved and blew each one a kiss she headed south blood flecked across her lips and face the guards shook their heads and murmured amongst themselves one looked to the water his disapproval visible when they left they were edgy and in foul moods those images are of a madman qurrah said remembering the man with his mouth sewn shut or madwoman was that your childhood the necromancer had always thought the cruelty and depravity of his early years was unmatched but it appeared someone else had a tale darker than his own he stood brushed the dust of his robes and returned to the tower fresh determination in his heart he would speak with the girl the following morning part of him could not endure the wait and part of him would gladly wait forever y ou look well aurelia said when harruq poked his head into their room better than yesterday he asked yes but not by much the halforc laughed and then collapsed onto the elfs floor delysia she called glancing back to where the priestess reclined on a bed reading a book the big boy needs a spell she asked not looking up or three aurelia cast a levitation spell on the passed out halforc he floated into the air traveled across the two beds and stopped beside the priestess she reached up and touched the floating halforc white light surrounded her hand healing magic flowed out from her delysia withdrew her hand having not once stopped her reading aurelia gently lowered harruq next to her seconds later he stirred eh where oh hello aurry hello harruq she smiled care to stay awhile sure thing good the elf said backing away and giving an exaggerated wave in front of her nose but bathe first so we may stay together in the same room harruq groaned where can i do that aurelia glanced back to delysia who looked up from her book with an evil smile oh this is going to be bad isnt it he asked as both began shoving him down the stairs you have no idea aurelia laughed t hey took him to a tiny stone structure jutting out the eastern side of the tower harruq had to duck to get inside the two girls stayed outside the smiles on their faces only increasing his worry what is so funny he asked nothing aurelia said now take off your armor and clothes excuse me his face blushed not sure you two want the whole show do you of course not aurelia said with fake indignation such a pervert delysia added aurelia reached inside and swung a small hinged door shut it was high enough to reach the halforcs chest now get naked aurelia said we wont peek in we promise just slide your armor over the top of the door harruq mumbled a few choice comments but made sure none were loud enough for aurelias sharp ears he stripped down and tossed his belongings outside now what he asked say the word water delysia said the halforc shrugged water water fell from the ceiling as if a tiny rainstorm were trapped inside harruq jumped but the water was warm and the rain soft there was no drain instead the water faded away without ever pooling higher than his toes this isnt too bad he said shaking his hair back and forth and staring at the ceiling kind of soft though say more delysia ordered more the rain increased in intensity oh yeah much better harruq began washing himself under the water thought youd like it aurelia said by the way just dont say much more what happens if i say much more one might as well have dumped seven buckets of water on him at once the room roared with a downpour mightier than nature could ever muster aaah make it stop the halforc screamed both girls were too busy laughing however to tell him how daah stupid rain less less the rain softened back to a tolerable level he shook water out of his ears while the girls continued laughing think youre soooo funny he grumbled of course delysia drummed her fingers against the door smiling at harruq you can say cold and warm to change the temperature im fine thanks aurelia jabbed delysia in the ribs her grin still mischievous think hes done in there already id say so the priestess replied we did soak him pretty good didnt we whatre you two up to now the wary halforc asked say dry harruq aurelia ordered no i dont trust you fine i will the elf hoisted herself up and stuck her neck through the top of the door harruq spun around blushing furiously the elf laughed and said dry very hard massive winds slammed harruq from one side of the room he struggled against it but eventually flew back the impact with the wall taking away his breath i hate you aurry he shouted when his senses returned i love you she shouted back she poked her head in once more took a good look at the halforc while delysia opened her mouth in shock and then said the word done the wind stopped all was quiet in the room aurelia stepped back while the priestess mouthed a question itll do aurelia said both burst out laughing can i have my clothes now a humbled and embarrassed harruq asked from inside here you go delysia said tossing the dirty clothes over the top of the door although you really should keep those in there with you when you wash both decided the curses coming from inside were not appropriate for female ears so they left qurrah met them at the door to the tower whats so amusing he asked your brother is just so cute aurelia said especially when hes all wet and grumpy delysia added qurrah remained outside as they left he shook his head honestly bewildered dezrel will rue the day those two met he said harruq showed up his armor in his arms he was completely dry have fun with the girls i guess qurrah asked shut up harruq said and im never bathing again still clueless qurrah could only laugh at his brothers anger as harruq stomped upstairs in a huff h aern slipped inside tarlaks room shutting the door silently the wizard sat as his desk pouring over maps of dezrel thanks for coming haern tarlak said without looking up youve become more perceptive tarlak chuckled nope aurelia cast a few spells on my room at my request clever girl really ill know when someone enters or is listening watching or scrying were safe here you can take that hood off if you want do you trust her the wizard looked up from his notes of course i do dont you haern shrugged i dont know yet then dont take your hood off yet was the wizards reply not too complicated he gestured to the seat before his desk sit down we need to talk the assassin crossed the room and sat he glanced around sighed and then removed the hood long curly gold hair danced with a shake of his head tarlak glanced at the face of his friend and sighed he would die to have haerns looks yet all the assassin did was keep his features hidden underneath his hood all so he could go unnoticed whenever he wished you really dont have your priorities straight tarlak muttered how so haern asked his voice was clear and firm the whisper vanishing along with the hood never mind we have a problem haern leaned forward scanning the documents and maps littering tarlaks desk what is it the wizard sighed and collapsed in his chair i dont know what it is and thats the problem something big is going on when was the last time any of our contacts gave you information worth a damn a hand ran through the golden hair as he thought two months at least maybe three are you worried my network has been compromised in a way yes tarlak leaned forward propping his chin on his fists the guilds are planning something something that makes our bribes weak by comparison our contacts have suddenly grown stupid what could all five guilds be working on that benefits everyone from top to bottom nothing haern said only a return to the days of old would carry such charm so who stands in the way of returning back to the days of fleecing the rich and robbing the merchants the heads of all the guilds are owned mind and soul by the nobles haern said they wouldnt dare risk losing the protection money they earn even if they could earn more by taking it haern shrugged thered be the risk of being caught having the other guilds cannibalize and destroy them and of course theres me any chance would require complete cooperation of four guild masters possibly all five tarlak nodded he had come to the same conclusion and that is the problem haern one of your guys hensley has passed us word that an attempt on guildmaster thren will be made in two days why to replace him with his second in command tarlak picked up a glass full of violet liquid and drank smacking his lips he put it back down and spoke perhaps it fits doesnt it cooperation is needed so the lower underlings thinking a tougher leader might get them more money arrange to have their current guildmaster killed he is owned by the nobles after all you think this is a trap haern stated i do hensley is the lowest rung on a ladder two feet deep in dung no way would he know about such a plan the assassin leaned back in his chair his eyes distant as he lost himself in thought why the trap though he wondered you said it yourself tarlak said with a shrug if all the guilds cooperate they wont be caught and no one will cannibalize the other so what is left that threatens them me haern said pulling the hood back over his face a shadow immediately engulfed his face born of magic only his blue eyes and his firm chin pierced out from his hood yes the watcher of the king paid handsomely to ensure peace among the thief guilds by removing all who would turn our streets to anarchy well it appears your efforts have earned you many enemies i must visit my contacts he whispered turning to go no tarlak said his voice gave no room for argument you kill them and theyll know we see their bait for what it is were going to willingly spring this trap why haern asked because someone organized all this and i want to know who besides a lesson to the underworld not to mess with the eschaton could make our lives much easier in the coming months if you insist he opened the door and was about to leave when tarlak halted him again oh by the way will the halforc be ready by then haern shrugged he is ready now all that is left is years of polishing well try not to beat him too badly that morning well need him healthy for the assassination trap whatever you say haern said offering a mock bow he shut the door as quietly as he had entered minutes later a loud banging startled the wizard from his task of copying spell scrolls come on in he shouted im never doing anything important in here just picking my nose and scratching my bum sounds important to me brug grinned shoving open the door a whole lot better than your pansy spell crap my pansy spell crap can make you a pansy mudskipper tarlak threatened mudskipper brug asked raising an eyebrow just came to me what is it you need wondering if you finished the scrolls i asked you for tarlak grabbed two capped cylindrical containers and tossed them to brug i take it those are for the ox he asked actually no ive been talking to the elf and she says shes not too bad with that staff of hers figure if she plans on whacking things with it itd be nice if things noticed explains the first scroll and the illusion brug chuckled tucking both tubes underneath his arm shes got nothing but a stick maybe its just me but im thinking theres more to things than just function you gotta look good at what you do tarlak chuckled fine ill give you free reign just dont spend too much of my money brug winked of course the door shut with a resounding thud tarlak sighed his fingers rubbing his temples paranoid antisocial assassin with a secret identity a bipolar blacksmith and halforc brothers hanging out with a girlie elf and ive got to use them to keep chaos off the streets lathaar old buddy i sure hope youre having a better time than i am at that time lathaar was deep in a haunted forest battling against an ancient demon composed of pure darkness if asked the paladin would have shaken his head and refused to switch places there are worse things in life than demons h ey qurrah harruq asked that night are these latenight conversations going to become common his brother muttered into his pillow they finally slept in beds although crates and supplies still surrounded them tarlak had said the portable hole would be longer acquiring than he thought given his underestimation of their rarity the beds however he had carted up the stairs with a few tricks of shrink and enlarge magic the sheets pillows and blankets were all white courtesy of delysia stitched across their lengths was a golden mountain whats that harruq had asked her the symbol for ashhur itll help you sleep better i promise the symbol didnt seem to be working so instead he stared at the ceiling and talked to his brother do youdo you like it here harruq asked qurrah sighed and his weak voice grew greater in volume and tone lets address this right now shall we he said harruq squirmed uncomfortably you are happy and enjoy this place but since happiness is a rarity for us you worry something is wrong and if it is not you then it must be me i dont fit in well brother but the people are mostly kind the food is grand and our beds are padded and warm what better accommodations have we ever had none so stop worrying about my happiness and that goes for aurelia as well not sure if aurry is worrying too much about you he said trying to lighten the mood dont be stupid you know what i mean or will given time again harruq squirmed yes he knew what his brother meant i love her qurrah he whispered into the quiet it seemed an eternity before qurrah responded i know go to sleep he did qurrah followed him into slumber but only after kicking the blanket with the golden mountain to the floor only then could he sleep peacefully the blackhaired girl returning to his dreams b oth were awake before the dawn they spoke little qurrah assumed correctly that his brother prepared for practice harruq assumed incorrectly that his brother did the same they parted the warrior circling north around the tower the necromancer heading southeast the center of veldaren was blessedly empty qurrah sat on the edge of the fountain dabbing a hand in the water nervousness gnawed at his heart she had power how much he didnt know but for her to dive into his mind and twist his own defenses against him showed a mind sharper than the blades his brother carried time passed and the sun crawled its way above the walls of the town why do you delay qurrah muttered surely by no fear of me more and more people passed by giving him curious glances as they did still no tessanna after an hour he felt a very familiar thorn enter his mind you wait for me he heard inside his skull the voice delicate and shy i wish to speak with you he replied silently it is more than that you border on obsession his anger flared do not say what you know is untrue a resolve hard as iron overtook the delicate voice in his head banishing any trace of weakness i have drunk from your mind qurrah tun i know what you are but i will come i too am curious tessanna stepped into view walking slowly up the southern road she had cut her ragged dress even higher than before exposing much of her thighs for the first time she and qurrah met face to face and the chill running up his back gave credence to the words of the baker only a shred of white encircled the outer edges of her eyes the rest was completely black both her irises and pupils her stare was blatant and powerful she could see through him and he knew it she approached her dagger in her right hand qurrah could not move could not even speak as she stopped less than a foot in front of him he felt like an old lumbering giant compared to her her forehead only came up to his chin hello i am tessanna delone she said her voice cruel and hard you wished to speak with me qurrah wondered where the soft giggling girl of the day before had gone my thoughts refuse to waiver he said i had to see your face lest i lose my mind forever you should let it go then she said i did years ago the freedom is a thrill she outstretched her left arm over the fountain the dagger pressed the underside just above her elbow why do you bleed yourself he asked her why the runes why the pain you ever ask people why they fuck she shot back feels good feels normal anyone ever ask you why the scent of the dead riles your blood red anger filled his pale face how dare you you want to speak to me fine lets see how obsessed you really are the dagger slashed quick and vicious this was not like her previous days of carving instead she cut one long open wound that poured blood like a crimson rain into the fountain tessanna closed her eyes and inhaled deeply she clenched her muscles and then the flow grew in power qurrah stared his mouth agape when she reopened her eyes her entire countenance had changed she giggled im sorry im having too much fun here come the guards several armored men bullied themselves past qurrah the necromancer unaware of their approach they surrounded the girl their swords drawn enoughs enough the lead guard said you wont make a fuss right of course not he heard her say but you might have to grab me i wont fight too much she giggled again something carnal underneath the sound made qurrah tremble unlike the cold shiver when he had seen her eyes this one was one of fire the guards ignoring qurrah completely marched tessanna toward the castle he watched them depart slowly realizing what it was the girl had just done i do not take kindly to being tested he said the whip tightened around his arm sensing bloodshed to come i n the northwestern corner of veldaren tucked against the giant beauty of the stone castle like a swollen mutated foot was the prison the construction was simple and practical it looked like a giant box with barred windows half below ground half above inside however was far more twisted and complicated than any rational mind could devise qurrah wasnt known for his rational mind he arrived at nightfall the moon was a thin sliver of light in the darkness for this qurrah was grateful for his mixed blood would grant him sight in the darkness two bored soldiers guarded the locked iron doors leading into the prison another guard looped around the compound his gait slow and his eyes dull a single spell put him to the ground a second put out his torch qurrah made no pretense of hiding the body in a minute or two the front guards would notice still he did not hurry qurrah felt her presence as a physical pull on his chest one he could see when he closed his eyes he approached her window and pressed his face against the cold bars tessanna sat on an aged bench her wrists bound together by rusted metal and chained to shackles around her ankles a second chain ran up her chest around her neck and then attached to a metal plate bolted into the stone tessanna he whispered why are you here she asked her voice was devoid of all emotion the sound of perfect apathy do you wish to be freed he asked ignoring her question she never moved her head to look at him no i am fine go your own way the halforc ignored her again he shifted next to the window and placed his hands against the wall his body turned translucent and like a ghost he slipped through grunting in pain he absorbed the landing on his shoulder when he stood he wiped dirt from his robes and glared at her do not play games with me he said i should let you rot tessannas eyes remained cast to the floor her long black hair hiding her face yes she said i should rot down here so leave me be you dont know why you came so why should i feel glad you did in answer qurrah slapped her across the face the sharp sound stirred the lone occupant in an adjacent cell whatcha doin over there girl found yourself a buddy a tanned man with dirty hair pressed against the bars hold your tongue or i will kill you qurrah said the other man laughed you cant even touch me how about you let me free or i start screaming for guards qurrah started to cast a spell but stopped when hands grabbed his robes he startled when he glanced back at tessanna her face had changed life burned in her eyes angry life before he could respond she released his robes pointed her shackled hands at the nuisance and whispered a word of magic in a dark tongue of old relnka qurrah heard the prisoner gargled and coughed blood spilled out his lips as well as his nose his eyes his ears and every other orifice he collapsed dark liquid pooled underneath his body as he silently died i should bleed you as well she snarled at qurrah try and you will die he shot back wishing he felt as confident as he sounded i come as your savior i will leave as your murderer tessanna held up her constricted hands release me he touched the metal shackles and pondered unsure he tried the same spell he had used to enter the cell the metal swarmed with shadow nearly glowing with its darkness and then slipped to the ground the flesh like air to it when he started to cast the spell on her legs she waved him off open she commanded hooking her fingers in strange fluid formations the locks around her feet clicked and fell she stood tossing her hair off her face how do we get out she asked not a bit of gratitude revealed its presence in her voice you did not need me to free yourself why do you need me now already he felt foolish he was no savior to this girl at any time she could have cast aside the chains that held her i cannot walk through walls she replied locks are a different matter we can leave through the front entrance but people will die they will hunt you if we do qurrah said give me your hand no he took it anyway she glared at him her eyes bulging with anger but the anger melted away he held her hand so gently qurrah closed his eyes to think and when he opened them again tessanna was blushing he raised an eyebrow your hand is soft she said in a quiet shy voice qurrah pretended not to notice follow me my former master taught me this spell but i have never used it before youll do fine she said i know it he cast the spell a black door formed against the wall constructed of shadows and magic they stepped inside the door vanished and then they were far away t he shadow door reopened inside a tiny decrepit building the two stepped out the entrance scattering into nothingness behind them tessanna looked around her arms wrapped across her chest there was barely room for them to stand side by side where are we she asked still in veldaren qurrah said this is where my brother and i used to live before we were evicted and forced to travel to woodhaven it has long been abandoned she looked away her arms still wrapped tight about her body why did you come good does not come from me qurrah tun it never has that does not mean it never will before going to the prison he had stashed blankets and a pillow in the corner he picked them up and offered them to her thank you she said gripping the cloth as if her life were at stake please how can i repay you he shook his head we are kindred tessanna we both sense it but i want to thank you she said she put the blankets down and stepped closer dont you want me to thank you she reached for the sash around his waist he grabbed her arm what are you doing he asked thanking you she said her voice was so soft so childlike it hurt him please itll be okay her other hand slid through the tight cloth she felt his knee caressed it with the back of her fingers and then slid her hand higher enough he shouted shoving her away she fell and the look of pain on her face would haunt his dreams for nights to come curled up on her knees she looked at him tears in her eyes his breath was heavy and he did his best to calm as he spoke i desire your company tessanna but not in that way i do not even know you tomorrow morning i will come with food please sleep well this night she nodded a hand wiped away her tears when they were gone so too was her emotion the girl of apathy had returned i will await you here she said she took the blankets and spread them out in the corner without another word she nestled in pressed her head against the pillow and tried to sleep qurrah stared at her his skin hot and his mind blurred tessanna he said his voice full of fear go home she interrupted my dreams are dark i do not want you hurt go home he did cursing himself every step of the way q urrah harruq grumbled in a drowsy voice that you i had trouble sleeping his brother said sliding into bed you sure nothing i am fine he said sharper than he meant his throat throbbed his head ached and his heart thumped as if it were to explode brother harruq asked rising from his bed whats wrong go to bed harruq qurrah said i will explain in time the big halforc shrugged if you say so qurrah put his back to him and stared at the wall his thoughts never left tessanna even when he slipped into the world of dreams m y dear eschaton we have ourselves a beauty of a task tarlak said to the collected mercenaries of the tower they grouped together on the first floor the two females sprawled across the couches the men sitting unhappily on the floor except for haern who haunted the stairs leading upward hows the pay asked brug no pay for this one charity stuff here tarlak scratched his goatee his eyes glancing over to haern we do this one for the watcher not to sound dumb but who is this watcher aurelia asked the yellow wizard turned to her and beamed i would gladly tell you my dear i am haern whispered interrupting him i keep the thief guilds in line both halforcs glanced at him with shocked faces youre the watcher harruq said holy orcbutt no wonder you beat me so bad holy orcbutt delysia asked raising an eyebrow at him harruq shrugged got the point across so now i know who the watcher is aurelia said but how exactly do you keep the thief guilds in line lovely aurelia do you have no knowledge of how the guilds operate in veldaren tarlak asked she shook her head who wants to inform the girl tarlak asked the crowd twelve years ago haern began the noble families in veldaren declared war on the thief guilds after five years of mercenaries roaming the streets and nobles bleeding out in the night they made a truce the nobles would pay the thief guilds what they were paying the mercenaries in return they gained protection and not just for their homes but the entire city five guilds accepted and the rest were eradicated odd as it sounds the thief guilds protect their territory and only the poorest of streets are left to a few vagabond burglars so you have no crime here aurelia asked a miracle we have crime my lady elf haern whispered just no robbery murder and rape are another matter many thieves want to return to the days of old tarlak added they feel like bodyguards now bottom rate sentries the number of members in each guild has doubled and tripled with each member getting a smaller and smaller cut only guildmasters make a luxurious living this leads me into our wonderful surprise for tonight he cleared his throat and grinned at everyone guildmaster thren felhorn of the spider guild is to supposedly be assassinated tonight supposedly brug said i say supposedly for i believe it a trap all of you need to be on your toes the largest obstacle to returning to the days of old is not the guildmasters it is our dear friend haern those who speak out against the current system have a way of not waking up isnt that right oh wise and allknowing watcher get on with it haern said right my informant claimed that thren is meeting a higher up of the shadow guild about what is irrelevant inside an old warehouse owned by the spider guild i want half of you inside that building the other half out and around well hide best we can if it is a trap leave one or two of them alive its hard to make dead people talk but not impossible qurrah said all eyes went to him he had seemed mentally absent the whole meeting and had not previously spoken i take it conversing with dead is a hobby of yours tarlak asked i consider it a profession the dead talk same as the living and the dead cant lie brug made a show of throwing up his hands and rolling his eyes wonderful people you brought into our fold tar shut up brug ill leave it up to you all then kill if you want but lets not be sloppy or stupid tarlak started packing his maps meet in this room by nightfall and come prepared tonight were going to have some fun q urrah spent the day meeting with tessanna he brought food wrapped in another small blanket for her to use during the chilly nights she was sitting outside when he arrived staring at the sky i almost took a quick trip to the fountain she said her voice distant and emotionless but i figured i am too popular with certain men right now are you hungry he asked he unwrapped the pieces of bread bacon and hard cheese she blinked at it and shook her head i dont need to eat at least not often she said bring me something three mornings from now she held up her right hand showing him a simple wooden band around her ring finger it looks plain she said her voice almost bored my family handed it down for generations it helped them survive famine i only have to eat once every six days qurrah sat down opposite her he awkwardly fumbled for words for he had many questions and he wished to ask them all at once where is your family he finally asked her black eyes grew darker the white at the edges deepening to gray i have no family she said the apathy slowly faded into anger an animalistic being controlled the girls voice my mother died giving birth to me my father died later along with my stepmother i have no family his body shivered at the sound of her voice but he pressed on she had pried into his mind it was his turn to do the same tell me tessanna what happened to them she brought her gaze down from the sky you want to know fine i didnt kill my stepmother but he thought so he drank a lot because of it i cant blame him though considering what he came home to as she talked qurrah watched as the angry girl seamlessly turned shy and quiet we lived in the kings forest daddy owed lots of people money so we hid out there in our tiny cabin daddy gambled he came back here though said he was going to make lots of money lots and lots of money well she continued clutching her hands together and batting her eyelashes at him daddy didnt make enough so bad people took him made him work real hard he couldnt come home and see me and mommy he needed to because mommy got sick i was still young and she was too sick to leave and buy food for us so she gave me this ring she starved to death after a few weeks she giggled i didnt have to eat often because of the ring but when i did i was famished but we had nothing so another giggle i ate what i had to the vision tessanna had shown him of a female arm in his lap and the taste of blood on his lips darted across qurrahs mind he shuddered it seemed he was not the only one who had been forced to eat the scraps of the dead daddy came home and saw me eating she said he thought i killed mommy he was finally free and he came home wanting mommy but mommy was gone he told me there was stuff i could do for him though stuff mommy used to do another image the rough man tearing at his clothes sank qurrahs stomach hatred burned in his heart what happened to him he asked tessanna crawled closer and whispered as if telling a great secret he liked humping me he drank all the time probably because if he wasnt drinking hed realize how bad it was to take your thirteenyearold daughter to bed i did it though maybe i liked it it feels awfully good inside you she laughed at qurrahs blush he never even bothered to tell me he loved me he hated me i knew it so he never lied i think sometime over those two years he broke my mind again that insane laugh qurrahs heart tore at the sound part of it was adorable the other part was pure madness and it frightened him beyond words she continued her voice dropping into an even quieter whisper one night i had a plan i made it seem like i wanted it even liked it arent i such a horrible liar he got really really drunk that night when he was done with me he drank even more and fell asleep in a chair i took some rope and i tied his hands and feet he couldnt get out i tied his neck too i didnt want him moving because that would ruin the fun fun qurrah asked torture is what that man deserved torture is fun she said she didnt smile that time qurrah considered fleeing then but he didnt he wanted to hear the end of the story i crushed some glass into tiny pieces and shoved them in his mouth he woke up choking but i didnt stop i sewed his mouth shut i had practiced but with flesh you have to be forceful once he couldnt spit out the glass the real fun started lots of fun two years worth of fun she looked to the ground her face suddenly blushing i kissed his neck just before he tried swallowing the glass im not sure why he died choking on his own blood qurrah said more than asked the final image took its turn before his eyes that of the rough man vomiting intestines filled with shards of glass shhhh tessanna said through clenched teeth its a secret she leaned back smiling into her hand and dont you tell anybody i promise i will not qurrah said he stood and stretched his arms i must go will you be fine spending a few more days here will you come visit me she asked she curled her legs to her chest and peered over her knees qurrah would have done anything she asked she was so beautiful of course every day i promise she lowered her head as if in hiding thank you she said for what qurrah asked you know what if you dont youre dumber than i thought the halforc chuckled glad to hear the edge of sarcasm she seemed sanest when she was being sarcastic he bid her farewell and returned to the tower w hy do i have to be stuck with the orcs brug grumbled in the quietest tone he could manage which was not very quiet at all they hid near where the assassination was to take place and tarlak had just outlined the groups naturally the wizard was to be alone with aurelia because youre so short tarlak said and all short people must suffer it is the eschaton way tarlaks grin faded when he realized brug was not amused listen haern stays on his own because he works best that way delysia remains safe until it is all over and done and she can heal whoever needs it aurelia and i will sneak in through the roof and that leaves you three watching from the streets how come i cant be with aurelia brug whined she needs a melee fighter in case something goes wrong it appears you have competition brother qurrah said an amused expression on his face bah harruq said with the mage or the short guy either way im not too worried both turned and glared he grinned back hello aurrys going without you so one of you better go he pointed to the elf who was twenty feet in the air and climbing courtesy of a levitation spell tarlak patted brug on the head looks like you cant follow good luck save our asses if we screw up he cast a spell his feet bumped an inch off the ground and then he followed aurelia harruq put his hand on brugs shoulder as the three stared a shame he said look on the bright side though you can almost see up aurrys dress from here brugs face turned beet red one day he snarled justone dayyoull see t arlak landed on the roof beside aurelia gorgeous night he said a perfect time to spend with a beautiful woman hope you have enough coin on you she said i said with not on tarlak corrected aurelia shrugged whatever i take it the three mummers are guarding the southern entrance tarlak nodded haern should be watching the other which leaves the roof to us time to vanish aurelia said the two faded from view as they cast their invisibility spells the roof was flat and bare leaving them no other options for hiding with all ways into the building covered there was nothing to do but wait twenty minutes later a lone man appeared circled the building and then dashed away a scout tarlak explained aurelia glanced down the alley and from her vantage point noticed harruqs shoulders peeking out from behind a few conveniently placed crates i think haern needs to teach harruq a thing or two about stealth she said tarlak laughed stealth if he isnt screaming and wrecking stuff before the fight ill be thrilled she tried to jab him with her finger but missed next time i see you you are getting such a hard poking be gentle i am a delicate creature tarlak suddenly stiffened the elf could not see his posture change but the abrupt silence quieted her as well the shadow guild the wizard whispered a moment later down the street walked a man flanked by ruffians dressed in black leather blue scarves covered their faces the man wore a suit of polished leather armor with silver runes shining across his sleeves and neck his scarred face showed the price of his position they marched to the northern door opened it and went inside odd tarlak murmured no checking no searches more come from the south aurelia said another group this time adorned in pure gray clothes and armor the black spider emblazoned on their clothing traveled up the street in their center walked a young man his face covered by a hood pulled low they look so much like haern she said he was to be their prized assassin tarlak whispered reared from birth to be silent and unseen the spider guild planned complete conquest of the other guilds and then dominion over veldarens streets aurelia observed their silent movements shrouded by their long gray cloaks they did not move like men she shivered what stopped them they underestimated haern they thought his mind enslaved to their dogma a certain redheaded girl saved him delysia a soft chuckle escaped the invisible wizards throat aye he may not look it but a small gold emblem of the mountain hangs from his neck ashhur saved him in turn haern has saved us a hundred times over the group of men reached the warehouse opened the door and marched inside the door slammed shut behind them fun time do you know passwall aurelia shook her head and then laughed when she realized the wizard would not be able to see no i dont she said very well i was prepared for that um hrm say something i need to grab your hand over here she reached out her hands and slowly searched the air here he asked to your left you mean here other left my left wait never mind that wont work will it here you are a hand suddenly wrapped around her waist found you unfind me right now mister wizard why should i do that was his flirty reply mudskipper the hand vanished fingers wrapped around her arm then slid to her wrist from her left she heard spellcasting a tingling sensation flowed all the way to her toes suddenly it felt like the ground beneath her feet vanished she started to fall but the firm grip on her wrist held her steady levitate for ashhurs sake woman tarlak said loud as he dared she closed her eyes and did the semantic components with her right hand when the final words left her tongue she floated up and off the ceiling you have about a minute left tarlak said float on down and stay at the top of the room ill be beside you no more whispering aurelia said before dipping down they might hear then she was falling through the ceiling t ime to go harruq asked thats just one group no clue when others are showing up brug argued from behind his barrel we wait until we get ourselves a signal what kind of signal is that fire screams writing in the sky said qurrah funny brug grumbled youre not laughing because it aint funny stop lying then and youre being far too loud harruq said how about we wait five more minutes if anyone was bothering to count and qurrah was it was the fifth time brugs face turned beet red from anger embarrassment or both both parties have arrived a voice whispered from behind them and i know of twoyearolds that make less noise than you three brug jumped harruq spun and qurrah laughed can one really expect a quiet conversation between a halforc who thinks with his muscles and a human who doesnt think at all qurrah asked yes if both are dead haern replied guard the door the other side is mine enter at the sound of combat the assassin dashed to the warehouse cut around the corner and vanished all without making the slightest sound showoff harruq grumbled they made their way to the warehouse armor creaking and footsteps aplenty t he sensation was unique and to aurelia entirely unpleasant her eyes saw the inside of wood rafters as if they had been chopped in half then darkness followed by more wood and suddenly she hovered above a large building stacked full of barrels more than thirty men stood in the center some dressed in black some dressed in gray the two leaders stood face to face discussing some matter in hushed tones what do you think they are going to do tarlak whispered into her ear i thought i said no more speaking she whispered back cant help it im a nervous talker aurelia rolled her unseen eyes they want haern right she asked right what will bring haern rushing in im going to say someone dying the elf chuckled so what do you think is about to happen tarlak pointed knowing aurelia would not see the gesture that the members of the two opposing guilds had drawn their blades aurelia ran through a litany of her spells pondering her course of action she preferred not killing anyone but if things turned rough she would not risk the lives of her friends you think all this is rehearsed tarlak asked the two leaders appeared to be arguing vehemently while their cronies twirled their daggers and prepared their swords tarlak she said ignoring his question if someone is plotting haerns death do you think it probable that one of the men down there knows about it id say its a safe assumption good the sound of spellcasting filled his ears what in blazes are you doing he asked nonetooquietly its all an act aurelia said and the prelude bores me a thick blue ray of swirling dust hit the floor underneath the two leaders freezing the ground with a thin clear layer of ice her invisibility spell ended broken by her casting of an offensive spell the rogues looked up easily maintaining their balance on the ice oh dear tarlak said beside her you just have to have things exciting dont you several of the thieves shouted warnings as others rushed to the doors then five of the spider guild members pulled out throwing knives and flung them into the air y ou hear that shouting harruq asked brug nodded as the halforc drew his blades should we make our entrance loud or sneaky he asked allow me qurrah said he approached the door placed his hand upon it and cast his spell the aged wood splintered and shook with power and then with a tremendous explosion the door shattered into a hundred shards blasting inward as if blown by the winds of a hurricane the pieces clacked and broke against the far interior wall one abyss of a knock brug said clanging his punch daggers together he led the way followed by harruq and qurrah they managed a brief glance about before a pack of gray thieves assaulted them a large group of both guilds stood in the center dodging and weaving around spells harruqs heart jumped as he saw dagger after dagger fly toward aurelia but she evaded all with ease spinning her body or dropping up and down with her levitation spell on the far side of the building a large collection of blackleathered rogues battled against a whirling gray mass that could only be haern despite being outnumbered seven to one he seemed to be on the offensive bring it on ya pansies brug shouted barreling his way into the thieves that rushed to them my daggers are bigger harder and pack a whole lot more thrust harruq followed bellowing out his war cry condemnation and salvation drank in the blood of the closest attacker brug smacked away a couple quick thrusts before letting a third purposefully slip through the dagger struck his hardened platemail and deflected off making hardly a dent brugs stab however had only weak leather to slow it the wide blade left a gaping hole in the rogues chest brug punched repeatedly perforating the thiefs ribcage a second attacker snuck around eyeing a crease in brugs armor near the shoulder blade brug ducked low when he saw the man circling and then whirled to face him he rammed his head into the thiefs groin then grabbed his legs and lifted him into the air with a hearty bellow he slammed them both to the ground the collision again ramming brugs forehead against his groin brug scrambled to his feet inadvertently kneeing him a third time when his punch daggers stabbed for the throat there was no resistance qurrah stayed back watching the fight the two warriors provided a wall between him and the rogues one he planned to use well a rogue slipped past their attack and dashed toward the apparently unarmed halforc idiot qurrah said hemorrhage the thief felt a tingle in his belly a tingle that rapidly grew into a raging fire his skin ruptured and blood poured forth the shock of it sent him staggering right into qurrahs arms the halforc caught him unafraid of the dagger he still held tight his pale gray hand clutched the rogues throat his eyes were blue his hair was blond they would not stay so qurrah hissed the words to a spell his hand turned vampiric draining the essence of life the mans hair was gray his eyes were dead qurrah dropped the body to the floor power surged through him eager for use he closed his eyes tendrils floating out from his body they were extensions of his power black and deadly one thief deep in combat with brug was touched midswing by one such tendril he shrieked his dagger dropping from his hand images of the abyss to come swirled before his eyes clawing things with bloody fingernails gnawed at his mind brug buried his punch daggers into the rogues throat to silence his shrieking another thief fleeing from harruqs rage felt a tendril snake around his ankle the madness came quick fueling his already burning fear he shrieked seeing nameless fiends sinking teeth into his ankle he stopped his retreat dropped to one knee and began sawing off his ankle with his own dagger harruq halted above him stunned by the sight kill him qurrah said smoke drifting from his eyes save him from his madness harruq felt a pang of guilt but knew his brothers words were true he buried his sword deep between collarbone and neck this all ya got brug shouted stabbing his dagger into the side of the lone thief that fought the three the thief hobbled back grimacing at the pain of his wound qurrah narrowed his eyes remembering the spell tessanna had cast in the prison he had prepared earlier in the day practicing those same words the girl had used bleed he hissed in the arcane tongue blood poured from every opening on the mans body brug spat on the corpse you got some creepy spells halforc but theyre effective harruq looked up to aurelia relieved by the sight of her unharmed bodies of the dead littered the icy floor haern approached from the other side a trail of defeated rogues in his wake well that was easy harruq shouted to the others too easy qurrah said if this was a trap it was a poor one the two casters floated down tarlak eyeing the corpse of thren in particular he fell to a single lightning bolt tarlak said stroking his beard something smells fishy and its not brug aurry do you know any dispel magic harruq felt a pang of jealousy yes she said and dont call me aurry the jealousy quickly faded aurelia swung her hands about and cast her spell a wave of white magic washed over the entire building harruq felt his armor and weapons sizzle in protest your equipment should be fine the elf told him when she noticed harruqs puzzled expression if i focused the spell entirely on your weapons i might manage to destroy their magic but i doubt it it wasnt thren haern said pointing to the body illusions a trap for sure the guildmasters body had changed now no different from any other common thief who lay dead around them you three leave any alive tarlak asked brug and the halforcs not thinking so harruq said did you tarlak shook his head i like fire and lightning it appears they didnt haern one still breathes yes haern whispered shall we have a talk oh yes tarlak beamed cracking his knuckles most definitely yes t he rogue was a young man with not even a scrap of hair on his chin he lay on his back wheezing with each breath his hands clutched a bleeding wound in his side will he be alive for much longer tarlak asked peering down at him no haern said call in delysia will do tarlak reached into his shirt and pulled out a gold medallion shaped like a tower come on over sis he whispered to it the gold flared a brilliant white before returning to its soft shine standing in front of tarlak her hands on her hips appeared delysia i wish i didnt have to stay behind so often she complained weve gone over this tarlak said i would be an awful brother to risk you being hurt in a melee delysia rolled her eyes when she caught sight of the wounded rogue she winced oh you poor dear whatd you do to him i might have stabbed him haern whispered might the rogue gasped before falling unconscious delysia knelt beside him her hands on his chest and her eyes closed in prayer qurrah slid beside tarlak and said softly to him he would talk easier if he was dead all men have a chance to be redeemed tarlak said back killing in combat is one thing but i will not finish off a helpless man i can save delysia would furious otherwise white light surrounded delysias hands and then poured into the dying man the wound closed ending the flow of blood strength poured into him stirring him back to consciousness wakeywakey brug greeted care to answer a few questions id rather die the rogue said you almost did delysia said frowning at him glad to know my aid is appreciated he sneered at her but said nothing haern we need an attitude adjustment tarlak said he snapped his fingers the assassin walked over knelt down and then buried a saber into the thiefs right wrist he screamed and struggled but the location of the saber was perfect in between the bones so the blade could not tear free finally the man calmed wincing against the pain delysia pointedly turned away her face disgusted you do not approve qurrah asked her there are always better ways she said violence is rarely the best the halforc laughed aurelia glared at him silence qurrah or i will quiet you myself he grinned at her but obeyed care to talk now tarlak asked once the thief regained his composure the man nodded good tell me your name terrence alright terrence who orchestrated this whole farce all i want is a name and i will let you live they will kill me if i talk terrence said you will die if you dont haern whispered besides all will think you dead now give us a name tarlak stood watching and stroking his goatee the man appeared to be greatly troubled and when haern yanked his blade free it did not help his confused mind i will tell terrance said at last but i want you to promise tarlak clapped the man on the shoulder ignoring the wince of pain on his face i speak for the eschaton you will not be harmed nor persecuted for any crimes you might have committed in your guild terrence glanced about before his eyes settled on a vacant area of the floor what theyve told us he said is that all of the guildmasters wish the watcher dead the guilds are united they prepare for war haerns face darkened he pulled his hood lower who initiated it he asked i dont know terrence said the spider guild seems the most eager thren has spoken with our representatives every night now may i go the mercenaries let him stand he winced clutching his tender chest delysia turned back around and grabbed his hand in hers go with the peace of ashhur she told him light swirling about her hands when she released there was no trace of the wound he nodded to each of them pilfered coins from his dead comrades and then ran why did you let that one live tarlak asked watching him go he was the least bloodthirsty and had some measure of skill i thought he might be the most tempted by a new life the wizard shrugged makes sense to look out aurelia shouted she dove in front of haern and then screamed as an arrow pierced through the flesh of her breast haern spun seeing just the trace of a gray cloak at the door qurrah had shattered tarlak caught aurelia in his arms and helped her to the floor haern knelt beside her eyeing the wound poison he whispered lady thyne please forgive me he yanked the arrow out harruq rushed to the door his swords drawn and ready he ran out into the street spun one way then the other no one was in sight move haern i must help her delysia said she knelt down her hands upon the wound she prayed for healing and white light shone about her suddenly her face contorted in pain and a black light poured out of the wound and into her fingers sis stop it tarlak screamed trying to pull her away i have toi have to she said before shrieking more and more darkness poured into her pushing away the white as the rest stood helpless qurrah walked over knelt beside delysia and put his hands atop of hers delrn rel thun yaer he hissed the black magic poured into his hands but did no harm to him instead it swirled above his palms held captive by the necromancer let your death go elsewhere he said he flung his hand as if throwing a spear straight into the ground a dark ethereal arrow flew through the dirt and vanished for a brief moment healing light flowed into the pale and dying aurelia then delysia fell back unable to keep her balance tarlak caught her gently in his arms i think i helped her delysia said her voice barely a whisper i dont think itll kill her i dont think she slipped into sleep in her brothers arms harruq returned then and looked down at his precious aurelia will she be all right he asked the arrow was cursed qurrah said his eyes looking not to his brother but to haern they wished you to die of poison and they wished death upon any that tried healing you aurelia saved your life who did this to her harruq said the whole world turning red in his eyes was it the spider guild dont do anything foolish haern whispered they are many and powerful and theyll soon be many and dead qurrah put his hand on his brothers shoulder i will await you at the tower i will be of no use to you now i have not the strength if you wish any to speak however i will be ready harruq turned to tarlak can you get her to the tower the wizard nodded ill open a portal haern and brugll help me carry aurelia and delysia what is it you plan on doing harruqs grip tightened on his swords and the rage in his eyes was visible fire killing everyone responsible he growled tarlak glanced to his sister weak and sleeping in his arms kill them twice for me he said with a nod harruq stormed out of the warehouse and into the dark streets of veldaren h e did not get far before haern fell from the top of a building and blocked his path out of my way haern this is something i have to do haerns cold voice showed no sign of backing down i will aid you the spider guild is strong you cannot do this alone i can and i will he tried to shove his way past haern hooked his foot behind harruqs ankle and kicked the halforc fell haern holding an arm so that his landing was not too painful do not be foolish haern whispered into his ear they meant to kill me aurelia saved my life i will repay such a debt harruq snorted blowing dirt away from his face fine do you know where we should start haern released his hold on the halforc harruq brushed himself off got to his feet and glared at his teacher haerns glare back showed he cared little for his pupils attitude follow me the watcher said t he black mug bar was a dank crowded building made of old plaster and uneven walls its drinks were often watered down and always overpriced but despite this it remained fully stocked with customers most were not there for the ale in the back of the building was its real purpose a guarded door led to an expansive and welllit basement filled with the finest luxuries available to enter one needed a password which changed every month and to show a sigil proving membership harruq and haern needed neither what you say a burly man asked as they approached pissed off halforc harruq said the guard shook his head you two should leave nothing down there you want oh yeah there is the halforc said grabbing the mans head and slamming it against the door the guard slumped to the floor the few patrons jumped to their feet drawing weapons most were members of the spider guild and donned gray cloaks similar to haerns the assassin whirled upon them drawing his sabers i have killed more men than all of you have combined he said his blue eyes blazing those wishing to live leave now those who dare face the wrath of the watcher come now and die uncertain glances were followed by disappearing cloaks soon only the barkeep remained harruq kicked the door splintering the meager lock there was a key on the guy you just clobbered the barkeep said pouring himself a drink keys bah haern tossed the barkeep a silver coin to cover your losses he whispered before following harruq down into the depths of the spider guild a s they descended the stairs two thieves ambushed from either side harruq jumped landing hard at the bottom haern smashed his feet into his attackers face the man staggered back blood pouring from his nose haern took his feet out from underneath with a sweeping kick twin sabers buried into his heart as he fell harruq drew his blades relishing the surge of power they offered his attacker rushed him his dagger thrusting the halforc smacked it aside like a toy the longer reach of his swords was too much an advantage the thief fell before him several gaping wounds in his chest you ever been down here harruq asked glancing around they were in a tiny room filled with dusty barrels and crates yes a long time ago the assassin approached what appeared to be a bare stone wall he traced the subtle indents of the bricks with his fingers here he whispered he stepped back and pointed at a particular section we need a new door with pleasure harruq said he tucked his shoulder and ran right through the false wall showering rock and stone everywhere haern dashed in as dust clouded the air his swords drawn and his eyes searching all about were plush cushions silver platters of food exquisite dining tables lined with black and scarlet patterns and several private rooms adjacent the main floor there should have been lords and nobles scantily clad women and wealthy merchants trading dealing and bribing one another with pleasures of flesh powder and coin instead the room was dark and empty everyone go home for the night harruq asked haern shook his head his eyes still darting the pleasures are partaken here night and day i fear we made a great error harruq id say so called the barkeep from the top of the stairs thanks for the coin by the way haern flew back through the busted wall and up the stairs only to find a wall of magical origin blocking his way harruq came rushing after his swords still in hand what the abyss is going on he asked the meeting wasnt the trap haern whispered turning back around to face the halforc this is the deep grinding of stone rolling against stone came from the far room im scared to ask what that was harruq said they are called the spider guild for a reason the assassin said he knelt in front of harruq pulled out a golden medallion shaped like a mountain and then as the halforc stared incredulously whispered a quick prayer when finished he slipped the medallion back underneath his tunic and stood come haern whispered i have no intentions of dying this night you got that right harruq said the two reentered the plush room on the far side surrounded by rubble was a newly created hole from within came loud skittering sounds that made the halforcs skin crawl oh that better not be what i think that is harruq said go for the soft underbelly haern whispered and dont get bitten loud thumping sounds joined the skittering after a few quick motions by haern they ran to either side of the entrance in hope of an ambush the sounds grew louder and then out crawled a giant tarantula enlarged to the size of small house of all the things harruq had seen in his life nothing prepared him for legs the size of pine trees giant mandibles beneath eight huge eyes and that loud constant shriek dont get bitten he mumbled staring at the fangs protruding out from the bottom of its head each one bigger than his hand no kidding when it was halfway out harruq used every bit of his courage to swing at one of the legs his sword thudded as if hitting a tree and clear blue ichor spewed across his hand the spider shrieked in fury harruq hacked two more times as it spun about focusing all eight eyes squarely on him hello he said then flung condemnation end over end the blade pierced one of the eyes embedding up to the hilt in green and black gunk the spider rushed forward horrifying harruq with its speed it slammed him backward with the top of its head he flung across the room thankfully landing on a pile of pillows he struggled to his feet throwing a couple as he did then haern came diving in the assassin rolled underneath the spider his sabers slashing in a silver flurry it shrieked and smashed its belly down but haern was already gone he slashed its legs spilling ichor to the ground when it spun giant fangs biting he dove back underneath with a sideways roll with every revolution he sliced his sabers into its belly soaking his cloaks with the discharge the bulbous back to him harruq gripped salvation in both hands and struck the spider reared onto its back legs its forelegs pounding great dents in the ceiling when it landed it slammed backward smashing its abdomen against harruq and the wall the red hairs on its back were like thorns shredding his exposed skin the legs turned flinging harruq across the room this time he missed the pile of pillows that hurt he said getting to his knees his gaze settled on the tarantula hissing at him from only a few feet away ah shit the thing spun around whipping its legs at him long spikes protruded from its back two legs each the size of a broadsword the first caught his forehead tearing open a bright red gash the other deflected off his armor the blow stealing his breath and jolting him back the tarantula continued spinning its back legs arching out just above its body a little help harruq shouted haern weaved outside the range of the spiders legs studying he stepped closer and then retreated just as quickly a spike nearly took off his head he repeated this pulling back seconds before acquiring an impaled skull the spider continued its spin the third time haern did not pull away he ducked down his sabers slashing the spider screeched as the end of one of its back legs flew across the room trailing fluids harruq swung salvation wildly hoping for similar results instead a great impact sent his sword flying from his hand unarmed the halforc had no option but to crawl away on his back i so hate spiders i so hate spiders he said repeatedly haern watched the shifted pattern in the tarantulas spinning it was incredibly quick the spikes on its legs deadly but it was still just an enlarged version of an unintelligent animal the spin which worked against all enemies it encountered in the natural world was all it knew the only change was the equivalent of a limp due to haerns cut the assassin danced in and out his sabers slashing another chunk of leg flew across the room the giant tarantula was vulnerable he leapt high into the air and landed atop the spiders abdomen both sabers pierced through the tough exoskeleton and into the slender heart tube that ran through its center the spider rocked back and forth in its dying throes haern flipped away harruq rolled and crawled desperate to evade the flailing legs the spiders loud screech rose higher and higher still spinning it charged at random smashing into walls until in one sudden convulsion it shriveled its legs underneath itself and died harruq stood frowning at the gunk covering his armor that has to be the most disgusting thing i have ever seen he said haern also covered with ichor chuckled and pointed at the halforc i have to agree but where did you find a mirror ha ha ha shaddup you harruq approached the spider still feeling queasy at the sight of it curled up in death stupid thing he said probably smashed my sword further in when it ran into the wall he looked around trying to see condemnation but could not guess you will have to dig for it haern said he clapped the halforc on the back good luck harruqs heart sank can you go get it for me youre a whole lot more nimble its your sword haern replied harruq grumbled and then climbed up a leg shuddering with each touch of the hard bristly hairs he found the ruptured eye and sure enough the sword was nowhere visible closing his eyes and keeping his nose as far away as possible harruq pushed his hand inside the slurping noise nearly made him vomit he slipped in further and further until his hand touched metal he grabbed it and pulled condemnation ripped free its red glow dimmed by the gunk covering it hope i never have to do that again he said shaking as much of the nasty stuff off his hand as he could he hopped off preferring the jolt to his legs over climbing down the dead spiders leg any ideas how to get out of here haern asked him harruq gave him a funny look arent you supposed to be the smart one the assassin shrugged and youre supposed to be the strong one so if i cant figure a way out you need to punch us a hole what is blocking the top of the stairs a magical wall harruq chuckled he retrieved salvation and then clanged both swords together you know i do have an idea t he barkeep downed his fifth glass showing no signs of it affecting him he had listened to the muffled sounds of battle his neck hairs standing on end every time the spider screeched but now all was quiet his customers were gone and it was too late for more to arrive perhaps it was time to call it a night a tapping against his magical wall interrupted his drink whos there he asked please help me said a weak voice on the other side the spider is dead but ive been bitten please the poison im sorry but youre supposed to die the barkeep told the wall nothing personal of course a drink then the voice whispered please a drink before i die i have gold the barkeeps greed kindled if he left the bodies down there for thren and the rest to return he would get nothing if he could loot the bodies first however very well he said i cant refuse a dying man his drink he picked up a silver wand resting atop the counter thren had given it to him along with instructions of when and how to use it he poured a drink tapped the wand twice and then said the correct words the wall dissipated into dust revealing haern lying on his stomach his hands shaking and his voice weak here you go the barkeep said he reached out the cup to haern to his horror a strong healthy hand grabbed his wrist thats alright haern whispered his eyes full of life ill help myself he twisted the wrist into a painful lock the barkeeps eyes bulged and he turned his body to prevent the bone from snapping haern rose and shoved the man into the bar another hand slammed his face against the counter bottles of ale scattered breaking and pouring everywhere where are they haern asked i dont know anything the barkeep said they paid me to lock you in thats all harruq pounded up the stairs his swords ready he swung one next to the mans head and left it there embedded deep in the wood care to answer that one again he asked i said i dont know the barkeep shouted i serve drinks thats it these drinks harruq asked glancing at some of the bottles lining the shelves he grabbed one at random popped it open and took a swig aaah good stuff then he knocked the entire shelf to the floor the barkeep winced with each shattered bottle pondering the prices he had paid haern grabbed the barkeeps head and forced him to watch the halforc tear his place apart mmmm brandy the halforc said guzzling a bit from a barrel he used his other sword to split the barrel and spill its contents to the floor he did the same for three more sampling each one before destroying it gonna get trashed before all this stuff is gone he laughed booze dripping down his chin do not forget the private stash haern whispered he pointed down below the bar where a few small bottles were hidden harruq marched over as the barkeeps eyes bulged in horror he took one popped the cork and drank woooweee that is good he said he tossed another to haern who flicked it open with his thumb and drank a bit he poured the rest onto the barkeeps head i dont know how much they paid you haern whispered but i doubt it was even half the price of that bottle or that blue one there toss me that harruq thank you he smashed the bottle and smeared the barkeeps face in it go ahead and lick it up someone might as well drink my patience is ended barkeep where are they hiding who paid you thren and his boys the barkeep muttered they gave good gold to lock you in they said they would return tomorrow morning i swear i dont know where they are now haern let him up harruq downed half of another expensive bottle then dropped it to the soaked floor the barkeep glared nothing personal the halforc said the two exited into the night w here to next harruq asked the two stood outside the bar still trying to clean off spider fluids from their clothes and armor we only have a few more hours until morning we will finish before the stars fade haern whispered pulling his hood down tighter and i have no idea arent you the best of leaders the halforc grumbled why am i following you anyway aurrys hurt and you cant find the one who did it aurelia may very well be dead harruq shes not he shouted they halted in the dark alley harruq grabbing haerns shoulders and shoving him against a wall how can you be so heartless never say that never haern smiled when he saw tears forming in the halforcs eyes no she is not dead but it is good to see your rage and sorrow remember why we fight this night now come i may not know where to go but i will find someone who does a small unshaven man stood outside the expansive mansion glancing up and down the barren streets the gray cloak of the spider guild was tied around his neck who is that harruq asked staring around the corner of a nearby building i dont know but he wears the correct colors stay here haern looked up judging the height after a few seconds he nodded seeming pleased then to the halforcs amazement he leapt into the air without even a running start vaulting all the way onto the roof how the abyss did you do that harruq asked haern placed a finger over his lips and pointed to the thief the halforc threw up his arms in surrender figuring some sort of magic involved he leaned back and enjoyed the show haern stalked across the roof his eyes locked on his prey the man most likely waited for word that the watcher was dead and theft could begin without fear of reprisal the mansion certainly had its treasures but he would get no chance at them with the grace of a cat haern leapt again his cloaks trailing behind him he kept his sabers out and ready his slender body descended his cloaks somehow not making a sound despite the air whipping through them haern landed directly behind the thief standing back to back the assassin spun the butts of his sabers smacking skull the thief dropped like a stone harruq helped drag the body into the alley haern propped him up and then reached into a pocket beneath his cloaks he pulled out a small green vial barely larger than his pinkie he popped the cork and splashed a little inside the mans mouth coughing and sputtering he jolted back to life welcome back haern whispered pocketing the vial stay silent or things will have to turn brutal the thief realized who it was and paled you he exclaimed i havent done nothing i swear quiet haern glanced to harruq do you wish to torture him or should i i doubt im as neat as you harruq said think we got the time no please what do you want ill help you the thief cried haern yanked him close his eyes looming out from a deep shadow that surrounded them pierced into the thiefs soul where is thren hiding oh come on you cant go asking me that itll be my head itll be your tongue your fingers and your manhood if you dont haern said now answer me i cant haern placed the edges of his sabers against the mans neck and then slowly moved one downward until it pointed directly at his groin then there will be many other things you cant do wonder what itd be like peeing through three holes harruq said haern faked a thrust and that was all the man could take they moved the headquarters he shouted haern smacked him across the face quieter and calmer where did they move it to the swines pearls he said sounds like a nice place harruq said new to me though just opened last month haern whispered your boss plays a dangerous game little thief run home tell thren im coming and by tonights end he will bleed at my feet haern removed his saber and the thief fled when he turned out of sight the assassin gave chase leaving the surprised harruq standing far behind what are you doing he shouted sprinting after haerns glare silenced any further shouts rounding about a corner the halforc grumbled as he watched haern leap into air grab a jagged brick halfway up a building and then use it to propel himself to the roof how am i supposed to follow you now he asked he ran after the fleeting image of gray cloak upon the rooftops as his only guide they crisscrossed southwest deep into the heart of the city harruq caught glimpses of haern and their thief who did not appear to realize he was followed the halforc ran on until he lost sight of both forget it he said slowing to a walk he gasped for air his many bruises crying out in fresh pain the gash on his forehead trickled blood atop his eyebrows and he wiped it with the back of his hand the hairs on his neck stood he whirled about his swords drawn haern stood there grinning you have gotten better he whispered dont have much choice do i he shot back whats with the running where is the pearls swine place the swines pearls and it is in the northwestern corner of veldaren harruq sighed in surrender alright so why are we here because the new headquarters is not the swines pearls that fool had the audacity to lie to me come our friend has just arrived and we must not let them prepare for our appearance the halforc smashed his swords together he felt his adrenaline surge yet again and he desperately hoped it would be enough it had been a long night after all lets go make them pay for aurry and delysia he said the assassin drew his own sabers and flashed a wicked smile the watcher has come to collect o n the outside the new headquarters for the spider guild looked far from extravagant to the passing eye it appeared to be a small poorly lit store offering vague unsorted items with only the hanging sign of a barrel and smith hammer offering any idea of what services might be appropriated inside the two approached the door from either side with a nod from haern harruq kicked the door open the halforc following haern in a few poor quality weapons lined some racks smithing and fletchery tools covered the others foul smelling barrels of ale filled an entire corner behind a rotted counter was a single unguarded door haern crossed the room silently harruq on the other hand stretched and popped his neck and back without worry for the sound when his part of their impromptu plan arrived he would do as expected except he would do it loud and nasty haern pushed the door open with the side of a saber he put an ear to the crack and listened he heard voices one in particular loud and panicked perfect their thief friend had just arrived the assassin nodded to harruq who cracked his knuckles disgusting habit haern whispered across the room the halforc chuckled lets go already he said spurring the man into action haern kicked the door all the way open and entered as a whirlwind of cutting steel the room was a small welldecorated entryway leading to a larger door their thief was in conversation with two guards blocking the way they never had a chance to move haern buried one saber in the left guards eye the other slicing the right guards stomach spilling intestines to the floor the thief drew his dagger as the two guards fell dead to either side of him you lied to me haern whispered he hit the dagger with a savage combination of chops it flew to the floor you could have lived the thief turned to flee haern felled him before he took a single step he twisted the blades when he pulled them free voices shouted from the other side of the door their quick exchange having alerted those within ready harruq haern shouted before harruq could answer the door swung open and armed guards rushed out they wore little armor and wielded shortswords and clubs outnumbering haern six to one they had little chance the assassin dashed to the left parrying away everything that came near him the guards formed a semicircle blocking any chance to retreat undaunted haern spun whipping his multiple cloaks into a frenzy the gray cloth twirled about hiding the actions of the assassins blades the first guard who tried a thrust watched his severed hand fly to the floor in a great spurt of blood the guards stared unsure of what to do and then harruq barreled into the fight his swords held high the closest two died without a fight another tried to block harruqs doublechop only to have his blade and bones shatter under the magical power of the twin blades haern leapt out of his cloak dance running between two fleeing guards making for the larger door leading further into the complex his curved blades sliced soft flesh when he reached the far side of the room he somersaulted off a wall and landed atop the guard whose hand he had severed a vicious stab ended his life the remaining two wounded by haerns pass threw down their weapons and fled for the street harruq snarled at their cowardice let them go haern shouted thren is the one who must pay the halforc ignored him charging after the fleeing guards he flung condemnation through the air the sword blasted the nearest guard off his feet the blade piercing through his back harruq yanked his sword free as he ran past the final guard grabbed a sword from a rack and faced his attacker haern shook his head such foolish anger had no place in battle focused anger perhaps but never uncontrolled idiocy the halforc still had much to learn the killing was far from done beyond the entryway was a much grander lounge red and blue pillows covered the floor thick red curtains sectioned off parts of the room for privacy on the far side stood guildmaster thren a near perfect image of haern barring the aged look of his hands and his bulkier stature twenty members of the spider guild formed a shield between them it is time to die watcher thren said his voice calm unwavering the honor of thieves must be restored he snapped his fingers in one single mass the twenty charged haern saluted their deaths with one saber and then stunned them all by pulling his hood from his face halt thren shouted by the gods put down your weapons haern chuckled shaking his gold hair loose i have kept my face hidden for a long time he said his voice no longer a whisper but strong and firm i feel it right you know the truth before you die the members of the spider guild halted and glared many more spat and gestured obscenely especially those that had grown up training with the guildmasters long lost son you were to be our savior thren said pulling back his own hood his hair was gold and his eyes an ocean blue every man and woman would have quaked at the sound of your name i am haern watcher of the king men do quake at my name but only those who deal in shadows and death he bowed to his father you have hurt those i love and i will not risk their harm for my sake again look upon my face all of you those who see my face must die may ashhur take pity on your souls before casting you to karaks abyss thren sighed you have been dead to me for seven years nothing has changed those loyal to my name slay this man and receive the highest honor i may bestow i will call you son and my heir to replace he whom you slay haern let his cloaks fall forward hiding his arms and blades the twenty resumed their charge a wave of dagger and muscle the assassin spun a whirling disarray of cloth blade arm and foot those that neared died still they came haern ducked his arm underneath a thrust rotated a hundred and eighty degrees and then slammed his foot into his attackers neck his foot looped around connecting with the chin of another two thieves attempted to flank him timing their strikes in near perfect precision near perfect however was still not enough to draw blood haern halted the spinning of his body and leapt straight up stabs struck his cloaks trailing beneath him as he fell he sliced open one thiefs neck his foot kicked backward after landing crushing the others windpipe gasping for air the man staggered away haern descend upon him his twin sabers ending his suffering seven lay dead at haerns feet but more remained ready to strike the thieves swarmed surrounding him in a ring of biting daggers haern resumed his cloak dance for no other purpose than to buy time a few seconds later harruq arrived having finished with the thief above which one of you shot aurry he roared decking the closest thief before trampling over his body to reach the others was it you he asked lopping off a thiefs arm or was it you condemnation took another mans dagger salvation his throat or were you the coward that particular thief offered no resistance instead turning tail and fleeing harruq was the faster he cut him down picked up his body and threw it at two more haern needed no better distraction he pulled out of his cloak dance and lunged batting away several daggers to slip his sabers in between ribs the remaining guards backed away their numbers advantage gone such a shame my son thren said from the far side of the room he pulled out a small metal object from his pocket you are a beauty to behold a beauty that must be broken beneath my heel he blew on the metal object which emitted a highpitched whistle curtains fell from the sides of the rooms and in came the entire spider guild more than a hundred men dressed in gray cloaks and armor crush them thren shouted to his minions bring forth the time of the thief once more that all you got harruq roared smashing his swords together so sparks flew for several feet in all directions bring em on to me haern shouted harruq obeyed joining his teacher the two put their backs to a corner and faced their attackers any ideas harruq asked just before the multitude hit yes whoever kills more marries aurelia what the first wave hit and freely the blood flowed to the other side haern screamed charging into the throng he spun and whirled with the grace of a dancer his sabers blurry whirls about his body with red specks flicking in all directions he weaved his way through ten leaving a bloody swath in his wake harruq bellowed choosing a strategy more suitable to him he used his greater reach and swung side to side his strength and power massacring any who attempted to block daggers bit into his arms and chest and the blood of him and his foes soaked his armor as the pain of his cuts grew deeper he lowered his head and charged right through a group of twelve bodies flew bones broke and condemnation and salvation drank in the death of others harruq and haern linked up on the other side of the room corpses strewn in their wake still a great many remained although their tactic had changed instead of charging forward they pulled back to the front came several men each armed with throwing daggers how many you got harruq asked nine eleven i have plenty of time they prepared another charge before they could a blue portal ripped open in front of them and out stepped a wizard in yellow robes daggers whirled toward his throat and chest only to ricochet off unable to penetrate the magic enchantment surrounding his skin how rude tarlak said glaring at the crowd those could have hurt electricity crackled across his hands just like you hurt my sister a great bolt of lightning sundered the opposite wall charring the luckless souls caught in its way the thieves rushed the wizard but twin blades halted their attack the two fighters teacher and student formed a shield before tarlak shredding the life from any who neared slowly a wall of the dead built before them tarlak shouted the words of a spell his hands lunged his fingers hooked in dual circles a small ball of flame shot between harruq and haern under the legs of a thief and then hit the ground a great rush of expanding fire filled the room followed by screams the curtains on one wall caught fire billowing red smoke haern swore when he saw it knowing that it would not be long before the entire room was at a loss for air no more fire he shouted to the wizard sure thing wheres your hat they deserve to see the face of their executioner tarlak shrugged the words of another spell on his lips a bolt of lightning leapt from his hands struck a nearby thief and then bounced to the next closest target it continued until seven thieves lay dead on the ground smoke wafting from their mouths and noses haern looked about the room his eyes narrowed as he spotted thren still on the far side a great bow was in his arms look out the assassin shouted lunging for tarlak an arrow flew across the room its aim straight for the wizards heart haern lashed out with his sword but he knew his timing would be too slow the arrow sank deep into flesh but not that of the wizard harruq stood between tarlak and thren his hand clutching the arrow embedded deep in his chest with a shriek of pain he tore it free the poison haern said wont be able to take me down harruq said you humans either cut off my head or rip out my heart he tossed the arrow to the ground his eyes glaring into threns and im guessing that youre the one who shot aurry biting cold air swirled out from tarlaks hands freezing several men into stiff corpses some of the rogues fled while those remaining readied their daggers and tensed in preparation for the onslaught he is mine harruq haern shouted the halforc ignored him he charged the wall of daggers regardless of any wounds he might take their thrusts came in fast and deadly but compared to the speed of his teacher they were nothing harruq parried them away shoved aside one thief butchered another and then continued on to thren who stood alone the guildmaster drew two shortswords from his belt come orc he said i yearn to kill this night then yearn for this harruq shouted slamming down with both his swords o ut of my way haern yelled scattering the remaining few thieves with brutal cuts of his sabers the fire cast a red hue across the room and smoke covered the roof sweat and blood clung to them like honey in the rapidly heating area tarlak slaughtered a few more with a bouncing ball of lightning help him he shouted his back to harruq and thren ill guard your back haern nodded his appreciation and then raced to his pupil harruq and thren were deep in combat slashing and parrying in a dance only the most skilled of blade wielders could create blood ran down the halforcs face and arms fresh blood he was losing thren lashed out twice with his sword pulled back and then feinted with the other harruq fell for the feint salvation swinging wide to block the guildmaster stepped forward his foot snapping out his heel crushed cartilage as it connected with harruqs nose he gasped in pain as blood exploded across his face and neck he collapsed to his knees his vision blurry and his arms limp miserable thren muttered he thrust his sword for harruqs eye haern parried away the fatal thrust giving his father a brutal kick his foot smashed against the left side of his neck the wise old fighter rolled with the blow fell to one knee and then slashed blind haern was already in the air before the swing he landed with both knees on threns shoulders blasting the air from his lungs both sabers curled around his throat you abandoned us thren gasped feeling the sharp edge cutting into his skin now you come to murder us murder your own father i would not have tried killing the watcher if i had known it was you you were a wretched father haern whispered into threns ear and i was not your son i was your assassin nothing more now i am your better he yanked both blades viciously to either side blood flowed thren died the assassin stood his cloaks wrapping about his body in the red haze he pulled his hood back over his head letting the comforting shadow hide all but the blue of his eyesthe eyes that shed tears despite the words he had spoken time to go tarlak said putting a hand on haerns shoulder come on i need help with the big guy ill be fine harruq said staggering to his feet the movements jostled his face and he clutched his shattered nose damn it always my nose tarlak hurried through a spell a blue portal ripped open before him without another word harruq took two shaky steps and vanished through he lied to me haern whispered staring at the body of his father what are you talking about tarlak asked he put his arm around his good friend trying to sound calm as he watched the spreading fire he had created he knew i was his son perhaps for all these years he knew yet he still tried to kill me its all over now tarlak said stepping toward his portal you have a better family now you have us lets go home this smoke is killing me haern nodded he gave one last look at his father face down in a pool of his own drying blood and then followed tarlak home b rug greeted them at the door his face sullen good to see you three alive he said his normally boisterous voice subdued how is aurry harruq asked one hand still clutching his face well get that fixed up and then you can go and see the elf brug replied harruq nodded stepped past him and then collapsed brug caught his chest and held him steady ill be alright harruq mumbled i just need to his words trailed off as his body went limp just follow me brug said bedtime for you you can say hi to your girl tomorrow he nodded to tarlak and haern before helping the halforc up the stairs any wounds on yourself tarlak asked glancing over the assassin none that will not heal in a few days but i could greatly use a drink tarlak beamed that my friend is something i can help you with h arruq awoke sprawled on his chest still dressed he tossed his blanket aside sweat drenched his body his entire head throbbed his nose especially it felt as if someone had rammed a tree branch up one nostril and down the other gradually the previous night came back to him and he lurched to his feet fighting off an initial wave of nausea he staggered downstairs placing both feet firmly on a step before lowering to the next one morning sunshine greeted tarlak who sat at the table on the bottom floor although morning is hardly appropriate considering i just finished lunch slept too long harruq muttered wheres qurrah beats me the wizard shrugged i could spy on him to find out but thats not what i do the halforc nodded rubbing his eyes with one hand the huge fingers paused though when he spotted a large sausage link uneaten on tarlaks plate take it tarlak said im stuffed to the brim harruq wolfed it down even though the chewing ignited pain in his nose hows aurry he asked suddenly remembering her grievous wound his heart shuddered at the look tarlak gave him follow me harruq ill explain on the way the two climbed the stairs to the second floor tarlak talking as they walked shes been unconscious for hours her breath and heart are weak our hope is that she holds on long enough for delysia to heal her cant you find another healer harruq asked the wizard opened the girls door shaking his head as he did thats another thing we need to discuss your little elf has managed to attract some considerable attention he did not elaborate instead beckoning inside both delysia and aurelia lay in their beds tucked underneath several blankets delysia seemed to be only sleeping aurelia however appeared much worse her skin was pale and her hair was dull and lifeless her breath was slow the rise and fall of her chest almost invisible your brother said delysia should awake in a couple more hours as for aurelia well tarlak shrugged his shoulders del managed to get a tiny bit of healing magic into her before she collapsed perhaps it was enough to combat the poison yeah harruq said his eyes lingered on aurelia and in his breast stirred fears he had never felt before he pondered thoughts of her death each one tearing his heart to pieces he walked over slowly as if not to wake her and then knelt beside her bed you wake up soon alright he whispered into her ear he stroked her hair with one hand unaware he was doing so dont do anything dumb like dying on me a surge of fear shook his chest and he wiped away tears hoping tarlak did not see a glance behind revealed him long gone harruq smiled despite his oddities the wizard could read people brilliantly harruq turned back to aurelia and stroked her face he felt almost criminal never before had he touched her and now while she lay helpless he felt the gentle curve of her chin the gradual slope of her nose and the soft brush of her eyelashes finally he pulled his hand away unable to bear the guilt he pressed his forehead against her arm not yet he said i havent told you yet you cant die without me telling you he looked back up overtaken by the beauty of her face he leaned forward without thinking and gently kissed her lips despite the paleness of her skin a trickle of warmth remained and he relished its feel the halforc backed away his throat constricted he left without saying another word g reetings tessanna qurrah said as he climbed into the dilapidated building the girl glanced up from her drawing and smiled hello qurrah care to play a game the halforc eyed the strange lines and circles she had drawn in the dirt what is it he asked find and seek it is a scrying game thats all another time qurrah said sitting opposite of her i come to ask a question sure she sent a hand dancing back and forth ruining the symbols qurrah spotted a fresh set of markings on her arm but said nothing about them can you heal someone qurrah asked tessanna gave him a funny look i kill people qurrah not heal them but can you he asked more forcefully i have learned my spells from my masters and from my experiments yet you control power without ever having had a teacher you are special and we both know it now answer me can you heal someone tessanna crossed her arms and looked away i dont feel like answering you will qurrah said i have no time for games a loved one of my brother is dying why do i care qurrah stood and the whip uncoiled its tip slapping the ground tessanna stared at him showing no hint of fear he is my brother qurrah said if she suffers then he suffers and i will do whatever i can to stop it now answer me tessanna stood anger swirling behind her eyes she drew closer ignoring his threatening glare her arms lunged out grabbing each of his wrists she shoved him against a wall and forced her lips to his for one agonizing second they shared the same breath and all time became a frozen river then the thaw as she pulled back her lips and giggled i think i can qurrah do you want me to because i will ill do what you want qurrah nodded holding in a gasp for air his heart thundered in his chest and he wished it to stop come with me to the eschaton tower help me and i might find you a home i dont want a home she said letting her hair fall before her eyes as she batted them shyly what is it you want he asked you she laughed qurrah felt a stirring throughout his body he did his best to ignore it he offered his hand and she accepted it with a smile follow me he said y ou werent at practice this morning haern said when he found harruq hunched over on a couch itd be dumb of me to practice without a healer ready the halforc countered besides my nose is already broken nothing left for you to do until it gets fixed the assassin took a seat opposite him handing him a mug of ale theres plenty more for me to break i will make up for it tomorrow here this will help with the pain harruq took a few gulps set the cup on his lap and stared into the liquid shes dying isnt she he asked haern drank from his own cup thought for a moment and then nodded yes delysia delayed the poison but did not cure it i know much of poisons and aurelia seems unable to combat the one destroying her she will waste away before our eyes harruq nodded he took another drink i hope youre wrong more than i have ever hoped for anything in my life haern patted the halforcs shoulder dont worry tarlak wont let her die we know people who can help her but someone else has complicated matters the door cracked open and both glanced to the entrance their reactions were of confusion as qurrah walked in a young woman at his side she looked at them with her deep black eyes the sight of her raising the hairs on their necks we must see aurelia qurrah said now whos the girl haern asked rising from the table i will let no stranger near delysia or aurelia in their states im tessanna she said her voice so quiet that both struggled to hear i want to help harruq stood raising an eyebrow qurrah nodded back and his look was all the convincing harruq needed let them go well follow if shes dying we have nothing to lose haern let his cloaks fall forward and his hands rest on the hilts of his blades very well tessanna follow me he led them up the stairs and to aurelia t arlak was kneeling by his sisters bed when they arrived he glanced up his face hiding any surprise upon seeing tessanna a visitor to our tower he asked standing i was not informed i would have swept first she is here to help qurrah said he placed his hands on tessannas shoulders and whispered into her ear she glanced back her eyes afraid qurrah merely nodded and gestured to aurelia very well she said she approached the bed all eyes upon her what is her name tessanna asked aurelia thyne haern whispered tessanna nodded she knelt curling her slender fingers around aurelias wrist her head lowered and long black hair fell across the bed silence filled the room as she meditated there who is she harruq whispered to his brother no different than us qurrah whispered back her life her childhood rivals that of our own but her power he stopped for light had begun to fill the dimly lit room tessannas lips quivered with healing words that felt foreign to her tongue the flesh of her hands shone white gradually growing in power her hair floated in the air as if blown by the softest of winds she arched her head back her face full of pain harruq shot a glance to qurrah but his brothers look ordered him not to move haern drew his blades but a hand from tarlak kept him still a sound like the shattering of a boulder accompanied the great surge of healing magic into aurelias body the elfs chest lurched upward as she cried out in pain tears flowed down tessannas face yet still she kept the magic flowing i cant cure it she cried the light fading from her hands im not strong enough you are qurrah said you are now try a brief flash of anger overwhelmed her shy features then retreated just as quickly fine tessanna said her voice dead you want her saved you want her to live then she will the white light darkened to gray aurelia gasped for air seeming awake although her eyes remained shut a new spell spilled from tessannas lips whose words of power jolted tarlak with recognition no dont he shouted it was too late the girl arched her entire body away from aurelia only her iron grip keeping her from falling a scream of pain came from those beautiful lips the paleness of aurelias skin retreated pulled away like smoke in the wind the death seeped into tessanna filling her veins at last the spell complete she released her grip and collapsed tessanna qurrah cried rushing to her side harruq was not far behind taking aurelias hand and feeling the warmth inside she took the poison into herself tarlak said staring at tessanna with a look of both admiration and horror harruq pick her up we must get her to the priests immediately why can we take her but not aurry the halforc asked i have my reasons now do as i say tarlak shouted no longer was he the kindly wizard the leader of the eschaton stood in that room and he would accept nothing short of perfect obedience harruq knelt down and scooped the thin girl into his arms tarlak stepped away from the others and opened a portal into the heart of veldaren he stepped inside followed by the two halforcs and the dying girl t hey exited in front of an ancient stone temple lined with pillars and carved of rare alabaster stone tarlak leapt up the steps and when a young man dressed in robes moved to stop them the wizard waved his hand completely paralyzing him sorry young priest i have no time he shoved open the doors the others following in his wake inside was grand and open huge columns lined the outer walls and a painted ceiling of magically strengthened glass depicting the seven lessons loomed above them several priests milled about the symbol of the golden mountain across their chests i seek calan high priest of ashhur tarlak shouted a few priests turned to him recognized the yellow robes and rushed off in obedience the two halforcs glanced about the praise to ashhur echoing from every piece of stone unnerving their souls they could not have been more uncomfortable if they had been naked a door opened and out stepped an old man dressed in white a symbol of the golden mountain hanging from a long silver chain around his neck not a single sharp edge existed on his entire face such a round gentle look made it so that when he smiled it was impossible not to warm ones heart to him tarlak eschaton the high priest said his gentle voice disarming i trust there is good reason to interrupt my nap with such rude shouting his beady green eyes stared at tarlak unflinching this girl is dying of poison i need her healed calan glanced behind the mage to see tessanna curled in harruqs arms the high priest nodded place her on the ground halfelf harruq glanced at the man confused and angry do as he says tarlak ordered dont you need a bed tonics potions and such harruq asked gently placing her on the stone the only bed she will need is back at your tower calan knelt down beside tessanna examining her with his eyes what a poor soul such beauty even in a body so frail he bowed his head and laid his hands across tessannas forehead he whispered a prayer to ashhur healing light surrounded his own hands but unlike tessannas its glow was comforting uplifting its shine was deeper its light purer gently it flowed into the young woman banishing the poison in her blood mere seconds later calan stood the magic fading from his hands she will be fine calan said sighing her wounds are many and the worst are in her mind i know this girl tarlak be careful with her qurrah knelt beside tessanna and held her he stared at the high priest with his steeled gaze how do you know of her he asked several of my priests have died because of her calan explained they sought to heal the chaos of her mind a few thought a demon resided in her others in their pride felt their power sufficient to put the pieces back together she killed them tarlak asked the madness they tried to exorcise engulfed them instead the pain they caused her though he shook his head they thought themselves wise she was to be proof of their faith that is why they died but can you heal her qurrah asked tarlak stood back eyeing the two something odd was going on but he didnt know what no i cannot heal her the high priest said why not only ashhur can heal a mind that tortured and broken calan said clearly unwilling to be convinced otherwise the necromancer felt his chest tighten and knew that the priest analyzed him with his stare what is it you see qurrah asked him tread carefully the priest said knowing that all stared at he and qurrah the girl binds herself in darkness because she has never seen the light while you cling to the dark like a babe in fear you walk a path leading to ruinous things do not speak to me of fear qurrah said his voice seething with anger he turned to tarlak may we go this place makes my skin crawl tarlaks look churned his stomach very well qurrah tun you need not express your gratitude for him saving her life qurrah glared but said nothing the wizard bowed to calan removing his hat as he did so many thanks high priest im sure well meet again hopefully not during my naps the priest said returning the bow tarlak opened a portal home and then gestured within the two halforcs entered first tessanna in harruqs arms once they were gone tarlak turned back to the wise old man what do you think of my new recruits he asked calan chuckled careful young friend both their souls are strong do not preach example is all they will believe may ashhur guide your steps tarlak said bowing one final time go with his blessing calan said the wizard reached into his pocket and handed calan several pieces of silver tipping his hat he entered the portal and vanished t hat night qurrah hovered over the sleeping body of tessanna he watched every breath yet never gave a single caress of her skin or hair she slept in delysias bed who had recovered several hours after their return from the temple aurelia remained unconscious but her skin had regained its color and her heartbeat was strong and steady harruq entered the room closing the door quietly behind him how they doing he asked his voice just above a whisper both sleep peacefully qurrah said tessanna did not just take the poison she took the very pain from aurelias body her body is weak though too weak sounds like a certain halforc i know harruq chuckled and hes survived through plenty worse than this harruq stood by aurelias bed and ran a hand across her cheek going to bed he said i suggest you do the same qurrah offered no reply his eyes lingered on tessannas closed eyelids as his brother left when he spoke it was to himself as much as it was to her the hardness of your life is over he whispered you have earned your peace i will give that to you tessanna i promise he pulled the hood of his robe low over his face and left the tower q urrah wandered veldarens empty streets in a trance he had been to the temple of ashhur but there was no aid for him there instead he searched for another temple hidden among the winding streets one to a darker god a hidden god a simple spell guided his path he could feel the pull of dark magic leading him on like a thin thread the closer he approached the luxurious areas of the city the more it throbbed in his temples one house in particular cried out to him in a voice only his mind could hear our faith is stronger our way is truer our destiny is assured order cometh he halted at the black iron gates at first glance the home seemed perfectly normal it was not fancy but well kept its walls were painted a soft white and its roof a dull brown his soul opened and his eyes saw what normal sight could not a new building towered before him several pillars lined the front chiseled of dark marble their sides scrawled with runes that glowed red in the darkness a giant skull of a lion hung above the door carved from the finest obsidian its mouth open and dripping blood let me pass qurrah whispered to the gate his fingers wrapping around the cold metal i will pass i will enter and i will speak with whoever is the strongest the gate creaked open yielding to his touch and his words he slipped inside flinching when it slammed shut behind him in all those years he had grown up in veldaren he had never once visited the temple the doings of the gods meant little to him but there was something the priests of karak might know more of than the priests of ashhur and that was madness he approached the door built of the thick strips of oak and bound together with long straps of iron the monumental portal hummed with magic as his knuckles rapped the smooth front i come seeking knowledge qurrah said to the door i bade thee let me enter for willingly or not i shall pass through the creaking of metal and groaning of wood broke the silence the door swung inward and waiting in greeting was a man dressed in robes a shade lighter than qurrahs a pendant shaped like a lions skull hung from his neck his low hood hid much of his face what knowledge is it you seek the man asked for many turn away at our truth or yearn for false answers to the questions they ask i seek chaos qurrah said and i seek a way to end to it the man nodded come weve been waiting for you t he fall of karaks right hand was known to us from the moment it happened the priest said shutting the great door you speak of velixar qurrah said that was one of his names yes karaks sorrow was great but even as we mourned he gave us hope in visions velixar had an apprentice one who could continue his legacy we were told he would be a living heresy an elf of blood both cursed and pure they passed through an expansive entry room with purple curtains tied above portraits of long dead priests of karak these contrasted with the deep black of the stone making their color all the more vibrant i have the blood of orc and elf in me qurrah said but i have no desire to replace velixar i wish to aid one dear to me and that is all the priest waved his hand as if this were no matter velixar needs no replacing as you will one day see in time you will accept your path for now we will aid in any way we can they reached a set of double doors made of stained wood gold runes marked the outer edge in a language unknown to qurrah the priest grabbed one of the ornate door handles then paused tell me stranger what is your name i am qurrah tun he answered qurrah have you ever bowed in prayer to karak the halforc shook his head i have felt his presence but never have i prayed prayer is naught but begging to a god i do not beg the priest chuckled his dark eyes gleaming we shall see he swung open the doors standing tall was a statue to karak chiseled in stone older than the race of man and sculpted by divine hands twenty feet into the air it towered a handsome man dressed in armor scarred by war long hair fell down past his waist blown by an eternal wind in one hand he held a sword with a serrated edge in the other he held high a clenched fist in this ageless pose he demanded all who looked upon him to tremble before his power twin altars churned violet flame at his feet yet they produced no smoke behold the lion the priest said qurrah gasped his heart weakened and he felt a pull on his chest like never before many bowed before the statue crying out prayers heartfelt and brutal in their honesty the halforcs guide knelt to one knee his eyes diverted as if he were not worthy to look upon its beauty qurrah stared into the statues eyes mesmerized how could this be the god condemned to eternal darkness and fire qurrah knelt there at the door he prayed five words and he wished for no reply aid me in aiding her he prayed he felt compassion encircle him and a confidence fill him there on his knees karak answered in all you do i shall be there do not forget the words of my servant velixar or the desire of all that serve me when he opened his eyes he discovered his vision blurred tears he wiped them away ashamed his guide stood and smiled down at him never forget the power of prayer the priest whispered extending his hand come tell us how we may help qurrah took his hand and stood her name is tessanna he began h e finished his tale in the priests private quarters it was a small room simply furnished with a cot a desk and a small window qurrah sat on the cot facing the priest who leaned back in his chair behind the desk our study into madness is extensive the priest said we feel it a result of the chaos that has engulfed this world to bring about a cure one must study the disease i wish to end the chaos in her mind qurrah said many have failed but they did not seek to understand only bandage it like a wound how will you study such a mind the priest asked leaning his elbows on his desk she will resent all but the most casual observance anything deeper will risk permanent harm i know qurrah said that is why i wish to study others with such madness the priest cradled his head on his palm where will you find so many with madness akin to hers the halforcs eyes hardened i will make them for a long time the priest was quiet he only stared studying qurrah with his gaze it was the second time qurrah had felt that type of stare and it troubled him still few of our brotherhood ever hear this truth the priest said only in absolute emptiness is there order to cleanse chaos much must be sacrificed you seek to kill others do you understand this i do qurrah said then know this life is by its definition chaotic karak fought against all that represents this mortal life we still do ashhur preaches against the nature of man not the nature of life itself his goal is smaller his resolve weaker he seeks to end this chaos by instilling common beliefs inside every mind with hopes of a world of puppets we are above such nonsense let every breath halt in this realm let us end all that celestia has coddled karak led you to tessanna and now to us all is as it was meant to be and now i shall aid you he reached into a cubby and pulled out a frayed collection of paper he flipped through it touching its pages like they were precious things and then pulled out several he deemed useful the priest handed the pages to qurrah as he asked him if he could read i can the halforc said his eyes flicking over the words and these are spells not spells these incantations represent perfect order the chaotic mind tries to adhere to them and cannot and so it shatters there are many kinds of madness with those words you can create them all just make sure you do not hear them yourself do not memorize them for there is risk in even that the priest took out a book bound with black leather archaic runes inscribed with gold across the front in this book are the spells from the most ancient of necromancers its knowledge is inferior only to darakkens spellbook take it know we will do all we can to aid you in the path you walk thank you qurrah said accepting the book he bowed his gifts wrapped tightly in his arms before i go may i know your name i forfeited my name to karak if you must you may know me as pelarak very well pelarak he said i offer my gratitude one day i may return we will await you every dusk qurrah went to the door stopping only when pelarak called out to him yes he asked glancing back a sly smile was on the priests face do not forget to pray he said qurrah nodded i will consider it b ack at the eschaton tower qurrah knelt by tessannas bed and took her cold hand into his your salvation is now a matter of time he whispered to her the love in his voice sounding dangerous and foreign even if a thousand must die you will find peace he slept beside her willing to suffer the hard floor to ensure he was there when she awoke in the other bed aurelia stirred uneasily she had awakened seconds after qurrahs return and with a chilled heart listened to those heartfelt words and wondered w hen harruq forced himself awake to spar with haern he found his teacher standing over him lightly waving a saber above his neck youre dead he said his face cold and dark then it brightened and aurelia is awake she wishes to see you the halforc hurried down the stairs and barged into the girls room sure enough aurelia was awake she was also in the process of changing into cleaner clothes her back was to him her dress spread out across the bed a pair of brown pants lay at her feet and in her arms she held a simple green shirt delysia had loaned to her aurelia heard his entrance glanced over her shoulder and glared you really should learn to knock harruq stammered his face flushed his eyes traced down her long hair her arched back and all the way to her rear when he realized she still glared at him he turned around and faced the door um i thought um sorry its fine he heard aurelia say the halforc shifted his weight uncomfortably as he heard the sound of fabric sliding across skin finally he felt aurelias hand on his shoulder and he turned around she smiled at him life returning to those twinkling eyes you didnt worry about me did you she asked tossing her hair back with her hand we all were if it werent for tessanna you might have well the elf gave him a funny look tessanna harruq gestured to the bed next to hers and then realized the girl was no longer there huh she slept there next to you big black eyes black hair kind of creepy was she there when you woke up the elf nodded her face grew troubled for a moment drawing a frown from the halforc you alright he asked yes im fine she said just a little weak is all and yes i saw her she left with your brother about an hour ago is she a priestess harruq shrugged he stole a glance down the elfs shirt which was too big for her and left quite a bit exposed no shes just forget it i dont know what she is qurrah found her somewhere brought her here and then she took that poison out of you and put it into herself aurelia smiled nice of her now come downstairs with me tarlak wants to talk to us yay everyone seems to want to see me today you tarlak haern but he doesnt count he just wanted to pretend he killed me the elf slipped her arm in between harruqs and looked up at him im still a little weak so help me down the stairs please his heart skipped at least two beats before time resumed normally sure yeah they walked down the stairs aurelia holding his arm and a goofy smile on his face when tarlak saw them the halforc immediately blushed arent you two a cute couple the wizard laughed he took a bite from his plate of eggs and sausage so when can i expect to be a godfather i may be weak but i think i can still muster a polymorph spell aurelia warned tarlak threw his hands up in a gesture of peace of course take a seat let me whip up some breakfast by whip up he meant twirl his fingers so that two plates magically appeared steaming with bacon ham potatoes and eggs harruqs mouth watered at the sight aurelia released her grip on his arm when they reached the bottom floor kissed his cheek and took a seat next to tarlak harruq sat opposite the two and started wolfing down his meal im never good at bad news so ill tell you both straight the wizard bit off a chunk of bacon chewed it twice and then stunned them both aurelia a bounty has been placed on your head harruq nearly gagged i feared as much aurelia said sighing and pushing away her plate who placed it i traced the official bounty back to the quellan elves i wanted to bring you to the priests of ashhur but as good a friend as calan is hes still a priest he would have reported your whereabouts respect for law and nonsense like that as for now i believe your presence here is still unknown harruq coughed gaining the attention of the two excuse me but can one of you fill me in here why do the quellan elves want her dead they dont want her dead tarlak said chomping down on his final piece of bacon the bounty is null if she isnt alive a thousand gold pieces for her capture as for a reason that was interesting most interesting the wizards expression hardened he began quoting the bountys details a thousand gold pieces for the live capture of aurelia thyne responsible for the escape of two murderers of elves and human children he stopped and stared straight into harruqs eyes ive heard many exaggerations and there are times when people die but it is the children that worry me i would like to know what i am dealing with before every bounty hunter in the country comes knocking on our tower door harruq started to reply but aurelia stood leaning against the table on weak arms there was nothing weak about her eyes or her voice when she spoke the battle at woodhaven was just that a battle i fought for my friends harruq and qurrah fought for reasons that will remain unsaid those murders are nothing more than the deaths of elves in combat many died that day but there is no bounty on every soldier that fought for neldar then why the bounty on you he asked his voice equally strong because i helped them escape i am a traitor to elven kind and so they wish me to explain myself and then kill you afterwards aurelia shrugged perhaps i hope not this is horseshit harruq said he smashed his fist against the table stood and flung his plate across the room it smashed against a wall splattering egg they cant take aurry they cant calm yourself tarlak said the only one still seated i am not turning any of you over to some bounty hunter aurelia saved haerns life who is like a brother to me there is much i owe her and keeping her whereabouts secret is a small step i can take toward repayment harruqs breath was heavy and heated through his nostrils as he fought to control his temper then what do we do he asked nothing we have aurelia lay low in the tower going out only in disguise until we do something about that bounty no aurelia said she stood tall and shook her head no that wont work why not tarlak asked because i know who put the bounty on my head the two men glanced at each other and whos that tarlak asked dieredon aurelia said her voice nearing a whisper and he will hunt for me until he knows my whereabouts i will not live my life in hiding dieredon tarlak said rubbing his eyes why did you have to upset that elf dieredon harruq asked wait is he an elf that uses a crazy bow with spikes that would be him tarlak said adding a bit of grandiose to his speech scoutmaster of the quellan elves unbeatable in blade and bow tracker of shadows and master of the silent arrow in the night thank you aurelia for all the wonderful fun you bring to my tower harruq frowned feeling his rage grow his body ached remembering wounds the skilled fighter had given him during their brief skirmish aurelia staggered a little a dizzy spell overcoming her harruq rushed around the table and held her in his arms as she recovered im fine harruq she said pushing him away dont worry and i know why hes looking for me crazy as it sounds hes worried about me probably angry too that is why the bounty is so high and only if i am unharmed if i talk to him the bounty will most likely be dropped so how do we find him tarlak asked that is simple enough said a voice from the stairs the three turned to see haern sitting on the lower steps wrapped in his cloaks his lowered hood exposed his golden hair and fair skin despite her weakness aurelia felt a tingle go through her at the sight of him no disguise the wizard asked no need not in here and you do not need to hunt down dieredon why is that harruq asked haern chuckled i will bring him to us the assassin stood and pulled his hood over his face his voice immediately shrank to a whisper i must ensure the other thief guilds learn from the ruination of the spider guild before i finish i will send word to the elven lands that we stand ready to collect the bounty tarlak scratched his beard clever we dont want her captured and turned in so we just beat everyone to the punch by doing it ourselves sure this is a good idea harruq asked looking to aurelia for an answer the elf nodded do it she said killing bounty hunters gets old after awhile they make it so damn hard to get a good nights sleep the men in the room stared at her with inquisitive looks she winked back to them dont ask they didnt q urrah and tessanna slipped out to the forest long before harruq awoke the halforc carried pelaraks papers with him cradled against his chest tessanna did not ask where they went or why and qurrah did not say they stopped at a stream a fallen tree stretched across it the two sat on one end and listened as the sound of birds filled their ears with a sweetness unfitting either of them qurrah had never learned to appreciate it and tessanna had long forgotten the peacefulness the sound used to impart her i want to show you something qurrah said handing her the papers tessanna glanced over them and shrugged i cannot read she said handing them back they are runic words of power they can drive any living man insane just by hearing their recitation the girl smiled sounds fun too bad ill never try them qurrah nodded his eyes refusing to look at hers i wish to cure you tessanna for everything youve done i can decipher what happened to you i can learn to undo it will you accept this from me the girls eyes flared with pain and her entire body shriveled away from him i just wish to help he said she shook her head pain bleeding out her eyes in the form of tears as i am qurrah cant you be with me as i am cant anyone she stood backing away as if he were a monster people have tried it hurts so badly qurrah my mind is broken glass and all they do is shove the shards together and hope they stick ive killed every one of them i never mean to please please i dont want to kill you this is different qurrah said approaching her even though she cowered away i am no priest i will not beg to a god who shall not listen i will find what broke your mind and i will remove it you deserve this tessanna felt a tree press against her back she glanced about but had no place to go qurrah blocked her path i thought you loved me she cried sliding to the ground as the rough bark tore her skin i thought you were different qurrah knelt and grabbed her hand anger flared and her black eyes widened i am different he said i have suffered as you have if i could undo my childhood i would but no cure exists but death i am beyond salvation you he released her hand you deserve better than i you are beautiful you have life burning inside you it is the least i can do the girl absently touched the black of his robes rubbing the cloth in her fingers you think im beautiful yes i do she stood a visible change sweeping over her her eyes looked into his with strength and fire take me now qurrah felt his heart skip and his nerves flare with fear and lust what why she grabbed the front of his robes and pulled him to her their lips met and for one long moment they kissed it ended when she bit down on his lip tasting his blood across her tongue he forced her back gasping for air you wish to cure me tessanna said a wildness swirling within her eyes you love me i know it but if you love me you must love me as i am now then you may change me but love me now prove it i cant qurrah said rubbing his lip with his fingers and then staring at the blood upon them i dont know ive never he stopped but he had already said too much tessanna laughed as she finished what it was he meant to say never done it before she asked her eyes burned with lust take me or i will take you she pulled him closer once more locking their lips together in a salty bloody kiss qurrah felt his resistance drain away the passion swirled across his tongue throughout his body kindled a virgin flame when she removed the sash of his robe he did not stop her at the foot of that tree he made love to her she was fire underneath him wild roaring fire and never could he have imagined the pleasure of being burned when they finished tessanna cried please help me she whispered into his ear youll kill people wont you for me if i must qurrah whispered back she pulled him close so that her tears wet his hair do it ill help you if you want just promise youll never leave me never the halforc said tessanna stood her bare skin shivering in the autumn air she went to bathe in the stream ive slept with many men she said turning back to him her tears were gone apathy had stolen over her but you were the first ive ever made love to with that she slipped into the water as she bathed qurrah slept the doubts and whispers in his own mind alleviated for one glorious moment fallen angels rejoiced in black song as they watched the promise of death had brought the two peace never before had karaks truth shone so pure and so lovely i n the back of the crowded bar sat a man with three empty tankards in front of him he smoked in the shadows only his eyes and the smoke of his pipe visible a young boy entered the bar glanced around spotted him in the corner and then approached i have a message from melhed sir he said out with it he says the best purse is held in yellow clothes to be bought by tomorrows eve the man blew a ring of smoke and tossed the kid a dull coin through it get on out of here the boy bowed and left so aurelias in the hands of the eschaton he muttered filling the end of the pipe with more blackweed puppets like them shouldnt be allowed such a fine catch if the message was true someone from the elves would come to take aurelia by tomorrow night that left little time to plan an ambush but he was confident his boys could get it done another mug he shouted a serving wench heard his demand and rushed a glass to him fast enough that froth drifted down its sides good girl he said offering her a wink she smiled holding in her shudder until her back was to him the man laughed having seen that same reaction a hundred times before luckily for the wench he was in a good mood he might have killed her otherwise if only to cheer himself up an hour later he paid for his drinks and left c ome in aurelia said as she heard a knock on her door she expected harruq but instead brug entered his face already in full blush i have something for ya he said one of his hands hidden behind the door well lets see it she said leaning up against the pillows of her bed brug stammered a bit sighed and then brought his hand out the elf gasped when she saw what he held it was her staff bearing little resemblance to the original plain stick of wood the whole of it had been tarnished and darkened so it resembled a long thin branch beautifully painted leaves spiraled down the length carved along the sides were spiders frozen in the process of making a web that spanned from leaf to leaf the webs thickened near the top crisscrossing into a dizzying display in brugs hand the staff radiated a soft green highlighting only the leaves and bits of web that touched them brug she gasped its beautiful please let me see it closer he handed the staff to her his blushing reaching ripe tomato color i try to make something for every member we get he stammered ill get ya that pendant but for now will the staff do at first aurelia said nothing too busy running a finger across the smooth webs and sensing the slight aura of magic yes she said yes this will most definitely do she pulled him close and kissed his forehead none of that mushy stuff he said jerking away the red of his face spread to his ears anyway tarlak said to tell ya dieredon is coming sometime tomorrow to claim your beautyuh bounty ill be ready she said grinning thank you for the staff was nothing he mumbled beating a hasty retreat from her room w hen qurrah and tessanna returned the halforc went to find tarlak whats the matter tarlak asked shutting the door to his room behind qurrah i wish tessanna to stay here the halforc said not as a member of the eschaton but merely as a guest the wizard plopped into his chair and leaned back his fingertips drumming the desk a guest we usually dont do that type of thing here but who cares about what we normally do eh can she stay with aurelia and delysia tarlak shrugged i have no objection you will need to ask them oh yeah i finally got that portable hole harruqs been working upstairs the whole day you have a room now instead of a cubbyhole among boxes much appreciated said qurrah and i will ask the girls if they mind her staying if you wish you may take her rent out of my pay nonsense the wizard said emphasizing this with his hand he stood and walked qurrah to the door youre family now you dont charge family rent not the members you like anyway qurrah chuckled very well i will speak to the girls dont go too far tomorrow tarlak said we might need you when dieredon comes i understand the halforc told tessanna the news aurelia and delysia readily agreed to let her stay albeit on a few bedrolls piled between their beds the tower was getting crowded but no one seemed to mind m elhed paced inside his small but luxurious home his frame was scrawny and triangular matching the shape from the top of his head down to his laboriously trimmed black goatee throwing daggers lined his belt oiled and well cared for they wont show the man said his voice sounding like a rat squeaking i knew they wouldnt they drank themselves dumber than mules and now im stuck a knock on his door ended his whining he looked through a peephole to see a mammoth muscled chest covered with blue and black armor about time the spindly man said throwing open his door youre late the floor creaked under the giant weight as the highest paid killer in all of neldar stepped inside shut up melhed im here and that is all that matters wheres your men melhed asked the giant man chuckled it was a deep dangerous sound and he knew he was treading on very thin ice they are warriors of karnryk the giant man shouted they will be here melhed disappeared to get drinks ready karnryk picked at his teeth he was a halforc his human mother raped by an orc karnryk had grown up an outcast his large ears and chubby face earning him names like dogface and the pig his enormous size and strength however had granted him a few perks he had been educated he had been trained nearly every guild in neldar had seen his enormous potential and the halforc had milked training from every single one before abandoning them when their usefulness was at an end now he worked for himself the pay was better and his reputation had spread far and wide you heard about the spider guild karnryk shouted to melhed who was two rooms away someone told me it was no more i assumed they were joking its no joke the halforc said the watcher killed most of them and the rest begged themselves into the other guilds sickening really how so melhed asked returning with huge pitchers full of ale karnryk downed one in two huge gulps they quiver at the name of the watcher he roared they act as if he were a demon or a god it is my name they should fear not his to be fair you approve of what the thief guilds do while the watcher well doesnt melhed sipped at his own much smaller cup if you called a bounty on the heads of all thieves people would cower at the thought of your approach the giant man leaned back in his chair which creaked loudly in protest he wore little armor feeling no need for it a sword the length of an average man hung from his back notched and chipped from many battles scars ran down his face his eyes were an ugly yellow still he was stronger and meaner than a raging bull and such attributes lent him many friends knockknock a voice shouted at the door a group of men barged in all carrying drinks they were armed to the teeth and beneath their ragged street clothes shone glimpses of old chainmail put your ale away the halforc said to melhed theyve already had enough of course karnryk the pitchers of ale vanished to the groans of the small rabble hey im thirsty one in particular said starting after the scrawny man the halforc grabbed him wrenched his arm and slammed his body to the ground the man cried in pain his hand pinned underneath him at an awkward angle shut up all of you the halforc roared this aint the usual crap we go after so i need all of you sharp now spill the beer and listen up we finally get to do what ive always wanted to do whats that asked one sneering at the pinned man the eschaton tower were going to make it ours a cheer rose throughout the men crammed into melheds home dont the watcher live there one man dared ask karnryk grinned at him his eyes filled with anticipation yeah he does and get ready to collect the hidden bounty by tonight every one of us is going to be stinking rich another cheer karnryk didnt bother to say he would claim the bulk of the secret reward offered by the heads of the thief guilds the others would be well off but nothing six months of binging on ale and women wouldnt whittle away to nothing melhed did you figure out a plan the halforc asked its simple but i think it will work melhed replied shut up all of you karnryk shouted the room immediately quieted after a gesture to start melhed explained the plan t hey covered themselves with the morning dew and crunched fallen leaves underneath their bodies while the birds of the forest listened to their moans when their flame burned out tessanna once again bathed in the chilly stream qurrah remained in the grass dabbing a hand in the water qurrah tessanna asked the water up to her neck yes the girl swam away her eyes never leaving him how did you know i could heal the elf the halforc shrugged not wanting to spoil the pleasant morning by thinking i didnt and i did im not sure i can explain that wont do the girl said you knew somehow didnt you now tell me qurrah glared im not lying i dont know how i knew youre different than me though ive practiced necromancy all my life have you tessanna lowered her face below the water so that only her eyes peered out the halforc sighed fine youve been inside my mind you know what i have done what i have learned where did you first gain access to magic the girl dove all the way under turned and then lunged to the surface her long black hair flailing behind her the scattered drops raining down all about i dont remember she said her back to qurrah ive always known nonsense the halforc said what was the first spell you cast i dont know she lied under qurrahs glare she finally swore and told the truth i was four a kitten died when my father stepped on it he said it was an accident i put my hands on it and i healed it you brought it back as undead qurrah corrected no i healed it she insisted my first spell was not necromancy i didnt delve into that until a playful look overtook her face until i had fun with daddy people starting dying around me after that after daddy i hope you arent one of them qurrah joined her in the water then taking her thin body into his arms the girl nuzzled her face into his neck i could stay with you all day he told her then whats stopping you the halforc grinned at her realizing she had asked an excellent question what was stopping him nothing he said tessanna bit into his neck hard yet he only felt pleasure nothing at all w ere walking a long way to go a short trip one of karnryks thugs grumbled you think this necessary from the forest well have free run of the towers backside their leader grumbled if were taking on the watcher we give him as little time to prepare as possible you dont think our rabble would get within half a mile if we stuck to the roads do you the same thug rubbed his arm cut from passing through a line of thick brush and spat i dont know just hate this stupid forest is all well be out soon all of you stay sharp and close wont be too long now the rest numbering ten plus karnryk and melhed shouted their approval that communal roar woke the two lovers from their sleep are you awake qurrah asked his eyes snapping open i hear it the girl whispered into his neck theyre close and theyre many they stood qurrah throwing on his robes tessanna watching him arent you going to dress he asked her she smirked in response dont you think im more intimidating as is the halforc looked up and down her body she was thin she was pale but by the gods she was beautiful youll steal their hearts but only to draw them closer not send them running she laughed i know ill put on clothes if you insist though she donned her short weathered dress tracing her fingers across the stains of blood finished the two slipped through the trees toward the source of the noise i count twelve qurrah said hidden behind a collection of brush farther ahead marched the mercenaries cutting and cursing their way through the forest toward the eschaton tower whos the big one tessanna asked licking her lips when she caught qurrah watching she laughed im not interested in that at least not while hes alive she laughed again qurrah wasnt sure if she was joking or not and that alone disturbed him they move for our tower the halforc said for what reason though tessanna shrugged you need subjects for your scrolls right well i see plenty ill leave you one breathing with that she stripped off her dress and left their cover fully exposed she shouted to the group whats the hurry the men turned their eyes bulging at the sight of tessanna approaching her black hair falling down either side of her face covering her shoulders and the sides of her breasts the morning was cold and her body showed it her face held no expression for the being of apathy had come over her what in karaks name is going on karnryk growled all around him his thugs glanced at each other each one looking for the courage to go to her despite what their halforc boss might say a nymph of the forest perhaps melhed offered i have heard rumors of such beauty but ive never seen one we can share her cant we karnryk asked one several others echoed similar sentiments hold it he shouted putting his arms out to stop them something aint right boys cant you feel it they could feel something but it felt right to them look upon me tessanna called caressing her body with her hands as she walked enjoy my beauty many already have karnryk felt a tug to go to her but the warrior in him shrieked in protest a cool wind blew from her direction even though the air had been still all morning the forest darkened with her steps as if clouds formed a permanent cover above her head and her eyes when she looked upon him with those huge black orbs he felt naked helpless and doomed to die get your weapons ready boys this girls no prize are you mad said one thug you want us to hurt a thing like that i want you to he stopped for tessanna had begun to change the shadows around her darkened cold air tossed her hair in all directions a creeping mist seeped out from her hiding her features step after step the transformation continued until she appeared a dark goddess walking the land of dezrel her eyes were the darkest of all tunnels to the abyss leering out at the living i am alive she said her voice the shriek of a banshee beautiful and deadly i am the angel i am the nightmare i have come black tentacles shot from her outstretched fingers curling around trees slicing through bushes and low branches and then piercing into the flesh of the nearest thug he screamed until two tentacles ripped out his tongue black lightning swirled around his body the tentacles finally drew back leaving a bloody pile of flesh karnryk drew his sword fear palpable on his face if you value your lives she needs to die he ordered the others drew their daggers and swords doing their best to ignore the carnage that had been their comrade come to the angel tessanna beckoned tentacles flared out her shoulders and swirled into great black wings that stretched higher than the trees power flared through her and the courage of all men who looked upon her melted like ice before the sun if the display had lasted a bit longer they would have fled never to return tessannas power however was not as absolute as she made it seem the black wings dissipated the tentacles faded as if they never were and in one great silent implosion the darkness returned to her body now only a beautiful naked girl tessanna fell to her knees gasping for breath damn poison she whispered sensing traces still lingering in her veins kill her karnryk ordered they charged bolstered by her collapse then qurrah stepped out from behind the brush let loose a crack of his fiery whip i will drive mad any who dare touch her he shouted ignoring the horrid pain in his throat too late karnryk bellowed not slowing in the least the rest of his thugs were not far behind he saw qurrah cast a spell so he raised his sword in defense the bones of the dead body animated and assaulted the group from behind men screamed and fell bones cracking their spines necks and heads a pelvic bone smacked karnryk hard in the back he stumbled to the ground in a great explosion of leaves and dirt kill him he shouted struggling back to his feet kill him quickly the first to approach tripped his feet tangled and his pants aflame two more lunged but qurrah knelt beside tessanna and cast a spell a single impenetrable wave of darkness rolled forth rising higher than their heads they flew back pushed on by the wave karnryk jammed his sword into the dirt and braced himself the magic slammed into his body like raging floodwaters he felt his flesh peel away yet he held his ground when the wave passed only he remained standing impressive he said spitting blood but it will take more than a few spells to kill me i do not seek to kill you qurrah said snapping his whip as i said i will drive you mad he is mine tessanna said rising from her knees the others you can do with as you wish but i want him alive qurrah nodded trusting her many of the thugs were getting to their feet only dazed by his spell very well he turned to karnryk my pity to you the necromancer walked around the powerful warrior giving him a safe distance considering the length of his twohanded sword karnryk let him go only concerned with the dark angel do you want me she asked displaying her body the halforc spat in response too skinny a man like me would crush you tessanna giggled im tougher than i look really i am the halforc roared yanking his blade out of the dirt and charging he swung with all his might attempting to behead tessanna where she stood in response she whispered words of magic and raised her hand the sword smashed against her fingers and stopped as if striking a mountain the impact nearly shattered karnryks hands and elbows she reached out and ran a hand across his chest karnryk pulled back his sword and struck this time at her scrawny waist again he smacked against stone my sword is enchanted he said the pain in his arms unbearable why do you not die in response tessanna flattened her hand against his skin and lowered it to his groin he tensed exhilarated and terrified theres only one sword i want she cooed ill tell you if you want to know she groped and pressed he held her with one hand and pressed his sword against her neck with the other stop it he snarled dont you want to know she asked ill whisper it to you she leaned forward unafraid of the blade at her exposed throat the halforc felt his heart skip as her hair and lips brushed the side of his face are you sure you want to know she whispered into his ear yes he gasped as she resumed the motions of her hand bleed she whispered the black magic poured into him the pain he felt was indescribable an overwhelming sensation so great his mind immediately shut down in defense he fell unconscious a giant red smear across the crotch of his pants i hope youll keep my secret she giggled licking the blood off her fingers l et go screamed the man as qurrahs flaming leather whip wrapped around his ankle he hacked at it with his sword showering sparks and ash but causing no damage the smell of burning flesh filled his nostrils and his screams grew all the louder you will die like the others qurrah said releasing the leg the thug charged howling like a mad beast eager to test out a new spell the halforc whispered words of power and outstretched his hand a gray swirling funnel like a tornado turned on its side shrieked out from his palm flesh cracked and died as the rolling magic swarmed over him the man inhaled to scream but the tornado swirled down his throat shriveling his lungs and denying him his final death cry the body fell looking like a freshly unearthed corpse a dagger sliced through the air only its clear whistle giving qurrah warning he cried out in anger as the blade cut across his cheek he dropped to the ground as two more flew above his head he sought out and found his attacker melhed hiding behind a tree if blood is what you want the halforc said then i will gladly grant it he wiped his face smearing blood across his palm dark magic hardened it into a small stone it vibrated in his hand filled with power the next time melhed threw a dagger qurrah released his own projectile a blink of his eyes and then melhed felt the impact the ball shattered swarming him in a tremendous explosion of blood its stickiness wrapped around his face his arms and his legs he collapsed gasping for air the blood thickened pulsing as if still encapsulated in veins struggle as he might the ropelike substance held firm comparatively melheds dagger had far less effect it bit into qurrahs shoulder a deep wound that would take time to heal qurrah had time melhed did not you struck me twice the halforc said i shall save you for last last would not be long for only three men remained facing the necromancer and all three were wounded do any of you dare strike against me he asked snapping his whip to the ground the men formed a triangle eyeing him fearfully get him one shouted his dagger thrusting at the halforcs back the other two remained cowardly at heart and did not charge with him qurrah spun shoving his hand forward with his fingers hooked in a bizarre way nightmare he hissed in the tongue of magic the thrust faltered all strength pulled out of it qurrah batted it aside with his free hand and then gripped the mans face with an open palm the man stared with wide unblinking eyes as qurrah forced him to his knees from his mouth came screams of sheer terror do you wish this mans fate qurrah asked the other two shoving the shrieking man to the dirt as if he were a pitiful child the things he sees are beyond description stay and you may share them youll kill us if we turn to run one said glancing to his partner for support thats right qurrah laughed wrapping his whip about his arm beside him the shrieking man gagged and shivered as his heart gave out still if i were you id be running all light surrounding his fingers sucked in and vanished leaving two voids where his hands should have been black lightning crackled between them its thunder that of a wailing eagle where qurrahs eyes had been were now doorways to the abyss seething with the cold promise of death the men dropped their swords and ran they died like cowards lightning bursting their hearts in their chests qurrah turned to see tessanna approach she remained nude her dress in hand they are all dead she said a wonderful smile on her face the smile did not flinch even when she yanked the dagger out of qurrahs shoulder i left one alive qurrah said grunting as pain flooded him tessanna kissed his cheek her pale hands gently pressed against the wound healing magic sank into him ceasing the blood flow satisfied qurrah pulled out a few pieces of parchment from a large pocket within his robes stay back he said you must not hear the words i say but i want to see she pouted when i am done you may see the results he offered she sighed but consented he ran a hand through her hair admiring the perfection of her body then went to melhed who was still bound by the blood curse what do you want with me the scrawny man asked his voice just below hysteria i have money lots of it its in my house let me get it for you where is your house cretin qurrah asked yanking the mans hair so that they stared eye to eye its in southwestern veldaren he said fourth down copper lane what does it look like qurrah took out his whip and draped it across the mans neck chest and abdomen small brown thick cedar my name is etched above the door please i have gold in there you can take it all of it just let me live the halforc pulled back his whip it vanished underneath the arm of his cloak thank you kind sir melhed said thinking his life spared i have no quarrel with you i was paid by karnryk yes paid thats all i never said you could live qurrah said his voice vile he unrolled the parchment to the horror of the bound man no no spells please no anything please use my daggers these are not spells he said he pulled out two globs of wax and shoved them into his ears they are far worse his voice was distant and muffled he hoped it would be enough the man screamed when he recited the first line of words written across the page he thought qurrah was about to explode his head or turn him into some pitiful creature the words however had a hypnotic affect he quieted listening intently qurrah continued to him he had read only seven lines but to melhed nearly a lifetime seemed to have passed his eyes grew distant his mouth slackened but still he listened deep in concentration when qurrah reached the end of the passage he stopped feeling dizzy and weak melheds reaction was far worse nooo he shrieked writhing against his bonds noooo speak speak qurrah did not know but to melhed the silence was more than deafening his entire mind had ridden the magical words like a man caught in a stream with the end of the water though he found passage upstream impossible tessanna arrived as he pulled the wax from his ears it looks as if he yearns for something she said staring at melheds fanatical eyes i do not know what qurrah admitted but this is nothing like you he has no control his entire mind is shattered the girl nodded laughing at the way the man flopped around are you going to leave him here she asked there are more than twohundred passages i must test he and the passage he represents is incorrect i have no use for him you poor baby tessanna cooed kneeling down beside the shrieking man she put a hand across his head holding him steady she put the rest of her weight on his chest she kissed him plunging her tongue deep down his throat she purred as the stink of madness filled her nostrils before she ended her kiss she grabbed his tongue in her teeth and bit down the tender flesh tore and the mans screams down her throat were waves of pleasure the taste of blood filled her and she reveled in pure sexual delight she stood flashing qurrah a smile he will choke soon she told the stunned halforc that or he will swallow his own tongue want to stay and watch no qurrah said holding in his shudder aww she said her lower lip pouting she put her dress back on flipped her hair over one shoulder and then slowly licked the blood from her lips no fun she told him no fun at all i hope your brother and that girl of his return soon tarlak said pacing back and forth in the main floor of the tower if dieredon decides to grab aurelia and run things could get nasty qurrah will show if he wants not much else we can do harruq said i could scry for his location aurelia said sitting on the stairs her staff on her lap but id rather save my strength for more important things like making sure you all stay alive your concern for our safety is touching the wizard said especially since were doing this for you oh please youd hate not seeing my cute butt again and you know it tarlak shrugged so you all are idiots brug mumbled munching on a thick chicken leg smeared with sauce he comes in aurelia wiggles her ass and then he leaves everyone happy since when are things gonna get crazy aurelia winked at him its me things tend to go that way when im around ill agree to that harruq said just try to keep the damage to a minimum delysia said coming down the stairs in her spotless white robes im still a little weak so if you can do with some bandages then you will the door to the tower swung open revealing haern his face hidden by his hood dieredon circles above he whispered fun time harruq said drawing his swords put those away aurelia ordered glaring at the dark blades wait until you absolutely must the halforc frowned but obeyed tarlak slapped his back before taking command look sharp and smart everybody youre eschatons you have a reputation to uphold here mainly mine dont blow it oh yes great and wise leader brug said dropping his chicken and grabbing his punch daggers your speech of inspiration reveals a silver tongue indeed shut up shorty the two were still bickering when they exited the tower d ieredon remained high in the air as he looped around the tower his bow still slung across his back there was no reason to expect trouble but he kept it loose just in case with a couple soft commands he landed his winged horse sonowin a safe distance away stay safe he whispered patting her side things get interesting take off understand the white horse snorted showing her opinion of fleeing fine dieredon laughed then trample whoever you wish he slapped her rump before approaching the tower an interesting crowd awaited him a yellowrobed wizard stood at the front beaming at the elf beside him was a priestess of ashhur her hair the same shade of red as the wizards to the side lurked a short warrior his beard covered with red sauce a man garbed in cloaks guarded the other flank the subtle placement of the mans feet and his sheer intensity in watching dieredons every move identified him as the watcher rumored to live at the eschaton tower dieredon marked him as the primary threat behind them he saw the bounty he had come to collect aurelia thyne standing next to her he halted the grip on his bow tightening hail dieredon scoutmaster of the quellan elves the wizard said i am tarlak eschaton leader of the eschaton mercenaries i welcome you to my tower you have puzzled us all lady thyne dieredon said in elvish ignoring the wizard you train with a murderer flee with him from battle and now accompany this wretch into the city of the humans and who would this murderer be tarlak asked in fluent elvish the scoutmaster glanced over his opinion of the man rising harruq tun traitor to the city of woodhaven the halforc heard his name his hands tightened on the hilts of his blades things were not going smoothly he didnt need to understand elvish to understand that murderer or not he is none of your concern tarlak said glancing at the halforc no bounty is upon his head at least none i am aware of answer my question lady thyne dieredon asked switching to the human tongue why did you betray us he killed elves aurelia how do you stay by his side aurelia slipped to the front of the group ignoring tarlaks attempts to hold her back he is a good man she said staring down dieredon the one who ordered him is dead he is free of his oath besides the actions he committed were in battle we all killed men that day i know his puppet master is dead i killed him myself come with me aurelia you will be tried for treason in quellassar for aiding the escape of a murderer nonsense aurelia said even if he was a traitor to woodhaven the town does not fall under elven rule i am staying i ask you as a friend to rescind this pointless bounty dieredon glanced about the mercenaries that halforc is a murderer he said to them daring each to meet his gaze but he didnt just kill elves he killed children you have invited the forest butcher into your home he glared at harruq when he spoke nearly spitting out the words you dont know that aurelia insisted enough of this harruq said drawing his blades he shoved past tarlak pulled aurelia back and stood between her and the scoutmaster shes not going with you elf and thats final so hop on your flying horsie and get out of here and call off this dumb bounty after you do the bow was off his back before any could move blades shot out the front top and bottom as a cold expression fell over dieredons face twelve children he said his voice almost a whisper twelve harruq remembered the last words a child had spoken to him just before he had ended his life youre an orc arent you the guilt sent him charging his blades lashing out dieredon ducked into a crouch the two swords cut air he flipped backward one foot cracking the bottom of harruqs chin as he staggered the elf lunged the bottom blade of his bow leading harruq jerked his head at the last second the bow slicing a gash across his cheek instead of ramming out the back of his head blood poured down the side of his face further igniting his rage he batted the bow to one side thrusting with his other sword only to have the bow swing around and parry the attack away twice dieredon slapped harruqs face with the flat ends of his blades stinging his pride the halforc lunged every nerve in his body on edge he had seen the speed of haern the assassin had trained him rigorously yet still he felt as he had that very first day clearly outmatched his next few attacks the elf blocked with ease and then he found himself on the receiving end of a brutal series of thrusts he dodged side to side his desperate blocks barely connecting hes going to kill him tarlak said preparing a spell haern shoved his hand over the wizards mouth halting any casting tarlak glanced at the assassin and raised an eyebrow dieredon does not aim to kill haern whispered something more is at stake it is not for us to intervene if he is too wounded you must stop them delysia said i will surrender before it comes to that aurelia said her staff clutched tightly between her fingers as she watched harruq hammered repeatedly in the face by kicks i thought you were a warrior dieredon shouted countering a thrust with a stab that cut through harruqs enchanted leather and into skin he pulled back drawing only a small amount of blood and then blocked a dual chop by the halforc i thought you skilled how many elves fell to you did you stab them in the back i killed them in combat harruq snarled shoving hard against the elfs bladed bow they fought me face to face and lost how many have you killed thousands the elf said matching the halforcs strength orcs goblins humans hyenamen even elves he tilted the bow hooking the two swords on the razors along the front and then shoved to one side harruqs blades and arms went with it exposing his entire left side to a series of kicks why does aurelia stay with you he asked spinning back and away what spell has convinced her good is in your heart you would never understand harruq said clutching his side as best he could without dropping his sword and neither will i the blades snapped in and a bowstring materialized from thin air dieredon readied an arrow before the halforc could move then why is it you stay with her he asked why do you fight for her i dont know he shouted he stayed where he stood knowing the slightest movement would send the arrow flying then why should i not kill you dieredon shouted back why should i not bury this arrow in your eye enough of this aurelia yelled please i will go no harruq roared charging the elf the arrow flew through the air its aim true aurelia screamed as the arrow pierced into the halforcs flesh harruq bellowed out his pain the arrow deep in his shoulder he neared dieredon who remained completely still when harruq swung the elf darted inward grabbed his wrist and flung him over his shoulder the blades snapped out of his bow and down came the spike halting just above the halforcs throat why is it you should live dieredon shouted because i love her harruq screamed his voice echoing across the land all was silent as dieredon kept the blade hovering how can you love her he whispered do you even know what love is she was kind to me he said gasping from the pain of his many wounds when i didnt deserve it she was still kind to me his voice dropped quieter and i hurt her and still i was forgiven i owe her everything dieredon pulled back the blades which vanished into his bow he knelt down and whispered to the halforc if you ever ever hurt her again you will answer to me and i will kill you i know harruq whispered back dieredon left him laying there and approached aurelia he slung the bow over his back and opened his arms the two embraced aurelia staring past him at the beaten bleeding harruq i still dont trust him he said to her in elvish i do she said is that not enough dieredon pulled back and smiled i guess it is for now he said ill tell felewen you are well she might even visit she misses you so aurelia smiled tell her that would be nice the elf looked to tarlak and gave him a nod i will rescind the bounty will you release them from your capture release tarlak laughed theyve become part of the family youre more than welcome to join i know a few dragons we could slay with your help i must decline the elf said cracking a smile dragons scare me dieredon hugged aurelia once more and then trotted back to sonowin halting beside harruq on the way she loves you as well he said only celestia knows why but she does the halforc offered no response the rest of the eschaton mercenaries watched until he mounted sonowin and took flight dang that guys good brug muttered once he was gone aurelia rushed to harruq who started to apologize she ignored him wrapped her arms around his bruised neck and kissed him the stunned halforc dropped his swords and held her close when the kiss ended she smiled at him you stupid halforc she said got yourself beat up for silly little me anytime he said blushing through the bruises brug rolled his eyes at the display and returned to his meal tarlak followed pretending to throw up delysia and haern moved to harruqs side both their expressions somber go to my room harruq delysia said looks like my healing magic is going to be needed after all yeah he said glancing down at the arrow thats gonna hurt when you remove it isnt it of course ill be waiting with a flip of her red hair she returned to the tower harruq grinned at haern unsure of what his teacher would say you need a lot more practice the assassin whispered not even a single hit when i fought him my first time i scored two cuts youve fought him before harruq asked trying to imagine the two in battle haern only shook his head and left come on big lug aurelia said smacking him playfully lets get you healed so i can snuggle you without getting blood all over me as you wish he said seeing no reason to argue i f karnryk lay perfectly still the pain only throbbed if he kept his breaths shallow enough the throbs weakened to dull aching if he moved the dull ache exploded into a thousand piercing daggers melhed he groaned no louder than a whisper melhed the wave of pain this caused nearly rendered him unconsciousness but he was karnryk the slayer never before had pain bested him and he would not let it do so now he stared at the light streaming through the forest canopy wondering how much time had passed the girl and the necromancer were gone the only sound he heard was a constant sobbing to his right broken by the occasional shriek a third time he called out and still he received no answer that whore he thought trying not to visualize the damage to his lower half hits me like a coward and leaves me for dead ill kill her ill eat her beating heart anger gave him strength to move he lifted his head ignoring the cry of protest from the waist down the pain was so great his mind could not focus where it came from his legs felt broken his thighs throbbed as if stabbed and his feet were all but numb where she struck him however was beyond pain melhed whatd she do to you he asked propping himself up on his elbows he could see his friend lying there rolling back and forth as he sobbed the halforc waited gathering strength for the agony he knew to come taking a deep breath he lifted to a crouch the movement was salt on an open wound agony assaulted his mind stubbornness alone kept his legs moving he roared throwing away rational thought and pushing upward slowly horrifically until he stood screaming at the top of his lungs when his mind was back under control he inspected his injured self it looked as if he had wet himself except with blood instead of urine he sensed in a way that was exactly what had happened youll pay he muttered taking one small painful step toward melhed dead bodies littered the forest floor his friends his pride and even his manhood were now reduced to a single ally sobbing incoherently in the leaves he often dealt in retribution but never before had he felt hatred as stark and naked as when he took another step his stomach churned as he felt a bit more blood slide down his leg warm and fresh long and brutal he said very long and very brutal as he neared melhed he knew something was wrong his skin was pale his arms and legs bound and blood covered his mouth his sobbing turned to a strange sucking sound one that turned karnryks already weak stomach its me karn he said hoping against hope look at me i said look at me the sucking sound grew louder louder and then melhed began choking karnryk watched his entire heart and soul numbed the wiry man gasped and rolled to his side gagging and retching silently after thirty seconds of this he managed to spit out something wet and red it was a large portion of melheds tongue im sorry mel the halforc said kneeling beside the man who gasped in air he took a throwing dagger from his belt gripped it in his fist and said goodbye to his friend down went the dagger through his eye and into the shattered remnants of what had been a mind karnryk screamed out his rage another reason for vengeance he started heading south step by agonizing step if he reached the end of the forest veldaren would only be a mile or so east the distance while not far felt like a thousand leagues to karnryk the first few hours he took childlike steps using a ricocheting path from tree to tree to give him support eventually he collapsed against a sturdy trunk and slept when he awoke stars filled the sky he took to his feet with no greater ease than the first time the hours crawled by broken only by brief moments of sleep or unconsciousness his heart cried out for him to fall to succumb to the pain hunger weakness thirst but mostly the pain his desire for vengeance was stronger than all of them he pushed on it was well into midday before he reached the city gates he said only one word to the gate guards before he fell healer s uch horrible taste tessanna said frowning at the ornate furniture designed to look worth far more than the craftsmanship warranted her grimace grew when she saw the curtains the worst shade of orange she had ever seen without a word she yanked them down and tossed them to the floor there are many houses nearby qurrah said glancing out a tiny window each one a potential for a prying eye why would you fear prying eyes the girl asked sneering at him because you drove the former owner insane and left him for dead in the forest screaming like a mad little puppy the halforc frowned there is that as well any screams shall be heard possibly by many we cannot live here tessanna crossed the room giving him a flirty look im sure some screams can be heard from inside without causing too much alarm she said what is it that you plan on doing in here just casting a few spells qurrah said nothing to concern yourself about nothing you do could concern me said tessanna curling her arms around his neck and looking at him with the wild eyes of an animal the halforc pulled her down onto the couch locking her in a violent kiss later as they lay silent in each others arms tessanna whispered into her lovers ear there is a home where there are no neighbors no one for miles where qurrah asked tracing a finger from her belly button to her chin in the kings forest not too far from the tower the halforc sat up on the cushion and looked down at her you speak of your home as a child few know it is there she said her voice shy any we bring will be miles from help the screaming will not bother anyone i can cut myself again too there is a stream nearby i used to watch the blood drip into the water i miss it you ask me to leave my brother qurrah said staring at the wall he can come if he wishes no not for this tessanna sat up and leaned against the opposite side of the couch all sense of warmth fled from her you fear he will not agree i fear he will overreact nothing more the halforc said besides i could not separate him now from who from her tessanna nodded her eyes cold and lifeless the elf yes the elf he is happy with her i would give anything for him so now i must give him this weve never been separate not since we were seven she bit her lip and huddled against the cushion youre doing this for me arent you qurrah brought his eyes from the wall to her he nodded yes i think i am tessanna just nodded back our home will not be far if you wish to see him you can we will find men and bring them there there are ways i know how do you wish to take me again the halforc looked at her thin pale body curled into a tight ball of arms and legs yes he said yes i do he pulled her over to him and again they made cold determined love y ou cant leave harruq said blocking qurrahs way to the door you just got here pay is good beds are warm and youve seen the food this is something i must do qurrah said his arms crossed at his feet were all his belongings in the world a few spare coins the spellbook and scrolls from the priests of karak some bed sheets and his enchanted whip all packed in one large rucksack why what must you do and why the abyss is she going tessanna cowered behind the necromancer currently in one of her shy fearful moods qurrah saw her so and his heart was instantly angry she is going because i wish her to go he said we do not belong here our magic our ways are limited by these walls freely we entered and now freely we leave move aside harruq shook his head shoving his arms harder against the doorframe so that his knuckles turned white no no and um no harruq qurrah shouted loud enough to send pain spiking down his throat listen to me we are brothers and long you have looked out for me but i do not need your guardianship not anymore you are a fine warrior and i am proud of you now let me go please harruqs eyes danced back and forth from tessanna to qurrah trying to make sense of the conflicting emotions of his heart i dont want you to he said at last do you have to really have to qurrah pulled the rucksack over his shoulder i must i will return as often as i can the halforc moved aside qurrah took up his things nodded to tessanna and then moved for the door where will you live harruq asked not far please honor this wish brother do not look for us i will be fine i assure you if i am ever gone longer than two months you may have the elf scry for our location nodding the burly halforc motioned for the door qurrah patted him on the shoulder he opened his mouth to speak but found no words only a soft trickle of blood down the back of his throat he turned and hurried down the stairs subtly pressing the sides of his hood against his face on the way tessanna paused before poor confused harruq pitying his turmoil she was still a stranger to him and in a few fleeting days she had come and stolen away his only brother harruq she said her eyes locked on his toes i justi want to thank you she kissed his cheek blushed and then fled down the stairs the halforc stood there long after they left hating and loving his brother and his girl with the deep black eyes t arlak waited for them at the bottom his arms crossed and his foot steadily tapping the floor going somewhere he asked we are leaving the eschaton qurrah said we have a new home and wish to move on the wizard nodded his expression dire good then i have just one thing to say to you he strode over to qurrah reached into his pocket and then pulled out a small silver scorpion it was exquisitely carved and dangled from a chain of gold he handed it to qurrah who held it close to his face and opened his mouth in wonder you will always be an eschaton and so i give you a parting gift it is a token representing your ties to us brug spent many hours working on that one and im not sure what all it does tell it to awake qurrah glanced at the wizard his confusion apparent awake not ask order it the halforc shrugged he held the medallion higher impressed with the lifelike detail and size the pinchers were sharp and the tail curled and ready to strike awake he told it his voice firm at once color flooded the silver it crawled about to face its master snapping its claws repeatedly many wizards have a familiar tarlak said smiling at the scorpion brug decided you should have one as well you wont have many of the same connections that most mages do but i do know you wont end up in a coma for a week if this little guy gets squashed qurrah brought his hand back and clicked with his tongue the scorpion crawled onto his shoulder and nestled down into the black cloth it is a fine gift the halforc said far better than i deserve you saved my sister tarlak said it is far less than what you deserve but take it as an effort to thank you just the same qurrah shifted the rucksack to his other shoulder we will return occasionally make sure my brother is well each time i do other than a few bruises and broken bones from haern he should be just fine tarlak bowed and qurrah returned it tessanna joined his side stroking the scorpion pretty she said and creepy i love it her laughter still echoed when they shut the door and left the tower h arruq was miserable the rest of the day not brightening up even when presented with another bountiful feast for dinner he picked at the food and then pushed the plate away he left without a word someone needs to cheer that guy up tarlak said shoving pieces of chicken into his mouth he will be alright aurelia said give him time ill set him straight tomorrow if he isnt haern said smiling his hood was nowhere in sight and his smile a bright sun to the somber table t he stars shine well this night aurelia said approaching the lone halforc they were a mile south of the tower the eschaton tower and its surrounding forest were far away only hills and stars blessed their eyes they do so to light your way and the way of your brother dont feel like talking aurry harruq said his back was to her hunched over and his head low his eyes looked to the ground as much as they looked to the sky i know she said sitting beside him in the grass do you know why he left its because he must harruq you two are brothers closer than most humans and elves ever become to their kin but you are not the same you cannot walk the same path forever harruq remained silent absently picking at the grass its normal to miss him she continued please dont dwell upon it though you have friends here and your brother is not alone he has her he said and you have me aurelia said her fingers touched his chin turning his face to hers did you mean what you said earlier harruq met her gaze a bit of anger flaring into his eyes but then he pulled away and looked to his feet yeah i did the elf slid closer and wrapped her arms around him her head rested on his shoulder she felt his muscles stiffen and she sensed the instinctive discomfort it caused him dont look at your feet dummy the stars are far prettier he chuckled mumbling some sort of protest he looked to the stars long moments passed quiet and warm as they gazed at the beacons of white locked into the black painting above finally aurelia stood brushing off grass from her dress she pulled a silver ring off her right hand and held it out to him take this whats it for he asked accepting it the silver twinkled in the starlight such a beautiful token seemed out of place on his rough dirty hands one day youll understand she said she knelt and kissed his forehead all you give me i will return she whispered anything and everything with those words she left him to his thoughts he twirled the silver ring mesmerized by the reflection when he returned to the tower he placed the ring underneath his pillow and did his best not to look at the vacant bed beside him a strange sickness claimed the trees as they neared the clearing miles from any established path grass lay curled and limp its color a dull brown the sunlight brought no cheer for it shone through dead branches in the center dilapidated and weatherworn was the former home of tessanna delone it was a small cottage overrun with brown vines with a single door flat roof and clogged chimney pretty isnt it tessanna said her voice was sullen and inward daddy said the land died at my birth she approached the front door qurrah at her side the grass crumpled weakly under their feet when she yanked open the door the dull noises of the forest silenced altogether qurrah was familiar with death he could sense its approach harness its power and touch the cold trail that lingered long after its passing corpses meant nothing to him he should have handled seeing what he saw he didnt his breakfast rushed up his throat and he lurched to one side doubling over and vomiting hi daddy tessanna said did you miss me tied to a chair hunched the remains of tessannas father his shriveled hands were bound behind him the ropes had loosened over time as the flesh underneath shriveled and decayed the house had been his tomb and within he had almost mummified stitches of red cloth hung stiff from the leathery nubs of flesh that had been his lips covering what remained of his clothes were great blotches of dried blood mixed with shards of glass i wonder how he died she said glancing back to qurrah i hope it was lengthy qurrah entered hands sweating and his stomach still churning he chastised himself for his weakness it was just a dead body after all never mind the horrific expression on the mans face or the expelled blood and glass he blamed his reaction on the smell the air was remarkably stagnant preserving the body in all its gory detail if we are to live here well need to greatly improve the natural aroma he said holding a side of his hood over his mouth tessanna looked at him her eyes blank of course did you presume us to leave the body here qurrah shook his head never mind what i presumed help me dispose of your father using tessannas dagger they cut the ropes his body slumped forward his head falling between his knees as if he were to vomit the girl took a rope wrapped it around his neck and dragged him out of the chair she showed no sign of emotion as she pulled the body across the floor she acted as if she were removing a chamber pot qurrah propped open the door took the sheets from the bed and wrapped them around the chair he carried it around back planning to toss it to ruin in some far away brush he stopped though for tessanna was already there the grotesque body sat propped against a tree tessanna knelt opposite it she was staring not blinking not moving qurrah put down the chair and approached tess i never said goodbye she said i wonder why i never said goodbye it never bothered me until now in perfect contrast to her words her voice lacked any of emotion he didnt deserve any comfort or sympathy you knew that then you have forgotten it now the girl shrugged perhaps youre right he didnt deserve it he didnt deserve me he didnt deserve my hugs my kisses me still no emotion qurrah placed a hand on her shoulder she jerked her head around and saw him and then the tears started to flow oh qurrah she said she sniffed want to do me a favor anything my love he said fuck me she pulled him down to her assaulting him with her kiss they made love in the dirt while the corpse of her father watched h arruq paced outside their door aurelias ring in hand two opposing thoughts clashed in his mind when he came to a decision he knocked his large knuckles against the door who is it he heard a female voice ask just open it delysia said another the door cracked open and delysia looked out smirking at the halforc care to join me in my prayers she asked ha ha can i talk to aurry please sure thing cutie aurelia your suitor is here she danced past him grinning at the fierce blush in harruqs neck he pushed open the door stepped in and crossed his arms aurelia lay on her bed her hair braided into a long ponytail yes harruq she asked in answer he walked over opened her hand and shoved her ring onto her palm before he lost his nerve what are you doing she asked staring down at the ring i know what you want me to do with it he said i cant ever she clenched her fist and met his steeled resolve why is that you know why he said no i dont why because it cant work he shouted aurelia flinched and the sight stung him deeply why harruq she asked quieter why can it not work im an orc youre an elf its never happened the elf stood shaking she slapped him with her empty hand you think me foolish she asked not giving him a chance to speak you think i havent thought of that i have abandoned my forest abandoned my home and made enemies of my friends all to be at your side just because you fear and loathe the blood in your veins doesnt mean i feel the same thats not i dont think youdamn it aurry you think this is how i want it to be what is it you want then i want you he screamed his face glowing red i want you at my side for the rest of my life and i want to stop being so damn scared to admit it they stared at each other anger and confusion pulsing through their hearts say you love me she said i love you he said fine her voice quivered a knifes edge from breaking then take this ring back if you want to be with me forever then to the abyss with what anyone else might think there may be orcish blood in you but never would i wish it gone she extended her hand the ring laying in her open palm harruq stared at it both fearing and yearning for it rejecting her was a kindness a blessing a noble act from an ignoble man how could he be so wrong he took the ring from her hand im sorry he said putting it into his pocket ill be going now wait she wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him at first he was unresponsive but as his shock faded his arms circled her waist holding her close when the kiss ended she pressed her forehead against his chest ive given so much she whispered but ill give more he hugged her tight at this i dont deserve it and that doesnt matter dummy you can spend the rest of your life trying to earn it if you want that sounds like a plan he said aurelia slipped from his arms and smiled at him good ill be in the rain room dont take forever to decide i may be an elf but i still dont live that long together they left only to find delysia waiting outside their door lovers squabble she asked nosy little priestess aurelia said poking her side i should turn you into a gnat well looks like the fights over if you want to continue kissing and making up ill stay out a little longer aurelia only winked abandoning harruq and his brightly flushed face as she skipped down the stairs no uh its fine we dont need the room he said delysia giggled having nothing else to say the halforc fled up the stairs those two need to get married she laughed to herself t wo weeks later harruq awoke to the soft rustle of cloth against floor his room was dark and the sun still in hiding a quick glance around his room showed no visitors but he knew better haern lurked nearby testing him he shifted his head still searching nothing again he heard a soft rustle and he spun thinking it directly behind him he found only wall he glanced up nothing there either slowly harruq reached down next to his bed and grabbed his swords he gripped salvation by the handle and drew it free barechested and dressed in an old pair of brown pants he scanned his room through the small window he could still see faint stars in the dim light nothing seemed out of place maybe hes not here he mumbled to himself grumbling he put a foot down to get his chamber pot when the cold touch of steel pressed against his calf his entire body jerked in fright it would be difficult to fight without a foot he heard haern whisper from underneath his bed you scared the piss out of me harruq said to him well nearly care to give me a bit of privacy here natures calling haern crawled out and removed his hood you should always look under the bed he said frowning just when i thought you were improving oh and your brother is here qurrah he asked be right down where is he enjoying breakfast with the others it is an early morning for the tower we can practice once you have talked haern saluted with a saber before vanishing down the stairs harruq did his business threw on some clothes and rushed after t he whole gang even the latesleeping brug was at the table feasting qurrah harruq shouted leaping down the last few steps and hugging his brother who nearly gagged on some toasted bread good to see you harruq qurrah said coughing throughout the entire sentence looks like we wont be rid of them after all tarlak said grinning at the two visitors turns out they cant pass up a free meal your gracious company will always prove most alluring qurrah said each word drowned in sarcasm usually tars gift is sending people running the opposite direction brug said what was that tough guy the wizard asked nothing thats right nothing i have a sexchange wand and i know how to use it so no sassy comments not even from me aurelia asked batting her eyelashes no not you he answered besides what fun is there in using the wand on you i dont cast that way could have fooled me harruq said tarlak pulled a pink wand out from a pocket and waved it menacingly the halforc feigned terror then sat down next to aurelia and started wolfing down his food after breakfast the two left the tower harruq eager to speak with his brother s o are you going to be staying harruq asked as they walked the tower a fading image behind them that is what i came to tell you brother qurrah replied we have a home now far from others it is peaceful there more than we deserve whats going on harruq said crossing his arms what is with this girl you barely know her yet youre going to live with her in the middle of nowhere qurrah shrugged yes that is our plan does this bother you of course it does ive spoken to her what three times i dont even know her i do qurrah said a cold look entering his eyes and your opinion doesnt matter i will be with her regardless of what you say taken aback harruq could not keep the hurt out of his voice whats happened to you he asked your opinion was all that ever mattered to me qurrah felt guilt creeping in his heart strange and unwelcome you have found a new home one i cannot be a part of i dare not say i love tessanna but i will be with her until the day of her death please try to understand im going to marry aurelia harruq blurted immediately regretting it he stood there waiting like a man with his neck on the chopping block when the axe fell it was soft as a feather do as your heart wishes qurrah said as will i she is a fine woman elf or not the warrior bobbed his head up and down wishing he didnt blush so easily at least youll come visit us here in the tower right yes i will this is not abandonment only a mere separation our paths broke and split with the death of velixar we both know that harruq gestured to the black cloth his brother wore is that the path you took up a bit of sadness flickered in qurrahs eyes like the glow of a firefly i chose the only path before my feet he said goodbye harruq live well and be happy nothing more could we ever have asked for he turned to leave stopping only when harruq called his name yes he asked if you need anything ill be here for you he said anything at all i know qurrah said pulling his hood up to guard against the increasingly cold wind he returned to the tower harruq stared a long while after as he vanished behind one of many rolling hills t essanna was waiting for qurrah when he returned sitting beside the front doors of the tower with a guilty expression on her face i got in trouble she said in response to his questioning look then all the wiser to return home he said offering her his hand she took it and stood before he could leave the door cracked open tarlak emerged beckoning the necromancer with his hand a moment if you would before you go he said qurrah shrugged and stepped inside tarlak slammed the door shut after him his face deathly serious all the others were gone except for delysia who sat at the table and stared at her hands what is it wizard qurrah asked i know i owe her for saving my sister he began but i am begging you reconsider what you are doing she is not well i know better than you what has been wrought upon her the halforc said his tone vile do not dare tell me what to do right now you are in my tower so ill do as i damn well please tarlak said and you best listen she hurt my sister halforc and i dont take kindly to that type of thing hurt her why she knew delysia said her voice shaking somehow she knew she asked for my hand and i gave it to her she cut my palm and she could not finish wanted to taste such aged purity tarlak finished his voice a whisper its like wine she said i dont care what you say has been done to her her mind is not right i know that qurrah shouted that is exactly what i wish to heal she saved delysias life so consider the debt repaid she has suffered beyond what you can imagine so before you impose your limited view know that i have been inside the chaos that is her mind i will fix it i will put it right and not a soul is going to stop me her mind cannot be fixed tarlak shouted back even calan and all the priests of ashhur are not strong enough to heal her then i will become stronger than ashhur qurrah screamed before doubling over in a violent coughing fit all was silent in the room except for his labored breathing leave my tower tarlak said his voice eerily calm you are free to return but tessanna is not allowed within my walls until you pull off this miracle you delude yourself into searching for tessanna leapt to her feet as qurrah stormed out of the tower what is it she asked were leaving he said lets go home the two slipped behind the cover of trees and were gone harruq returned much later and with stones in his gut listened to what his brothers beloved had done t hey were a sullen pair sitting around the fire faces dark mouths closed and thoughts turned inward qurrah poured over pelaraks spellbook while tessanna traced her dagger across her skin a soft giggle brought his attention to her smiling face ive forgotten how good this feels she said tensing her arm so that the blood fell on the fire qurrah why did we not go to veldaren and take someone for you to experiment upon the halforc closed the large book i realized something as i read over the tome even if i can mimic the way your mind has become i know little of how to affect it tessanna licked her bloody arm staining her lips so what do you plan to do pelarak recorded all his knowledge on the darker side of magic within this tome he also has many spells but it will take time to study them until i have mastered these spells we can delay the messier side of our undertaking what am i to do while you study she asked her eyes locked on a rune she carved across her arm cut sleep return to veldaren you are free to do as you wish i wish to stay with you she said she ran her hand down her arm smearing blood all across it i wish you to stay with me as well he said opening his book im sure we will think of ways to pass the time tessanna looked at the halforc smirking oh i bet we can i wasnt thinking sex but yes that would be one of the more preferable ways to pass the time more preferable than reading some old dusty book she asked crawling around the fire like a cat much more preferable to his surprise he didnt really mind the blood from her arm smeared across his naked skin h arruqs days began with haerns training and they ended with aurelia and the stars the halforc tested the waters by holding her hand one night and he found the lightness of his heart and the fierce tingling of his fingers quite addictive soon they relegated the stars to only occasional viewing as they found each other far more interesting qurrah had been gone for a month when harruq popped the question to haern if i wanted to propose to someone what should i say he asked after a rigorous morning of sparring haern removed his hood shook his blond hair and then raised an eyebrow shall i assume there is a certain elf you wish to propose to harruq shrugged maybe any ideas haern rubbed his chin amused first set up the scene flowers stars make sure youre alone oh yes and make sure you bathed recently ha ha be serious haern laughed i am serious no one wants to marry a smelly halforc besides there are other reasons if you know what i mean the halforcs reaction showed that he did just shut up and go on he said not sure how i can do both but very well tell her how much you love her want to be with her and then present her with the ring this is after you get down on one knee of course why one knee the assassin gave him an incredulous look you really dont know anything do you harruq crossed his arms now when would i have been taught all this tutors my parents we street urchins arent known for playing dress up my apologies you get down on one knee like this and then take her hand when you tell her all the mushy stuff tarlak came around the corner a scroll in his hand just as haern was illustrating the proposal maneuver he stopped blinked twice and then burst into laughter am i interrupting anything important he asked haern leapt to his feet and for the first time ever harruq saw him blush helping out my dear halforc friend here he said trying and failing to act nonchalant what is it you need tarlak gestured with the scroll got a message for the kings watcher haern took the scroll unfurled it and read a smile grew on his face as he did excellent he said handing the scroll back to the wizard ill retrieve it tomorrow morning retrieve what harruq asked the king doesnt pay haern just in gold for his services tarlak explained he pays in magical items this one is for five more years of loyalty you didnt answer my question the halforc said youll see tomorrow haern said winking by the way do you have a ring to give aurelia aye where did you get it haern asked ring tarlak interrupted so you finally found the guts eh aurry gave it to me harruq said so shes not going to be too surprised proposing with the girls own ring nonsense tarlak wrapped an arm around the giant man listen here we have one of the finest metalworkers in all the realms right in this tower and hes not too bad with jewelry either find some way to pay him and im sure brug can make you a ring thatll knock the eyes out of aurelias head brug hed feed my manhood to a dog if i gave him a fork all show ill come with you trust me that guy is a softie at heart and when he hears its for love hell melt like a tub of lard alright harruq said shooting haern a worried glance as tarlak led them into the tower n ot no bloodyabyssyway like lard harruq muttered jabbing tarlak with his elbow i know you have plenty of precious gems for all your little toys the wizard said are you telling me you cant spare one not just my gems you want he said storming to the other side of his room not bothering to step over the pieces of armor metal clanged and banged as they flew this way and that you want me to take the time to carve a ring decorate it and why not even throw on a magical effect or two no problem ill drop everything just for that harruq needs a ring to propose to aurelia with and youre the best for the job tarlak argued propose brugs eyes bugged out of his head this lamewit porridgeskin musclebrained dog is going to marry her go find a clump of dirt for your ring and propose to a pig somewhere thatd be a more appropriate coupling tarlak winced and waited for the halforc to detonate he didnt instead harruq said ill make sure aurry knows im sure shell be thankful if she believes you made it what do you mean by that brug asked he kicked his grinding wheel i can make any damn thing in all dezrel you telling me she wont believe i could craft a gorgeous ring well not unless your name was on it or something he said with a shrug come on a pudgyfingered roundbelly like you making rings im surprised tarlak thought you could my fingers are not pudgy he shouted and i know what youre doing making me all upset and proud so ill prove you wrong well what if i make a ring give it to her and you dont ever get to see it at all brug tarlak said his patience clearly ended just shut up do a good job and accept my thanks his thanks and aurelias thanks understood fine ill do it but it wont be my best work or anything and im only doing it for aurelia if shes going to be married to that idiot at least shell have something pretty to help endure her wedding day very funny harruq said and then quieter im gonna kill him tar i swear im gonna kill him thank you brug tarlak said shoving harruq out as fast as he could the next day harruq waited for haern running his hand across the dewcovered grass and dozing off he awoke at the sound of approaching footsteps please forgive my tardiness haern said pulling back his hood youthful joy sparkled in his eyes ready to begin harruq drew his swords so whats your new toy it will be more fun just showing you he said he drew his sabers and tapped them together a sign to begin harruq approached lacking the reckless hurry he had shown in his earlier sessions the two circled each other each waiting for the first move an obvious feint by the assassin sent harruq in motion one sword slashing high his other kept back to block haern rushed forward his swords high and then he was not there the halforc slashed air staggering forward as the expected block did not come he whirled about to see haern directly behind him sporting a huge grin on his face how in the abyss did you do that he asked you mean this haern asked his entire body grew fuzzy and then he was gone a finger tapped his shoulder harruq jumped haern stood behind him once more youve got to be kidding me he muttered short range magic haern explained showing him a simple silver band on his right hand it places me seven feet directly ahead it is but a parlor trick one that you will grow accustomed to those who have not fought me before however his grin was dark and mischievous i only need to fool them once craziness harruq said pure craziness but just straight ahead yes not up or down or backwards good ready to go the assassin tapped his blades harruq charged and even though he still batted his swords away with ease haern was pleased by the increased speed and skill his apprentice showed a quick parry sent salvation out of position and a saber stabbed in to take advantage harruq having purposefully given the opening twisted to the side the thrusting cutting wide he slashed with both swords at the overextended assassin when he struck air the halforc turned and swung expecting his foe to be lunging from behind instead he saw no one clever haern said poking a saber into his back but predictable the halforc turned around his face the epitome of annoyance you said you could only go forward he said i did haern said his grin wide i never said i couldnt turn around and activate it immediately after thats it im not sparring you anymore alright alright i wont use it for the rest of the day happy yup harruq clanged his blades together their ring matched by another from haerns lets rumble and rumble they did and for the first time harruq scored four kills to haerns ten his previous best in a day was two a week later harruq heard loud grumbling coming up the stairs he lay on his bed recuperating after a rough assignment from tarlak to show a coldhearted merchant that his wealth didnt make him immune to retribution and justice the halforcs ribs still hurt from a tumble with the merchants guards that you cheerful he shouted to the stairs nah its the ogre patrol here to take you back to your swamp brug was in a surlier mood than usual and he stomped into the room wearing a scrunched frown ogres out back on a chain harruq said doing his best not to wince when he sat up shaddup you now take it and be grateful he thrust out his hand which held a tiny wooden jewelry box the halforc took it popped open the top and then felt his jaw drop and his eyes nearly fall from his head hand shaking he took out the ring and held it for a closer look brug had carved the ring from two pieces of interlocking silver twirling them together in an eternal braid three inset diamonds shone across the top welded across the braids were the shapes of a scorpion and a spider each facing the diamonds faint writing covered both sides whats it mean he asked turning it around in his hands mean what does what mean brug had his arms crossed and his back to the halforc although he kept peeking to see his reaction the writing i cant read it scorpion side is orcish others is elvish aurrys got this thing with spiders and you got that scorpion on your armor so it made sense both say love well the elvish side says love orcs dont really have a word for love so i had to make it up eternal friend was the best i could do not too worried i dont expect any orc to correct my butchering of their guttural pig squealings harruq returned the ring to its box his chest aflutter he had a ring he had everyone waiting for him the gods help him he was actually going to propose make sure you treat her good brug said interrupting his thoughts something like thats sturdy but if she breaks good luck ever fixing it didnt know you cared so much for aurry he said brugs face flushed i meant the ring he lied of course you did thank you ill never be able to repay you dont i know it he stormed out of the room and down the stairs mumbling the whole way once he was gone harruq took out the ring and held it mesmerized so he said twisting the ring in the light now i need stars flowers he sighed a bath n ight came too slow for the halforc he found a hill close to the tower that still had a patch of lateblooming flowers he placed a blanket atop it covered it with petals and then topped it off with a bottle of strange bubbly stuff that tarlak had promised the elf would love when finished he paced his bedroom working over how he would propose hows it going loverboy tarlak asked entering his room without knocking been pacing for two hours im guessing my poor floor cant figure out what to say he said no clue i got no clue youll be fine tarlak assured him try to say something romantic and if you bumble out nonsense shell just find it cute now come down dinnertime a fter dinner harruq did his best to nonchalantly invite aurelia out to stargaze wanna go outside he asked outside she asked back you know outside oh outside sure thing cutie as the two left the tower tarlak shot him a wink youll be fine he mouthed harruq rolled his eyes briefly to show his opinion of that assessment o oooh someone was prepared tonight aurelia said when she spotted the blanket is the grass too scratchy for my poor halforcies skin just you know thought itd be nice he wrung his hands his nervousness nearly immobilizing him he had fought skilled elves in combat he had witnessed the dead walk he had spent countless nights in the presence of the dark prophet velixar cake all cake compared to this it is nice she said sitting in the middle of the blanket she picked up one of the flowers and inhaled fall roses she said youre up to something no im not he said far too quickly then what is this for she asked picking up the bottle he had left and tilting it side to side did you think it would be nice too yes i did that a crime ill have to check sit before i get cold and lonely he sat down wrapped an arm around her shoulder and stared at the starfilled sky while she nestled her head against his neck ask her now he thought just get up ask her and get this whole thing over with no thats too fast got to be all romantic like haern said or was it tar besides i cant kneel like this ah screw kneeling just pop the question give her the ring let her say no and then be done with you alright aurelia asked glancing at him you look rather troubled nothing he said just thinking thinking yeah she knows she has to know shes smart youre dumb and now theres no point do it later next week next year a stubborn part of him reared to life you will not do it later you spineless chicken now get up on one knee and propose you sissy i am not a sissy he grumbled without realizing he spoke aloud course not aurelia said jabbing him but what are you being a sissy about just do it now a part of him shrieked forget it times wrong youre not ready dont do it shrieked another aurry he hesitated she looked at him her hair fallen to one side of her face moonlight bathed her soft cheeks and brown eyes he brushed her hair behind her pointed ear his eyes lingering on her full lips his heart and resistance melted away aurry i got something i want to ask you what is it harruq she tilted her head to one side harruq broke from her grasp and stood aurry i think you know butdo you know how much i love you yes she said i do he fumbled for the small box in his pocket his fingers shaking then will you do me the honor of um beingwill you marry me off came the lid the ring sparkled silver and white tiny circles glowing and fading like an open field filled with fireflies the three diamonds shone a smoky blue powered by the light of the moon when harruq removed the ring and held it out to her the color trailed behind it an afterimage of the deep ocean in the night her slender fingers accepted the ring of course i will harruq she said tears streaming down her cheeks of course i will his relief was indescribable as was the joy that replaced all the fear doubt and worry he had built up the past few weeks she slipped the ring on as harruq wrapped her in his arms forever he thought ill remember this forever they announced the news as the eschaton broke their fast everyone cheered including brug although his was limited to a few quick claps before diving into his meal with ferocious intensity about time tarlak said i think i speak for everyone when i say the wait was driving us insane are you going to have a wedding delysia asked staring at the ring in awe are we harruq the elf asked jabbing her fiance with her elbow um uh yes aurelia smiled good boy youre a lucky man haern said rising from his seat so he could shake both of their hands did he kneel correctly he asked aurelia as he kissed her wrist he didnt kneel at all she said no kneeling egad youre marrying a dimwit brug said when all eyes turned to him he pretended to have said nothing aurelia though did not let him off so easily it was a lovely ring you made me she said gliding over to where he sat i dont think i can ever thank you enough for helping my dimwit was nothing he mumbled it was everything she corrected she kissed him on the forehead drawing forth the red cheeks and ears that sent everyone into laughter youre evil he said i know i love it you are one to be envied tarlak said to harruq he stood and grabbed his glass a toast for the groom and bridetobe everyone joined in a toast for a long healthy marriage except for brug his toast was for a decent meal after the wedding t hey set a date for two weeks later neither seeing reason for drawing out the engagement harruq had no clue what to do about the wedding preparation dress or even why they were not already married shes got my ring and shes wearing it he argued why arent we married because someone other than you two needs to say you are delysia explained ashhur needs to accept the union of your souls ashhur when did i start caring what he thought the priestess winked since now ill get you ready while haern helps aurelia with the wedding wait if haerns doing wedding stuff what are you helping me with her evil mocking laugh was far from comforting minutes later harruq sat outside with a towel wrapped around his neck his hair was dripping wet delysia sat behind him a gleaming pair of scissors in her hand when was the last time you had your hair cut she asked couple months at least youd have to ask aurry no need she said snipping away we need you dashing for your wedding long homeless halforc hair is not going to cut it me dashing he tried to glance back but she held his head in place how the abyss are you going to do that my life is devoted to miracles she said ha ha ha he said keep still unless you want to lose an ear she said wouldnt that ruin the whole dashing thing a loud snip made him jump id heal them afterward the way she said it without a hint of jest terrified him he sat still as a stone until she removed the towel unfinished though she examined his face tapping her lips as she did do you shave she asked shave not really i dont think elves are known for their facial hair she ran a slender finger across the brown stubble covering his jaw line obviously it is time you learn she pulled out a thin razor which gleamed in the morning light is this going to hurt he asked youve never shaved before correct delysia asked nope then no it wont hurt she said as she pressed the razor to the side of his face h is face decorated with thin cuts he sulked for the next two days ignoring all pleas from delysia to prepare for the wedding caving only after aurelia threatened to polymorph him into a caterpillar so what do you plan on wearing delysia asked him they sat in harruqs room speaking for the first time since the shaving incident the halforc shrugged and gestured to his armor with a careless wave of his hand thats the best i got really the girl frowned at the black armor hardly elegant what will you wear underneath what im wearing now delysias frown sank to a new level of disagreement he wore brown pants and a weathered white shirt stained a wide variety of colors the sleeves were frayed around the edges and in many places the fabric had begun separating under no circumstances are you wearing that she declared ill see what we can do about getting you clothes put your armor on and let me see how it looks perhaps if we polished it up a bit he strapped on the various pieces of stained leather muttering to himself his appearance was one thing but he spent hours each day making sure his swords sang when swung through the air and that his armor shone clean and bright whenever worn look good he asked he flexed his muscles and posed itll do she said pinching her lower lip with her fingers maybe some red underneath your shirt for instance and then get you some nice pants something is missing though what he asked far as he could tell he had every piece of armor strapped on delysia continued staring deep in thought of course take off your pauldrons harruq shrugged unlaced his armor and handed them to her here he said ruin them and ill kill you so melodramatic delysia said tucking them underneath her arm im heading to veldaren to buy you some clothes she pulled out a long strand of rope with markings all along the side stand up straight so i can measure you the halforc endured the seemingly hundreds of measurements with calm quiet grumbling finished delysia mentally rehearsed numbers eyeing him with a growing smile what he asked youre so cute youre being domesticated she fled down the stairs a barrage of pillows bed sheets and other nonlethal objects hurling after her t wo days later delysia barged into harruqs room with an armful of clothes i need a door he said dont worry i wont peek she said tossing him pants and a shirt she put a bundle of black cloth on his bed not yet unfurling it now put those on he did as commanded after the priestess turned around she knew when to look by the halforcs complaints you must be pulling jokes missy she beamed when she saw him the black pants were a bit too loose but she could fix that and she was still proud of the exquisite stitching along their sides so small and tight as to be invisible the shirt was a bright red with the sleeves and chest lined with tiny silver buttons i look like an idiot he said you havent finished yet she said rushing over to him she buttoned his wrists and then his chest all the while telling him how dashing he looked youve lost your mind was his response this is not me what are these pants made of they itch like a whores he wisely didnt finish the rest sorry he said instead just put your armor on she said a bit of her good mood dampened harruq felt bad so he buckled his armor without complaint it gleamed brighter than usual the result of extra attention by a halforc determined to show delysia he was trying wheres my shoulders harruq asked when he was almost done right here she said grabbing the wad of black cloth and unfurling it the halforc coughed at the sight attached by silver clasps to his shoulder guards was a long flowing black cloak she turned it back and forth for him to see across the back of the cape was a giant red scorpion identical to the one across the chest of his armor im wearing a cape he asked staring as if it were dangerous surely youre joking im hurt she said her lower lip pouting i attached it myself and stitched on the scorpion trust me youll love it now put these on she handed them to him which he took without a word he slid the shoulders on the cloak billowed down his back and teased his elbows he slid his arms across the fabric pondering suddenly he had a desperate urge to see himself one sec going to go look at myself in a stream he said marching to the door a childlike thrill in his heart at the feel of his cloak trailing behind him no need i have a mirror right here she pulled a small square object from her pocket and gave it to him harruq took it and held it as far back as he could cant really see too much he said grow and show delysia said to the object it squirmed in his hand startled he let go instead of falling it floated grew many times its original size and then hung suspended in air harruq grinned at the sight of himself in the floating mirror his welloiled armor perfectly matched the red and black clothes peeking out underneath and as much as he hated to admit it the cloak made him look a tiny bit dashing like some noble rogue from fireside stories coupled with his long wellcut hair he had to admit he looked good you look like a prince delysia said smiling prince of orcs maybe he said twisting side to side not sure who around here would follow a halfblood like me oh please you look spectacular ill tell aurelia to come up and see you no he said let her wait until the wedding the priestess laughed very well then thats not too far away i can wait to see her reaction until then she hugged him and gave him a quick peck on the cheek youre too fun har too bad the elf got you first a snap of her fingers returned the mirror to its original size she caught it on its fall slipped it into her pocket and hugged him once more dont worry about the clothes she said ill have tarlak pay for them from your wages out of my hey i thought these were gifts delysia stopped at the top of the stairs and glanced back that was silly were not that nice around here should have known he grumbled his grumpiness could not last though not when he could glance down at his enchanted armor ancient swords and swirling cloak and know he was a truly awesome sight e ven though winter neared the weather was warm enough that a few blankets and each others warmth kept the outside bearable together the soontobe wed couple nuzzled and held each other close ive solved our dilemma aurelia told him underneath the blanket of stars whats that your brother instead of scrying for him ill send him a message hows that she wiggled her fingers in loopy and exaggerated movements theres power in these here fingers tarlak taught me a spell that sends my voice to anyone in dezrel whatever i say he will hear given a few seconds or so harruq grinned some neat stuff you mages know all i do is swing a sword aurelia nestled her head against his chest and purred yes but you do it well i guess thats all that matters eh you bet now hug me he did as he was told i t was during lunch that harruq thought to ask aurelia who she invited to their wedding just dieredon and felewen he hacked and he did his best not to choke on his food you want dieredon to come are you insane the elf tossed her hair over one shoulder possibly i am marrying you after all why do you not want him here i dont know wouldnt him wanting to kill me make things a little tense she took her fork into her hand and pretended it was a bow imaginary arrows flew one after another across the table each one accompanied by the joyful sound of her laughter har har har he said not funny of course it is tarlak said plopping down in a seat next to aurelia what are we laughing at harruqs being a baby aurelia explained popping a cherry tomato in her mouth am not are too the wizard shouted he turned back to the elf about what anyway i invited dieredon to our wedding turns out he disapproves the halforc threw his hands up in surrender could make the part where we ask if anyone has objections interesting tarlak mused what the halforc asked very much worried nothing dear aurelia said elbowing tarlak in the side ill tell him to behave and besides seeing you do something civil for once might do him good yes the domesticated orc the wizard chipped in harruqs glare was full of death promises ill have to remember that she said smiling at her fiance youre my domesticated little orciepoo why do i put up with all of you he asked pushing away his plate and standing because you love us tarlak said well you love me anyway not sure about the lovely lady here now now tar i dont need any competition for my harruqs love you guys are sowrong the halforc said storming out the door when he left their laughter followed him down the hall should i worry about you stealing my love from me she asked him not really tarlak replied his grin spreading ear to ear his butts cute but not that cute they both lost control laughing only harder when haern came down the stairs with a most perplexed look on his face t hey would hold the wedding outside cradled against the forest tarlak purchased a few extra chairs for seating all at harruqs expense of course what aurelia would wear they kept hidden from harruq just as his cape and clothing were hidden from her no word had come from qurrah and tessanna something that gnawed at harruq even more with his wedding so close felewen arrived three days before the ceremony her reception of harruq was quiet but warm the two elves talked for hours in aurelias room many times harruq stopped by the door wishing to enter common decency held him at bay dieredons arrival the day after was just as quiet but far less warm greetings orc was all he said to harruq to the rest of the tower he was charming witty and graceful time found ways to crawl ever slower and come the eve of his wedding qurrah was yet to show think hell be here he asked his fiance who was wrapped inside his arms their backs pressed against a tree whose bark was smooth as pressed grass you know him better than i what do you think he wrapped a blanket around them both shivering in the cool air i dont know anymore i think that is why i worry leaves rustled in the nearby forest as a soft wind blew through them aurelia kissed his cheek and then settled right back down against his chest hell come theres good in him somewhere and i think hes fond of me hope youre right so do i she whispered t he cold sensation of air against his legs pulled harruq from his slumber he groaned tucking his knees to his chest for warmth he lay there halfway between sleep and consciousness until the gnawing sensation of something missing forced his mind awake the slender form in his arms was gone harruq sat up and looked around dew soaked his hands back and wetted the blanket that covered his waist the sun was low on the horizon the sound of rustling grass alerted him to someones arrival aurry he asked squinting against the light have they evicted you on your final night of freedom asked a quiet raspy voice harruq beamed as his adjusting eyes spotted a frail form dressed in black robes brother he staggered to his feet and wrapped him in a hug qurrah chuckled offering a meager squeeze back i didnt think you were coming harruq said grinning at him whyd you take so long the elfs spell told us to arrive by this morning as far as i know i am not late did you bring the girl qurrah chuckled she did not wish to attend harruq was unsure of what to say that would not offend his brother so he let the subject drop ah well come on lets get something to eat qurrahs eyes glinted at the thought of food that sounds wonderful he said q urrahs entrance to the tower was a mixed thing the members of the eschaton smiled and welcomed him including tarlak but felewen and dieredon both lurched to their feet i killed you dieredon said an arrow already drawn and ready qurrah pulled back his hood to reveal his face and with his steeled eyes he stared dieredon down i know for i was there the halforc said a deathly silence filled the room as the two faced off the arrow not wavering even though the string was pulled fully taut i will not have bloodshed in my tower tarlak said it is strange company you keep dieredon said to the wizard his body not moving why should this one be left to live do you wish me dead qurrah asked a sneer spread across his face i have seen my master murdered at your hands i know my doom the question is not whether i wish to live but whether you wish me to die you have released my brother from your condemnation what have i done that he has not his eyes held regret when i was ready to take his life dieredon said yours openly invite it regret is naught but fear in a different dress qurrah said i do not know fear enough tarlak shouted dieredon put down your bow qurrah outside now we have to talk no qurrah said this elf thinks he can threaten any without worry the supreme executioner but he is wrong there are those better than you dieredon faster wiser smarter you are known only because you have murdered more than they what have i done that you have not dieredons eyes narrowed tarlak grabbed his bag of spell components expecting an arrow to let fly at any moment you seek glory in death dieredon said do not lie to me qurrah said i am not alone in feeling the thrill of the kill i fight with fire and darkness you with steel and arrow how are we different i value life the whip slipped down qurrahs shoulder into his hand dieredons look was simple try it and die before he could aurelia stepped between them her face calm as stone put down the bow she said if you harm him i will kill you fail or not i doubt you will sleep well with my death on your hands the string relaxed and the arrow slipped back into its quiver dieredon slung the bow across his back and gestured to the door i wish to leave please do not block my way qurrah and harruq stepped aside giving him more than a wide berth the elf glared at both as he left the tower the door slammed shut vicious enough that wood splintered my apologies tarlak said greeting the halforc with a handshake it seems you have a way with people i am used to that qurrah said i will do my best to not agitate him further the fewer headaches the better the wizard agreed besides this is a happy day a wedding day speaking of such it is time i started preparing forgive me he dashed up the stairs a mischievous grin on his face delysia gave harruq a kiss on the cheek well start getting you prepared after lunch she told him before following tarlak haern who had remained calm and seated throughout the whole affair clapped when the two brothers glanced over he grinned at them you must be insane he said few have stared down dieredon and lived not many have an elf named aurelia to bail them out aurelia said kissing harruq time to put on my dress you all behave she turned to felewen will you help me with my dress with pleasure felewen said arm and arm they hurried up the stairs when they were gone haern stood and crossed his arms awhile ago we made a wager he said he who killed the most thieves would take her hand in marriage if i remember correctly i had thirtythree harruq said bumping the number up by a couple from what he honestly remembered and i had thirtyseven haern said it appears we have a problem you would not go back against your vow would you you are such an idiot brother qurrah said fighting back a smile wait a minute you cant marry her just because you got more kills than me tarlak came back down the stairs two different overextravagant hats in his hands more kills when he asked on the night aurelia and your sister were injured haern explained what did you two finish at haern says he got thirtyseven while i only have thirtythree harruq said really i finished with thirtynine who do i get to marry qurrah laughed at the look on his brothers face delysia haern said not batting an eye congratulations when will the wedding be tarlak shook his head taking the two hats back upstairs with him you all have problems qurrah laughed all the harder haern joined him slapping harruq across the back the elf is all yours halforc my sincerest congratulations haern left to speak with dieredon with brug still upstairs snoring that left just the two brothers standing in the entranceway the mood fell silent but it was not an awkward silence the two shared it as brothers do glad with their company and knowing much of what the other thought never thought itd come to this eh harruq finally asked never dared hope for it qurrah said he smiled at his brother your mother would be so disappointed by you karak rest her orcish soul amen to that he laughed the tension of the past moments melting away into joy o utside the chairs were set up a simple but elegant carpet unrolled between the rows and all was ready to begin only aurelia harruq and delysia remained in the tower the others mingled ate a bit of food and shared their stories qurrah and dieredon did their best to remain at opposite sides of the gathering at all times tarlak was grateful for small favors harruq was the first to arrive his armor was polished his clothes were clean and crisp and his cloak flapped behind him in the chill wind he joined his brothers side and quietly accepted the compliments on his attire delysia followed gushing about how beautiful aurelia looked you remember this was all my doing she told the groom winking at him she stood at the end of the carpet beaming at everyone she wore her white robes of ashhur her braided hair hung down her back shimmering with gold lace she had a youthful beauty and many eyes lingered on her including harruqs then aurelia made her debut and his eyes were only for her around the corner she came seeming to float across the grass rosemary blooms encircled her hair forming a crown her hair hung loose behind her back though a few braided strands ran down the sides of her face earrings of cut sapphires dangled from golden chains in her ears her eyes sparkled highlighted with hints of blue powder a new pendant hung from her neck thin silver threads looping through its clasp from one direction it seemed to be of a spider yet from the other side the playful shape of a kitten the twin illusion was marvelous the pendant rested just above the swell of her breasts which were on prominent display due to the low cut of her dress the dress itself was simple white and elegant she wore a single sash of a sky color and no shoes how do i look she asked harruq tried to answer but his jaw refused to budge from its halfopen position seeing this aurelia lifted her arms above her head and twirled did i ever tell you how much i envied you tarlak whispered to the halforc touch her and die harruq whispered back harruq aurelia are you ready to begin delysia asked are you the elf asked harruq sure he said his smile huge and contagious good she pecked him on the cheek lets get this over with a lthough aurelia had been in charge of the wedding she did not wish it to be traditional elvish the fact that a priest of ashhur and not celestia presided over it spoke much to this fact in truth they retained only one element of an elvish wedding and that was the opening song the union of souls should always be a beautiful thing delysia said to all in attendance the girl was gone replaced by a proud and solemn woman so let this ceremony begin with a beauty to both the eye and the ear felewen queneya let us hear your song the elf stood smoothed out the soft bluewhite dress she wore and began to sing no music accompanied her no hands clapped along the only instrument was her powerful voice its smooth melody was like the waters of the ocean rolling from her tongue with a sound that was constant and beautiful three hundred years before she had been taught that song for the funeral of her youngest sibling those who heard the words and understood them nodded in understanding and approval those who did not such as harruq did not need translation their hearts understood felewens song ended followed by a respectful silence all gathered there looked upon delysia as she sliced through the quiet with her voice carrying with it power and authority harruq tun a mixed blood carrying the race of celestias condemned as well as the blood of her chosen you have the potential to be everything we fear and everything we may hope to be whatever path you walked before coming to us matters not the path ahead i tell all of you is what matters and to marry out of love and to give devotion to a single soul shows what path you have chosen harruq tun i offer you my blessing she smiled and bowed to him harruq shifted uncomfortably glancing more than once at aurelia the elf merely smiled and squeezed his hand aurelia thyne many would give all their worldly possessions for such beauty as yours many more would sacrifice for the powerful magic you wield well known is the elven hatred of the orcish every man and woman on dezrel walks with the taint of sin and the failure of mortality few wear the proof of this upon their face their skin and within their bloodline fewer still would see the gem beneath while all here have come to see the worth of harruq tun you have come to love him as only a soul mate can aurelia thyne i offer you my blessing the elf smiled as delysia bowed to her you make me sound too good to be true she whispered the priestess smiled lovers your rings harruq pulled out a small black box from his pocket while aurelia levitated a similar box from atop a nearby chair as one they opened them aurelias held a simple silver band harruqs which he had not opened under brugs strict orders held a much greater surprise light burst from the opened box a soft eruption of colors seven orbs of light rose into the sky sparkling in lavender blue gold green orange white and red the orbs danced above their heads before taking orbit and bathing them in the colors of the rainbow you outdid yourself there tarlak whispered to brug who sat with arms crossed next to him cheap tricks all it is he whispered back still his face held a smug satisfaction as he watched the orbs revolve in the sky bathing them in waves of light delysia gave no reaction to the orbs even though she had been given no warning of the display harruq tun the ring you hold represents your heart which you give to your lover for eternal safekeeping do you give such sacredness freely i do he said and aurelia thyne do you willingly accept his love into safekeeping for as long as you draw breath i do she said at those words harruq felt a soaring in his heart give your ring to her harruq tun and know ashhur watches and blesses your love with his he took her outstretched hand and slid the ring on her finger whirlwinds of feathers tore through his chest his head felt full of air aurelia thyne the ring you hold represents your heart which you give to your lover for eternal safekeeping do you give such sacredness freely i do she said and harruq tun do you willingly accept her love into safekeeping for as long as you draw breath i do he said give your ring to him aurelia thyne and know ashhur blesses your love harruq stared at the ring sliding across his finger a foreign thing one he never thought to possess when finished the two interlocked their hands and stared into each others eyes as delysia finished the ceremony each of you holds the love of the other in your heart keep it sacred and keep it close may ashhur forever bless and protect these two lovers before us all aurelia you now are a member of the tun family harruq you may kiss your wife to a round of applause harruq took the elf in his arms dipped her to one side and kissed her t he feast was beyond anything the wizard had ever prepared roast quail venison boar and mutton covered a single table all seasoned with basil sage and rosemary another table was piled high with cheese fish aleflavored bread wild fruits and assorted beers meads and wines covering all was a blended array of spices some rare some common each bite contained a hint of cloves cinnamon pepper ginger or nutmeg when the feast was done and the toasts were over the guests said their goodbyes come visit me some time felewen said hugging both make sure you let me know when the babies are coming ha ha ha harruq said grinning at her dieredon left with her bowing to aurelia and offering only a quick word to harruq break her heart i break you he said will remember the halforc replied the two mounted sonowin and soared off into the southern sky qurrah was last his mood strangely quiet and somber you will come and visit again wont you aurelia asked offering him a curtsey the halforc bowed i will do my very best to both of you i offer my most sincere congratulations you stay safe brother harruq said hugging him qurrah chuckled of course you as well another bow and then he ventured into the forest vanishing amid the trees harruq resumed eating a bit more worried by that last troubled look on his brothers face what are your plans for tonight tarlak asked sliding beside harruq while delysia distracted aurelia what you mean you know what i mean the wizard said winking you do know what i mean right harruq flushed of course i do just figured you know upstairs in my room and all tarlak laughed and clapped his hands as a personal favor i am paying for all of us to stay in a nice inn in veldaren the tower is yours for the night enjoy harruq beamed at the wizard i owe you a lot tar and youll pay me back one day i have faith in you but for now the night is yours it is time for us to go he clapped three times and the rest of the eschaton heard the signal and obeyed they politely bowed and wished them well entered the tower returned with travel packs of clothes and gathered at the door before they left haern trudged over to harruq and removed his hood just so you know i am still expecting a sparring match tomorrow morning he told him dont overdo it ill hold him in check aurelia said kissing the man on the cheek now run off time for us to have a little quiet time right harruq right aurelia tun he said a dumb grin on his face aurelia tun sounds so funny the gang bounded off southeast harruq and aurelia waved standing in front of the door with arms intertwined come on upstairs love aurelia said when they were gone she kissed his cheek hand in hand they hurried upstairs when they arrived they found flowers piled across their beds a dizzying array of roses tulips and daisies somehow alive even though winter was fast approaching i feel tarlaks hand in this aurelia said picking up one and gently pressing it against her lips silly wizard why would i he stopped as he watched aurelia slowly drift the soft petals down her neck lower lower lower gods bless you tar harruq said t he moon was a curved sliver of light illuminating a cold forest when qurrah returned home tessanna sat before a fire she had built in the clearing before the front door how was it she asked the red flame flickering off the black orbs that were her eyes bearable he said sitting opposite of her they love each other so very much some people are lucky enough to find and marry their love she grabbed a long stick and tossed it upon the fire and others never do and then there is me youre no different qurrah said his voice was vile water spewing from his heart are you incapable of love tears ran down the sides of her face even so her words carried no hint of the emotion she clearly felt i am capable of loving a man she said and men are capable of loving me but death comes for all i love and claims them like a bitter thief qurrah cast down his eyes ashamed of his outburst ignore my words i have lost my brother tessanna curled her legs against her chest and peered at him over her knees do you wish to have me it might help no qurrah said let my brother do the taking tonight she stood to return to the house but the halforc stopped her do not go he said stay with me the girl smiled beautiful amid the dreary night whether the smile was honest or false qurrah was too tired to care i will be inside my home she said our home do not worry about what your brother does this night she entered the cabin shutting the door softly behind her he stared after her the flickering fire popping and cracking his mind ravaged itself how dare he fall prey to weakness his brothers actions and choices were of no concern to him if he found happiness in forsaking his blood and marrying an elf then so be it philosophy was for the rich and the bored feeling was all that mattered his brother felt happiness with her he would feel happiness with tessanna he stood and kicked out the fire silent as a thief he opened the door to their home upon the bed she waited her clothes cast aside as if she had known all along it is what we both want she said i care of nothing else i know he said he went to her t hat night both brothers slept with fire one was bright and roaring a controllable inferno that surrounded and engulfed one was cold a blue flame burning without heat turning to ash without the warmth of consumption blanketed by stars and separated by a great distance both found peace in the fire of the two only one created life q urrah nestled in the old chair a fire roaring at his side in his lap was the book of pelarak three times he had read it analyzing every word he was halfway through his fourth read and still he marveled at the knowledge the cleric of karak possessed outside a heavy rain fell tessanna looked up from the bed her small head poking out from a multiblanket cocoon shouldnt you go she asked the halforc flipped a page pretending not to hear youve been quiet she continued impatient terrible in bed even he flipped another page i will visit their child in time she shrunk her head further into the blankets will you start taking people again she asked try making them like me qurrah chuckled he had decided over the winter that he preferred the childlike mentality of tessanna best the sarcastic cynical form was next her angry side her fearful side and her apathetic side well he planned to get rid of those yes we have let enough time pass to safely take another i have not forgotten my promise in time your mind will be healed what about until then he glanced over until then we will make do with what we have they did not speak the rest of the day silence was not a thing either feared nor did it imply anger or frustration they could each dwell within the confines of their minds silence it was a blessed thing h er shrieking wail was horrible to hear harruq couldnt imagine the pain causing it inside their room delysia attended to aurelia doing things he preferred to stay in the dark about he crossed his arms uncrossed them paced back and forth and muttered incoherently childbirth such a stressful thing what are you doing out here tarlak asked as he came up the stairs kicked me out harruq said making too much of a fuss eh well brawny men with more muscles than brains usually dont mix too well with such delicate matters ill see how things are going dont go in there the halforc said tarlak waved him off opened the door and slipped inside harruq counted to three on his fingers timing it perfectly get out of here now the door flung open and out fled the wizard as if seven firebreathing dragons chased him for supper he slammed the door shut straightened his hat and then fixed his robes kicked me out tarlak said harruq rolled his eyes dont worry ol buddy the wizard said clapping him on the shoulder im sure del has everything under control your child will be fine another cry came from inside sharp and focused both shuddered something tells me we got the easy part harruq said amen to that another cry came soft and shrill both stood alert at the sound no woman made that sound it was the cry of a babe aurry harruq shouted yanking open the door his heart froze and all things of the world fell away to a single image on a bed her hair frazzled and her face soaked with sweat was the most beautiful woman harruq had ever seen in her arms wrapped with towels was a newborn child his mind fought to grasp what he witnessed his wife was holding his child his child im a father he said breathlessly its a healthy girl delysia said towels in her hands covered with blood fluid and sweat what shall you name her harruq slid beside his wife his eyes mesmerized by the scrunched red face swollen shut eyes and tiny mouth of his crying child as we agreed its a girl so you get to name her aurry aullienna aurelia said aullienna harruq repeated gonna take some time before i can say that right youll have plenty of time to learn it tarlak said smiling beside the door think of how many times youll be shouting it aullienna stay away from my things aullienna put down my sword aullienna stop beating up brug chubby hands reached from behind the door and then the wizard was gone a few seconds later brug ducked his head inside good to hear youre alright aurelia he said he winked at the little babe hope its a long time before you try beating up little old me aullienna aurelia smiled too tired to laugh i need to nurse her she told her husband harruq nodded realized what that meant and then nodded again everybody out he said private time as they were leaving haern slipped inside he wore no hood or cloak only a simple pair of pants and a shirt i come to pay my respects to the child haern said respects paid my babys hungry so time to go hush harruq aurelia said her voice distant and drowsy she stroked a hand across aulliennas soft forehead we are grateful haern the assassin opened his hand and held it out flat across his palm was a long green ribbon with gold writing tie it to her crib for now haern explained and when she is older may it adorn her hair pretty harruq said not understanding the true importance aurelia however read the writing and smiled it is a noble gift and a thoughtful one we thank you whats it say the halforc asked after haern bowed and left may ashhurs eyes forever watch over this child even as we of the eschaton do the same such a token is given by men who pledge armies to ensure the safety of a child the elf smiled at her daughter ill take haern over an army any day cant argue with you there d own on the first floor harruq found tarlak pacing did my brother harruq asked no sign the wizard said im sure he is very happy for you im sure he is too he said none too convincingly he grinned at tarlak you realize im a dad now a dad im a father aye that you are the wizard said scary as the abyss isnt it scarier harruq said far far scarier they moved aurelia and aullienna into the tuns room later that night harruq carried the little babe in his arms beaming as if his face had been frozen that way welcome to your home he said opening their new door slowly with an unrehearsed theatrical flair aurelia kissed his cheek as she carefully came in behind him due to carefully cast spells the room was transformed into something more akin to a forest illusions enchanted the walls so they appeared in touch taste and smell to be covered with ivy the floor was a carpet of smooth short grass as for a ceiling there was none not to the naked eye puffy clouds floated above on a gentle breeze a single tree marked the center of the room winding upward with branches positioned as steps at the top was a cradle thick and sturdy near the tree was a bed covered with a great blanket of flowers the entire room felt open natural and above all else like a private home kind of bright for nighttime dont you think harruq asked in answer aurelia snapped her fingers twice the blue sky turned purple and a sparkling field of stars covered the ceiling the soft breeze vanished and in its absence came the constant drone of cicadas aullienna was fast asleep so she failed to show her amazement the halforc grumbled one day shell be old enough to know how neat that is he said shush youll wake her aurelia took her from his arms and glided up the treesteps to the crib she laid her inside and stroked her face i never expected to have a child she said cooing as she felt harruqs arms wrap around her never expected any of this if you expected to marry a bumbling halforc when you were a youngling then something was wrong with you aurelia reached back put a hand around her husbands head and pulled him close so she could kiss him she looks elven she said when their lips parted nearly full blood even guess we can be thankful for that he said itll help her be accepted no shame in my orc blood i just know her life will be easier without it showing it does show aurelia said shes bigger than most elven babes shell grow tall like her father is she going to wield swords and beat people senseless too he asked only if daddy wants to get his cute ass fireballed aurelia said with a wink harruq kissed from her neck to her ear a tradeoff ill take any day he whispered just to watch it drive you crazy oh but i am already there she said running a hand down his face i married you didnt i thats right you did whyd you do that because i love you dimwit he flipped her around and kissed her lips dont you forget it either never she said smiling up at him never in a million years a fter waking three times to attend the crying child aurelias eyes didnt even flutter when the halforc slid off the bed he crossed his arms as if cold although a soft phantasmal breeze blew from the walls warm and comforting up the stairs he climbed his steps surprisingly silent for his bulk aullienna was sound asleep on her back her fat face turned away from him he reached out to touch her halfway there his hand froze unable to move any closer how many did we kill qurrah he asked a lump in his throat his voice was a raspy whisper among the cicadas you were wrong this life is not suffering we were wrong brother we did his finger brushed her face he recoiled as if touched by fire his foot slipped on a stair he went down slamming his knee on the top step a sharp intake of air marked his pain kneeling there clutching his leg he fought back the tears the girl he had seen the girl the one clutching her stuffed doll in the village of cornrows like an animal he had butchered her driven his blade through that pretty face and those blue eyes youre an orc arent you we were wrong he whispered he smashed his fist against his thigh he remembered the mother who had held the child in her arms when he took their lives all those questions he had wondered they came thrashing back for now he had the answers they were a vile blade in his gut unable to hold back the tears he sobbed there a broken man when hands touched his back he turned and snarled like the beast he felt he was before the sight of his wife tired and worried he could not remain such a thing when she extended her arms he accepted in her embrace he cried until his sorrow subdued all will be fine she whispered to him you dont know he said to her that changes nothing she said kissing his forehead come to bed whatever it is it can wait until morning i only have an hour before she needs fed and i would like to sleep as much as i can until then he nodded stood erect and did his best to smile alright lets go to bed harruq slept with his back pressed against her stomach her arms wrapped under his arms and around his chest the steady feel of her breath against his neck calmed many of his thoughts sleep came coupled with nightmares when light flooded the room from an illusionary sun rising at dawn his eyes were bloodshot and heavy morning love aurelia said kissing his back you should go haern will be waiting for you without a word he stood dressed in his armor and left to spar t he baby wake you often haern asked seeing the red in the halforcs eyes nah just didnt sleep well harruq drew his blades lets get this over with instead of attacking the assassin frowned this is hardly the competitive spirit i prefer is something amiss nothing is amiss i just need some damn sleep now either swing a blade at me or let me go back to bed the halforc tensed ready for a lunge but instead haern sheathed his swords get out of here harruq stepped out of his combat stance what you heard me get out of here my training is a privilege my apologies for your lack of sleep but you and i have suffered far worse it is your attitude that has soured nothings wrong with my attitude haern crossed his arms you were a beacon of happiness yesterday do you fear being a father i dont fear anything harruq snarled say stuff like that again and youll find yourself fighting and the cuts wont be fake haern turned his back to the halforc and walked back to the tower harruq watched him go emotions swirling in his stomach until he violently sheathed his blades and stormed off into the woods a urelia found him several hours later sitting beside a stream that ran through the forest not too far from the tower unknown to harruq it was the same spot qurrah and tessanna had made love before karnryk and his thugs had arrived sitting on a log he stared at the moving stream tossing in stone after stone what is wrong aurelia asked as she neared haern told me about this morning i dont deserve her he said and you dont deserve me either but you have both harruq glanced back at her chuckled and then threw another stone cute but youre right i dont ive done aurry shes just a child a helpless child he dropped a handful of rocks and ran his fingers through his hair just helpless he mumbled harruq i dont understand please tell me whats wrong youre my husband nothing you have done will change how i feel about you im sure you think that he said you might even believe it but youre wrong aurelia knelt in front of him her eyes strong as iron she put her hands on his face and forced him to look at her dont do this torturedhero nonsense and dont you dare assume you know how i feel about you i love you unquestioningly and unconditionally you cheapen us both when you spew such filth now tell me what damns you so we may be damned together i killed the children he screamed lunging to his feet aurelia flinched at his words but did not falter her gaze what children she asked woodhaven aurry im the forest butcher i killed them all for qurrah every single one it was me that is who you married that is who you want raising that precious child i wont raise her i cant theres too much blood the silence that followed seemed to confirm harruqs worst fear pain washed over her face and for a long while she struggled to speak harruq tore from her grasp and started walking deeper into the forest how dare you she said the shaking emotion in that quiet voice deeper and stronger than any raging river how dare you he turned to her his eyes pained and his face frozen she crossed the distance between them and slapped him across the face when she spoke again the sheer will in her eyes kept him from looking away that child that life that lives in our room is from our love harruq it is our doing it is our creation how dare you try to abandon it because of your pain because of your sins how dare you try to abandon me aurry no she said nearly screaming the word there are no excuses harruq no reasons condemned or not for what you did i would never abandon you for your past nor for mine how would i explain why no father was there for her first steps what would i tell her when she asks who you were what would i tell her when she asks me if her father loved her tell her he loved her with all his heart harruq said tears filling his eyes tell her thats why he left never aurelia said wrapping her arms around his neck and pressing the side of her face against his that is why you stay i will not do this without you harruq i wont he tried to stay angry he tried to convince himself he was doing the right thing he tried how he tried but against aurelias tears he felt rolling down his neck he was powerless the guilt of his sins crushed him and every face he had murdered rushed through his mind im sorry he said wrapping his arms around her im so sorry i should have told you its alright aurelia said back ive always known i just never wanted to believe to this he said nothing only sniffing as he felt his own tears streak down his face as they embraced aurelia spoke never again harruq please swear it to me we will kill it is the nature of those with skills as ours but never children swear it i swear it he said i can bear the guilt no more she kissed his lips then let it be gone forever come your daughter is waiting hand in hand husband and wife they walked back to the eschaton tower i t was two months before qurrah saw his niece harruq greeted him warmly and proudly led him up the stairs to where his daughter slept what name did you give her qurrah asked as he neared her crib aullienna harruq answered leaning against an ivycovered wall aullienna his brother said rolling the word over his tongue an elvish name do you hold no care for our heritage we have no heritage he said i like the name and so does aurry thats all that matters qurrah stooped before the crib and peered down aullienna was napping sucking on her thumb as she did she was dressed in clothes given to her by delysia a plain white dress that hung over her diapercloth trailing down the crib was the ribbon given to her by haern qurrah looked at this foreign creature unsure of how to feel she looks elvish he said and you give her an elvish name do you wish to hide the blood that flows within her were hiding nothing harruq said his tone hardening you of all people should know that do i he asked turning his back to the child the orcish blood in your veins gives you strength it helped you survive the streets of veldaren would you wish it gone never harruq said their gazes met in silence broken moments later by qurrahs voice she is beautiful he said not looking at her when he said it he climbed down the stairs not having once touched her though i fear for her fostering a wild elf and a burly halforc are far from normal parents well be doing what we can harruq said fidgeting as he followed qurrah i was hoping you would be around more often help us raise her qurrah put his hand on his brothers shoulder you will do fine in raising her teach her strength teach her pride and she will grow up an honor to your name now i must be off business awaits me in veldaren when will you be back harruq asked opening the door i dont know it will depend but i fear it several months at least harruqs disappointment was obvious are you sure qurrah bowed to his brother my congratulations on such a wonderful daughter he walked past his brother to the top of the stairs he stopped turned around and gestured to the illusionary grass ivy and clouds did aurelia do all this he asked harruq grinned all of it you like qurrah nodded smiling at a small cloud floating across the ceilingsky impressive he said t he black gates gave no feeling of home and no comfort in their familiarity only the aura of certainty of order that permeated from the bars soothed his turmoil they opened as he approached needing no word or touch from him halfway across the obsidian walkway the great doors creaked inward the night was young and the wise man who stepped out seemed almost youthful in the moonlight welcome home said pelarak no home of mine qurrah said i do not worship your god how may it be my home because your family is here waiting for the wayward prince to ascend his throne the old man bowed i trust my meager knowledge was useful to you some things should be discussed in quiet rooms qurrah said no matter how calm the night may seem indeed pelarak said fully opening the door come inside qurrah tun inside he went fighting the newly awakened feeling that perhaps he had come home after all t hey headed straight for pelaraks small room pausing only to offer a prayer before the majestic statue of karak the two sat opposite each other with reverence qurrah took the tome the priest had given him and placed it on his desk your wisdom on such matters is humbling qurrah said gesturing to the book i have to ask how did you obtain such knowledge do you mean the spells the priest asked no your writings you talk of madness its causes and its effects with authority that leaves me in awe the priest rested his chin on his knuckles that first tome i gave you with the words to drive men mad proved helpful i truly believe they can create every kind of madness it took many years but i have seen the effects of all two hundred tessannas mind qurrah said could you remember which of them formed something similar to hers the priest sighed and leaned back in his chair uncrossing his fingers as he did in truth no i have spoken to her before although i doubt she remembers me regardless the key to her does not lie in my findings but why qurrah asked surely one resulted in a similar madness pelarak raised a bushy white eyebrow at the halforc are you so sure it is madness to this qurrah had nothing to say so the priest continued madness is a loss of order in the mind the worse the madness the less the order tessannas actions may seem chaotic but i have sensed the winding weave that is her mind and within i found order frail as it may be then how may i cure her qurrah asked if she has obtained a semblance of order in her mind then i dare say she might already be cured her current mental state may be salvation from the true madness she suffered earlier in life no qurrah said rising to his feet her mind is shattered broken it can be put together again i welcome you to try pelarak said his voice tired and honest but she is not mad i was reluctant to tell you earlier but i feel she is more fractured than insane each piece seperate and controlled as for what controls them i may have something for you to think over the halforc stayed silent his mind sifting through what pelarak had said the priest rose from his seat and pulled a small diary from a shelf he flipped through the pages until he found a specific passage and then read it aloud a man called out to me for coin he lived off the pity of others for he was blind since birth when i declined he at first accepted but as i passed he lunged like a rabid animal biting for my leg i threw him back broken the animal left him as he cried for forgiveness he claimed a demon lived inside him curious i touched his mind to see i found the demon but it was not what he thought instead it was himself or at least a part of himself isolated into a second being this vile secondself wished nothing but death and pain upon others it fought for control constantly and though i sensed no strength in the beggar he succeeded in holding it at bay for many an hour before each temporary escape curious as to how i searched deeper and there i found it i viewed a vine growing out of both yet at the same time it seemed a wall blocking one from the other i sensed this entity had a full form deep inside but i was unable to probe any farther sadly the beggar died karak curse my carelessness if i had been more patient i might have followed the snaking tendrils from these two selves to the center pelarak closed the book and set it down next to his spellbook take both he said you still have much to learn focus upon this wall that separates her selves and yet also connects them as well ask her if she knows about it for she might if anything can bring the pieces back together it is that secret hidden self qurrah took the books and bowed i will consider what you have said he promised although you err in saying she cannot be cured i know little about love pelarak said showing qurrah to the door my mind is too cynical to study such chaos good can come from love however for i love karak with every beat of my heart love tessanna as she is if you fail to cure her the sting will hurt that much less i will not fail qurrah said he held the books tight against his chest and bowed once more i never fail spare me the theatrics the priest said a smile creeping on the corners of his mouth we all have failed some are humble enough to learn from their failures they are the wise qurrah left the temple having gained no answers but plenty of questions as well as a gnawing fear that there was more to tessannas mind than he so far discerned b ack at their cabin they lay soaked in each others sweat in the calm afterward qurrah dared ask the question pelarak had urged him to ask tessanna he said his eyes closed he felt less awkward bringing up the subject when he wasnt looking at her do you understand what i mean when i say there are many in your mind yes she said her voice subdued she usually fell into such a state after they made love although how long the apathy lasted varied greatly i believe i understand qurrah searched for a way to ask what he barely understood himself these differentparts of you pieces of you they are all separate but theres one that isnt part of it connects to every piece do you understand tessanna giggled fading out of the apathy smoother than a boat floating across still waters something is wrong with me she said her voice intolerably shy ive always known it people die around me and sometimes it feels like strangers sit behind my eyes spitting at them but what of my question he asked tessanna did not answer she closed her eyes appearing deep in thought her eyelids fluttered a look of pain crossed her face when she reopened her eyes a new identity spoke one he had never witnessed before the girl is a maelstrom she said all emotion all fear all shred of anything human drained out of her her selves swirl about the edges i am the center i am celestias chosen speak qurrah felt a phantom presence pass over his body shadows stretched and crawled along the floor toward them the wood creaked the bed shook and all about darkness formed where darkness should not have been he stared at her face with detached horror her black eyes were aflame consumed with purple fire swirling deep within he saw the face of a woman glaring out similar to tessanna except older and wiser the creeping darkness took corporeal form wrapping around her naked body like a phantom dress how may i cure the madness within he asked his voice almost lost in a sudden roar of wind do not meddle halforc tessanna said as her hair danced wildly about her arms back and breasts otherwise time itself will protect her from you the darkness flared washing over qurrah with burning wave after wave his skin crawled with vile sensations his mind reeled against horrible images of a vast emptiness beyond comprehension mortal power could maim could kill but this was beyond that this was the power of a goddess the final wave came and went the shadows returned to their rightful positions a fragile calm overtook the cabin tessannas hair halted its writhing she stared at qurrah with a terrified look tears running down her face i thought you would be dead she said she flung her arms around his frail body and cried against his neck i thought he held her his eyes staring into nowhere after a few minutes her crying ended her sorrow and fear vanishing as if it had never been you should be bleeding right now she said pulling away from him everyone always is after that after what he asked in answer she shrugged i dont know be thankful you arent dead it seems someone favors you perhaps he said rising from the bed to seek fresh air but i intend to find out f or weeks qurrah poured over pelaraks diary learning all he could his brief encounter with tessannas innerwell whatever it was had certainly proven pelarak true this strange center did indeed exist and apparently disapproved of his efforts a part of him was afraid but a larger part ached with curiosity he thought he knew much about the mind but this girl mocked him with her complexity when will you try to change me she asked him one day a small squirrel sat in her hand amazingly docile in her presence in time tessanna he said but i have found a new obstacle and must find a way to overcome it nothing from a book helped him to his next revelation one night as he sat in his chair with his head aching he watched tessanna carve runes into her arm her precise intricate movements entranced him she scrawled seven runes before stopping while she watched the blood flow she licked her wrists what is it you write he asked her standing from his seat i dont know she said whatever feels good there is too much detail for that to be random he said crossing the room to grab her elbow do you know what these say does it have to say anything she asked attempting to yank her arm away qurrah latched on his knuckles white his eyes scanned over the bloodsoaked runes attempting to discern any form or meaning let go tessanna said a new cold had entered her voice let go of me now spell runes he said releasing her by karak they are spell runes you dont know that she said what else could they be qurrah asked others have tried to speak them aloud nothing ever happened those that tried did they die qurrah asked tessanna shrugged the halforc tossed her a rag clean off the blood we will see if i am wrong a fire raged beside them as they stood underneath the stars already the cuts on her arm had faded to angry red scars the rate of her healing remarkable qurrah had studied them carefully perusing his spellbooks and finding runes matching the ones tessanna carved some were identical while others had slight deviations that he hoped were insignificant give me your arm he asked her she obeyed seeming indifferent about the whole situation she expected little to happen as much as she loved qurrah she did not think him correct he however was certain he had stumbled onto something significant what that significance was well he hadnt a clue he put away such worrisome thoughts and held her hand one after another read the names of the runes delk mordthun vaeln nelaquir tirug nolfwud xeudayascar he spoke them as he would a spell from a scroll feeling the power reeling out his body wind swirled around him blowing leaves and sending their clothes and hair dancing the runes glowed as if the cut skin were embers of a lingering fire all about the night grew dead when the final word was spoken qurrah looked to his beloved taking pride in the lack of fear in her eyes he held her hand and prepared for the storm qurrah stay with me she said moments before lightning struck her from a cloudless sky the bolt lifted her into the air her lithe frame hovering a foot above the ground her hand clutched his her nails piercing his flesh he felt no pain let all those who endanger the balance wither away as dust the girl said her tone was flat all emotion gone it was the voice of the center she pointed a finger at him be gone from her qurrah he heard her cry a second voice from one mouth black power collected at the end of her accusing finger walls of wind ripped from the ground sealing the two in a gray prison the halforc did not think only react he flung his arms around her holding her tight as a small ball of emptiness shot from her finger he kissed her lips and awaited death the magic hit him he wished for death when he opened his mouth to scream no sound came forth his soul shrieked in agony immeasurable the two hovered higher and higher as his vision blurred a song rose over the roar of the wind one of longing and desire sung by an unseen choir of thousands the magic ripping through him intensified adding a physical component to his torture the pain crawled up his arm and into his lungs all breath ended and his lungs filled with fluid his arm were aflame with the pain of a thousand burns what have you done tessanna asked the center was gone yet still she felt no fear only wonder at the chaos surrounding her qurrah tried to respond but his jaw locked as his neck muscles pulled tight a black fog poured from his throat which she breathed in like smoke her dark eyes flared with color and then all he knew turned white continuous the choir sang a chorus whose line he did not understand but knew within it there was reason on and on the ebb and flow of time balance the balance it will come eternal ghastly was the pain shredded was his soul and all else a pure numbing shade of white so white all thought all breath all heartbeat halted arm in arm the two swirled ever higher stretching into a vast space beyond the sky beyond the stars and beyond time itself part two h ow long you think theyll be like that asked the ruffian his leader grunted an unintelligible response the man drew his dagger and thrust it into the ground accompanying it with a grunt of his own come on weve been here for weeks why dont we just gut them and get out of here they were camped deep in the kings forest living off hunted game and growing fouler of mood with every passing day there were nine of them plus their leader the generous coin each of them had accepted eased their complaints a bit but not their boredom more than a few would have considered abandoning their job but they knew karnryk the slayer would have their heads if they left so they stayed grumbled and pushed for a quicker ending to their task the complaining man was marv a bucktoothed scoundrel who bragged often of the many women he had taken at knifepoint he pulled that same knife out from the dirt and pointed to the strange sight that dominated their clearing a man and woman hovered in the air their arms entwined their eyes were open but they did not move their mouths hung low as if in the middle of a scream but they drew no breath the air around them was calm yet still their clothes and hair blew about as if in a great windstorm they were qurrah tun and tessanna delone imprisoned in time by a force unknown whats so important about them marv dared asked karnryk stood to his full height the halforc towering over the scrawny man they dared cross me he said shifting the greatsword on his back so his right arm casually rest upon the hilt and they dared hurt me but go ahead try and kill them youll end up just like stokham stokham was an idiot marv said he glanced around seeking approval from the rest aint that right i know caves less hollow than his head was one man said two turds short of a pigsty said another a couple more nodded then by all means the huge man said gesturing to the floating couple kill them with pleasure marv said licking the edge of his knife after an exaggerated time spent aiming he hurled his weapon its aim was true and had it gone undeterred it would have pierced through qurrahs back and into his heart instead the knife froze in midair an ethereal shield swirling around the couple flared to life white magic crackled around the spherical defense the sound of thunder boomed throughout the clearing wind blew dust scattered a bolt of lightning tore through the air into the forest flew marvs body charred and smoking as his henchman landed with a cracking of brush and leaves karnryk cackled with laughter what he gets for thinking he said to the rest the swirling sphere vanished and all was quiet once more in that dead clearing with the gray grass withered trees and mysterious floating couple w hile the others slept karnryk stayed awake glaring at the two frozen forms the very sight of them sickened his stomach and awakened old pains where the foul demoness had cast her spell their embrace was one of fear and love and while he had no idea the reason for their imprisonment it did not appear willing in truth he didnt care why all that mattered was that their freedom was met with his bloody painful welcome the spherical shield was clearly visible in the moonlight the pale glow reflecting off like flowing water tiny circles of light wafted like smoke from a doused fire glowing a dull blue directly underneath lay the ash and bones of what had been stokham karnryk removed his greatsword and scraped a whetstone across it knowing he needed to keep his blade and his mind sharp dont sleep too long he said its only making me crankier as if in answer a slow rumble shook the clearing a second louder rumble sent his eight minions scrambling out of the cottage some had weapons drawn most did not the halforc swore his original men the ones he had personally trained and kept until the two crazed lovers had butchered them would have made dog meat out of his current crew no matter those he liked he would train the others whatever happened to them happened knock the sleep out of your eyes somethings wrong he roared a rainbow of colors poured out the magical shield flooding the clearing with an unnatural hue karnryk held his sword high above his head about damn time he shouted cracks appeared in the rainbow akin to broken ice atop a frozen lake clean light shone from inside as if it were daylight within the sphere larger and larger the cracks grew until every man there had to look away thunder shook them all air blew in every direction the light vanished the tempest faded the two lovers landed hard both looking as if awakened from a dream grab their hands now karnryk shouted leading the way qurrah staggered to his feet his reactions slow and drunken tessanna remained still her eyes distant and her mouth open tessanna qurrah shouted stand thieves seek our lives out came his whip wrapping around the closest mans neck fire roared he screamed and clawed at his charred flesh as the whip closed tighter and tighter with his other hand qurrah cast a spell blood shot out anothers forehead as if an invisible arrow had struck him qurrah reeled overcome with waves of dizziness when karnryk rammed his hilt into qurrahs gut he vomited all over the blade his hands flailed for something to grab he felt a huge fist yank his robe and hold him steady you dirtied my sword karnryk snarled into his ear his breath stank of rot and again qurrah felt his insides churn a shove sent him to the ground the huge blade hovered before him glistening red and pink from bits of food and vomit lick it clean karnryk ordered lick it or ill cut your damn head off qurrah spat on it instead his reward was a monstrous fist to his face coupled with a welcome return to unconsciousness w hen he awoke his hands were bound behind his back and tied to a rope that looped around his neck even a twitch of his hands tightened them choking his weak throat all around he heard the mutterings and jokes of petty lowlifes the heat of a fire warmed his face and chest summoning the courage he opened his eyes karnryks minions surrounded him a bonfire roared several feet away beside him lay tessanna bound in a similar manner her eyes were open but she seemed sleepy and incoherent on the opposite side of the fire stood karnryk his sword heating in the flame good youre both awake he said now we can start the fun i want to see the fear in your eyes as i cut you to pieces then you will never have your chance qurrah said you cannot scare me a bully with a sword is all you are the things i fear are beyond your abilities really the giant halforc said that so well you dont have to be afraid for me to have my fun pains my true specialty he reached over and grabbed tessanna his giant fingers dwarfed her small neck she made no struggle as he lifted her into the air her body dangling strange to see you with clothes on he said lewdly examining her body last time you didnt seem to mind being naked he took her dress in hand and ripped it exposing her chest his henchmen murmured in approval want some fun he asked her she said nothing with a shrug he tossed her to the ground well youre getting some anyway he said with a nod the first of many came forward undoing the button to his trousers when qurrah looked away karnryk knelt beside him yanked his head by his hair no you look he growled you watch you killed my men she nearly killed me so you better enjoy your fucking reward tessanna showed no emotion as the first pushed up her skirt and pulled down his trousers qurrah watched a burning anger growing in his gut his lover gave no sign of pleasure or displeasure instead remaining perfectly still her eyes far far away without any struggle or signs of life the man raping her beat her face then her chest furious she did not scream she did not fight back she did nothing when he finished the man was furious you have fun with her he told the next in line the second lowered his pants knelt down and howled like a wolf as he entered her qurrah marked him for death first one after another they took her like she was their slave their property their conquest one after another qurrah had to watch bruises covered tessannas face and body blood trickled from her nose and ears only karnryk refused to touch her hating the agonizing throb in his pants it was not until the very last one had finished that she moved her elbows flexed her neck tilted and her black eyes shimmered in a way that sent cold fear creeping through all who had touched her you took me she said looking around without any sign of anger no it seemed to be curiosity and that chilled the men even more you took me while i was awayall of you the ropes that bound her neck and wrists blackened and smoked as if a fire burned them from within a sharp edge entered her voice did you enjoy it she asked the ropes fell to the ground nothing but ash she stood none moved against her an unseen wind blew her hair because i am about to enjoy this black lightning arced to the nearest man into his crotch and then throughout his body he died instantly still none moved her eyes held them still did you watch qurrah she asked bringing her gaze to him the halforc nodded seven have had their way he said then in seven ways i will have mine she said smiling to those around her your deaths will be painful i promise karnryk lifted his sword and screamed for them to attack what happened next was a blur of blade and black magic a chaotic mess in which only tessanna thrived waves of power washed out from her sticking to the eyes of those that did not look away they stumbled around blind one thug launched himself at tessanna wild with fear the girl laughed at his terror then multiplied it tenfold poisonous magic leapt from her fingers and into his mind he sailed past tessanna rolling onto his back he scratched and clawed at his chest finally flaying at it with his knife the whole time he shrieked the maggots the maggots karnryk lunged with his greatsword determined to take his vengeance tessanna saw him coming the corners of her mouth curled into a brief smile a single step back and the sword cut the air where she had been before he could strike again she lunged forward and touched his chest kelakkao she said almost seductively the halforc staggered his entire insides seething like a pit of snakes he fell to his knees as wave after wave of vomit poured from his mouth continuing until blood and acid scorched his throat and splattered the ground below tessanna watched him until the furious cries of those she had blinded changed in sound her spell had worn off they could see again and they sought death she twirled her arms swaying like an elegant dancer with each finger she beckoned them closer amid the death cries qurrah struggled against the ropes that held his hands tight each movement sent horrible pain throughout his throat until he gave up squirming free he glanced about searching for another way a dagger lay nearby but the rope was far too thick then he saw his whip for whatever reason untouched from when he had dropped it the halforc crawled on his belly like a worm until he reached it he put his back to it so that his hands could close around the handle instantly it sprang to life not yet he said to it first my freedom the leather wrapped around his wrists and at his command burst into flame the initial fire did not harm his flesh but when the rope itself started to burn so did his skin qurrah closed his eyes and endured the pain hoping something remained of his hands by the time the rope broke r ise pale moon for i am alone she sang a haunting melody accompanied by an orchestra of wind eruptions of blood and the screams of men hide burning sun day waits anon black flame roared out of her hands scattering back any who approached only four remained alive three terrified men and karnryk to each one she turned singing a lyric sing night birds night needs beauty an ethereal arrow struck the back of one mans head as he fled blood shot from his ears and then he fell dig grave man then leave me be the second one hurled his dagger it struck her side drawing blood she dipped a hand in her own wound and let it soak red goodbye pale moon for i am alone she sang removing her hand and grinning at it magic poured out of her the blood stiffened took shape and flew seven hardened balls shredded the dagger throwers face and punched out the back of his skull only one left before she faced karnryk goodbye burning sun see me no more the final fell to his knees and begged for mercy tessanna tilted her head as if confused tears ran down this mans face as he groveled like a dog unable to bear the sight of his companions brutal deaths the girl answered him with another lyric goodbye night birds dirt fills my ears she cast her spell his eyes blasted out his body by a great surge of blood and his body shriveled and curled in obscene ways she ended her song smiling at the beautiful sight of death she had created goodbye grave man cover me in the morn the sound of movement made her turn she felt no worry pure euphoria swirled inside her head she was a goddess among mortals none would dare strike her karnryk was a furious warrior proud and arrogant he had no respect for goddesses as tessanna stared incredulously he shoved his greatsword through her stomach the tip tore out her back the blade soaked in gore she gasped as her blood poured out wheres your magical armor now bitch he asked spitting on her face gone as is your life qurrah said from behind karnryk turned his blood chilling surrounding the necromancer in strange orbits were the bones of his dead hirelings numbering in the hundreds with but a thought they assaulted his eyes cold qurrah watched as karnryk staggered about surrounded by a tornado of bone that shredded his flesh stabbed his eyes and bruised every bit of exposed skin down he fell unable to withstand the torture still the bones struck faster and faster their chalky white turning red qurrah was not satisfied you struck her he said his voice a low seething sound suffer for your sins the pieces of bone dug deeper into his eyes sharp rib bones broke through his teeth and poured down his innards when the necromancer approached the remaining bones parted for him he yanked karnryks bloody mess of a face by the hair and whispered into his ear i will torture you even after death he said you will yearn for the abyss and you will not be granted its reprieve he shoved his fingers deep into karnryks eye sockets the bones lodged there pushed farther in deep into nerve tissue spasms wracked his body and for the only time he screamed hemorrhage qurrah hissed dark magic poured into the remnants of the halforcs body qurrah yanked his hand free as a great explosion of blood and brain burst from where karnryks face had been when the body collapsed to the ground karnryk was already on his way to the abyss qurrah tessanna said the sword still through her waist she lay on her side her legs paralyzed the sword had shifted when its point touched dirt grinding against her spine qurrah rushed to her kneeling down and grabbing her hands tessanna im so sorry he said i should have acted sooner i should have shut up tessanna said her face pale and cold i hear the singing again those were her only words overcome with grief he placed his hands on the giant hilt and apologized before yanking the sword free holding in a sob he wrapped his arms around the painfully light body of his lover dont die on me he said you cant die the lack of breath and heartbeat insisted otherwise but qurrah would not accept it delysia can heal you he said staggering south with her in his arms each step sent more blood dribbling across his knees everything was strange it seemed the stars had shifted and the warmth of summer seemed lost into autumn the trek south through the woods was the longest darkest time qurrah had ever experienced n o cloud dimmed the light of a single star the eschaton mercenaries had just eliminated a troublesome band of thieves with delusions of creating a new guild haern had given them the choice of death or surrender their leader had drawn his weapons the rest surrendered when they saw how quickly he died nothing like a job well done tarlak said after depositing the thieves at the prison this place always depresses me delysia said pulling her robe tight about her lets go home all glanced to aurelia who frowned at them what am i your wagon she asked the night is peaceful we can walk unless someone else is capable of opening a portal home what about your kid brug asked you should get home not safe and all right another frown nice try aulliennas fine bunch of whiners all of you they left town traveling across the beaten path west harruq and aurelia walked hand in hand smiling as the wind blew against their faces haern let down his hood shaking free his golden hair tarlak led the way babbling to the assassin about the idiocy of common thuggery in veldaren when they reached the tower everything changed someone awaits us haern whispered seeing a deviation in the shadows at the door aurelias keener eyes widened as she saw what waited there its qurrah she said when harruq heard he ran ahead a smile spreading across his face qurrah he shouted as he neared qurrah his smile faded when he was close enough to see brother he asked qurrah looked up and to harruqs great surprise he saw tears he held the pale body of tessanna in his arms her limbs hung limp her eyes closed blood soaked her clothes which were ripped and torn harruq took a shocked step forward as his brother spoke please qurrah said i need help please help me more and more tears rolled along his cheek past his thin lips down the gray of his chin and then falling falling until breaking atop the dead face of the girl with blackest of eyes w hat happened harruq asked he saw blood everywhere and tessannas face was a deathly white just help me qurrah shrieked everything inside him broke he buried his face in her hair and cried the rest of the eschaton mercenaries arrived stunned and confused let me see her delysia said rushing past the others she put a hand on qurrah only to have him shove her away when he looked up his eyes were a bloody red the priestess saw the wound on tessannas stomach and gasped help her qurrah said realizing who it was please i know you what you do please help her delysia put her hand on tessannas neck and another on her breast for a quiet moment she closed her eyes and when she opened them again her look contained only sorrow she is dead qurrah she said her heart is still her breath is gone im sorry shes not dead he cried staggering to his feet he held tessannas body close you have healing spells cast them on her qurrah it will do no good do it harruq said his face solemn please just do it anyway delysia glanced to him and then to her brother tarlak nodded his approval very well qurrah give her body to harruq we need to get her inside qurrah reluctantly obeyed harruq lifted her in his arms grunting at how light she was and he shuddered at the strange ways her tightened muscles resisted movement he laid her body on the long table inside everyone gathered about watching in silence except tarlak who moved to qurrahs side who did this he asked a giant halforc qurrah said he wielded a greatsword and had many men with him karnryk the wizard said he posted a bounty for your whereabouts months ago what did you ever do to him about a year back he said watching delysia preparing her healing rituals when dieredon came to speak with aurelia they were sneaking through the forest toward the tower their intentions were ill so we struck them only karnryk survived somehow tarlak nodded stroking his beard in thought suddenly he stopped a year ago he asked qurrah gave him a quizzical look but tarlak shook his head he would inquire about it later pure white light enveloped delysias hands she put them across tessannas chest letting the healing magic flow into her body nothing happened she cast another spell plunging the light deep into her wounds nothing happened she cast a third spell a fourth nothing happened shes not dead qurrah said watching her please keep trying delysia glanced up her eyes filled with pity i will try for you she said sweat covered her brow and her head hung heavy all were silent as she worked every spell of healing she could cast she did when finished and still no change had taken place she rest her arms on the table and gasped for air i am sorry she said i can do no more she is gone qurrah beyond all that i can do no you must you must keep she is dead qurrah delysia shouted her exhaustion overruling her kindness you are no fool you know this just as well as i the two glared at one another neither backing down um guys harruq said drawing their attention to the body whats going on a tiny light hovered above tessannas breast shining a myriad of faint colors the room darkened as if the tiny ball of color sucked in all available light the seven were lost to bewilderment as feminine voices filled their ears singing softly faster the colors changed pulsing with an eerie power louder grew the singing an ominous throng tinged with triumph and victory the singing ended the light plunged into her chest the darkness of the room faded tessanna coughed tess qurrah said rushing to her side he latched onto her hand and kissed her face delysia stared at the womans waist where the vicious wound was all but gone thank you the halforc said his face pressed against his lovers as tears streamed down his cheeks delysia turned to tarlak who stared at her in wonder what did you do he asked that was not me she said whatever that was i do not understand not my work tar not my miracle we should find out tarlak said wrapping an arm around his sister as he watched tessanna stir as if from a long slumber riddles are interesting only when people are not involved t arlak placed a cot in his room reluctantly agreeing to let delysia sleep there their two guests slept in his sisters room as long as she behaves she can stay the wizard told qurrah the halforc stayed by tessannas side long after she sank into sleep when he felt certain the rest of the tower slept he crept down the stairs harruq however waited for him at the bottom leaning against the door where you going he asked outside qurrah said what is it you want just to talk to my brother he said havent seen you in forever i would hardly call a month forever he replied his voice ached with exhaustion his ragged whisper painful to hear harruq crossed his arms and blocked the way when qurrah tried to leave a month he asked try eighteen aullienna is almost two you didnt even come to celebrate her birth harruq was not ready for the shock that came over his brothers face eighteen months he said his eyes grew distant as he remembered the magic that had encapsulated them what was it the center had said even time itself would protect her could it be that long he wondered aloud what now harruq asked time qurrah said dismissing the thoughts with a shake of his head it is amazing how fast it moves when you least expect it my apologies for our separation he beckoned to the door may i leave or am i held prisoner only tonight harruq said you look like you can barely stand go to bed do whatever you want to do after a good nights rest ever the protector qurrah said a smile growing against his will i guess i will submit this time good night harruq nighters qurrah the halforc slunk back up the stairs into delysias room and under the covers next to tessanna he wrapped his arms around her waist relishing the soft feel of her flesh succumbing to sleep his last parting thought was how he could still feel the blood drying on his hands w hen he awoke the night was deep and a single candle lit the room his arms were empty tess he asked rising on one elbow the girl sat at the edge of the bed blankets huddled about her i hurt you didnt i she asked her shoulders trembled and qurrah thought he heard crying i always do always qurrah rubbed the sleep from his eyes and looked at the length of her hair you did not hurt me tessanna you protected me come lie down she glanced back her eyes voids unfilled in the dark tears ran from them are you sure really sure the halforc threw off his blanket and stepped on the cold stone floor he groggily walked before tessanna who looked away his hand took her chin and forced her to face him i would go to the abyss and back for you he said and then do it once more to ensure peace in your mind she smiled briefly i heard the singing again she said her tears continuing it was so beautiful they were talking to me and their voices so sweet but the words please why did they have to say those words what words he asked resting her face in the palm of his hand they called me something they called me daughter they called me balance and thenand then she shrieked tearing at her face with her fingernails qurrah grabbed her wrists fighting her wild thrashing as blood flecked the white sheets she clawed at her flesh howling like an animal cease this qurrah snarled thankfully she did she slumped into his arms and sobbed they said i am broken so i may fix that which is breaking she whispered in between sobs they said i am to killbut my purposemy purpose dont talk love qurrah said holding her tight not if it pains you this much no she said shuddering please let me say it so i may forget it you remember it for me alright the halforc nodded i will they kept singing all these voices did you hear them their voices were pretty but they sang ugly things forgive me my daughter forgive me my child your path was done before you were born forgive me for you are to destroy all that is beautiful you will ruin all that is golden you will tarnish shatter your reflection let the balance go on eternal tears streamed down her face as she finished forgive me for your time was unkind but all is how your mother decreed it be she fell into silence qurrah pondered over the words as he held his love tight you are not meant for such things he whispered to her you will not destroy you will not bring ruin the voices are wrong i dont want to hurt people she whispered back not those who are kind to me i never mean to i hurt them i never know why but now maybe i do know mother wants me to hurt them i shouldnt disappoint her mad giggles interrupted her crying qurrah felt the hair on the back of his neck stand erect as her body shook with laughter mommy wants me to kill i should be a good daughter and obey who does she want dead though good daughters should obey without question but im not that good who to kill who to kill snap out of it tess the halforc said perhaps you perhaps tarlak your brother she leapt from the bed and danced in the loose dress she wore dried blood still covered it and there was a gaping hole in the cloth where karnryks greatsword had punched through is it delysia ooh i just felt my skin shiver maybe it is her but no someone else mommy says its someone else someone just like me shatter my reflection she said i should obey all good girls obey right qurrah qurrah stood his fists clenching tessanna ignored him turning to the simple dresser carved from stained oak a small circular mirror hovered above it held by twin supports carved in the shape of doves the girl pranced over cackling she smashed it with her forehead showering the dresser with bleeding shards she smiled back at qurrah blood rolling down her face and around the corners of her lips i did it she giggled and it felt good the halforc said nothing as he crossed the room he put his left hand on her shoulder and held her firm i love you tessanna he said i love you too qurrah she said qurrah struck her across the face hard the girl slumped to the ground unconscious for a long while he stood there taking in great shuddering breaths as he prayed for his heart to slow forgive me he said to her pulling her onto the bed he covered her with blankets tucked them in and then retrieved a cloth and a bowl of water carefully he removed the pieces of the mirror and cleaned the blood from her face when finished he kissed her forehead tired beyond reason he sat on the bed pondering what it meant for tessanna to be a daughter of balance a s all of veldaren slept a man slipped through the shadows his torn clothes were stained and stunk of feces he wore no shoes his scabbed hands clutched the shutters of a window his eyes gazed inside seeing a small child he smiled as he drew his dagger in daylight he was mocked and scorned in daylight his mind was a shattered broken frailty in the darkness he was the reaper the child cried out only once before the dagger plunged his father staggered in from the other room a club in his hand whats going on he shouted the bed was empty the room was empty the window was open two hours later a guard patrol found the body pieces of it were missing others were in the wrong place so appalling were the remains that within the hour a bounty was already posted offering two hundred gold pieces for the capture of the veldaren reaper q urrah and tessanna were the last to come down for breakfast aullienna ran about the room playing with small wooden toys brug had carved as they took their seats qurrah held in his shock the last time he had seen her she had been a tiny thing in a cradle yet now she jumped stumbled and prattled nonsense that could almost be words qurrah ate with the feeling of being a trespasser how long will you be staying here tarlak asked as the meal neared an end we will be gone by tomorrows eve qurrah said we would hate to be a bother nonsense harruq said youre more than welcome here can you at least stay another week you ask the wrong person qurrah said with a chuckle it is delysias room that we occupy i dont mind at all delysia said feeling multiple sets of eyes on her stay as long as you wish my brother is not as great a nuisance as he seems brug let out a satisfied belch leaned back in his chair and looked at qurrah so your scorpion working right he asked in response the halforc reached into his cloak and retrieved the token it immediately sprang to life and crawled up qurrahs arm snuggling into the cloth on his shoulder i believe it is quite fond of me if such emotion is possible for it he said it might be tried to make the thing lifelike as possible glad to know it aint keeled off harruq watched the scorpion a slight grin on his face so that was your pendant he asked qurrah nodded harruq pulled out a similar looking scorpion on a chain you ever see mine he asked he held it out for his brother who briefly examined it like everything else of brugs workmanship the piece was perfectly and intricately carved just by touching it qurrah could sense the magic flowing within what does it do he asked makes his swords stronger brug answered obviously pleased he can cut through stone if he swings hard enough considering the magic inside those swords already shoddy blades just shatter against his quite a gift qurrah said yeah i thought you might someone is coming tessanna interrupted saying her first words of the day she glanced about her face ashen and her voice emotionless he wont like me i know it he kills people like me who tarlak asked rising from his chair the rest of the mercenaries stood as well preparing their weapons hes here she whispered two loud thumps came from the door the sound of a fist smashing the wood aullienna come here aurelia said the girl sensed the urgency in her mothers voice and frowned she dropped her toy and rushed over taking her mothers hand into hers haern tarlak asked i will see the assassin said pulling his hood low he drew his sabers and approached the door again the stranger knocked twice as the second knock ended haern flung open the doors the stranger staggered back as the curve of haerns blade pressed against his neck your name haern whispered lathaar of the citadel the man answered bowing even though the sword remained against the soft skin of his throat may ashhur grant you peace all the worry rapidly melted away from tarlaks face replaced with joy lathaar he exclaimed rushing past haern to embrace the man delysia was right behind him with a chaste kiss on each cheek tessanna slunk to the back of the room even as the others warmly welcomed him brug pumped his arm and haern exchanged a bow everyone i want you to meet my best friend he said letting the man into the tower may i present lathaar paladin of ashhur the man bowed deeply and gracefully long brown hair was carefully trimmed his eyes twinkled also a soft brown his nose was a bit too large and his cheeks too thin but his smile lit up his face as well as the room qurrah felt his whip seethe and curl itching for his hand to take its hilt he fought it down with effort the paladin took aurelias free hand extended his right leg and then bowed deeply kissing her hand at his lowest point aurelia blushed immediately smitten harruq seeing her swooning had to resist his temptation to punch the man in the face may i have your name precious gem of the elves he asked aurelia tun she said and the child he asked aullienna hid behind her mothers leg she had a round face and rounder cheeks her sharp nose was reminiscent of her father while her tiny ears were clearly aurelias lathaar knelt down and reached into his pocket with a disarming smile he pulled out a small object wrapped in paper and offered it to the girl when she did not take it he removed the paper revealing a hard piece of candy her name is aullienna aurelia answered gently urging her daughter forward the shy girl reached out took the gift and then retreated sucking noisily adorable child lathaar said rising to his feet and the father that would be me harruq said crossing his arms the paladin did not miss a beat instead he grinned gesturing once more to aullienna her shyness certainly did not come from you greetings halforc he outstretched his hand harruq stared at it then yielded after a fierce jab from aurelias elbow im harruq tun he said using all his strength when they shook hands to his surprise the mans grip was just as strong and his smile never wavered he glanced about the entry room with a look of nostalgia when his eyes swept across qurrah and tessanna however his smile faltered for the first time by ashhur he whispered lathaar meet the two newest additions to our little family tarlak said sensing the atmosphere tighten the halforc is qurrah tun and the lovely lady tessanna delone lathaar did his best to recover he extended his hand but neither accepted it he brought it back down with no sign of insult you say you are of the citadel qurrah said yet i hear the citadel has fallen i am still of the citadel lathaar said his grin faltering whether it has fallen or not anyway tarlak said trying to change the subject come on upstairs well find a room for you with haern perhaps i havent seen you inwell how long has it been three years the paladin replied the two approached the stairs followed by a rather large procession only qurrah tessanna and harruq stayed on the bottom floor he wont hurt you tess harruq said to the girl who remained at the corner of the room his kind is the bane of what we are qurrah said you are quick to side with your friends harruq the warrior snorted youre just paranoid he joined his wife upstairs feeling the cold stare of his brother as he went when they were alone tessanna pulled her robe tight and peered at her lover with childlike eyes ill try to be good she said her voice just above a whisper while were here while hes here ill try to be good is that good qurrah is that what i should do the necromancer sighed feeling the whip slacken on his arm yes tessanna for now that is what must be done t hat night lathaar sat with tarlak by the fire a glass of wine in tarlaks hand flavored water in lathaars he looked much more relaxed without all his armor with his hair brushed and his face cleaned he looked all the more handsome the rest of the eschaton were in bed at least as far as they knew so where have you been the past few years asked the wizard i was worried sick especially with all those dark paladins crawling around vultures they are i never meant to be gone so long lathaar said rolling the water across his tongue to guess the flavor he had tasted grapes once and intermixed with them in the water he swore he detected a hint of peach i crossed the river into mordan seeking refuge in the sanctuary the priests there were kind and i learned much from them but their way is not mine they focus on healing and prayer the edge of my sword needs neither never been much for the softer side of your profession tarlak said with a grin blame mornida lolathan was the strongest of our casters but he the paladin sighed tarlak i have long meant to ask you i have seen things in dreams and they trouble me i think it a memory i lost long ago it is about your teacher tarlak frowned placing the wine down on a small table next to him you have your stories and i have mine madral is dead now lathaar he died by my hand lathaar nodded glad to know such a powerful servant of karak had been eliminated he killed lolathan he said right before my eyes and then bid me forget it with his magic sorollos brought down the citadel but madral helped him rise to power such things will be made right again tarlak sipped his wine ashhur does not slumber i am sure your path was set for a reason a reason i have already seen lathaar said chuckling by any chance have you heard of the mountain of gold tarlak nearly choked on his wine you found it found it lathaar laughed aye i did and i walked through its tunnels which glittered like the gates to the golden eternity it was all a ruse tarlak a ruse my friend malik fell susceptible to do you know what is buried beneath the demon darakken is supposedly sealed inside tarlak mused please tell me where is this mountain it was elfspire lathaar said right there deep in the stonewood forest you jest there is too much to tell but two protected the mountain one was a mimic of a servant of karak a rather frightening creature mira told me the name of their kind dorual tarlak nodded creatures of purest dark they cannot survive in the daylight claws like longswords teeth sharp as knives you fought one i did and it is a battle i would prefer to never fight again lathaar leaned forward and his voice dropped in volume but there was another with the creature a girl named mira the one beside qurrah with the black eyes and hair does she have a sister a sister tarlak shook his head i hope not one is enough for dezrel but there is more than one said the paladin of that i am certain mira could be her twin even their voices are similar this girl tessanna tessanna does she possess powerful magic the wizard frowned obviously troubled yes she does very powerful from what i sense mira is the same lathaar said almost like a goddess i thank ashhur that i now count her as a friend for the darkness i sense from tessanna worries me anyway back to darakken tarlak said urging him on with his hand against my wishes malik obtained a small army from the king of mordan and they marched upon elfspire to fight them mira created more of the dorual sacrificing elves to do so the conflict was brutal many men died most to miras magic the mountain was spared i take it malik did not know what was in the mountain the wizard asked none of us did i learned only after when mira showed me the council of mages received word of the battle and they came seeking darakkens spellbook its a powerful item tarlak said gulping down the rest of his wine rumored to be the oldest of magical tomes of all dezrel the council released the demon lathaar continued a giant thing with charred flesh and ebony claws it had these enormous wings stretching twenty feet to either side i swear the sword it wielded was longer than i am tall the spells it cast lathaar stopped drank some of his water and pondered for a time we banded together with the surviving council members i still am in awe of the spells ice boulders streams of fire bigger than houses magical missiles by the hundreds you should have seen it tarlak the eldest of magics it shrugged off too bad i wasnt there the wizard chuckled a few of my spells and hed go down like a baby sorry tar but a few of your spells might have tickled it only mira could match its power his eyes twinkled with wonder she looked like a goddess then tarlak when i saw her thats what i thought i was staring at the power of a goddess even still she faltered and darakken nearly killed her what happened then ashhur granted me strength to fight it my blade became an elholad and i battled it as best i could elholad tarlak asked come now dont jest with a wizard we dish out well but are terrible on the receiving end lathaar stood and drew his longsword bright light enveloped it its strength mirroring the faith of its wielder the paladin closed his eyes whispered and then held the blade high calmly saying the word elholad all traces of metal from the sword vanished in a great flare the weapon became a perfect creation of light shimmering with blue and gold he cut the air twice displaying its incredible lack of weight the light vanished when lathaar sheathed it and returned to his seat tarlak whistled that is a rare gift of ashhur the wizard said few paladins in all history wielded such a blade ashhur knew i needed it lathaar said his grin fading as he sat back and looked to the floor even then my strength was not enough i faltered in both heart and mind by the grace of ashhur we were saved for he answered my prayers with an angel ive seen so much these past few years but none surpasses its beauty i can only remember it vaguely as if in a dream but there is no white on this land that matches the hue of its robes and no armor made like that which adorned its chest and shoulders it did not kill darakken i believe it waited for me when i stabbed darakkens leg the creature reared back in pain and then the angel beheaded it the energy of its death knocked me unconscious for several hours you killed darakken tarlak said thoroughly amazed an army of elves could not strike it dead you dont look stronger than an elven army no disagreement here the spellbook tarlak said i must hear of the spellbook did it remain upon the demons death lathaars face grew dark aye there is no way to destroy it we debated what to do i even considered bringing it to you the wizard visibly sickened the words in that tome would cry against my very being lathaar ashhur keep me from ever looking upon its pages so what became of it i took it to the sanctuary youre one of few i have told of its existence if we are lucky the book will pass to myth and legend tarlak poured himself another glass of wine and drained half of it in one gulp so why is it you come here did you miss me actually i did lathaar let out a hearty laugh here is as much of a home as i have anywhere i decided it had been too long i would come here to visit and propose an idea tarlak grinned knew there was a reason out with it my friend i want to rebuild the citadel lathaar said i need money i need men and i need a designer up to the task the wizard sighed far beyond me money i have and i do know influential people but not enough for such a grand undertaking cant the priests of ashhur help i am here to speak with them as well i cannot let karak claim victory i refuse to be the last paladin of ashhur well discuss this more tomorrow tarlak said finishing his glass let me sleep on it alright many thanks lathaar said the two stood and embraced as they headed for bed qurrah dashed upstairs having heard every word m orning came tessanna refused to join everyone as they broke their fast qurrah said nothing of it and no one asked a few jokes were exchanged mouths were stuffed and lathaar told a tale from his travels halfway through the meal aulliennas crying cascaded down the stairs you gonna get that hun harruq asked his mouth full of food her look was icy shes just throwing a fit because she wants downstairs aurelia said and why is it i should go tarlak and haern exchanged knowing glances how it works youre better at shutting her up again the icy glare brug let out a choked chuckle im not finished eating she said gesturing to her plate harruq shrugged and gestured to his plate as well perhaps it is wrong for me to intrude haern said jabbing harruq in his side but you should go and get your blades anyway we shall be sparring soon the halforc glanced to his friend his face full of betrayal i can go get them later you can go get them now the assassin whispered wondering how the halforc could be so dense when harruq continued eating aurelia rolled her eyes and gave up ill get the swords while im up there she said rising from her seat but that will be the only thing gotten in there for the next few nights brug roared with laughter and tarlak joined in harruq glanced about looking like a surprised deer what he blurted whathey shut up all of you aurelia kissed him on the cheek and glided up the stairs she rolled her eyes as she reached halfway for her daughters crying had ceased she certainly did not miss the multiple feedings and the starvation of sleep but she was starting to understand why so many told her it was the second year to fear not to make the trip pointless she continued on figuring she could get her thickheaded husbands swords her skin chilled when she reached the top their door was wide open sitting on her knees with her back to the door was tessanna run kittykitty said the girl in a singsong voice i see a big dog yes i do climb kittykitty big dogs coming and he comes for you peals of laughter erupted from aulliennas mouth as tessanna tickled her making funny growling sounds as she did more the little elf girl cried i see a kittykitty yes i do black and brown and a bit of blue meow kittykitty hungry little lass chase the mice chase the mice arent they fast aullienna smiled mimicking gestures tessanna made with her hands her tiny fingers fumbled the movements but tessanna would reach out and mold them correctly she pretended her hand was a cat and before aullienna pulled away the cat pounced nooo she shouted her eyes wide as her smile as she leaned forward giggling she saw her mother mama were playing tessanna lurched to her feet and retreated away with downcast eyes im sorry she said she was crying and i thought she was lonely ill go no aurelia said stopping her you may stay if aullienna wishes just promise me you wonthurt her the sincerity in her black eyes was impossible to deny never would i hurt a child she said never do you want tessanna to stay with you a little while longer aurelia asked her daughter the girl bounced her head up and down shes plays shes a kitty kittykitty and a mouse the mouse didnt do a good job running away tessanna said sitting next to her on the illusionary grass she needs to learn mice are sneaky she acted as if aurelia were not even there her hand crouched and jerked about accompanied by twitching noises aurelia watched them play torn in the end she did what felt right she let them be y ou wanted to see me tar harruq asked poking his head into the wizards room it had been three days since lathaar moved in and with qurrah and tessanna also staying in the tower things had been chaotic the halforc frowned when he saw his wife standing next to him a dark expression on her face tarlak looked equally serious can you read he asked long as the letters are big and the words are small he said flicking his eyes back and forth neither found this amusing aurelia handed him a small piece of parchment he read it struggling only occasionally to make out the words tarlak eschaton leader of the eschaton mercenaries the formal bounty is already announced but due to the increasing brutality of the murders i antonil copernus guard captain of veldaren and servant to our great king vaelor offer an additional seven hundred gold pieces above the current eight hundred if you bring me the culprit known as the veldaren reaper this increase is only if he is alive he has taken twelve children cut their throats and done atrocities improper to list in complete detail this bounty shall diminish a hundred gold for every body henceforth found in such a manner i am confident you may stop the loss of life given the fine skill of your mercenaries loyal servant of neldar antonil copernus by the time he finished his hands were shaking and the final words were a blur you think its qurrah he said it was no question it was an accusation the night they returned that very same night these murders began tarlak said and i have spoken with your wife you and your brother were the forest butchers of woodhaven the details of the murders as well as the targets qurrah is killing children once more aurelia interrupted without you but he is blood surged to harruqs face and a thousand thoughts jumbled his mind he tried to say something but nothing seemed right it is without you isnt it aurelia asked quieter i made a promise he said pieces coming together in his mind and i havent broken that promise but qurrahs made no such promise to me or you ill talk with him he tossed the paper to the wizard we need more than talk tarlak said rising from his chair as the paper fluttered to his desk we need guarantees perhaps it isnt him well be patrolling the streets tonight just in case do what you can i do not take the death of children lightly harruq ive seen what you are now and any worshipper of ashhur should know that a man can change but some dont harruq nodded his eyes distant deep down he felt a bitter sting he had changed he knew he had and welcomed it as much as he feared it but he was not his brother he turned and marched out the door aurelia watched him go sadness in her eyes can he stop him the wizard asked when she said nothing he wrapped his arms around her shoulders and held her much as a father might hold a child things will turn out right in the end but i will not harbor a man who commits such acts he loves qurrah so much she said i dont want him hurt qurrah will hurt him aurry we both know it all that matters is when and what becomes of the two afterward they both glared at the letter as if it were an intruder in their home bringing only poison and pain aurelia flicked her fingers and burned it to ash we will catch whoever is doing these things she said and i pray to celestia we catch a stranger t essanna and aullienna danced together in the grass playing like neither held a care in the world qurrah quietly watched feeling a tugging on his heart he was yet to decipher it always hit hardest when tessanna would scoop the little girl into her arms and share in her laughter a loud bang turned him about harruq stormed over his face flushed qurrah stood preparing for some sort of ill news why harruq asked his whole body trembling with rage whyd you have to continue like this like what brother qurrah said his own cold anger growing at the sudden unexpected attack dont lie to me the children in veldaren its you doing it the necromancer frowned his eyes narrowed down to thin serpentine slits do you accuse me out of proof or conjecture i know nothing of what you speak but your anger is enough children have died in the city when harruq said nothing the halforc smirked i take it their deaths were gruesome their entrails smeared across the streets any fool can desecrate a body yet you come running already judging me guilty tessanna halted her playing watching the two with her black eyes aullienna sensed her seriousness and frowned she tugged on the womans dress up she cried tessanna scooped her into her arms and with tears in her eyes she held the little girl close did you do it or not harruq asked the question is dear brother why do you care qurrah chuckled the laughter hiding his fury do you suddenly regret all that you have been are you now willing to wish death and judgment on one who must kill fifty more children to rival the blood that stains your hands its not right killing them harruq shouted his face inches away from qurrahs dont you get it theyre someones son someones daughter no different from aullienna id kill any man a hundred times over for laying a finger on her all that shit about saving them from lifes tortures and not a word was true life is not suffering your life is not suffering qurrah said but there are a million others who live under the same sun who do not agree you are but a flailing child in this realm harruq and no prowess with blades will ever change that your wisdom is like a worm lodged in an oak do you dare tell me what is right and what is wrong damn it qurrah just listen no qurrah shouted throwing magical power into his voice i will not kneel to my own brother there was a reason i left this tower and now i remember why i dont want to leave tessanna said drawing both their ire i like it here i like aullienna youre not leaving qurrah tun tarlak said exiting the tower until i know who this veldaren reaper is you may consider yourself a permanent guest surely you understand in case qurrah didnt his hand slipped into one of his deep pockets fingering a sparkling wand etched with sapphires tessanna sensed movement behind her as she watched should this turn ill i would hate for aullienna to be hurt haern whispered into her ear let me take the child aullienna who had begun crying saw haern and reached for him tessanna relinquished the child why aullienna asked her shrieks turning to sniffles they are hurt haern whispered to her for different reasons perhaps but the hurt is the same he took her into the tower tessanna qurrah said drawing the womans attention away from the child do you mind the stay it is fine she said her voice quiet and uncertain i just want to play with aullienna come inside then tarlak insisted well figure all this out qurrah ignored the squirming of the whip around his arm and accepted t he halforc poured over his tome as the stars braved the darkening sky tessanna quietly watched him she did not want to break his concentration nor did she want his attention she just wanted to feel his touch against her arm as he read next to her that was all harruq poked his head into the room as if he were a robber well be back before morning he said i hold confidence in your abilities to catch such a madman qurrah said not looking up from his reading exonerate me quickly so i may leave in peace yeah sure thing he left qurrah showed no sign he cared an hour passed and like thieves in the night the eschaton mercenaries scoured the streets and rooftops of veldaren seeking its reaper as the hour ended qurrah abruptly shut his book and rose from the bed where are you going tessanna asked seeing him pull low his hood and wrap his whip about his arm i will find this knave whose meddling has turned my brother against me he said i will return before the others please come back soon tessanna said her eyes wide i can be alone but right now i dont want to be aullienna sleeps in the highest room he said as he opened the door go to her if you must he hurried down the stairs and into the deepening night tessanna sat on the bed her knees curled against her chest she gazed into nothing for her mind was on the man she had grown to love if love was indeed what she felt desperate for the emotion she made her way up the stairs slid open the door and stepped inside stars mimicking the real location of the night sky covered the roof a soft breeze blew across her skin her bare feet brushed the wooden steps to aulliennas bed but she did not go up knowing the child was nearby was enough she lay on her side her head on her arms and did her best to stay awake w here is it you hide fledgling killer qurrah asked as he searched the streets he closed his eyes reopening them with a sight known only to those who walked the darkest roads of life what he saw shook his chest and made his heart stumble come find me chosen of karak come find your savior come find your killer follow the blood fool come find me across every wall this message throbbed in a deep purple to normal eyes it would be unseen or glimpsed only in passing and then immediately forgotten qurrah saw it it splattered buildings as if the previous nights rain had been of blood more ran along the dirt crisscrossing in tiny streams that clogged the gutters and merged into great rivers leading west fledgling you are not qurrah said but i am no fool he waved his hand and cast a spell the blood faded dissipating as if it had never been the writing on the walls vanished only the river remained for he wished it so some illusions did have purpose he dashed down the street following the river haern leaping from rooftop to rooftop passed over the area qurrah had been but a second too late his eyes seeing only shadow where he would have seen the necromancer hurrying away s een anything unusual tarlak asked the tun couple the time the bodies have been found varies greatly aurelia said we must be patient or perhaps hes just not killing tonight harruq grumbled his meaning clear a lack of killing this night does not prove him guilty tarlak told him although it sure doesnt help him either keep looking stick to the poorer parts of town it seems our killer prefers them as his hunting grounds they broke apart harruq and aurelia south tarlak east traveling below them a shield of darkness wrapped about his body was qurrah he followed the blood river west n othing marked the alley different from any other not unless one looked with the hidden sight runes marred both buildings beside it they were ancient symbols of death hatred and exile written in an archaic script the entrance was blocked by a broken cart filled with rotted fruit only a tiny gap remained and qurrah knew it was made for him he stared into the unnatural darkness within whoever this person was he had done the killings with purpose and his gut told him it was to bring them together i am here he said to the alley and i fear not who resides within he entered a waiting man sat before a dead fire he looked nineteen twenty at most his skin was pale and thin his eyes were the darkest shade of blue he had ever seen every feature on his body suggested hunger and suffering on a healthy man his nose would have seemed pointed so in his emaciated state it was jagged and thin the sagging of such a young face darkened every feature and placed a visage about the eyes that shrieked hatred and anger so many years the man said he remained seated and did not welcome his guest your name i must know the name of karaks chosen you have not earned it nor have you given me yours qurrah said sensing the shadows swirling about him i have no name the man said his smile vanishing i have lost the honor of karaks title for a time i was xelrak death bringer of our dark god the name turned qurrahs stomach he recognized the name velixar had spoken it in purest contempt you are the one who brought low the citadel the halforc said a puppet of velixar the man who had been xelrak chuckled at the name i owe much to velixar both gratitude and suffering he found me as an orphan gave me life when i should have died and then raised me as his student karaks blessing was greatest then and i rivaled even velixar in power his shallow face smiled your power would have faded the second you turned upon the man qurrah said enjoying the hurt and anger that flared in those horrific eyes they looked like dams before a river of insanity and the years had formed many cracks what do you know of velixar xelrak asked did he tell you of his past of his creation i know he died to ashhurs hand and karak brought him back to serve that was hundreds of years ago the other necromancer said so long he has walked this land i have searched for him but karaks whispers are clear i am not to meet him until i meet with you you will never meet him not until the abyss qurrah said velixar is dead he expected the man to be shocked or at least flustered but instead he laughed dead you think him dead i dreamt of that battle halforc i saw your cowardice and abandonment it may take time but he will return karak has sworn this to me qurrahs unease only grew something was amiss and the knowledge of velixar returning did little to help he had thought him dead he had almost wanted him dead his life with tessanna happened only because of his passing what would happen if he returned why did you bring me here qurrah asked wishing to remain no longer your name the starved man snarled i will speak no more until i know your name i am qurrah tun now tell me your reason things are rumbling xelrak said rumblings in the realm of gods you are blind even karaks closest servants are blind but i have been told i was his chosen but i lost my masters favor i must regain it he stood his robe was identical to qurrahs only faded and filthier dark magic crackled at his fingertips give me your power master he shrieked and laughed and cried long has been my exile but let me prove my worth to you before qurrahs eyes karak granted him that very wish lightning struck the ground swarming through the frail form that was xelrak blood and faith mixed and from the deepest pits of the abyss magic came forth the blue eyes shone with power his smile was of pure pleasure i have no reason to kill you qurrah said summoning his own magic in defense the stalemate shall soon be ended xelrak shouted in triumph one of us will lead the world into darkness qurrah or xelrak and it must be the stronger a blast of pure raw energy shot from his fingertips its color deeper than the chasms beneath the world an ethereal shield spread from qurrahs hand the two spells collided in a thundering clash known well to spellcasters like the sound of steel on steel was to skilled swordfighters qurrah felt his mind bend under the pressure you idiot qurrah said he shoved the stream of power aside where it shattered a wall of stone his fingers danced and the darkness turned into crawling globules that sank their teeth into xelraks feet and ankles you do not strike with your strongest spell first you immobilize you bleed and you cause suffering when xelrak tried to pull his legs back from the biting things he found his feet held firm by teeth and shadow his glare to the halforc writhed with pain and hatred hemorrhage he shrieked the spell surged into the halforc setting fire to his blood and attempting to have it burst forth through the skin of his chest qurrah however focused his mind calming the blood and denying the painful rupture the spell yearned for he retaliated not with spell but with his whip the flame lashed out drawing blood and burning flesh no wonder you failed karak qurrah said you are rash you try to overwhelm with power and instinct but i am greater i am wiser and i do not rely upon your pathetic god for strength xelrak sent waves of bones flying from a bag at his side qurrah shattered them to chalk with a thought xelrak launched a ball of flame that detonated like a miniature sun qurrah wrapped his whip about himself feeling strangely calm as the fire enveloped but did not burn as the smoke wafted into the air qurrah lashed the whip to the ground a wave of molten rock filled the alley xelrak snarled his fingers curled and ice smashed the wave you do not deserve the strength karak has given you xelrak roared enough qurrah said he summoned all his strength into a barrage of seven circular balls of darkness fire trailed after them like the tails of comets each one sundered the magical shield the other necromancer brought up to block the protection cracked splintered and finally collapsed against the final blow xelrak fell to one knee i will tear the balance asunder he said gasping for breath i will free karak from the whores prison i will lead his army to victory not you then lead them qurrah spat i care not for some petty squabble between brother gods i am not his chosen i am not his avatar then what is it you want xelrak asked curiosity overcoming his anger i want her healed he said nearly a whisper i want what i have seen in my brother but you know nothing of that the man chuckled and he shook his head as if finally understanding some great riddle you are the stronger he said the black power left his hands death and cunning lingered in his eyes but your will is not with karak that is why we meet karak has shown me the path that awaits you kill me why should i bother qurrah asked i said kill me xelrak said or i will kill the girl you call tessanna black tendrils encircled the halforcs hands you are mad qurrah said you seek me here cannot match my power and then beg for death so desperately you threaten to harm those close to me is this the dream of karak a groveling dog that will obey its master without thought without will i will tell you the dream of karak xelrak said it is order reigning in this chaos it is peace replacing murder death and villainy it is you leading this world to the serenity it has long yearned for a dream it will forever be qurrah said and may you go share that dream with him never ever pretend to control me black tendrils snaked out his palms like spearheaded tentacles there were nine and each one aimed for xelraks heart with a visage of perfect calm the man accepted the blows they tore into his chest covered the alley with his blood and mutilated his inner organs in a splay of gore then the smiling visage was gone the man himself was gone instead the massacred remains of a twelveyearold boy lay before qurrah torn apart by the tendrils the boys head was mostly intact and his eyes peered to the night sky with a lifeless gaze several runes marked his forehead laughter filled the alley as qurrah seethed he had been made a fool fear not my child said a voice in the halforcs mind its sound was the coldest chill on a winter morning and the strongest thunder in a raging storm do not despair my ways my servant has done as he was ordered walk with courage the true test approaches qurrah said a voice quivering with rage and horror it was deep and nearly a growl yes the halforc said he turned and faced his brother h arruq stood at the entranceway his eyes locked on the butchered remains of the boy tears ran down his face even as anger overwhelmed his sorrow this was not my doing qurrah said listen to me brother it is all a ruse a ploy dont lie to me harruq shouted you think im stupid its all for your magic your sick damned magic not so long ago you helped me or have you forgotten those days are gone i will not let you guilt me forever ive moved on you havent as they talked harruq slowly approached his hands clutching the hilts of his blades his fingers twitched seeming eager to draw qurrah watched remembering all the times those swords had taken lives with brutal efficiency killing was what he was he remembered this his brother did not you have not moved on qurrah said the grip on his whip tightening you have merely forgotten delusional fool killing is what defines you it is your greatest ability now you threaten me for doing what you are the better at im going to stop it harruq said drawing condemnation and salvation now swear it swear youll never kill again and maybe we can make this out alright qurrah chuckled as his world shattered rage clouded his mind coupled with a sweeping sadness covering his rage like snow on a volcano i cannot promise this he said because i will forever hold my promise and a killer is what i am we are murderers harruq not anymore forever qurrah shouted ignoring the rupture in his throat i said not anymore their faces were inches apart their wills locked in a desperate struggle i will kill again qurrah yelled i will kill children women elders elves tarlak brug ill kill any i wish whenever i wish aurelia aullienna their lives are nothing to me nothing to you have you grown too blind to see it harruq smashed qurrahs face with the back of his fist there was no thought involved no decision he just struck qurrah reeled back clutching his face his complicated tangle of emotions cleared into one heated moment of fury you would strike your brother he said for all we have done all we have survived you would betray me youll not lay a finger on them harruq said shaking their lives over yours thats how it must be so be it qurrah said a black tendril shot from his hand streaking for an exposed part of harruqs armor condemnation smacked it aside as he charged his bloodrage taking hold bones ripped out of the dead childs body and pelted his hands and face he felt a burn on his ankle and knew it was the whip he halted tensed his legs and then leapt backward qurrah released the handle knowing he could not match his brothers strength the fire died when the handle left his touch harruq kicked it off the sting of it driving his anger he rushed again his arms up to protect his face see only darkness qurrah said a curse leaving his hands may you be as blind as your heart has become all light vanished from harruqs eyes it was as if he were in a dark cave far from the grace of the sun he kept his charge hoping his orientation had not changed when he heard spellcasting to his left he ducked wet objects splattered onto the wall beside him knowing he had little time harruq leapt toward the sound of his brothers voice still deep in casting he felt his shoulder connect followed by a faint gasp his momentum continued forward and when he heard the sickening sound of bone smacking against wood his heart stopped qurrah he said taking a step back then the hemorrhage spell hit his arm his right bicep tensed tighter and tighter until muscle broke blood exploded out pouring down his arm his leg and across his brothers robes and face his mind white with pain he lashed out with his other arm the sound was faint but he knew it for what it was in his pain he had forgotten he still held his swords and that single lash had cut deep into flesh qurrah he asked again dropping both his blades get rid of this damn dark and let me see you the sound of gurgling blood was his answer the image filling his head mortified him he had slit his brothers throat his scarred torn throat please delysia can help you he said he staggered forward his good arm searching he felt a hand wrap about his wrist i didnt mean to harruq said i didnt dizziness flooded his head his entire left arm went numb the pain followed agonizing shrieking stealing pain his life poured out his flesh stolen into qurrahs grasp harruq collapsed colors of violet and red swarming across the darkness that was his vision you cut me he heard his brother gasp you dared cut me please harruq said please dont go you fear me leaving you said the hissing voice just above his head but you have left me long ago qurrah the raspy breathing trailed down the alley and faded away harruq struggled to stand but one arm was numb and weak and the other torn and bleeding he managed a sitting position next he slid his legs underneath grimaced and rose to his feet qurrah he shouted again where are you no answer aurelia he staggered out of the alleyway he brushed the shoulder of his numb arm against the wall to keep his orientation his ankle smashed against a crate sending him sprawling aurelia tarlak who has done this to you asked a sudden whisper startling the halforc haern he asked who harruq the whisper asked again i cant see the halforc said help me i cant see i have already sent for delysia now tell me who it was qurrah harruq said i knew it he whispered stay here until you are healed harruq i will find him no harruq screamed dont hurt him look what he has done to you haern said the halforc felt strong hands grab his shoulders and prop him against a wall you are blind and bleeding and he has left you i hit him first he gasped please i hit him first the assassins mind had been set and he thought no argument would stop him still those words kept him by the halforcs side the pain in his voice was too great he waited for delysia and the others to arrive harruq a female voice called out a soft hand stroked the side of his face are you alright never been better he said haerns beat me a lot worse before he tried to smile but the tears flowing from his blind eyes revealed the lie im so sorry aurry im so sorry q urrah traveled through shadows all the way to the tower knowing his time was short they had to know he would come for tessanna he slipped through the doors and rushed up the stairs all the while clutching his throat he needed to stop and rest but he had no time guilt still panged him for stealing life essence from his brother but he had no choice he was dying tessanna he said opening the door to their room not surprisingly he found it empty further up the stairs he went he did not knock at the top he simply barged in tessanna he said startling her from sleep she was curled tight upon the grass directly below aulliennas bed come we must go what happened she asked fully awake even though her slumber had been deep you have blood on you i have no time to explain he said the others will be coming and they will kill me they couldnt she gasped why what have you done nothing he saw her cringe at his outburst and his guilt calmed his temper they feel me guilty for things i havent done he said i fought my brother his wounds are not severe but that wont matter we must hurry come but aullienna tessanna glanced up to where the little girl slept qurrah turned his back to her go or stay your choice he went down the stairs the girl glanced back and forth hating him it was not her choice there was no choice she followed him down t he two were deep within the trees when a blue portal ripped open at the tower door haern led the way followed by aurelia the assassin scanned every room his eyes missing nothing the elf went straight to the top floor her relief at finding her daughter sound asleep was indescribable they placed harruq on a few pillows beside the fireplace without a word delysia began her craft he never enters this tower again tarlak declared his eyes hard never and neither does the girl is that clear dont hurt him harruq moaned from the floor please dont hurt him he has a fever delysia said glancing back to the wizard i think his left arm is rotting do what you can tarlak told her well take him to calan if we must brug mumbled constant streams of curses while healing light poured out of delysia and into harruq aurelia stroked her husbands head taking in every moan he made and every flinch of skin they were signs of life and she needed their reassurance haern slid next to the wizard his sabers drawn underneath his cloaks should i hunt for them he whispered tarlak watched the healing knowing the decision he gave would hold grave consequences either way in the end he sided with his gut the two were trouble do what must be done the wizard whispered back may harruq forgive us when he wakes haern bowed his eyes aflame ashhur be with you he whispered ashhur be with us all said tarlak t hey ran until qurrahs body could take no more his lungs gasped for air and his chest racked with cough after cough blood covered his throat lips teeth and tongue tessanna held him as they walked the forest was quiet its calm in strong contrast to their emotions dont push yourself so hard tessanna said please stop for a moment when she pulled against his arm he had not the strength to fight mouth agape and spitting blood he wished he was dead the girl knelt down before him tossed back her hair and started to whisper her face was calm and the halforc knew he shouldnt be surprised a maelstrom lived inside tessannas mind so why would she worry now a faint blue light surrounded the girls hand grew in strength and then dipped into his chest energy filled his body the ache in his muscles faded and the fog that had grown about his mind lifted she smiled up at him batting her eyelashes did i do good she asked very good he said he wrapped his arms about her shoulders and pulled her up to him they embraced long and silent in the cool dark air we cant return there anymore can we she asked the voice of a child no not for a long time ill never see any of them she said none i will find a way qurrah said knowing what troubled her i promise just like you promised to cure me the comment stung even though she had meant no insult yes he said the same she sighed the crook of his shoulder became the perfect place to rest her neck and a sound came from her throat almost like a purr qurrah yes tessanna someone is coming to kill us he shoved her away and then ducked as a flailing mass of cloaks sailed past he felt a sting on his arm but the wound was shallow he lashed out with his whip desperate as he staggered off balance the flaming tip wrapped about haerns wrist before the halforc could pull it taut the man was gone the whip curled about air behind he heard tessanna say he spun his heart halting the man was right on top of him his sabers leading knowing death was but a breath away he still attempted to cast a spell if he would die he would die with a spell of necromancy on his lips but the blades did not come and the next breath he drew was not his last a howl of wind slammed haern away his legs smacked against a tree spinning him so that he cracked head first against another for a moment he struggled to stand qurrah used that moment well the words of a curse left his tongue draining away some of the strength in haerns muscles black clouds grew from the earth enveloping his body and pouring into his lungs the assassin gagged the air poisonous and vile what harm have i done to you qurrah asked him drawing ready his whip was it my brother that sent you here he lashed out browning a spot on haerns back and ruining the fabric he lashed the same spot this time burning all the way through to singe flesh or have you always hated me and now you have your excuse i need no excuse haern said staggering to his feet and i need no hatred you know what you have done with that he clutched his wrist and enacted the magic of one of his rings white light swarmed over his body banishing the clouds and scattering darkness for hundreds of feet qurrah cried out the sight burning his eyes the jewel on the ring shattered the last of its power flooding haern with healing magic when the darkness returned qurrahs eyes took a moment to readjust a moment was all haern needed he charged for tessanna tessanna however had no trouble seeing when the light faded her skin glowed as if she had absorbed the illumination fire swarmed about her body covering her exposed flesh her anger gave it fuel and all the restraint she had held within the tower burned away you wont keep me from her she shouted fire leaping from her hands haern ducked between the streams and rolled past slashing her legs with both blades as he did the metal clanged as if hitting stone fire leapt off her body traveling down the metal and torching the skin of his hands haern held in a scream of pain the stink of his own burnt flesh filled his nose a bolt of shadow struck his back pain overloaded his senses doubling in strength as a second bolt smashed the base of his neck do not touch her qurrah shouted his hands outstretched and bleeding darkness you are a coward a fool and deserve not the breath in your lungs the third shadow bolt flew haern tucked his arms and twisted it struck ground instantly killing the grass it touched not wishing to try his luck with a fourth haern leapt into the air kicked off a tree and slammed into tessanna over and over he bit his blades into her flaming flesh his skin his clothes his hair it all erupted into fire and smoke he felt like a miner hacking a rock with a broken pickaxe in the middle of a wildfire his lungs cried out for air as the fire on his skin continued to grow he had no choice damn you girl he said shoving his foot into her face and leaping off a living ember in the night a whip took his foot out from underneath when he landed smashing his face to the ground he didnt mind for it put out the fire that had blackened his cheeks and nearly scarred his eyes shut he rolled over to see qurrah hovering over him a sick anger in his eyes ill send my brother to meet you soon he said hemorrhage the spell was aimed for his face and most certainly would have finished him haern activated the magic of the kings ring the spell fizzled haern was gone qurrah spun his eyes searching but he did not look the correct way he did not look up haern fell as he had lain on his back the heel of his foot cracked across the top of qurrahs skull sending him spinning knowing his time was short haern scrambled to one knee used his ring to teleport further into the forest and then fled with all his remaining strength fire streamed after him torching tree and bush and grass it was not long before everything behind him was a raging inferno a power that mocked his own feeble blades he chugged a small healing potion as he ran it did little to subdue the pain he felt as his flesh tightened ripped and peeled anger burned his gut far worse than the fire that had burned his skin even with the element of surprise he had lost t essanna are you hurt qurrah asked gingerly touching the knot growing on the back of his head im fine the girl said the fire on her flesh withering away scratches covered her body they were long and thin and they were bleeding qurrah hurried to her catching her in his arms she giggled licking her lips as blood from a slash across her eye trickled into her mouth i burned him good she laughed he was fast but i burned him and hell glow forever we need to bandage these cuts qurrah said no let them bleed ill be fine she shoved him aside her body appeared weak but the will in her eyes was healthy and terrifying as ever he deserves what happened i knew what he was thinking he was thinking i will never see aullienna again and that made him happy he deserves to burn i want to burn him again and again and again we both need to rest qurrah said taking her arm please we still have a long walk ahead then lets walk arm in arm they made their way home o n the third knock the tower door opened where the bloody abyss have you brug caught haern in his arms grunting at the weight delysia he called back inside hope you got a bit of magic still left in you he turned his attention back to the assassin did you dance in a funeral pyre amusing haern said with a grimace and youre closer than you know brug dragged him next to harruq who slept soundly aurelia slept with him her slender frame nestled against his ill do what i can delysia said giving him a faint smile her entire face sagged and the dark circles underneath her eyes hid much of her beauty still she placed one hand on haerns chest another on his face and began praying to ashhur lathaar took her hands into his own and removed them you have done enough he said brushing strands of hair away from her face let me do what i can tarlak wandered over his own eyes bloodshot from exhaustion he watched lathaar place his hands on the assassins chest and face strong blue light flaring from his fingers how could they do this to him the wizard wondered aloud brug heard him and snorted you sent him after them didnt you a soft nod was his answer if they can do this to haern im sure glad theyre dining with the worms now theyre not haern gasped i failed tarlak i failed soothing light flooded his being as the pain faded his body cried out stronger and stronger for sleep he had not the strength to resist lathaar backed away letting delysia go to him sleep will help you heal faster the priestess whispered kissing his cheek as the man fell into slumber her back creaked and her legs wobbled unsteadily when she tried to stand easy there tarlak said taking her into his arms i couldnt have said it better myself you must rest since when did you start acting like the big brother you are she asked smiling despite her aches never this is just a fluke now go to bed he helped her upstairs leaving brug and lathaar with the three sleepers when he returned they had taken a seat at the table a frothing mug was in brugs hand tarlak sighed and sat next to him declining the offer for a drink what haern said you think it means what it sounds like brug asked qurrah and the girl still live tarlak said yeah i think so brug gulped down a third of the mug thats terrifying tarlak laughed im being serious here brug insisted anyone who can do that to haern and look at him hes a crispy critter anyone who can do that is not someone i want to mess with you sent him to kill em both didnt you they know that they have to know that you fear retaliation the wizard asked course not not for myself they wont retaliate against us not in a normal way theyll hurt us differently a deeper way another gulp of the mug always said they was bad news never disagreed with you on that tarlak said snapping his fingers so that a long glass appeared filled with a sparkling orange drink he took a sip ignoring brugs disgusted look they are necromancers lathaar said at least the halforc is the girl knows many necromantic spells but she isnt one in the strictest sense if they seek to harm any of you they have the ability when you sleep when you walk underneath the stars it is then they can find you sounds like you have experience tarlak said stories i havent heard yet necromancers and followers of karak are essentially the same thing lathaar said they may believe otherwise but any follower of karak is a follower of a death god and trust me tarlak ive fought many followers of karak we going after them or do we wait like sitting ducks brug asked we wait the wizard decided we have no choice ill let antonil know we found the veldaren reaper at least the killings will stop i doubt harruq will let me hunt down his brother the two are sad souls really i hoped to show them kindness bring them out of the pits they had sunken into but he sighed no good deed goes unpunished right lathaar no good man goes untested lathaar said rising from the table all good deeds have their reward never confuse the two night lathaar night tarlak brug the paladin prayed on one knee by the two wounded his brown hair falling to hide his face as he whispered in the quiet finished he climbed the stairs to sleep its almost daylight tarlak said turning back to brug figure we should turn in go ahead i can go a day or two without sleep no problem aye but you get grumpy go on to bed this nights been a long one bah if you insist tarlak waved at the fireplace the light dimmed although the heat from it remained strong the two trudged up the stairs leaving the three to sleep y ou have forsaken me leave me harruq said sweat and blood covered his forehead fire raged around him melting rock and billowing smoke i never worshipped you you have forsaken your brother and you have forsaken me you turn to ashhur who has granted you no power no wisdom and no strength velixars fall is a fleeting moment in time will you stand beside him when he comes again no he shouted the wails of a thousand tormented souls overwhelmed his words i love my brother you would kill him you are blind harruq tun blind to the path before you blind to those who seek to help you those who turn against me suffer halforc they suffer greatly the tower crumbled to ash the sky ran with blood and every star fell hordes of the dead marched before him a single cry on their lips for qurrah they shouted for qurrah for qurrah i will hurt you harruq tun i will ruin all you betrayed me look upon the cost of your betrayal the vile voice thundered the molten earth ran over the dead burying them the sky melted filling the horizon with flame only harruq remained to listen to the cries of his beloved aurelia fell into the fire weeping silently tarlak stepped in willingly tipping his yellow hat as the flesh melted from his bones finally there was aullienna who waved at her father with a single laugh she dove in and was consumed aullienna he screamed horrified as his most precious love disappeared into the raging flow aullienna aullienna the destruction was complete karaks laughter filled the world and the chant of the dead changed for order for order for karak and his chosen the fire rose it burned his arms his legs his waist it flowed in with every breath charring all that it meant to be him aullienna he shrieked lunging up from the ground his arms flailed about in his blindness each movement intensifying their aches aullienna dont harruq aurelia wrapped her arms around him and held him still harruq it was a dream just a dream he felt her arms and calmed burying his head into her chest and weeping she was dead he sobbed all of you were dead karak wants you her and everyone we wont let that happen she whispered stroking his face well always be here for her always his sobs faded and his exhaustion overtook him he lay back down glad his wife was at his side he slept and this time no dreams came to him w hat is it qurrah tessanna asked she had been awoken by the screams of her lover her kisses had slowly calmed him chasing away the terror nothing he said sanity returning to his eyes i dreamt of velixar is all and my brother go back to sleep she said i was dreaming of dogs eating my heart while worms crawled from my mouth you whimper like a child qurrah chuckled tessanna placed her head across his chest her long hair draping over him like a blanket qurrah opened his eyes and stared at the ceiling unable to shake the horror of the dream he had been dead as had his brother in a demonic haze of smoke and fire velixar had mocked him while karak declared his victory what have we done he asked so softly that tessanna did not hear have you changed so greatly in the time i was gone to him it had been a few weeks but to the others over a year had passed perhaps his brother had moved on changed he had a wife and a daughter after all no he said his brother had not changed he had merely forgotten the life they had lived marching at velixars side was but a memory to his brother one long suppressed i will awaken your anger he whispered i will bring forth the killer you buried you cannot strike against me and then deny what we are in his silent fury he found the comfort to sleep h arruq awoke to throbbing pain in both his arms his left felt weak and clumsy while the right ached like a dagger was lodged to the hilt inside his next realization after the pain in his arms was that he could see again aurelia was gone a shuffle to his side brought his attention to haern what are you doing in my bed he asked the idea that he wasnt in his bed followed and he chuckled glad that the assassin appeared to be asleep never mind then he said did anyone ever tell you your voice is the worst thing to hear in the morning haern mumbled blinking open a bloodshot eye i take it were not sparring this morning no no sparring i think ill pass out again though harruq struggled into a sitting position blinking as he looked around the main floor of the tower slowly his groggy mind cleared he glanced at haern seeing his many burns they were bad but they appeared to be healing um what happened to you he asked your brother happened to me what haern pulled a pillow over his head ask tarlak the man went back to sleep harruq grunted and used his numb arm to push his hefty self to his feet the contact of his hand against the floor awoke a thousand shocks within each one reminded him of what his brother had done needing answers he wound his way up the stairs for tarlaks room he was intercepted halfway there by a very angry priestess what are you doing up delysia asked get your gray butt back downstairs and rest wheres aurry he asked upstairs with your daughter ill get her for you if you want she examined his arms her mouth locked in a little frown itll be another day before theyre fine she said tossing her red hair across one shoulder dont you dare try lifting anything until then i need to reserve most of my magic for haern the poor dear what happened to him the halforc asked knowing he would not like the answer did qurrah do that appears so the priestess said letting go of his arms tessanna as well ashhur protect us from those two if they decide to repay our kindness she gave him a wry smile anger bubbled up harruqs throat tarlak sent him after them didnt he delysia crossed her arms and pointed down the stairs ill bring him to you as well but get yourself back to your pillows before you hurt yourselfagain the halforc reluctantly obeyed he mulled over the previous days desperate to understand what had happened he had struck at his brother wounded him severely and then his brother had responded in kind now a friend had attempted to take his brothers life how would qurrah respond would he accept an apology more importantly should he even offer one the sight of the massacred child in the alley his young eyes frozen in a death gaze was a haunting one ugh too much thinking he said plopping beside haern do it silently came haerns muffled reply tarlak arrived a few minutes later just ahead of aurelia and delysia hows our wonderorc the wizard asked loud and annoying thanks haern seriously though your eyes and arms fine harruq shrugged did you send haern after qurrah and tess he asked tarlak sat down at the table sighing never been one to beat about the bush eh harruq the wizard asked harruq perhaps this is better to wait for another time aurelia said sliding in beside her husband harruq kissed her cheek but disagreed what happened when i was out he asked i sent haern to retrieve your brother he went into the kings forest and returned hours later looking like a burnt log end of story the halforc groaned fighting through his hundred initial reactions you had no right to do that he finally decided on no right tarlak stood marching over to the wounded halforc no right last i remember he was a wanted fugitive for the city of veldaren last i remember he has the blood of innocent children on his hands last i remember he had struck down a member of my mercenaries he may be your brother harruq but you are my family and i do not take kindly to anyone who hurts my kin now he has hurt haern what did you expect me to do just let me deal with him no tarlak knelt down his face inches from harruqs this is no private matter not anymore he is a threat and must be dealt with accordingly he is too dangerous to leave in the wild he wont hurt any of us harruq pleaded i didnt mean to hit him i started our fight and you sent haern after him not the opposite just let him be he will leave us alone you dont know that aurelia said yes i do trust me i just need to talk to him the wizard threw up his hands he stood and paced with curses on his lips am i missing all the fun lathaar asked as he came down the stairs still dressed in his bedclothes what do you think we should do tarlak asked him should we hunt for qurrah or let him be the paladin shrugged we leave him be until he does more harm the wizard nearly fell over despite the seriousness of the situation delysia could not suppress a smile we do what he asked aurelia lathaar asked is it alright if i tell them good qurrah and tessanna have some sort of magic protecting them from being located i had aurelia scry for their location only to see darkness even if we can find them wed be marching on their home with them on the defensive if tessannas power is anything like miras it is best to leave them be youre joking tarlak fumed you have to be joking are you telling me youre afraid of that crazy blackeyed little girl not afraid lathaar said but you havent seen what ive seen and what is that the wizard crossed his arms challenging his friend what have you seen that shakes the knees of our most holy defender do not confuse fear with wisdom lathaar said ive seen an ancient demon brought low by the magical barrage of a goddess ive seen the greatest fire wizard of our time brought to shame by the raging inferno leaving her fingertips if tessanna is akin to mira her power is awoken by anger i suggest we not risk unleashing that unless we must until they harm again i would leave them be tarlak frowned in silence for a brief moment lathaar saw the young kid he had first met brash reckless and with red fuzz in place of a mustache and beard even now that recklessness wished out to demand its way but tarlak was a wiser man now most of the time this mira girl really outdid roand the flame he asked her fireball was twice the size of his the paladin said so well leave him be harruq asked daring to hope yes for now tarlak said not leaving lathaars gaze if hes wise hell stay gone for a long long time and if hes not it was aurelia who asked this other than worry for her husband she had revealed little of her opinion on the matter if hes not wise then lathaar might need to fetch that mira girl to protect us the wizard said with a chuckle no one laughed q urrah awoke with the dawn rising from the warm bed with a ferocious cough the stolen life had healed much of the sword wound but the pain and blood remained clogging his throat the cold air did little to help tessanna stirred but he kissed her eyes back to sleep he slipped into velixars robes and pulled tight the sash xelraks words haunted the morning air it may take time but he will return karak has sworn this to me qurrah cinched the robe tighter bracing himself he opened the door to outside the chilly air swept around his robe danced about his legs and crept its way to his arms and chest he met it head on not wishing to disturb tessannas slumber he closed the door behind him the earth remained dead all about the home a gray scar on the orange and red canvas of the forest qurrah found comfort in its death i sought you to help my wounded lover he whispered to a phantom image of his brother he imagined floating along the wind frost punctuated his every word and now i return wounded by you at least one thing had not changed he attuned his mind to the darker things in life he could sense death and the soul he sought was so strong its pull was like a noose around his neck karnryk he whispered the halforcs name having never been told it before the spirit was so desperate to return to life that it was flooding his mind with memories the way ghosts haunt old homes dark caves and the gallows where souls had died karnryk should have known better he had forgotten qurrahs promise to him karnryks body was a mess something about the cabin scared most animals away but the carrion eaters were unafraid coyotes had consumed his innards worms and insects feasted on the remains his face was puffy his eyes long gone to his mild amusement the corpses right arm was gone most likely as a late meal for a scavenger mutt he heard a ghostly wail and the soft touch of fingers pressed against his neck chilling his blood you are too late to be brought to life qurrah whispered to the ghost at least not how you wish my way however does not require freshness of the body he spent the next hour carving runes into the dirt surrounding the fetid corpse tessanna did not join him the trials of the past few days had taken their toll and she slept deep into the morning that was fine with him qurrah preferred torturing in seclusion drak thun drak thaye kaer vrek thal luen he chanted kala mar yund cthular they were the words of his teacher velixar and the unnamed master the words made him shiver with memory the runes glowed the body shrieked and karnryk lived once more if life was the correct word stand up qurrah ordered karnryk growled the first tugofwar match had already begun mere seconds after being granted life inside his head qurrah saw a silver thread linking the two one end wrapped about qurrahs skull the other karnryks throat the more the warrior pulled the deeper the ache but the stronger qurrah pulled the less and less will the undead monster kept in physical strength karnryk may have been the greater but when matched in willpower he was by far the inferior i said stand the necromancer shouted the giant rotting halforc lurched to attention bits and pieces sloshed off him qurrah grabbed his head and forced it downward placing his other hand over the empty sockets he cast a spell so the undead thing could see even though the eyes were long gone this done he made sure karnryk watched the rotting pieces of himself fall how was your stay in the abyss the necromancer asked ill kill you the enslaved being growled back qurrah chuckled you did not answer my question he sent a mental command to his minion his will so strong that karnryk could only obey he plunged a hand into his ribcage and crushed the remains of his heart as a rule undead did not feel pain their lungs did not inhale their hearts did not beat and their blood was unmoving in their veins qurrah however had deviated from the original spell much of karnryks original self had come back from the abyss and through magical means retained the sensations of touch taste and smell most important of all he had come back able to feel pain qurrah denied him the ability to scream he would hate to wake up tessanna you can feel it cant you he asked his mouth pressed against karnryks ear as if whispering sweet words to a lover how soft and weak it is i wonder how many eggs lay inside your flesh you will find out in time every hatchling will crawl about blind and rabid for flesh and they will feast you will feel every bite every burrow they are in your head your feet your chest even that thing that made you a man before tessanna mutilated it beyond recognition press harder mash your heart to pieces you dont need it not anymore he could feel karnryks hatred seething in his mind he laughed a promise is a promise qurrah told the living corpse and i keep my promises tear out your tongue i hear you clearly enough in my mind without hesitation karnryk shoved his hand in his mouth and yanked out his tongue he held it out to qurrah as if it were a great offering throw it to the wolves the necromancer ordered your jaw next tongue and jaw flew into the forest karnryk stood erect his face locked in an enormous hollow smile tiny shreds of his tongue hung from a hole above his neck coated with dried blood a tiny bug crawled up poked its head about and then crawled back karnryk felt every skitter of every leg down his windpipe very good qurrah said i will come for you tomorrow morning as well and every morning after until i am sated stand where you are perfectly still enjoy the sensations within you the threats ended inside the halforcs mind pleas and bargains flooded in karnryk would kill obey serve anything at all as long as he was spared the ability to feel you will make an excellent bodyguard one day qurrah told him in his head but that time is later you are not broken yet a single thought and the words ceased the link between them broke all karnryk could do was follow his order which chained his will greater than that which chained the moon around the world he stood perfectly still even when a swarm of flying bugs arrived swirling down his nostrils and throat to make gluttons of themselves t he bitter aroma of boiling roots greeted him upon entering the cabin morning lover tessanna said her voice calm and quiet ive made us tea to drink worlds getting cold so i made something hot the halforc ran a hand through her hair before sitting at the tiny table she retrieved two woodcarved cups from a shelf pausing to stare at one a memory of her father sitting by the fire a knife in one hand and a block of wood in the other flooded her mind a shaggy brown beard dirtied his face mommy walked by covered in flour she kissed daddy on the cheek and playfully tugged his beard the memory was good mommy was alive her mind was one and father still loved her a single tear ran down her face she didnt notice one cup she placed in front of qurrah the other opposite of him she took the boiling kettle stirred the insides with a long wooden spoon and then filled both cups did you enjoy yourself out there tessanna asked as she placed the little kettle back over the fire he needed to pay for what he did to you qurrah said and yes i did enjoy it the girl nodded she sat down wrapping the cup with her hands and staring into the thick brown liquid she didnt sip it not until qurrah did it tasted bitter in her mouth strong and bitter but it was good did you pick the roots yourself qurrah asked yes nothing else qurrah accepted this expecting her to remain silent for once something weighed upon her apathetic self beyond the tarnished shreds of her childhood i want to see her again she blurted qurrah sipped a bit more of the tea who aullienna loves me she said her hands clenched the side of the table but shell be forced to not love me they will make her they will i wont let them you know they will not let us return to see her qurrah said but i have to she said another tear rolled theyll ruin her not like me a different way i must see her again qurrah i must they love her because she is normal she is happy they wouldnt love her if she was like me they hate me for how i am they would hate her too what are you saying tessanna qurrah grew alarmed at how white her hands were she clenched the table so hard her skin scraped off her fingertips i looked in your book she said her attitude shifting she turned shy i looked at all the pretty runes that make people go crazy i saw me in them qurrah she held up her arms i saw what i see in me it will make her like me they wont love her when she is like me and then they will give her to us i can see her again and ill never stop loving her not like they will show me the runes you saw qurrah said jumping from his seat tessanna lazily pointed to their bed where the tome lay open its the fourth set down on that page i even read them aloud they felt right just right you read them aloudbut you said you couldnt read tessanna giggled like mad see theyre me how would i know them if they arent me qurrah scanned his eyes over them instantly recognizing the symbols they looked very much like those the girl carved in blood across her arms they were in the final third of the book and although qurrah had tested forty forms of insanity it would have been another hundred before he had reached them you want me to read these to aullienna he asked tessanna nodded please it wont hurt her it didnt hurt me he felt his gut tighten and his breath went shallow if i do this harruq will never forgive me will he forgive you now what do you have to lose he must be punished qurrah he hurt you it was all you dreamt about last night hurting him making him angry she stood from the table and approached her eyes livid life danced in them more than he had ever seen you can help us all she said your brother will learn the eschaton will learn i will have her and she will love and have me if i cure your mind i can cure hers as well qurrah said feeling his resolve weaken i will do no permanent harm to her harruq will forgive me but first i must be stronger to cure you i need a spellbook beyond the ones i have been given what is it you need tessanna asked sliding her body against his her hands brushed and caressed darakkens spellbook he said the paladin knows where it is he can bring it to me then lets do it she whispered nibbling on his ear she will be like me for only a little while and its for good right qurrah grabbed her wrists and spun shoving her against the wall with surprising strength he pinned her hands above her head the girl gasped at the sudden force but it was not of fear anger or even surprise youre using me arent you he said you care not for me or my brother you want their daughter yes she moaned but you use me as well and we both like it he pressed harder against her arms his chest shoved against hers pinning her her breath quickened and against his chest he felt her nipples hardening i would do anything for you he whispered to her anything you do not need to play me for it please she gasped whatever you want ill do it he took her there right against the wall dwelling in her lust at her climax she tore her mouth away from his and shrieked his name but it was not the name he expected master she screamed master master he finished shortly after a bitter feeling in his heart he knew his role then the one he was meant to play he would play it until she needed him as a true lover an equal a husband he would play it and enjoy every second h aving worms eat his flesh wasnt worse than the abyss but it was comparable when night fell a new torture arrived it came with yellow eyes patches of missing fur and a limping gait that explained its desperation the animal could no longer hunt for food it would have to do with the carrion it could find and that night it had found karnryk qurrahs order was simple dont move so he didnt when the coyote nibbled on his lone hand he knew a good punch would send the wretched thing running but knowing and doing were two different things with a sickening crunch it tore off a finger and rolled it about its mouth enjoy it karnryk thought lost in a sick delirium chew it good maybe even choke i got plenty for you to eat you sick little mutt think you can eat all of me my head too scoop my brains out so the gnats wont crawl through the holes in my eyes to feed crunch went the bones in his hand it latched on with a feverous grip yanking until the wrist broke tail between its legs the mongrel ran off with its prize when i kill him itll be by clubbing him to death with my elbow he thought gods help him he couldnt even bite not with his jaw lying twenty feet away in the dirt his only recourse his only salvation was imagining the brutal death of his master by sword by foot by choking by throttling smashing his head in a door burning his face in fire bleeding him out bit by bit before a stream everything was good every bit of it would be fun if he had his way hed deserve his return to the abyss hed take qurrah with him hauled over his shoulder to throw him to the demons something ate your other hand qurrah mused the next morning a shame you have no way to wield a sword yes s uch a horrible shame came karnryks words rudely into his mind i can still kick people to death for you though you sick bastard qurrah took a stick from the ground and rammed it through an eye socket uncalled for he said and unwise you need a sword hand or you are of no use to me then start searching coyote stomachs because youre not finding it around here qurrah yanked the stick out and shoved it through the other eye socket twirling it about for good measure youll get a new hand he said ive a task for you once youve completed it ill return you to the abyss until then though qurrah reached into his pocket and pulled out a stale piece of bread he mashed it in his fingers scattering crumbs around the rigid warriors feet he wadded the rest into the gaping hole that was karnryks face that should ensure you plenty of company for the day the necromancer trudged back to the cottage pondering a way to obtain a new sword arm for his slave meanwhile karnryk silently invented new curses as the first of many flies flew down his throat to investigate the wonderful new smell h aern waited until harruq and aurelia were upstairs playing with their daughter before slipping into tarlaks study afternoon haern the wizard said not looking up from his bookwork so what brings the grand servant of our king to my humble little room by the way youve been wandering around the city havent you he glanced up so his frown would be visible your burns havent healed you shouldnt be sleuthing about the assassin shrugged scars covered his face and hands although delysia promised him they would fade several fingers were wrapped in bandages miraculously enough his hair had survived mostly intact only a small patch near the front had been burned off so that it appeared he had a receding hairline haern combed his blond hair forward best he could to hide it but it did no good i believe i found where qurrah is hiding he said say again karnryk spent a good two months dropping coin for any information about tessanna the assassin explained he and his cronies vanished weeks ago and not long after qurrah returned here with tessanna tarlak said making the connection those wounds to the girl karnryk made them which means karnryk found them haern said leaning with his hands atop tarlaks desk a few cutrate thugs knew the girls father evidently he had a debt to them gambling of some sort they followed him to his house mostly to ensure he couldnt hide if his debts grew out of hand ive talked with them there are a few markers and eventually a path deep enough in the woods i can track it tarlak folded his hands together and cracked his knuckles i know i must be wrong but i get the distinct impression you want to go after them again haern grinned ive got a score to settle wouldnt you agree the wizard chuckled hoping you would learn from the first time was foolish of me wasnt it he stood closing his book his hand absently scratched his beard as he stared at the cover pondering lathaar is right he said at last until they make a move it is best to leave them be im glad we know in case something does happen for now lets keep this knowledge between ourselves quiet in the night haern insisted there will be no battle no warning i said no tarlak warned and they had no warning the first time either but you still came back a burned mess the assassins eyes darkened they cannot kill me those marks on your face say differently the wizard sighed knowing he had gone too far im sorry haern i cant risk it if we take them on we go together right now im keeping my word with harruq or hell never trust me again haern bowed i pray you are right he whispered pulling the hood back over his head and i pray they accept the uncommon grace they are being given with a flutter of gray he was gone tarlak slumped back in his chair and reopened the book i hate being in charge he muttered i have an idea for his hand tessanna said one morning after a violent hour of lovemaking my pets qurrah said his head nuzzled into her length of hair the girl laughed at his words yes your pets we need him to hold a big scary sword right right his breath tickled her neck and she laughed again i can make him a new hand one of stone if you find me a rock and a fire i think i can make it i think that is a lot of thinking for tiny little you said qurrah leaning on his elbow he shivered as she traced a finger across his naked chest i want to help i should help you right its the right thing to do yes love he said it is the right thing to do how large a stone do you need big as a fist she said shouldnt that be obvious the halforc laughed yes youre right it took him half an hour to find the perfect stone he pried it from the dirt beside the river it was smooth and round with a flat bottom he threw it against a tree twice just to ensure it could endure a pounding only dirt caked off with each collision against the bark satisfied he cleaned it in the river and trekked home tessanna was ready for him a small fire burned steadily in the dirt three small rocks with blooddrawn runes formed a triangle about the fire even more blood dripped into the flame pouring freely from a cut on tessannas wrist as she gazed on with glee when she saw the stone she beamed perfect she said come here put it down i want you to watch he set it next to the fire and then glanced at the glyphs on the runes he recognized the three but it made no sense they were symbols usually involved with resurrecting the dead how would they help with making a hand for his pet tessanna how do you know itll work she said bobbing her head enthusiastically dont ask me how even though you just did you naughty boy i know like i know a lot of things without another word she picked up the stone and placed it in the center of the fire the burning twigs shoved aside and continued to burn imagine a hand she whispered running her fingers across qurrahs face to close his eyes her voice grew cold and aged a hand forged by gods and granted power by things we dare not see imagine each vein pulsing with gold imagine its claws short but strong as steel their tips stained with the blood of a thousand victims this hand can wield the mightiest sword and brace the greatest of shields imagine it lover and i will make it let me see and then you shall see as well he did imagine such a hand its flesh stone its veins gold and its thick fingertips red her words painted it in his mind sure as a brush on a canvas he focused on the hand mesmerized by the strength it possessed he dimly grew aware that tessanna was casting a spell but the haze that enveloped his mind swirled the knowledge away the hand could have belonged to a deity he thought one that made the rock of earth and gave purpose and rhythm to the stones and rivers a man could die by that hand and there would be no shame open your eyes he heard his lover say he did deep in the fire was the hand he cried out and stepped back for it pulsed with a life unworldly the fingers flexed one by one even though it ended in a simple stump at the wrist the flesh was gray and impossibly strong how he asked breathless someone once had a hand like this she whispered soft and quiet he was a bad man lots of people tried to kill him when they did they cut him up in tiny tiny pieces bad people deserved that they said so i brought his hand here and i made it alive do you like it qurrah he nodded his eyes never leaving the hand what was his name he asked in response she giggled jerrick jerrick qurrah laughed jerrick carver the cleaver of newhaven he had died an age ago when ashhur and karak were but lowly gods warring on the land of dezrel back when velixar was still alive run run the cleaver come you been bad and now youre done he said tessanna gave him a funny look a silly rhyme qurrah explained i thought jerrick just a myth a story to scare us as children amazing love simply amazing how will i attach it to karnryk pick it up and put it on she said tossing her hair across her shoulder to expose her soft neck pretend youre sliding into me itll go just fine ill remember that he said bending down to the still burning fire and retrieving the hand he felt blood or some similar fluid throbbing in the veins a chill ran through him and it was a delicious chill he went to karnryk bring me a present asked the voice in his head one you should be proud to bear he said holding forth the hand extend your arm karnryk held out his lone arm the stump a nasty mess of fluids and bone the necromancer felt a sudden bolt of excitement shoot through his slave when the hand first touched the rotting flesh wuuuh karnryk groaned his first audible noise in two days it is your hand qurrah said sliding the wrist forward exactly like his lover suggested somehow the bony flesh attached and became firm and even in your state you should know what a tremendous gift this is give me a sword ordered karnryk in response qurrah ordered him to his knees i give all commands the necromancer said nothing has changed do not forget your place he glanced about trying to remember that chaotic fight that felt years ago although it had been little less than a month find your sword he told him retrieve it and return here you are allowed to do nothing more karnryk willingly obeyed returning to the place where he had died he picked up the mammoth twohanded sword in his one hand lifting it as if it were a feather he carried it to qurrah who examined his pet and his blade curiosity overtook him he had to see his pet in action chop down that limb he said pointing to a branch hanging low near them he sensed a bit of magic in the warriors blade so he expected little difficulty a good couple hacks and it would be down at least that is what he thought when karnryk lifted up the giant sword and sent it slicing through the wood like it was butter he realized just how precious a gift he had stumbled upon the tree he said as the branch fell to the ground with a crashing of leaves and sticks cut down the tree without a word the hulking slave marched over to the trunk it was easily the width of karnryk himself he hefted the sword high above his head and then swung a great thunder tore through the forest as the blade sunk two feet into the wood before halting take it out qurrah said instead his pet ignored him letting loose a low grunt his arm flexed the veins in the hand pulsed gold and then the sword shoved further and further in snapping through the final foot birds scattered as branches caught on branches and the tree smashed with a whoosh to the ground tessanna you goddess qurrah said his voice awestruck he might have been scared if he realized just how close his words were to truth a re you sure i cannot go tessanna asked she sat on the bed her knees up to her neck with her arms wrapped around them her tattered dress covered little of her body i will be fine qurrah said stacking his tome and spellbook into his arms karnryk will provide ample distraction for my purposes but i want to see her the girl whispered please i just want to see her the halforc turned and kissed her forehead he stared into her eyes and promised just as he had promised many times before you will see her again i swear it he pulled his hood tight over his head took his whip and left tessanna bitterly stared at the door qurrah she said but the thought had too many endings she did her best to pass the time she took her dagger from underneath the bed moved beside the dying fire and viciously slashed her arm each rune pulsed with blood and she found strange satisfaction knowing those runes would soon be read aloud to that precious little girl c ome karnryk qurrah said approaching his pet we travel to veldaren should you perform well i will absolve you of your sins against tessanna i would hate to disappoint was his reply before they could go qurrah needed to cast one last spell by the time he arrived at veldaren the stars would be numerous beautiful as they were he needed them gone fear was what he needed fear and chaos the stars combated both tessanna had taught him the words for the spell the knowledge locked in her brain seemed infinite yet she used it so sparingly the words were simple at least in terms of magical incantations he cast the spell with ease rolling against the wind a line of cloud grew across the western horizon pleased qurrah lowered his arms and let out a sigh of relief we are ready he said the two trudged east in silence qurrah had his spells his whip and his tome of insanity karnryk had his sword and his hand it was all they needed s omething is wrong aurelia said sitting up in the bed the blankets fell to a heap in front of her revealing the thin silk that covered her body beside her harruq stirred with an unhappy grunt what is it baby he asked rubbing her arm with his hand she turned to him her eyes wide and her whole body shivering please my dreams were dark something horrible is coming just a dream is all the halforc mumbled surely you dontyou do dont you she cast off the blankets and headed for their wardrobe she let her slinky and unpractical garment fall to the floor revealing her naked form for a brief moment before she slid on her green dress it glittered with soft runes and gold trim she tied a sash about her waist and grabbed her staff all before harruq could stumble out of bed aurry wait up whats going on your armor she told him put it on now harruq got up a creeping fear growing in his heart he had not seen aurelia this afraid sincewell he wasnt sure he had ever seen her so afraid he took his black leather armor off the nightstand and began the tedious routine of buckling it on what did you dream he asked his arms reaching behind his back pulling on strap after strap i saw tessanna standing over aullienna she said crossing her arms across her chest she was killing her with a dagger but not normal not she turned tears sparkling in her eyes please hurry from far down the stairs they heard a banging on the front door the sound made harruqs heart jump that better be coincidence he said not willing to risk it he strapped on his cloak buckled his two swords and rushed down the stairs halfway down he met tarlak rushing back up the wizard was dressed in his bed robes and had a funny pointy hat on his head topped with what looked like a ball of cotton get ready we need tooh youre ready he said giving harruq a funny look how did you know i didnt he said aurry got spooked by a dream whats going on that was a guard from veldaren he said dashing into his room he grabbed his yellow robes and hat throwing them on over his bed clothes somethings tearing through the town tens of guards are already dead the soldier said they couldnt corner it couldnt overpower it with numbers weve been promised a fortune to kill it he pulled his hat tight on his head either not noticing or not caring that is was badly crooked wake up haern lathaar and brug ill get delysia were moving now harruq banged on haerns door only to have the fully dressed and armed assassin greet him i heard the knock was all he said lathaar was already awake his platemail gleaming in the blue light of his swords together they roused brug who gave harruq the dirtiest of looks until he heard the reason for his waking great jumping galoopagots he said staggering toward his armor harruq glanced at haern galoopagots the assassin shrugged t he entire party massed in the main foyer in less than five minutes armed and armored lets go tarlak said seeing all accounted for we strike the killing blow and twothousand gold is ours since lathaar here wont accept any were talking a lot of coin split between the rest of us oh and people are dying thats bad too what about aullienna aurelia interrupted i wont leave her here unguarded she will not be safe with us haern whispered the wizard rubbed his eyes are you sure we cannot leave her here alone for an hour the elf shook her head adamant i will stay before i leave her but your magic could decideoh blast it tarlak glanced about his mind frantic brug he suddenly decided stay and the guard the child me im no durn babysitter aurelia gave him a pleading look and it didnt take long for him to melt please brug she said i will feel much better he kicked his foot and caved fine just dont have too much fun without me with that the gang headed out into the dark rain and wind swept the land the sky was clear when we retired aurelia said her voice shouting above the thunder tarlak nodded feeling his stomach sink why did you leave brug behind harruq asked as his wife opened a magical portal to the city because hes stubborn and cranky the perfect person to watch her the wizard shouted that and hes our worst fighter the halforc laughed but not much the way his wife had looked when she awoke he was starting to wonder if he would have preferred the best to remain at his daughters side then the blue portal ripped open a swirling passage to the city they all entered one after another when aurelia went in last the portal swirled closed its blue light fading the entrance to the tower fell to darkness and in the darkness something stirred t he portal opened beside the fountain that graced veldarens center the sudden rain had caused the basin to overflow so the eschaton stepped out into heavy mud already their clothes were soaked to the bone where is our quarry lathaar asked glancing every direction when they sent for us it was in the northern quarter tarlak said stay sharp and look for guards lathaar led the way a longsword in his right hand a shortsword in the other each one glowed a soft bluewhite the light softened their fears and anxieties banishing them like they did the darkness because of such a beacon it was not long before a guard in chainmail spotted them and came running thank ashhur youre here the man shouted his face was bloodied and he kept wiping the rain from his eyes we tried cornering it against the wall but it blew right through us like we were twigs and straw what is it tarlak asked what are we fighting hes a giant the guard replied orc blood and fighting like a crazed demon watched him kill twenty like nothing and took a priest of ashhur to even make em wince lead us there lathaar ordered the guard bowed follow me he shouted he turned and ran north following the main road before ducking down a maze of empty streets the sound of steel against steel rang through the thunder he appeared out of nowhere the soldier explained glancing back to make sure they were following dont know how he got in the gate guards saw nothing but then oh shit thats darren up ahead a soldier had staggered toward them his left arm clutching his chest his right arm was gone their guide ran ahead shouting his friends name wait lathaar shouted chasing after him a behemoth in rotting flesh smashed out of the alleyway a giant sword held in its only hand the sword swooped in a wide arc slicing both guards at the waist they fell soaking the muddying earth with blood a thick guttural roar bellowed from the monster what is that delysia asked her hand over her mouth tarlaks eyes narrowed in recognition haern clanged his sabers together remembering his lone encounter long ago with that giant halforc its karnryk the assassin whispered except hes had his face and arm ripped off bring him down tarlak ordered fire erupted about his hands and do it fast karnryk spotted their ensemble raised his weapon high and charged only lathaar stood his ground not fearing the halforcs giant blade he had faced larger and that blade had been consumed in fire and wielded by an ancient demon of the abyss he crossed his glowing swords into an x and accepted the blow energy crackled and the sound of the collision sundered the air lathaar staggered back his arms numb he hits like a demon the paladin gasped you would know tarlak said a fireball leapt off his hands straight for karnryks chest in response the halforc put his fist before his face and sucked the magic into his glowing hand thats not good the wizard said moments before the fireball flew straight back at them the party scattered as the fire exploded haern scooped aurelia into his arms just before the impact leaping to a side alley to the tower haern whispered to her why what is wrong she asked karnryk vanished looking for tessanna he explained glancing back toward the fight can you not see his flesh he is dead and imbued with strength unholy one of the necromancers commands him aurelia aullienna the elf gasped her haunting dream returned in full strength go haern whispered take harruq if you must the assassin dashed back into the street the elf debated in the end choosing to leave her husband behind they were acting on a hunch while the threat in veldaren was most definitely real besides her magic would do little good the returned fireball proved that she closed her eyes and summoned a portal back to the tower her heart in her throat she stepped through l eave me as a durn babysitter brug grumbled a mug of ale in his hand he sat at the table wallowing in the light of a lone torch upon the wall five other mugs lay next to him all empty when someones got to do grunt work its always brug do this brug do that make this make that screw all of ya he downed the sixth mug spilling on his beard about as much as he drank a burp marked the cups return to the table knock a single rap on the door but that was all it took any semblance of drunkenness vanished from him brug stood a punch dagger in each fist whos there he asked no voice answered he approached low and battle ready outside the wind howled carrying voices go away they said making him shake his head as if to scatter some strange mirage go away and do not come back it is not safe not safe not safe shuddup i aint no coward he said whoevers out there you better have more up your sleeve than that i do qurrah suddenly hissed into his ear brug whirled stabbing out but he found only an illusion to eviscerate the presence of qurrah scattered like butterflies made of shadows each swarming to a separate corner of the room what the abyss he said circling looking for the intruder but the intruder wasnt in not yet the doors to the tower burst open in rushed qurrah latching onto the mans wrist ice flooded his arm numbing his entire right side brug punched with his other arm his dagger shattered against some unseen barrier before the halforcs chest no magical enchantments on your own blades qurrah said you idiot brug gasped as qurrahs other hand clutched his face his fingers locked tight image after image of despair and death swarmed into his mind his eyes rolled back he gasped a deep sigh and then he fell and moved no more sleep well qurrah said i have a bedtime story to read the halforc climbed the stairs a gleaming tome of blood and nightmares in his hands i got him harruq shouted meeting karnryks rush head on the enchantments on his swords were strong and his muscles like those of an ox like lathaar he tried blocking the blow with both swords like lathaar he flew back unable to meet such strength headtohead a bolt of ice flew from tarlak only to be batted away as if it were a pebble keep him distracted haern whispered to them he lunged straight for the raging undead monster karnryk swung his sword in an upward arc one that would have torn haern from hip to shoulder the magic of his ring teleported him behind the warrior safe from harm harruq charged following the orders of his teacher he bellowed lashing out at exposed skin when the greatsword came swinging in he dove to safety his head lathaar screamed as haern flew in from behind stab for his head haern had a different plan in mind his knees slammed between the halforcs shoulders followed by each saber stabbing at the collarbone connected to the lone remaining arm karnryk lurched forward steel biting into his rotted flesh the assassin pried feeling muscle tearing and the bone beginning to pop karnryk twisted this way and that like a bull tossing a rider twice he slammed his back against a building splintering wood haern dropped after the second hit all breath blasted from his lungs one of his sabers remained embedded while the other fell beside his limp form haern delysia cried she dashed over completely ignoring the behemoth that towered above him lathaar chased after for karnryk had turned and raised his sword to finish off the dangerous man elholad he cried sheathing his shortsword and grasping his longsword with both hands the bluelight flared the light scattered the darkness the blade all but vanished becoming a glowing weapon of holy light lathaar crossed the distance in the single stroke of a lightning bolt the elholad intercepted the killing blow lathaars shoulders jarred his hands ached but the blade did not break nor did it falter get back lathaar screamed shoving forward one of his hands karnryk was undead and while dark paladins could compel undead to their will paladins of ashhur could command their retreat lathaars will was strong his faith hardened and tested when the invisible power rolled off him karnryk staggered as if slammed by a battering ram lathaar gave him no reprieve he took to his feet slashing in with his mystical blade karnryk blocked once twice each time showering sparks and light throughout the rain lightning struck and in the flicker he glanced back at the sight of delysia hunched over the fallen assassin healing light enveloped her hands who is it that commands you wretch lathaar asked stabbing forward with his elholad karnryks parry came in late and the swirling light buried deep into his chest before tearing out the side a tiny bit of blood leaked to the mud accompanied by puss and rot the undead hulk did not relent karnryk gurgled something unintelligible and then roared his rage their swords clashed as harruq and tarlak watched transfixed should he fall take up the attack tarlak said the fire of a spell still surrounding his hands harruq nodded waiting for an opening it appeared he would get none lathaars strokes never slowed and his skill surpassed karnryks more and more flesh hacked away including a sizable chunk of the sword arms elbow again the paladin outstretched his hand and attempted to banish him be gone from our land he cried karnryk roared pain intolerable swarming throughout his mind momentarily stunned he was helpless before the shining white blade that thrust for his head the sword struck a wall of pure darkness accompanied by the sound of steel scraping against stone lathaar pulled back and the others grimaced or swore in fear tessanna approached her hands covered with shadow and her eyes pits of black her dress flapped in the wind her hair clung to her face and in the dim light she seemed a demoness oh shit tarlak murmured abandoning his spell and instead preparing a magical shield no kidding harruq grumbled charging the girl as several bolts of shadow flew their way t he door crept open with the tiniest of creeks although a fierce storm raged outside calm starlit sky graced within a few docile clouds floated across childlike compared to those that unleashed rain and thunder the grass was soft against his skin the wind cool and soothing atop her bed aullienna squirmed it seemed even her dreams were speckled with warning qurrah grabbed his tome his hands covered with sweat his heart hammered in his ears yet he could not deny the excitement that flooded his body for good or ill he was going to do this step after step he took winding his way up to where the girl slept the branches creaked a few leaves rustled aullienna startled and she awoke to see qurrah standing over her a smile on his face and a book in his hands uncle she asked rubbing her eyes most would have found it cute even adorable qurrah barely noticed im here to read you a bedtime story the halforc said wheres mommy she asked turning in bed to look at the dark doorway leading to where harruq and aurelias bed was they are sleeping qurrah said as should you be i know your dreams are troubled just listen and ill send all your fears away i want mommy she said shrinking back from his smile one of her dreams had been of a bear chasing after her its mouth dripping with honey somehow that bears smile seemed kinder than qurrahs but mommys asleep right now he said placing thick wads of wax in his ears lay your head down child she did as she was told qurrah opened up his tome marked by a dried leaf to the page where tessanna had discovered her incantation his ears blocked he read aloud the words to break the little girls mind t his way the man in golden armor said twenty men behind him they were all well equipped their armor shone in the light of torches their shields polished and smooth their leader carried the standard of neldar on his shield and his blade was the finest of the citys smiths beside him hurried a priest of ashhur his white robes tarnished by rain and mud do you think they will come antonil the priest asked holding a hand up to block the rain do or dont we have to find that thing and finish it the guard captain shouted back and no devilstorm will provide me excuse should any more die can you sense where it went the priest shook his head his mouth open and gasping for air i lost it when he knocked mehold here i believe i sense it the soldiers waited impatiently as the priest closed his eyes and concentrated a moment later the man jerked open his eyes and staggered back as if struck did you find it antonil asked ii dont know the man said but i found something he pointed down a street to their right that way hurry and may ashhur help us all they hurried ahead the squad a fourth of the size it had been a mere hour ago the undead creature had torn through their ranks at least sixty were dead by antonils count and he would allow no more they passed by small homes and closed stores the normal business of the night had halted only killing went unabated the priest gave directions which they followed without hesitation when you see the creature charge at once antonil shouted back to his men we must overwhelm it with numbers it is our only ashhur be with us the priest said drawing the guard captains attention back to the front he halted his mouth agape the eschaton mercenaries had come and his heart was thankful but the battle raging before his eyes defied reason a paladin of ashhur dueled their undead target matching it blow for blow with his glowing blade beside the monster was a girl her eyes were dark and her hair wet and clinging to her skin magic seemed to explode out of her a wizard presumably tarlak due to the abundance of yellow did his best to counter and protect against her attacks but he was sorely pressed two others knelt by a house one a priestess of ashhur the other haern antonil wondered a bellowing war cry turned his attention to a raging halforc that seemed incredibly familiar the halforc charged the goddess accepting blows of darkness against his flesh to cross the distance all those with blades take the creature antonil ordered aion help against the girl i will do my best the priest said rushing to the wizards side with a communal cry the guards of veldaren charged karnryk their blades held high y ou will not interfere tessanna shrieked great spears of shadow leaping from her fingers harruq twisted and dodged but several scraped against his skin as they passed one wicked spear slashed the side of his cheek smearing his face with water and blood he grimaced swearing to repay her not just for the wound for everything you interfered plenty harruq said jumping over a wall of fire she had summoned and then smashing his blades against her neck despite the powerful magic in his swords she only laughed and accepted the hit her legs buckled but the swords did not pierce flesh the halforc shouted out his rage you ruined qurrah you thrust him into the abyss you whore ruined the girl said the scars on her arms flaring a dull crimson ruined she slapped the swords aside and shoved her hands against harruqs chest fire exploded about the armor the force of it flinging him through the air he smacked into a house hitting his head hard of course that wasnt the only hit the fall to the ground jarred his legs and caused him to bite down on his tongue harruq spat blood and glared death at the girl yeah ruined he cried a bolt of ice courtesy of tarlak punctuated his accusation it struck tessanna square in the chest covering her body the chill in her blood grew worse black tendrils danced off her fingers sweeping aside the next two bolts of ice along with a bolt of fire they attacked the mage piercing through his magical warding not good the wizard mumbled his heart ached he looked to his sister and then the tendrils hit his flesh they sizzled and recoiled like a scared viper stunned to be alive the wizard glanced down at his unharmed self and then to the side where a priest of ashhur had joined him focus on protection aion said before casting another spell a translucent shield appeared between the two casters and tessanna tarlak formed another of his own doubling the strength can the halforc take her if we provide distraction aion asked ashhur knows was the wizards reply but her attention was not on them not then i did not ruin him she spat to harruq i helped him i loved him i love him every night and it makes him happier she cast a weakening spell on harruq sapping the strength from his muscles the halforc felt his energy leaving and fought it how he knew best pure rage with a roar he cast off the curse as if it were a chain about his body tarlak fired another bolt of fire giving harruq time to cross the distance as she summoned her shield to block the spell hes not happy harruq shouted shoving condemnation straight for her mouth the girl ducked firing a dagger of ice straight into the halforcs gut he felt white pain but ignored it salvation slammed down hilt first his sword cracked as if hitting stone but he could see he hurt her the girl collapsed to the ground a soft moan escaping her lips are you so blind you cant see it he gasped pulling the long shard of ice out of him he dropped it to the ground beside her face iamnotblind power rolled out from her like waves on a lake the halforc was thrown back against the same building as before this time he felt the stones give a little as his back smashed into them and then of course came the fall to the ground tarlak hurled several red balls of magic while the priest slashed the air with a golden blade all traveling unerringly toward tessanna the girl stood her hands quaking and her eyes wide with bits of dark smoke trailing out the corners she batted the spells aside as if they were nothing how dare you question my love tessanna seethed her voice trembling with power you are insects you are vile you are wretched and i will show you how wretched you are darkness swirled about her in corporeal form great wings stretched out her back made of a dark ethereal substance ten feet in the air the wings spread decorated with black petals that scattered into the air with each beat the ground before her melted into complete emptiness the buildings beside her rattled their very walls shaking pour every bit of your will into a shield aion commanded tarlak agreed their hands stretched forward as the power of a goddess came streaking forth as pure dark energy focused in one gigantic beam k arnryk was feeding off tessannas power it was the only thing that made sense with the girls arrival he had gone on the attack each blow stronger than the last lathaar blocked his speed easily beyond that of the creature but the sheer power every second his arms ached a little more his faith in ashhur was great and his elholad would not break but his body was an entirely different matter when the sound of charging men met his ears he smiled for the first time that night encircle it he heard a man shout lathaar leapt back as guards of neldar surrounded his foe their shields up and their swords ready a man of honor took position next to him a grin on his face as well you must be lathaar the guard captain said my reputation precedes me the paladin said onward rushed karnryk ignoring the other men in a desperate lunge at lathaar his greatsword cut air as the paladin rolled to the left lashing out with his sword in one hand the gleaming white blade tore through karnryks calf shredding bone and rotted muscle antonil went the opposite way using his shield to deflect the sword upward for two quick stabs into the halforcs gut guards charged from behind hacking away at undead flesh that was rapidly losing volume karnryk grunted his anger and spun but the guards had already retreated its not too difficult antonil shouted smashing his sword against his shield in an attempt to draw attention his way only one paladin remains and id bet my life that youre him is that so lathaar countered a swing chopping off part of karnryks nose in the process he failed to parry the next hit desperate he jerked his body low to avoid decapitation antonil did not hesitate he smashed his shield against karnryks waist while hacking at his tree trunk of a leg the halforc was unable to strike a killing blow against the offbalance paladin instead forced to deal with the nuisance at his leg he rammed his knee beneath the shield ignoring its sharp bottom tearing into his skin the blow wrenched antonils arm and cracked his head back hard several guards again rushed his back karnryk sensed their coming and spun his sword out in a long arc he cut two in half and took the arm off a third even as their comrades screamed in pain or death the guards charged in more and more strikes tore at the rotted flesh his knees were particularly wounded and each step caused his entire body to wobble two more died horrible gashes in their chests from the greatsword but they had fulfilled their goal as one antonil and lathaar charged take his knees lathaar shouted lashing out with his sword antonil led with his shield absorbing a direct swing against it his entire left side of his body screamed in pain as his collarbone broke but still he ran lathaars sword cut through the left knee severing the leg from the body as karnryk tilted antonil swung his sword with all his might his strike crushed the other kneecap like a giant oak the halforc fell he is mine lathaar yelled karnryks fury had not diminished but he no longer had height or legs to give his blows strength one savage block sent the sword back to the ground exposing the entire body for lathaar to strike holy wrath swarming his hands he shoved his palm to karnryks chest back to the abyss he shouted the rotting flesh melted beneath his hand karnryk howled and flailed lathaar flipped around his sword may karak welcome you he said ramming the tip through the gaping hole where his mouth had been rotting flesh melted against its blade a wave of power surged out of lathaar shattering the chain that bound the spirit to the worldly plane a lone sigh was all there was to signify karnryks final death lathaar gasped for air pulling free his sword the glow faded the elholad returned to earthly steel the paladin was given no reprieve for it was then he heard the great cry come from tessanna he turned to see her black wings her empty eyes and her terrible power his mind flashed to an image he had seen before one so similar it horrified him mira he gasped for a brief moment confusing the two he saw the wizard and priest preparing to defend and knew them doomed no he screamed running toward them you cant withstand her fast as he was he would not reach them in time a blur of gray flashed past him and then the goddess unleashed her onslaught e very ounce of his will was in the magical barrier in front of him tarlak was a skilled mage and only once had he fought an opponent that could break his shield combined with aions the wizard had every reason to believe they could survive when that black beam hit their shield he knew their error his back arched his hands flailed about in spasms and his entire mind turned white with pain in a distant part of his mind he felt his shield shattering like glass hands wrapped around his waist time seemed slow and he turned almost lazily to see haern taking him into one arm the other arm reached for the priest but the beam was breaking through the sound was thunder of demon gods and the assassin had no choice he activated the magic of his ring tarlak felt a quick sense of distortion when his mind recovered he found himself to the side of where he had been he spun around to look and immediately regretted it aion remained before the great stream of power his shield shattered just as tarlaks had but there was none there to rescue him the black power washed over him it melted his skin it shattered his bones it tore his mind asunder and left only dust where he had been the stream continued several homes exploded into wood brick and mortar their occupants ash on the wind no he screamed beside him haern seethed and drew his blades aion delysias cry was like a dagger stabbing tarlaks gut you are wretched tessanna shouted you are nothing nothing to me the eschaton mercenaries prepared their weapons be it spells or sword and faced the dark goddess before them a urelia stepped out her heart sinking the doors to the tower were splintered and broken it took little imagination as to why brug she shouted nearly wrenching an ankle running over the debris she found him slumped in the middle of the floor drool on his chin oh brug she whispered stroking his face with her hand she left him there praying he could be made well she dashed up the stairs her staff clutched tightly in her hands if she met qurrah she knew it would come to spells the elf swore she would be ready had she looked carefully she would have seen a patch of shadow by the fire deeper than it should have been she might have even seen a pair of eyes leering out at her with purest contempt but she did not so unseen qurrah slipped out of the tower and into the pouring rain at the top of the steps aurelia paused her fears realized in the form of a slightly ajar door the world silent in her ears time a forgotten notion she pushed open the door aullienna baby are you there from up in her bed aullienna turned and smiled at her mommy is everything alright aurelia asked scanning the room as she made her way toward the stairs are you alone uncle was here the little girl beamed he read me a story aurelias throat tightened but she kept a straight face she climbed the steps two at a time desperate to hold her daughter he did did he aullienna nodded look she held out a small object in her hand at first aurelia did not recognize it but then it squirmed and raised its silvery tail it was qurrahs scorpion the gift brug had made for him put that down now in response to the elfs shout it turned raised its tail and then buried its stinger into the little girls wrist aullienna aurelia lurched forward slapping the thing off with the back of her hand the scorpion fell to the grass and writhed on its back aurelia incinerated it with a small bolt of fire before it could right itself she pulled aullienna close her hand tight on her wrist she turned it upward to see a trickle of blood marked the sting but flowing in her veins could be any possible vile poison that scorpions possessed honey do you feel alright she asked aurelia knelt down holding her girls head to command her gaze aulliena smiled as if she were completely unaffected pretty the little girl said uncle made things pretty pretty the elf said is that so aullienna were going to take you to a priest to get you healed come with mommy no the girl suddenly shrieked and her face turned icy and vile she clawed at her mother like a captured animal one of her slender fingernails jabbed against the side of aurelias eye cutting across her pupil tears wet aurelias face and when she blinked she could see blood whats wrong she asked torn between anger horror and confusion baby in response aullienna howled like a rabid animal then turned and leapt off her bed aurelia was so stunned she never even dove to stop her the girl hit the ground on her shoulder and rolled aurelia flew after her crying out her daughters name she feared the worst but aullienna moaned the wild bestial nature in which she had acted made aurelia hesitate before reaching out her arm to her daughter love please i want to help you she said aullienna looked up from the grass tears in her eyes im scared the little girl cried please uncle made me scared aullienna crawled to her mothers lap sobbing she buried her face into her dress aurelia stroked her hair her heart broken im scared mommy she cried im scared please help please im scared please delysia will make you not scared aurelia assured her im going to go get her do you want to come with me dont aullienna wailed dont dont leave dont then the crying stopped she fled away from her mother as if she had never met her before aurelia reached out a hand only to watch her shy away what did he do to you the elf whispered tears still staining her eyes she cast a spell over her daughter at once the little girls eyelids drooped and she yawned long and loud curling up like a kitten she fell asleep atop the illusionary grass aurelia took her in her arms and carried her into the separate bedroom flowers scattered from the covering as aurelia placed her daughters body atop their bed the elf kissed her cheek then turned away ill be right back she said a blue portal ripped open in their room rain swirled in from the other side accompanied by cold air that blew her dress and chilled her skin a single glance back and then she stepped inside t essannas first attack was a wave of serrated shadow with a sharp wedge leading it tore down the street leaving a great ditch in its wake everyone dove aside lest they be torn to pieces several of antonils soldiers were not so quick they broke like glass blood pouring out in great spurts from their mutilated bodies the other guards she gripped with her mind assaulting each one with a bleed spell blood poured out their eyes ears mouths and nostrils she reveled in their pain and at the horror that came over the faces of the others they are not worthy of my presence she mocked haern rushed beating lathaar to the girl he had felt the girls power firsthand and knew the quicker he dispatched her the better tessanna laughed at his approach surrounding herself with a terribly familiar shield of fire and youre not worthy of mine haern whispered he rolled away from a quick blast of dark energy tucked his legs and then dove straight for her feet although her skin was tough as stone when it came to blades she was still a frail girl weighing less than a hundred pounds ignoring the biting fire haern swept his feet behind her ankles he grit his teeth at the sudden impact against his shins tessanna cried out the black wings vanishing as she fell she struck her fists and the ground rippled like water she hovered there as haern danced for balance knowing his window to strike was fleeting harruq neared antonil behind him the halforc prepared to hurl one of his swords but he held it in hand when the assassin bore down on the girl his sabers stabbed for her neck the swords struck past her flesh for the black ethereal wings returned pushing the girl high into the air the two collided he screamed fire leaping off her frame and onto his face and hands still he tried to pull back and stab only to have her reach up and grab his wrists now burn she hissed fire tore from her eyes and seared his face haern felt his skin bubbling the flesh rising up and peeling he tucked his feet ignored the burning on his face and the sudden heat on his heels and shoved out of her grasp he fell only to be caught in lathaars arms harruq and antonil charged to either side of the floating girl coordinating their attack in a desperate attempt to protect their injured friend tessanna righted herself and flapped higher beyond the reach of their swords come face us coward antonil shouted weakly striking his sword against his shield even the slight vibration increased the throbbing from his broken collarbone lathaar rushed back to tarlak and laid haern on the ground prayer on his lips he placed his glowing hands against the vicious burns across haerns face be healed he whispered hoping his meager abilities would suffice tarlak saw his most trusted friend so severely wounded and decided enough was enough tessanna so far refused to lower instead flapping her black wings higher and higher time to fall angel tarlak said pulling out a wand and activating its magic he had tried to harm her with spells now it was time to try the opposite tarlaks wand shattered the powerful magic spent waves of antimagic swarmed over the girl dispelling all enchantments and effects her wings faltered their magic broken the fire faded from her flesh revealing her pale skin and dripping wet hair with nothing to keep her afloat she fell vulnerable and stunned the two fighters awaited her below their blades prepared for a killing stroke do not harm her antonil turned in surprise to the voice but harruq only felt his gut sink ever further qurrah had come a wall of invisible force followed the shout slamming both of them back tessanna hit the ground and gasped in pain down the street walked qurrah his whip wrapped about his arm in dark flame his eyes seethed red darkness surrounded his other hand the makings of another spell a single black tendril shot out feinted an attack and then wrapped about tessanna he pulled her to him she collapsed in his arms sobbing in the rain qurrah she said all her power leaving her qurrah im so sorry i didnt were leaving he said to her to the others he glared death and waited for someone to make a move he halfexpected the guard captain or maybe his brother but it was tarlak who struck a lance of ice flew across the street the end jagged and impossibly sharp clenching his fist qurrah created a magical barrier shattering the projectile a second and third followed each one suffering a similar fate the halforc chuckled is that all you can muster he asked tarlak cracked his knuckles how about this then fire curled inside his hands growing larger and larger he glanced to the two fighters who stood wounded and weak charge him he thought hoping they would get the idea every bit of power tarlak poured into the fireball draining his reservoir of magical energy it flew from his hands like a giant comet a great yellow tail trailing after air sizzled and smoke billowed qurrah took a step braced his legs and extended his right arm the fireball hit the barrier and detonated swarming over the shield but not crossing qurrah shuddered his mind nearly blanking he felt his protection cracking another spell would surely break it but the fire was spent the flame and smoke cleared and qurrah gasped for air it is time to go he said to his lover into the shadows tessanna said breaking from his arms and running toward the nearest alley qurrah turned to follow but his eye caught movement tarlak was on his knees completely exhausted and his brother stayed back confusion evident on his face the paladin still hovered over the wounded assassin the guard captain however antonil charged shield leading qurrah lashed out with his whip taking the mans feet out from under him the fall jarred his shield antonil screamed in pain as he felt the broken pieces of his collarbone grind together qurrah turned to leave but there was one other he had forgotten ashhur condemn thee delysia shouted having snuck around and then charged with antonil holy light flashed from her hand burning his sight like a dagger through each eye he shrieked thrusting his fingers forward and unleashing a blast of ice the priestess struck the building behind her ice freezing her wrists and chest to the wall staggering like a blind man qurrah followed his lovers voice wait harruq shouted breaking out of his paralysis he rushed after only to see them step into a dark portal similar to aurelias damn it he screamed he slammed a fist against a wall fuming in mindless anger why what the abyss did we do harruq he heard his leader call the halforc turned his swords sagging in his arms despite his anger his guilt overtook him upon seeing his friends haern lay on the ground obviously in pain delysia shivered in the rain and ice her skin pale and her lips blue he watched antonil crawl onto his back gasping for breath while tears streaked his face and then there were the bloodied bodies of the guards harruq tarlak said again grabbing his attention he pointed to where delysia was stuck to the wall break her free will you we need her spells yeah harruq said he sheathed condemnation and took salvation into both hands he smashed the ice with its hilt spreading cracks with each blow delysia coughed coming out of her daze haern she moaned wheres haern hes fine the halforc said turning the blade around to slide it underneath the ice he pulled dislodging a large chunk take a lot more than that to hurt ol sneaky i bet dragons would quake if they knew he was coming to say hello and they would flee in terror from tessanna she said smiling halfheartedly you didnt flee harruq said his hits against the ice grew harder you came after them while i just stood there harruq the halforc shook his head and the comment died on her lips with most of the ice cracked and broken he sheathed his sword the rest he pulled off with his hands ignoring the biting cold with a soft cry she fell forward clutching him to stand easy he said easy catch your breath i need to help them she said pushing away he let her go feeling more helpless than ever before she staggered toward haern only to halt beside antonil she said words to him although he did not hear her hands took on the white glow of a healing spell and three times she cast a spell on his chest tarlak checked on her and then went to harruq your brother he said pointing to his sister and his friend your brother did that along with that tessanna yet you never struck you watched while my sister nearly killed herself to slow their retreat you let lathaar slay the creature you let haern burn against the girl i expect better from you harruq worlds better lightning flashed and in its light tarlak could see the anger burning inside harruqs eyes good he thought let it burn something needed to wake him up something needed to force him to see the wind picked up harruq opened his mouth to speak but then a blue portal tore open behind them they turned harruq realizing for the first time his wife had even left when the elf dashed through his words caught in his throat her eyes terrified him harruq she shouted flinging her arms around him he held her tight she let his embrace calm her for a second before pushing away qurrah broke into the tower she said her husbands arms tightened around her waist is aullienna he poisoned her the elf said please i need delysia she needs to come back take me to her the priestess said still hunched over antonil she gave him a soft kiss on the forehead before standing her white robes were covered with mud and water her hair was soaked to her skin and exhaustion tainted her face somehow she remained regal take me to her and i will do what i can thank you aurelia said she glanced back to the portal which she had kept open please hurry i dont know how long she has harruq had heard enough he dove into the portal he had to see her he had to see it for himself his only thought was simple plain denial he couldnt have qurrah his brother he couldnt have a ullienna harruq asked fighting off a brief wave of disorientation as he rushed up the stairs and entered his bedroom he saw her on their bed and hurried to her baby wake up he said shaking her tiny shoulders in his hands aurelias spell broke and her eyes fluttered open i was a flower she giggled harruq sighed her skin was fine her temperature was normal a smile was on his daughters face you were a flower were you he asked behind him he heard aurelia and delysia enter he brushed her cheek with his hand he would pick her up and show them his brother would never stoop so low as to harm his only daughter he would show them all was fine that the chaos in the night was a misunderstanding but a change hit so sudden the halforc never saw it he only realized when the little girl reached up grabbed his hand and sank her teeth into the upper part of his thumb he screamed yanking his hand back she refused to lessen her grip blood spilled across her face the bed and his hand as his skin tore underneath her stubborn teeth he pried her loose and held the bleeding thumb to his chest gaping at his daughter aully the halforc almost pleaded tears in his eyes why why did you do that aurelia was at his side pulling him to her as she looked on i dont know what happened she said her voice quivering delysia it must be a poison i saw the scorpion sting her scorpion harruq asked the one brug made for him harruq pulled away his temper fuming brug did this where is he downstairs the elf said hes unconscious qurrah did something to him delysia stepped beside them her eyes on the little girl aullienna watched her approach her legs pulled to her chest her little white eyes shaking with fear dont she said jerking away from the priestesss gentle hand please youll hurt me i wont hurt you delysia cooed please i want to help tears filled aulliennas eyes and it broke harruqs heart that he could not go to her you cant the little girl said youll make it worse delysia ignored her whispering another prayer for a healing spell youll make it worse aullienna shouted her voice shrill worse worse youll make it worse delysia shoved her hand forward the bluewhite light pouring out aullienna shrieked she slapped she kicked and she dove to the ground curling into a tiny ball there she whimpered like an injured dog whatever it is i cant cure it delysia said to the terrified parents we need to take her to calan if anyone can save her he can ill open us another port she stopped taking up her staff and preparing to strike a shadow crawled up the wall it remained flat against the mossy stone until widening into a perfect visage of qurrah tun harruq drew his swords but aurelia reached out and pushed them down just a shadow image she said eyeing the spell what is it you come to tell us wretch i seek a trade qurrah said his eyes looked distant and unfocused lathaar knows of a tome i desire one freed by his defeat of the demon darakken have him bring this to me and i will hand over the cure for your daughter you bastard harruq said how could you how harruq the image asked glancing toward the halforcs general direction i mean her no harm things will become sane soon i promise everything will return to how it washow it should be the image faded even as harruq cursed his name the three stood silently while aullienna whimpered to calan aurelia asked the other two nodded she glanced at her daughter and offered a weak smile im sorry honey she said casting another sleep spell the whimpering faded harruq took her in his arms his heart aching with pain and anger a new portal ripped open they took her to calan q urrah opened his eyes the message given he steadied himself against the wall furious at his own weakness i should not show you such compassion he said you have grown far too weak they were still inside veldaren cowering like rats in a wretched slum tessanna remained at his side she huddled in the rain looking wet and miserable he remembered the chaos she had sown and felt his anger rise why did you come he said you were to remain behind i didnt want them to find you she explained i had to make sure your pet kept them busy you had to succeed you had to qurrah slumped against the building how many did you hurt he asked how many did you kill she turned away her chin tucked down her hair hid her face aullienna was to grant us the tome tessanna now youve hurt them nearly killed them what if they seek vengeance what if they fear you more than they desire the girl to live i wanted to help the girl shrieked nearly choking with sobs please you wouldnt let me help but i want to help i want to see her one more time the halforc turned and wrapped his arms around her he felt her crying into his chest and his anger broke all is well he said we have not killed any dear to them they will forgive you and me i just need the spellbook with it all will be made right tessanna sniffled and if they dont give it to us they will i know my brother he would do anything for those he loves the girl was not sure if he meant himself or the girl perhaps it didnt matter i want to go home she said as do i night and rain will be ending soon let us go the two slunk off to the western wall crossing to the other side through a door of shadow once again they retreated to their sanctuary within the kings forest w ake the high priest harruq said to the young priest that answered his vicious knockings on the temple doors the boy paused in indecision he looked no older than twelve the lowest of the low in the temple hierarchy well the halforc had a way with dealing with the lowly i said wake him harruq screamed my daughter is dying and if you keep standing here telling me he cant be woken i will rip the door off and beat you on the head with it ill go get him the boy said flinging the temple doors wide please justill bring him here wait for him if you please it would please me fine harruq said shoving his way in if you show me to his room i dont have time for this the boy glanced at the two girls his face brightening as he recognized delysia oh he said i didnt see you there this is important the priestess said doing her best to calm him take us to calan i am sure he will understand the boy glanced at the halforc paled and then gestured for them to follow he led them through the entrance wincing at the water they dripped across the carpets they veered away from the main altar room approaching a large oaken door the boy politely knocked twice harruq followed it up with several booming fists of his own thats how you knock to wake someone up he said now get out of here the young priest glanced to delysia who gave him an assuring nod he fled hoping he had done the right thing after no commotion from inside harruq smashed his fist against the wood a few more times give an old man time to rise from his bed came the answering call from within harruq stepped back trying to calm himself his daughter would be fine calan was a powerful priest at least according to delysia such a man could heal his daughter any mortal poison should be within the abilities of such a healer at least he hoped the door cracked open and a haggard wildhaired calan opened the door yes children he asked harruq grunted and looked down at his daughter shes been poisoned he said we need you to cure her now demands are unnecessary the man said brushing his hand across aulliennas forehead the halforc caught a frown so quick it was as if calan tried to hide it his stomach sank bring her inside calan said place her on my bed so i may take a look he stepped aside so the three could enter the room was a cramped study filled with tomes expertly bound and illustrated in archaic lettering harruq gently placed his daughter on the bed his hands lingering on hers calan slid between them and knelt he touched the girls forehead closed his eyes in prayer and began for a long while the three waited harruq and aurelia seeking comfort in each others arms delysia stayed out of the way her arms crossed her teeth chattering finally the prayers ended without any action taken on calans part wheres the spell harruq asked aurelia tried to shush him but he pushed away her hand dont get up heal her wheres the light the chanting i cant calan said the ache was evident in his voice but harruq pressed on bullshit you can now get on your damn knees and heal her harruq aurelia shouted she has no poison calan said overpowering her shout with his simple words no poison no curse no hex and no spell then what is wrong with her aurelia asked she acted terrified to see me and other times she cried like a wild animal i have seen it only once the high priest said his left arm searching behind him for his desk to lean upon when he found it he slumped back his face exhausted only once but i know it well what is it harruq asked the girl you brought to me calan said tessanna their minds are now similar and just like i cannot heal her i cannot heal your daughter the words pierced them worse than any arrow could but qurrah said theres a cure harruq whispered he said he had a cure then he lied to you the high priest said there is no cure i do not know how but her mind has been reshaped a curse or a hex merely binds and forces a change a poison is evil in her blood but this he sighed and collapsed into his old rickety chair this is beyond me beyond anyone what are we to do aurelia asked she felt her husbands arms wrap around her and she clung tightly to him pray he said watch her hope that in time she will gain a semblance of her old self this might be temporary but i say this only out of hope not out of reason or wisdom she is still your daughter broken mind or not there will be times she remembers you and times she loves you it is your task to love her even when she does not i cant believe this harruq said you will in time my son calan said it is not the end your daughter is alive hold to hope hope he said he scooped his daughter into his arms smiling down at her sleeping face he didnt know what to think what to do he could feel others watching him and he wanted to appear strong stronger than the nightmare he was trapped in instead he felt tears run down his face as he spoke in honest anguish at least shes normal when shes sleeping he said they returned to the tower t hey found everyone gathered in the main floor haern was propped on pillows beside the fire lying on blankets next to him was brug his eyes were closed and he appeared to slumber a decided improvement over the comatose stare he had possessed earlier tarlak sat next to them chin on his knuckles and lost in thought lathaar did his best to comfort the three bringing drinks food and assuring words when the others arrived he didnt let any rise from their places moving is a bad idea lathaar warned crossing his arms most of his platemail was gone but even without it he was an imposing figure none had the heart to argue with him harruq walked through the front door still carrying aullienna he moved like a man drained of life aurelia followed her expression similar delysia hurried past wanting to explain the situation before the two parents had to but she did not make it in time what happened tarlak asked sitting up they harruq found a lump in his throat and no words would come aurelia stroked his cheek looked them in the eye and said the bare truth qurrah made her like tessanna she said he broke her mind and made it like hers despite the burns despite the pain despite his near delirium haern managed to cough and speak ill kill him he said ill kill the bloody bastard why would he do this tarlak asked feeling his own hatred growing why would he do such a thing to a beautiful little girl harruq looked about wanting a place to put aullienna down but seeing none so instead he placed her in the crack between the blacksmith and the assassin covering her in both their blankets he wants some spellbook he said darken or something darakken aurelia said looking to the paladin he said you knew where it was if we wanted a way to cure aullienna you must give it to him all waited for lathaar to speak when he did his voice was calm firm and unshakable i would give all to make her well but i will die before i see such a thing in the hands of your brother im sorry harruq the knowledge in that tome is best forgotten its just a book the halforc said he pointed to his daughter pleading just a stupid old book this is my daughter my daughter how can you say such things that book has the spells of karak himself tarlak said holding his head in his hands it has incantations that can poison oceans shake mountains and summon demons of unimaginable power with such a book qurrah could place veldaren under siege assuming he could read it without going mad lathaar is right qurrah has come close to killing many of us as he is with the spells of a god at his disposal i cant believe this harruq shouted i cant he stormed up the stairs feeling angry and broken aurelia looked around her beauty marred by her sadness i understand she whispered i do understand she went to comfort her husband silence followed there were many things to be said but none important not compared to what had just transpired it was haern that ended the horrible quiet even though his lips cracked and bled i still know where he lives he whispered not yet tarlak said plopping down beside the fire not with so many of us beaten and broken haern closed his eyes and sighed knowing the mage was right q urrah tossed and turned a single sight dominating his dreams it was of a child laying face down in a pool of his own vomit xelrak stood over the child his hands soaked crimson he looked like a warrior standing with pride over his victory when qurrah awoke sunlight streaked through the window of the cabin tessanna sat next to him wideawake you dreamt it too didnt you she asked the halforc nodded for his sins i am blamed he said for his conniving i am punished he has ruined my brother against me the halforc donned his robes and took his whip dont go she said it seemed a meager protest said as if she thought she were supposed to say it i do not like games the halforc said then he fell to one side collapsing against the wall in a sudden spell of weakness tessanna rushed to him but he pushed her back must pay he mumbled banging open the door he rushed out having not eaten a thing in two days the girl stood at the entrance feeling the crisp cold blowing against her skin as she watched her lover trail off into the forest like a possessed being she watched until he was gone and then cut herself to pass the time a ntonil arrived the next day accompanied by a squad of soldiers he wore his shield awkwardly presumably to lessen the pain it caused his wounded arm tarlak greeted him at the door looking worlds better than he had the night before greetings our highly esteemed and so dangerously intelligent guard captain the wizard beamed the dark edges in his eyes added an unintended tinge of sarcasm how fares your collarbone your sisters magic borders on miracle work antonil said he did not smile do you know where qurrah has gone no tarlak lied i mean we think we have an idea but its not in veldaren out in the wilderness where he cant harm anyone why antonil sighed he nodded to his guards who obediently backed out of listening range when satisfied he continued another child was found butchered the worst yet it happened sometime this morning i thought you told me qurrah was the reaper he is tarlak said his arm shot out catching the side of the door to steady himself i mean he was antonils mouth tightened i trusted you and i still grant you benefit of the doubt i lost a hundred good men last night and we were already stretched thin whoever you can muster i need their help we didnt lie to you for the coin the wizard insisted harruq said he saw qurrah standing over the dead child with his own two eyes but did he see him kill him tarlaks silence was answer enough antonil gently pressed his good arm against his chest his way of saluting tell your sister she has my sincerest gratitude tarlak tipped his hat and closed the door he slumped against it cursing under his breath harruq you fool he said you damn fool a t the top of the tower harruq knelt on the ground a sweetroll in hand do you want something to eat he asked aullienna shook her head refusing the offered roll her entire body quivered in fear harruq had seen dogs shake like that ones that had been beaten kicked and abused no hand had ever struck aullienna yet she remained huddled in the corner of the room refusing all attempts to lure her out aurelia took the treat out of her husbands hand and began nibbling on it at least she appears better the elf said perhaps calan is wrong yeah he seems like hes wrong a lot the halforc grumbled walking away from the corner he could feel his daughters eyes lingering on his back he wondered what she saw sure he was big and he could scare people but she was his daughter not once had he raised his voice in anger to her why would she fear him in truth she didnt she feared the tentongued goblin who gibbered nonsense as he offered her a crust of black bread crawling with worms when the door opened she shrieked the god of the goblin had come his eyes dim yellow his tongues trailing to the floor when he spoke his voice shook the ground should i leave tarlak asked as aullienna sobbed and buried her head no stay aurelia said she gets like that every now and then what is it you need the wizard walked in his hands clasped behind his back he seemed reluctant to speak harruq eyed his pacing for as long as he could stand before putting an end to it out with it wizard before you make me get my swords another child was killed last night tarlak blurted the two stopped trying to swallow the news like before aurelia asked just like before harruq opened his mouth and then closed it again he had no idea how to react the worst news he had ever heard seemed too good to be true qurrah wouldnt come back he said theres no reason he would have left town gone to wherever he goes in the forest you think someone else killed the children aurelia surmised she stood her heart a flutter you think we wrongly accused qurrah i struck him first harruq said me all of this was because of me and it was because i was wrong you know this now dont you tar the wizard turned away and then the great yellow wizard hat bobbed up and down yeah i do tarlak said and that puts a whole new color over this crazy painting my gut wants us to go after them kill them if we must but now he sighed harruq approached him his face reddening you caused this he said jamming a finger against the wizards back tarlak spun around flabbergasted me tarlak exclaimed how is that you sent haern after them he said what had happened was between me and him i was wrong what i did i struck first and i was wrong he has acted on defense every time against me against haern and it wasnt qurrah who attacked us last night it was tessanna i wonder how much control my brother truly has on her you will not blame this on me tarlak shouted matching the halforc in volume but not height self defense or not he left you a broken mess haern would cut a new smile in any persons throat who did such a thing to a member of my family regardless who boys aurelia shouted drawing both their attentions shut up right now or i will polymorph you both into songbirds so at least i will enjoy your incessant banter they quieted for each could see magic tingling on the edges of her fingers excellent whoevers fault this is doesnt matter a murderer is still loose inside veldaren and he needs to be caught more importantly we must decide how we deal with qurrah if this is true the extent of his crimes number only to what he has done to our daughter what he has done is unforgivable the wizard said i will decide what i can forgive she said and what if he can find a cure shall i kill the one person who can save her aurelia pointedly looked to aullienna and watched her pick at the grass perhaps we should reconsider his offer she whispered what both asked at the same time if this is true then things are different we dont know his motivations we dont know how he will respond if we explain ourselves or even apologize there is so much we dont know she did not say her most nagging thought the one that had kept her awake all the previous night she was no fool she knew why qurrah wanted the spellbook he didnt want to just cure aullienna he wanted the cure for himself for tessanna it is up to lathaar the wizard said storming to the door convince him but i swear if you give that tome to qurrah it is on your head not mine i can bear the weight aurelia said her stance firm regal i do not fear such mantles then try a few of mine the wizard said he left in a blur of yellow aurelia watched her anger softening upon his departure her true worry showed its face deep and frightened do you really think qurrah might know a way to fix her harruq asked aurelia turned to answer him but it was aullienna who spoke up startling them both uncle lies she said rocking back and forth her large eyes looking at her parents but hes hoping will you help him mommy help the bad man where did you hear that aurelia asked slowly approaching the girl who told you to say that the voices she whispered giggling they whisper and theyre smart when aurelia reached out to stroke her face she growled and snapped her teeth the elf let her be theres a lot we dont understand harruq said and i dont know a single damned thing to do about it i do aurelia said she pulled him close and held him each seeking comfort in the others arms u nder normal circumstances he would do such deeds after nightfall his dark robe blended well with the secrecy of the stars but beneath the unrelenting sun he drew more curious looks than he preferred merchants were wise not to offer him wares people did their best to skirt his path most thought him a priest of karak in other cities other places they walked openly even brazenly but not in veldaren not in the city their god had built the kings had turned their backs to him in all of neldar the priests of ashhur claimed dominion across the rest of the world the sigil of the lion did not draw ire and curses qurrah found some odd satisfaction in this let the city turn its back against what built it and gave it strength and dignity just as karak had made the great wall and castle only to have the city turn away so too had harruq betrayed him forgotten what it was that made him the perfect killer there were those who fought for the old faith and qurrah planned the same but first he had to destroy the man who poisoned his brothers mind against him where are you xelrak he asked he tried to see with the darker sight but the busying commotion of people prevented him instead he reached out with his mind searching for auras of power xelrak was a strong follower of karak perhaps stronger than pelarak and his fellow priests not wiser but stronger his faith surpassed fanatical wherever he was qurrah was certain he could find him and find him sleeping it was daylight after all he wandered down the street seeking a moment of solitude his eyes closed the jostling noise about him faded for a brief instant his vision darkened he could sense karaks puppet and his emotions flooded into him he dreamt of war of bloodshed and of purest order brought from the greatest chaos the man slept to the north silken curtains golden arches and great oak doors coated with polish flooded his vision i found you qurrah thought there in his darkness someone found him it was the king of all things where the light held no sway he did only what he was meant to do karaks voice said it came cool as the scales of a serpent poisonous and vile to the mind qurrah collapsed to the ground his mind sought to believe the torrent of whispers even as his soul shrieked against them only his duty as will you no prayers do you offer but more than a hundred sacrifices you have burnt at my altar the time is coming do not hold back slay my servant if you must his purpose is done keep hold your strength for the confrontation comes and the chaos of this world will soon be ended in glorious order qurrah scrambled to his feet sweat covering his hands and face many were staring others glanced about for guards although none dared call for one crossing a priest of karak meant death if caught furious at interference even from a god the halforc hurried north over time the thump of his heart calmed his breath lost its ragged edge and he could think clearly once more i am no pawn of yours he said and i will kill the one who tried to use me as one a tall blackiron fence surrounded the robust mansion of some wealthy merchant it did little to deter him a shadow enveloped a few bars near the back turning them to dust it was daylight people milled about and none suspected any trespassers two men stood in front of the great oak doors shortswords hanging from their belts across the grass the halforc brazenly walked to where a smaller house stood like a little brother to a giant it was meager bland and of pathetic quality compared to the garish mansion nearby from within qurrah smelled the sicklysweet aroma of rotting flesh he doubted others could detect it the halforc uncoiled his whip a single thought covering it with crackling fire he pressed his hand against the door let dark power flow into it and then pulled away the door exploded inward splintering into great shards that smashed against the back of the single room rows of wood and straw beds three high filled the place in one slept a frail man garbed in dirty black robes rise and shine precious the halforc said xelrak gasped his eyes lurching open when he saw the halforc standing over him his whole body trembled qurrahs whip snaked around xelraks waist burning through the flimsy cloth his muscles tightened he fought but the pain was intense he collapsed to the ground screaming in agony did you seek to turn my brother against me qurrah said stretching his fingers in the shape of a halfmoon tiny needles of ice shot from his palm burying into xelraks cheeks and throat one found his eye his screams grew i will serve he cried throwing himself onto his knees so he could bow the whip only tightened he tore at it with charred fingers you must learn karak has set your path and i refuse to walk it qurrah said xelrak tried to cast a spell but the whip snapped back coiled and then wrapped about his face his mouth had been open when it did he tasted oil and leather before his tongue began to cook smoke filled his lungs his eyelids melted away and the liquid that surrounded his eyes popped and sizzled his cries were as bubbling oil qurrah let the whip return to his arm xelrak collapsed the pain knocking him unconsciousness his face was a horrific mess bits of skin curled and smoked some blood ran down his cheeks but not much even in his slumber his entire existence was a form of suffering it is a shame the citadel fell to a wretch such as you the halforc said he spat that honor should have gone to a stronger man the commotion brought a tired old crone with gray hair and a lizard frown qurrah struck her dead with a thought her body clumped to the ground in the middle of the doorway we do not have much time he said glancing down at the burned man it is time you awaken he took a chunk of xelraks remaining hair in his fist and pulled up his head with his other hand he gently sunk his fingertips into the black holes where his eyes had been nightmares flooded his mind invading the blank solitude minutes later xelrak awoke screaming first from fear and then from pain qurrah shoved his hand over the mans mouth silence he said shut your screams or i will not kill you the pain you feel will never leave your face is a blackened husk all those who lay eyes on you will recoil karak will not aid you wretch only open his arms and await you in death i will send you to him if you cooperate is that understood xelrak bobbed his head up and down his screams becoming ragged moans i want you to deliver a message to karak when you see him the halforc said as the demons spear your flesh tell them i dont fear his subtle workings as the fire melts away the flesh on your legs scream to your god that he may bring his full power against me and i will not cower and i will not fail and when the ravens consume the remains of your tongue shout shout to him that i will bring nothing but chaos to this world splendid chaos and he is powerless to stop me xelraks moans grew quiet exhausted the pain was too much in a rare act of mercy qurrah pulled out a tiny bit of bone from his pocket whispered an arcane word and then sent the man to his master make sure he gets my message qurrah said dropping the head to the floor quivering bones lodged in his eye sockets he left stepping over the dead woman no more children would fall victim to the veldaren reaper he had been sent to the fire and the darkness doomed to look up in torment at the golden eternity above where those he had massacred sung in endless glory even if qurrah had known he wouldnt have cared in the slightest he had his revenge the hood of his cloak pulled low over his face he returned to where the most important thing in his life sat in silence and sliced her flesh with her dagger t he healthy members of the eschaton returned at dawn their arms sagging and their eyes dulled with exhaustion they were granted a welcoming sight at home for sitting wrapped in blankets by the fire was brug downing a mug of ale hope you all had a great time he grunted placing the mug on the floor beside him it gets lonely here when the only one to talk to is asleep beside him haern chuckled pulling his own blankets tighter around him the burns on his face were healing however slowly they shone an angry red with some patches still black and peeling he could smile with only mild pain and that he could deal with tarlak clapped his hands pleased with their recovery welcome back brug since youre so healthy well put you out there tomorrow night no slack for the short as i like to say aurelia and delysia entered next each giving him a soft kiss on the cheek lathaar came next casting a grin at brug harruq entered last his weapons slung over his shoulders and his face sunken well find him in time tarlak said slapping his back he pulled his hand away at the glare he received the group each made their way upstairs to change out of their wet clothes and armor tarlak whipped up a quick breakfast a simple wave of his hand and honeysoaked rolls and roasted pork slabs covered the table brug and haern joined him one by one the others arrived quiet and solemn in the early morning as everyone ate in silence lathaar decided it was time to speak i must be leaving soon he said drawing many glances his way i thought you wanted to rebuild the citadel tarlak asked licking honey off his fingers what changed nothing has changed the paladin said but the sanctuary must be warned qurrah knows of the books location and might come looking for it others might learn from him as well you got nothing to fear of qurrah harruq said the food he ate did little to satisfy the pang in his gut especially as his brother was spoken of as a villain hes done nothing to harm us any of us only aullienna he cannot heal her tarlak said trying to keep his voice as calm as possible you dont know that harruq countered harruq lathaar said his voice drawing the halforcs gaze into his unflinching own i will speak with them calan is a brilliant man but the clerics of the sanctuary have helped me with wisdom unparalleled i do not wish to offer false hope but there is a chance they will know of a way to restore your daughters mind and the book the halforc asked it stays lathaar said i am sorry we are grateful aurelia said taking her husbands hand in hers and squeezing hard enough to hurt aye harruq said grateful l athaar decided to leave without sleeping wanting to cover as many miles as he could before the setting of the sun your daughter may not have much time if she is to be healed he explained i do not claim wisdom in the ways of magic but i would rather not risk more than i already have before he left lathaar pulled tarlak aside to talk i will find out more about the girl he whispered you said that already no tessanna she too closely resembles mira the first time i talked with cleric keziel i felt he kept things from me this time i will hear the whole truth godspeed tarlak said hugging his friend ashhur be with you lathaar said do you want a portal aurelia asked him before he left can you send me directly to the sanctuary he asked the elf frowned and shook her head too far is there anywhere closer the paladin thought then nodded send me to haven he said very well aurelia said where the rigon river ended its divide through dezrel it forked creating a delta filled with rich and fertile land amidst this farming paradise was a small town named haven a months travel away but still closer than the sanctuary which nestled amidst mountains on the far southwest corner of the continent she ripped open a blue portal kissed his cheek and joined the rest in waving goodbye the paladin kissed his fingers and then waved back he stepped in the portal closed behind him good riddance harruq said returning to the tower whats up his butt brug asked glancing back just leave him be tarlak said sighing aurelias hand on brugs shoulder showed she agreed h arruq entered his room as if a stranger he opened the door slow and quiet a quick scan showed his daughter in the corner a soft smile on her face she was carving something in the dirt with her fingers her joy appeared honest and that burned him all the worse she seemed so normal he almost walked over took her in his arms and bounced her on his knee but he didnt having fun he asked taking a tentative step forward aullienna looked up and smiled overjoyed to see her father she stood scattering her markings with the bottom flap of her dress she ran across the room laughing harruq knelt tears already in his eyes qurrahs spell had failed or perhaps merely run its course like a disease he scooped aullienna up into the air smiling although he cried i missed you daddy she said kissing his nose i missed you too cutie he said back her words melted away his doubts he returned her kiss on the nose grinning his first thought was to hold her forever his second thought was to call for his wife so she could see the little girl squirmed in his arms laughing at something she found hysterical you look funny she said swiping at his cheek hows that he said do it again she cried hun do what her face scrunched and she pulled back in his arms daddy i dont like this like what aully im not doing anything the girl only squirmed harder pushing back against his chest stop it daddy stop it she slapped him once the thin nails of her fingers cutting into his gray skin no blood flowed but the wound was more severe than a stake to his heart he set her down ignoring the marks she made across his hands her feet did not support her at first so she clumped to the grass with a primal cry she leapt to one wall spinning around she eyed her father with shaking eyes bird eyes in the face of the serpent her kneels curled to her chest she hid half her face behind them stop it she whispered into the skin of her arms please daddy stop it he collapsed his heart breaking he wanted to die shuddering sobs straight from the stomach ripped from his lips damn you qurrah he said damn you aurelia found him as such a crying pitiful sight without a word she knelt beside him wrapped her arms about his neck and kissed him he latched his hands onto her a drowning man clutching the sides of a boat he buried his face into her neck the tomb of her hair about his head the only comfort he could find she was fine he managed to say when i came up sheshe was fine be glad for it the elf said gently stroking the side of his face the words seemed hollow to her but they comforted him under aulliennas watchful eyes the two rocked in the illusionary grass beneath a blue sky that was a lie in a peaceful world that did not exist a fter five days qurrah decided it was time to receive his answer he stood behind his home wincing under the glare of the rising sun tessanna sat nearby running an old brush of her mothers through her great length of black hair it had been cut only once since her mothers death a clumsy attempt by her father after the first time he raped her despite its length the hair shimmered with a livid energy in the morning light washed and well cared for qurrah found himself mesmerized by the mystic beauty of his lover a smile dared grace his lips i am so lucky to have you he thought so very lucky she caught his stare and smiled what are you thinking about dirty boy nothing he said turning away nothing at all stay silent while i speak with my brother she shrugged and resumed brushing whispery words slipped off qurrahs tongue a simple incantation in the middle of the eschaton tower a shadowy imitation of himself rose from the floor it stared with dead eyes that saw only the most basic shapes and colors greetings harruq i trust the past few days have been well the abyss has seen happier days the deep voice rang in his head coming from nowhere a second voice spoke that of the wizard it is a shame you arent here to enjoy them with us come join our breakfast in person ive got hemlock and poisonberries special treat just for you you are not witty wizard so please do not make me endure any more comments qurrah said his voice sounding far away have you accepted my request he listened for his brother but instead tarlak spoke again you arent getting the book butcher you never will youve ruined his daughter for nothing but im sure you feel it justified qurrahs forehead sloped downward narrowing his eyes to slits i do not jest only i have her cure he said yet you refuse what i ask im sorry brother he heard harruq say you will never get it im sorry for striking at you you werent the reaper we know that now please if you are angry be angry with me do not bring my daughter into this please i beg you as my brother whatever you wish to do to me just make her well a strange feeling welled up in his chest constricting and burning at once to hear his brother say there was no chance for the book and such an offer qurrah he closed his eyes and turned away scattering the shadow form into nothingness he stumbled one way then another fingers pressed against his forehead you will never get it why he said what is it you fear from me i beg you as my brother qurrah tessanna asked seeing the troubled look on her lovers face is something wrong im sorry for striking at you i am fine he said stumbling for the house i justlet me sit for awhile he ran to the house flinging open the door with a burst of magical power that splintered it down the middle he collapsed into the chair beside the fire cursing repeatedly how dare his brother attempt to guilt him how dare he i dont care if you know now he said covering his eyes with his hands i do not care i do this for her not for myself just make her well the thought would not leave he would do anything in the world for tessanna harruq would do anything in the world for his daughter of course he would so why did he refuse the book what if they never brought it to him the halforc wrenched his head violently side to side was it possible did aullienna suffer without reason without hope damn you harruq the halforc said burying his head in his hands you couldnt let things go as they should you never can so many promises he had made so many he might never keep a floorboard creaked he glanced up to see tessanna peering at him with an intolerably shy look on her face when will i get to see aullienna she asked he glared so fiercely so heartlessly that she stepped back tears swelled in her eyes i knew it she seethed she fled from the house qurrah gave no chase he had no words c ome on tarlak said rising from the table we all need a break four nights straight searching for our suddenly vanished killer it is enough to wear anyone out he glanced to where the shadow form of qurrah had been that sure isnt helping either what i need is sleep harruq said a caravan from mordeina arrived yesterday the wizard insisted exotic wines a few nifty toys and some new clothes we can find something for everyone lets go harruq aurelia said nudging her husband in the side or are you afraid of a little shopping not much for wine brug muttered but ill take a chance for some good old kerish ale snuck in among the bunch and healing salve for burns haern said he offered everyone a wink they actually feel quite fine delysia youre a goddess only close the priestess said blushing well you all can go without me harruq said im going to take a long long nap you dont want to go aurelia asked looking offended how many times i got to say the word nap well fine the elf said stay and mope then im going when do we leave right now tarlak said he took out a brown bag tied with a white string at the top it jingled when he shook it and unless any of you get too crazy ill be buying haern smiled and brug cheered the mercenaries got up to leave only harruq remaining seated at the table picking over scraps of his meal the mercenaries filed out the door but before she left aurelia leaned next to her husband one last time are you sure you dont want to come she asked someones got to stay with aullienna he said meeting her eyes briefly try to cheer up she said kissing his cheek i always need your strength im not as tough as i look he gave her a slight smile and kissed her back ill try he said thank you she left to join the others harruq waited until the door shut then stood he climbed the stairs one heavy step at a time perhaps he was depressed but he was tired very tired and the allure of sleep was a strong one when he reached the top he paused took a breath and stepped inside aullienna looked down from her bed her face devoid of emotion hey aully he said dropping his swords to the ground he unbuckled his armor casting it carelessly to the grass he watched her as he placed his hands in a fist and popped his back sure you dont want anything to eat the little girl shook her head still staring at him thats fine he said lumbering to his bed ill be napping need anything just wake me alright she didnt nod no surprise really he had begun to recognize a few moods this was her apathetic one he probably could have stripped naked set himself on fire and done a dance before getting a reaction the halforc sighed at least she wasnt screaming or cowering in fear nighters he said sliding under the sheets and burying his head into a pillow he tossed he turned and he groaned and sighed a few more tosses and turns later he succumbed his eyes rolled back his breathing slowed and precious sleep came aullienna watched him strangely intrigued she recognized him and some part knew him as a protective and loving figure but she knew this like she knew that a fall would hurt her or if she tried to eat the grass in the room it would dissolve into nothing in her mouth her interest in the sleeping man passed boredom came next all she could remember was this same bland room grass she could not tear sky that was always the same with nothing to see in the clouds wind that was always soft she climbed down the stairs from her bed careful to be silent she didnt want to wake the sleeping man when she reached the ground she paused the wildness in her eyes ruined an otherwise adorable image of her crouched like a kitten in the grass when the sleeping man did not move she crossed over the grass as quick as her tiny legs could go before dashing down the stairs she wanted grass that was grass it didnt make any sense to her but few things did lately she paused in front of brugs room where the scattered pieces of armor and weapons looked like a wicked forest where the leaves cut skin and the trunks gleamed in the daylight the little girl giggled that was what she wanted trees leaves a forest when she reached the bottom floor of the tower aullienna rushed for the door she stood on her tippytoes her tiny fingers slipping around the handle she more fell than pulled but her weight was not enough angry she kicked the door the obstacle to her freedom no matter how much she stretched she could not reach high enough she was trapped inside the stupid boring tower suddenly she heard a rattling sound the door shook and then with a loud creak it opened chilly air swirled inside aullienna beamed smells true smells filled her nose dew grass and in the distance a forest the door opened all the way spilling sunlight into the room she squinted to see before the door his red eyes gleaming his black robes flowing in the wind stood velixar where might you be going he asked in answer she put a finger to her mouth and shushed him sleeping man wont want me to go she said but you want to go dont you she bobbed her head up and down fascinated with how the strangers face kept changing i thought so he knelt down and put his hands around her she shivered at his touch back there is a pretty forest the man in black said it is a special forest you see the faeries live there do you want to see them promise you wont tell the sleeping man aullienna asked i promise now go play and watch for the faeries she gave him a shy smile turned and then ran around tower at the sight of the forest she forgot all about the strange man in black to her mind the forest sparkled in purples and reds a magical place full of adventure there would be no gibbering goblins in there only faeries beautiful ones with hummingbird wings and sparkling dust marking their trail through the air she ran wild free her foot stubbed a rock and she fell her hands scraped against the ground yet she felt no pain the forest lost its allure for a brief moment lost to the mesmerizing view of blood trickling down her palm curious she licked it the dirt was nasty but beneath was a sweet taste that filled her with energy she ran for the forest h arruq awoke with a need he was immediately angry for not dealing with before he lay down to rest grumbling he staggered out of bed and reached for his chamber pot as he did he saw the door was open he stood there looking at it as he thought this should alarm him why would a door alarm him it was open did that mean something aullienna he said much of the drowsiness leaving him he looked about the room calling his daughters name aullienna he checked her bed he checked the corners he checked underneath everything she was gone he screamed her name as he ran down the stairs all the while telling himself to calm down the only place she could hurt herself was in brugs room and it wasnt like he was dumb enough to leave his but of course that door was open too he looked inside you in here aullienna he saw nothing and heard nothing the mess on the floor looked undisturbed if that was even detectable in that wreck of a room he bypassed the other closed doors to the bottom floor his heart stopped when he saw the main door flung wide open you came and got her he said anger flushing into him you just came and no he couldnt believe it he just couldnt perhaps he meant to cure her if he had even taken her at all or maybe she went out on her own it was possible probable the halforc bolted outside immediately wishing he had at least thrown on his cloak the thin clothing he wore beneath his armor was little comfort against the wind he looked around the open grass and dirt path leading toward veldaren nothing whered you go he asked spinning around he had no clue how long hed slept or how long she had been gone it could have been minutes it could have been hours aullienna he screamed cupping his hands to his mouth around the tower he went scanning all about when he saw the forest he felt his stomach churn if qurrah had taken her that was where they were she just wandered in he said desperate to believe she just wandered in thats all he ran into the forest repeatedly calling his daughters name harruqs former master watched him run from his hiding place im sorry wayward son velixar whispered i only do what must be done he had spoken those words many times but for the first time in ages they felt hollow to him t he forest was better than she had hoped much better everything swirled in rainbow colors the leaves werent green they were orange and red and purple and every other color except green that was boring animals wandered by saying hello as they passed she said hello back to every one mommy and daddy had raised her to be polite after all the little girl had no clue how far into the forest she had gone but that didnt matter the forest was better than that stupid little room she never wanted to go back never ever run kitty kitty she sang prancing through the bushes big dog coming and hes coming for you she fell into leaves giggling madly she dragged her arms and legs across the ground swimming in the colors she felt so bubbly so light that if she jumped high enough shed just float into the air and fly away so she tried sadly she fell back into the leaves banging down on her knee she wiped the blood onto her hand and kissed it kisses made everything better aullienna she turned hearing the voice it was the sleeping man except now he wasnt sleeping that meant he wanted to take her back to her room she ran in the opposite direction of his voice a new sound met her ears and she so desperately wanted to see what it was it was a constant rushing sound it had to be water she climbed a log a mountainous obstacle blocking her path with a cry of victory she leapt off the way was clear she ran to the noise beaming at a small stream flowing through her forest of magic i see me she said peering down into the water she waved hello herself waved hello back both giggled then deep behind her reflection in the water she saw lights they were quick and subtle every time she jerked her eyes to see they were gone faeries she thought the stranger was right she reached into the water to grab them but her hands were too slow stop moving she whined she reached again but they zipped deeper she knelt closer her concentration complete a thrill surged through her she caught one aullienna yanked her hand back out but it was a frog dull and yellow it leapt off her hand back to the safety of the water aullienna did not see a frog she saw a blue pixie beckon after her leaping into her watery world with a trail of dust tinkling atop the stream she followed with a smile on her face for she wished to see the world of faeries w here are you harruq cried doing his best to fight off panic she could have wandered anywhere if she got lost and night came hed never aurelia can find her he said remembering her abilities with magical portals she could take us right to her this calmed him a little he slowed from a run to a jog searching for signs of passage as he charged through some bushes he found a thick pile of flattened leaves you around here baby he asked glancing about he could hear a stream in the distance perhaps she was there d eeper and deeper she went her eyes open under the water much of it was so muddy so brown it couldnt be the world of faeries they had to live beyond deeper in she kept swimming kept pushing following the twinkling dust that had begun to fade she cried out for the faerie her voice a weird echo in her head the creature did not return to her desperate she hurried faster into the world of light that she began to see she swam harder until the world grew brighter and she knew she neared the faerie land she sucked in water mostly out of instinct passing through the dust of the faerie had helped her she knew she could breathe water and so she did ignoring the retching of her chest ignoring everything everything except the twinkling lights that grew forever stronger until they enveloped her very being the land was golden the song was eternal and seeing it she smiled h arruq stumbled to the stream scanning its length perhaps she was playing the water was bound to be cold but she had done stranger things he took a few steps glanced down and then his world stopped floating face down in the water was his daughter she twirled in the pull of the stream her head swaying from side to side bits of mud and moss were in her hair her hands floated beside her pale and lifeless her entire body moved only with the water the halforc cried out he plunged into the water took hold of her shoulders and yanked her out he felt her body sink into his arms her head rolling to one side her eyes were open as was her mouth her eyes did not blink she did not breathe aully he pleaded nearly crushing her against his chest he brushed a shaking hand across her face pulling away the hair that stuck to her cheek please aully please no dont please dont he fought the stream pushing to the shore cold water ran down his arms and chest his eyes lingered on her lips blue as the sky above she felt so tiny in his arms and yet so heavy a lump in his throat swelled and his eyes clouded with tears so that he could not look upon her face he shrieked again running his arm across his eyes to banish them im so sorry he whispered down to her forgive me im so sorry he hugged her water spilled from her mouth and across his chest it was colder than anything he had ever felt before the world remained frozen only he seemed to move at all he carried her back to the tower the longest trek he would ever take d eep within the forest tessanna cried out grief and horror mixed into one terrible sob what is it qurrah asked taking her into his arms the girl is dead she sobbed clawing at his chest i saw it shes dead you killed her you killed her he did not stop her as she dug her nails into his chest so hard that blood flowed he only held her tight as the shock of what had happened overcame him he tried to say something to say anything but no words would come they just would not come w hen the mercenaries returned to find the door to the tower open they knew something was wrong they set down their bags of trinkets wine and ale did harruq go somewhere tarlak asked aurelia shrugged fear nagged at her some nameless worry so she did not rush up the stairs to check she cast a divination spell to see her husband in her minds eye she suddenly cried out startling the rest she turned and fled out of the tower tarlak and the others followed so surprised it took them a moment to realize she had even left around the tower aurelia went running for the forest as fast as her elven grace allowed staggering out from the trees came her husband their daughter in his arms harruq she cried flying over the grass her husband looked up at her his eyes lifeless she saw that look and knew she did not need words she did not need to see the way aulliennas arms hung lifeless beside her or how her neck slumped in an unnatural way she knew she stopped running her hands going up to cover her mouth squelching a moan the halforc stumbled tears streamed down his face less than ten feet away he fell to his knees and cradled the girl to his chest shes dead he said and then the sobbing came it erupted from the center of him great and powerful he tried to speak to say something but he could not aurelia knelt before him her slender fingers caressing her daughters face how she managed to ask she drowned he said fighting for control he placed her on the grass in front of him unable to bear the weight any longer the rest of the mercenaries came running falling silent at the sight tarlaks face flushed the deepest red delysia let out a startled cry before turning away harruq stood looked to his wife and then took her in his arms he needed her more than ever he needed her the two embraced each quietly crying at last he could cry no more for an easier feeling one he knew well overcame harruq he killed her he said aurelia gave no reaction so he said it again the words made him better somehow he killed her he pulled back looked her in the eye and said it one more time he killed her dont go she said but he already was he marched past the others heading for where his armor and swords lay scattered across the bedroom floor where are you going haern dared ask im going to kill him harruq turned and screamed im going to make him pay we need to talk tarlak said harruq ignored him he rushed for the tower putting his daughter behind him he could bear that image no more he heard his wife call his name but he fought against it sorrow was for another time vengeance was now then she took his wrist in her hands he whirled around fury raging in his eyes aurelia did not back down even as the pain filled her face please dont go she pleaded i need you please he killed my daughter he shouted she was my daughter too she said a tear ran down past her nose and fell to the ground cant you see she was our daughter he nodded more tears came to his eyes i just aurry i the anger melted away his grief lost its razoredge fading down to a constant throb we need to build a pyre she said harruq nodded and sighed his shoulders sagged ill make one out back he said i guess tonight wellwe well give her body back to nature aurelia said trying to be strong her soul has moved on the pyre will make her as she was shell never be as she was harruq said to this aurelia only clutched him tighter the cold wind blew the couple mourning amidst it as deep in the woods two more lovers suffered much the same s cattered among the forest of metal within brugs room was a great hulking axe one side was enormously thick the edge sharpened to a lumberjacks point harruq retrieved it grunting at the weight in his hands it weighed more than aullienna he didnt know why but that fact irritated him he jammed it down on a broken chestplate frowning as it punched a giant triangular dent across the middle good enough he said they were the last words he spoke for the next three hours his breathing ragged and still wearing the thin sweaty clothes from the morning he approached the forest he knew the others watched him this irritated him even more the first tree he reached became his victim into the air the axe went lifted high both hands gripping the far bottom of the handle when it swung it swung with anger with pain the first bite drawn he settled in for the rest the tree a spindly stubborn thing that had lost its leaves early was just about to fall when brug appeared thought someone should show you how to cut a tree properly he said trying to sound callous unimpressed or bored harruq did not respond nor did he move out of the way to let the smaller man move in with his thicker axe so instead brug stood by and watched as the tree came tumbling down they needed logs so harruq began cutting off the branches and placing them in a large pile some were just tiny while others were enormous chunks with many warts and growths meanwhile brug cut the tree into quarters hefting the axe high above his head before crashing it down haern arrived then his hood removed he knew kindling was needed so he had retrieved a small hatchet from the tower the smaller branches he trimmed and smoothed the larger ones he hacked into smaller pieces this he did while harruq split the quarters into more manageable chunks which brug took wordlessly with one great swing he cut them into perfect sized logs with a polite nod to the halforc tarlak arrived bearing no axe or hatchet he instead took the branches to the place where the pyre would burn then he came for the logs carrying them three at a time back toward the tower he could have used a levitation spell to carry them but he did not without sweat and toil his help would be meaningless the two women accepted his gifts with thanks given only in their eyes it was their duty to prepare the pyre it would be smaller than normal much smaller a web of the thinner twigs and branches formed the center to give easy life to the fire surrounding it went the bigger logs like a wall protecting a scattered bird nest one or two thick logs went in the center for support and then more twigs branches even dry leaves all packed atop everything they placed more logs around the sides as sweat ran down their necks when the pyre neared completion aurelia told tarlak to bring them no more he nodded dreading the act he didnt want to speak the silence and backbreaking work had done much to mask the grief that made them toil a bond formed out of tragedy would soon be broken his words would break it were done here the wizard told them crossing his arms to pull his yellow robe tighter across his chest a large pile of wood remained to be taken but they left it abandoned harruq plopped the head of his axe to the ground and leaned on the handle you sure he asked tarlak nodded yes im sure the four left the woods it was still the afternoon but the days had grown shorter the sun was already speeding its way toward the horizon the orange light would soon be gone come nightfall the fire would be lit seeing the pyre filled harruqs eyes with tears and ripped apart his heart it looked like an altar one he would sacrifice his daughter upon to what god would she go what purpose he imagined his own body lying atop of it his flesh burning in the fire he would bear it willingly gladly if it would bring life back to the waterfilled lungs of his daughter still despite all this the pyre was beautiful it was made out of love and all things made this way are beautiful to those who have the eyes to see it he hugged his wife and kissed her forehead well done he said his voice cracked help me move her body she said alright let me get her she seemed so peaceful lying on her back with her eyes closed just like a nap he thought never mind how blue her lips were or how pale her skin had become just napping the weight of her in his arms was greater than he remembered he held her away from his body as if her very touch would set fire to his flesh he walked slowly a thief approaching the gallows her small frame fit snug atop the pyre crisscrossing twigs surrounded the very top and if he stepped back just far enough he couldnt see her what do we do until nightfall he asked his wife we make our fire delysia answered touching his arm i t was an eschaton tradition not an elven one the business about the fire several years before one of their original members a wily rogue named senke had died in a pointless brawl in a tavern they had buried him in one of veldarens cemeteries but they felt it appropriate to honor him in a way all their own from this came the bonfire delysia tarlak brug and haern all found an object of theirs something valuable and tossed it into a bonfire why must it be something so valuable aurelia asked as it was explained to her we had lost something dear that day tarlak said but it was nothing that belonged to us i threw my first spellbook into that fire the hassle the cost and the annoyances to regain the knowledge i lost took a mere five months before that i had thought it something i could never live without the wizard sighed it put things into perspective any possession is a possession senke was so much more as was your daughter they piled a few of the remaining logs that tarlak had brought back next to the pyre and soaked them with oil the wizard used a tiny spark just a little magic to get it burning haern was the first to go he tossed his gray hood upon the flame it is about time the scum feared my real face he said watching it burn as if losing a part of him brug was next he pulled out a pouch shaking it a couple times so everyone could hear the rattle yanking the string open with a quivering hand he spilled out four precious emeralds onto his open palm i was going to make her a necklace he said smiling briefly you know for her birthday he sniffed out went his hand sprinkling the four into the flame probably would have been an ugly necklace he muttered staring at his feet delysia removed a small gold pendant from around her neck one shaped in the outline of a mountain im sure ashhur knows you mean no disrespect tarlak said as she tossed it upon the fire hed better tarlaks laughter was forced and did not last long into his pocket went his hand coming out with a single scroll he read its words the scroll in one hand his staff in the other at the end the scroll shriveled and a great shimmer went across the staff this done he let it fall into the fire had to make sure it would actually burn he chuckled it was harruqs turn he sighed unfolding the bundle in his hands it was the cape delysia had made him for his wedding always thought i looked good in it he said he felt his wife wrap an arm around him and it gave him the strength he needed he folded it into the fire careful not to let it drop flat and snuff the flame the fine material caught and burned aurelia looked around to the others and then removed a thin silk cloth wrapped around her gift it was a bouquet of flowers harruq gave me these a long time ago she said looking at them lovingly ive kept them alive i dont know why i did even then but i dont need to know anymore she threw them into the fire they were consumed in silence the group stood they watched the flickering of the flame enjoying the warmth and loathing the meaning i dont think i should be giving a eulogy tarlak said he glanced around tucked his arms untucked them and then continued but someone should say something and it always seems to be me that does so ill do it again he turned to the parents their arms wrapped about each others waists for support ive never been around a baby he said never the crying the feeding the constant yelling at you to take care of her ashhur spare me such a fate but we loved her here i was hoping one day she might grow up and well learn a little from me i wanted to show her a thing or two and be there when she cast her first spell ive never had a student but im sure she would have been a great one i know you two loved her more than us my hurt im sure it pales but its there and ashhur help me should such a day as this come to my heart but to ashhur she has gone he has always said the lives of children belong to him and to each one he will open his arms and embrace if ashhur grants me the same welcome the first person ill ask to see is that little brownhaired girl to see how shes grown to see he stopped to swallow and then stared into the fire thank you harruq said for everything we owe you two for all of it delysia said for the time we had with her on behalf of us all thank you two tears running twin paths down each cheek lined aurelias smile youre welcome she said its dark enough the wizard said its time h arruq demanded the task be his he dipped a branch halfway into the fire letting it heat and burn for several minutes until it was solidly lit his heart in his throat he turned to the pyre the rest of the eschaton surrounded it their faces somber he wiped his sniffling nose on his other sleeve and then slowly reluctantly lit the fence of twigs lining the outer rim of the pyre as it caught he stared at the face of his daughter the feeling was surreal but he knew whatever it was that had made his daughter able to love to feel to cling to his leg and look up with an emotion purer than anything in the world was gone from that body for the first time he saw her truly dead he dropped the branch into the fire put his arm around aurelias waist and stood straight he watched the pyre burn he felt his wifes head rest against his shoulder and the wetness there he knew was tears all about the others watched in silence brighter and brighter the fire grew smoke poured up first light and then a heavy billowing shield protecting him from the sight of that little angel chubbier than most elven girls taller her skin soft and her smile innocent and wonderful being consumed by the fire no animals sounded in the newly come night and it seemed even the stars watched in sorrow at that small flicker of flame harruq swore upon the pyre to avenge the loss of his daughter he hated the bitter feeling welling within but he could not deny it only succumb and feed the entity under red visions of rage he imagined killing his brother ramming his sword through his forehead shoving every shred of pain he felt into a crimson blade drenched with blood vengeance gods help him it was all that gave him comfort but for the first time the images broke unable to stand beneath their horrid weight he was not a monster he was not what qurrah thought he was he leaned his neck atop aurelias head their arms holding each other tight as they swayed in the heat of the pyre in his heart he cast aside his vengeance its all right he whispered aurelia did not know to whom he spoke its all right well be all right everything will be all right she turned away from the fire and buried her face into his neck they stood before the flame for more than an hour at last tarlak put a hand on their shoulders and led them back to the tower for the rest they so desperately needed delysia went as well preparing their bed and doing her best to remove bits and things of aulliennas before they arrived brug and haern side by side in the orange light held their solemn stand what kind of man can kill anothers daughter haern whispered to the pyre what kind of monster it doesnt take a monster brug whispered back its the act that makes you one from his pocket haern pulled out the green ribbon he had offered aullienna on the day of her birth on it was the vow of the eschaton to protect her haern dropped it into the fire wondering how he had so miserably failed such a vow brug saw and clapped the assassin on the back they left without another word unwatched the ribbon burned and blackened until nothing but ash remained of the love that had made it q urrah tun stood below the starfilled sky his body a motionless statue his arms out at his sides and his legs stiff his neck ached and his clenched fists trembled with each ragged breath he took he wept the stars his only witness q urrah slept outside shivering as the chill sank into his bones he was a cold bluelipped and miserable even when shame overwhelmed his tears he could not enter the cabin he knew tessanna awaited him probably needing his arms or did she he never knew with her never so out in the dirt he huddled his penance for hurting the girl she loved he thought of his days as a child huddled against his brother for warmth in the slums of veldaren now he had no brother to comfort him if anything harruq would greet him with drawn swords instead of open arms go ahead qurrah said to a phantom harruq clenching his jaw to stop the chattering condemn me if you want he drifted in and out of sleep slowly growing aware of a slight rain his robes were pitiful protection against it the cabin tempted his mind flitting in and out of his selfpity guilt rooted him firm he dreamt just a little a spider hung above his head dangling by a silverglinted thread eight eyes sparkled violet and from its fanged mouth he heard words but did not understand he awoke to the touch of feminine fingers against his arm he kept his eyes closed as tessanna knelt beside him curling her arms about his waist she pressed her body against his her face nestling into the nape of his neck she said nothing neither did he her warmth was not great but it was enough his great convulsions slowed to constant trembling together they rode out the cold suffering they shared t he damned persistent sun ripped open qurrahs eyelids with its light water rimmed his eyeballs so he turned away and buried his face into his arm a cold wind blew against his back and he realized his lover was not with him a burning stirred within his turmoil one he must obey he had to make sure nothing changed despite his broken promise despite his grotesque error he had to know something remained stable he stood and shook the dirt from his hair inside the cabin tessanna sat beside the fire shivering in wet clothing she glanced up at him her face ragged and tired sleep well she asked he pulled her to her feet off went her wet rags she called a dress when she started to protest he rammed his mouth against hers his clothes went next she was like a doll weightless obedient he threw her against a wall her hands pinned behind her back his tongue and teeth nipped and flitted across her neck am i still who i was he hissed into her ear you always will be she said her bottom lip trembling always it should have been enough but anger stirred where there had once been guilt he took her on their bed his motions seeming of vengeance rather than love but she cried out just the same once he had dressed qurrah sought solitude in the forest tessanna gave him time before joining him despite the cold she ventured naked from the cabin qurrah glanced back his heart fluttering at the sight every curve every tender touch of her skin was beyond human if not for the way her ribs showed when she walked or how thin her arms sometimes looked she would have been flawless he knelt at the edge of the dead wildlife when she approached he kept his eyes low and his words quiet do you blame me he asked her part of me does she said but i think its more aurelias fault and your brothers i have to otherwise i would kill you and i dont want to do that what do you think theyll do harruq will want blood he said standing and the others will seek the same even if he does not can they find us in time even if they must search the entire forest she glanced over at him a shy look on her face what are what are we going to do when they show up the halforc turned away and in his silence she found the answer we can go she said the idea offered reluctantly almost in embarrassment lets just go we dont have to stay yes we do a bird dared sing a happy tone and he struck it dead with a wave of his hand tessanna watched with idle curiosity as the rigid lump of feathers fell but why she asked because i will not run he said so softly that the girl had to strain to hear why not because then harruq will be right right about what he turned on her a dark anger smoking underneath the brown of his eyes everything tessannas apathy rose to match his anger fine what do you want me to do qurrah walked to where the dead bird lay a quick mutter of magic syllables and the hollow bones tore out from beneath the soft feathers they swirled around the halforcs hand so tiny i must face harruq he said watching their flight one by one he flung them against a tree the others are yours kill them he returned to the cabin for warmth but the fire had died his frail body shook underneath the blankets of his bed but still the pleasant feel of heat eluded him he shivered and shivered when tessanna offered to join him he turned her away spurned she sat before the dead fire a single slit across the end of her forefinger sent blood dripping down her soft breath blew against the drops when they touched the wood they flickered with flame growing hotter and hotter with each successive drop by the time a great fire roared qurrah had fallen into slumber tessanna did not mind she sucked on her bleeding finger a look of pure hatred blanketing her face as she watched her lover sleep she did not move nor did her look change until she saw his body stir and then apathy grabbed the anger and locked it away h aern snuck into their room just as he had so often to awaken harruq for sparring but this time he did not seek swordplay wake up he said nudging the halforc what is it harruq asked rolling toward him his eyes were wideawake and bloodshot the assassin felt a pang of guilt as he wondered how little the halforc had slept that night i know where your brother hides he whispered not now haern aurelia pleaded from the other side of the bed how do you know harruq said propping himself up with an elbow that does not matter we must not let them have time to slip away you deserve vengeance and i will help give it to you the halforc flung off the blankets and put his feet on the cold floor he shuffled about grabbing armor and swords aurelia sat up not caring that only the flimsiest of fabrics protected her skin from haerns eyes what are you going to do she asked run off on your own if i have to harruq said struggling against the buckles of his chestpiece leave she said to haern the assassin bowed and did as he was told when he was gone the elf left the bed and took her husbands hands in her own halting his preparations i have to do this he said to her but you dont have to do it alone she said harruq pulled against her hands expecting her to release but she held on something in her stronger than he realized not alone she said a quick movement of her hands releasing his grip and unbuckling his armor so that it slid to the ground and not yet she pulled him back to the bed and held him close his hands did not wander and she did not desire it together they huddled against the coming trials enjoying the last moments of darkness before the illusionary dawn rose above the ivy walls matching the rise of the sun outside i dont know what to do harruq said as morning came what do you mean how do i prove him wrong how do i show him i am not the killer he claims when the only right path i see is him dying by my hands she stroked his face do what you think is right just dont do it alone at last she let him go all of us she said sliding her green dress over her body that is how it should be if you say so when they came down for breakfast food was ready and not surprisingly all were dressed for battle brug grumbled from beneath his platemail sharpening one of his punch daggers tarlak had no staff but a spellbook lay on the table beside his plate haern wore his cloaks his twin sabers hidden beneath their fabric even delysia seemed regal and dangerous her white dress so clean and bright it hurt the eyes the golden mountain on her chest shimmered with angry power out of everyone only harruq lacked his armor and did not carry his weapons well didnt expect that tarlak said tearing a strip of bacon in half and shoving it into his mouth grab something to eat ol buddy and then get ready we have a job to do of course he said flustered by the sight of so many ready to risk their lives for him his appetite was greater than he expected he devoured the entire plate put before him plus some of aurelias when finished he dashed up the stairs and returned with his oiled black leather armor strapped tight across his body salvation and condemnation swung from his hips the others saw him ready and rose from the table one by one they filed out the door tarlak pulled the halforc aside away from the others and talked in a quiet tone are you sure you can do this he asked the halforc nodded remembering that tortured moment when he had yanked aulliennas body from the cold water yeah i think so good the wizard patted his shoulder then lets get to it q urrah dragged himself out of bed his shoulders hunched as if carrying a greater weight than his frail body could handle he kissed tessannas forehead ignoring the way her eyes stared numbly past him he flipped through his spellbook glancing over lines he had read hundreds of times they are almost here tessanna said the words intoned as if she were informing him that the sky was cloudy i know the halforc said he took his whip and let it wrap around his arm can you cast spells to protect me the girl nodded her back still to him i can make you safe for awhile his swords are strong the medallion makes them stronger qurrah yes tessanna promise you wont be mad what is it i dont want to kill them but i will i thought you should know that the words were spoken with a calm dead voice ghosts carried more passion more life the halforc gently rocked his head up and down knowing that the fire lived underneath ready to burst forth to wreck and burn i love you he said so you say she said she finally glanced back to him there was no smile on her face no sarcasm her words bit deep he opened his spellbook closed it opened it again and then sighed how do we end this he suddenly asked how do we end this right tessanna looked at him her eyes aching with sorrow i dont think we can she said qurrah nodded he opened the cabin door we must prepare he said stepping outside tessanna followed him out proud and beautiful and sad t he eschaton arrived there was no immediate burst of combat spells did not flare swords stayed sheathed haern remained back told to wait until an opportune moment harruq walked ahead wishing to speak alone with his brother one last time he entered the clearing surrounding the cabin his blood chilled at the feeling of death that hung palpable in the air nothing good has happened in this place he thought qurrah and tessanna waited for him they stood dressed anxious and uncertain harruq looked at his brother seeing for the first time how he had aged his skin had grown paler his hair hung dirty past his shoulders his eyes scared even him intensity beyond words fire his entire body seemed to be dying its life drained into those allseeing orbs hello qurrah he said the words sending the butterflies in his stomach careening into a thousand different flights hello brother qurrah said he gestured to the swords sheathed at his side do you plan to use them i do he answered i know of your daughter i hoped you would harruq waited wishing to hear his next words if they were of repentance guilt horror even regret no matter how insincere he would have stayed his hands we were fools to think our actions would not come back to haunt us qurrah said but they have will you accept their message or will you try to kill me harruq drew his swords i am different than you you are a monster a killer one of the greatest i said i am different the rest of the eschaton approached preparing blade and magic no qurrah said sadness creeping into his voice if you were different then you would not be here you would not be so ready to kill you are the same as i only weaker and the truth is painful to see the rage built inside harruq a fire fueled by hate and revenge he turned to tarlak who waited a step behind do it he told him fire surrounded tarlaks hands mirroring the heat that burned in harruqs chest great arcs of electricity crackled from aurelias palms as one the mages sent their attacks forward on either side of the charging halforc tessanna cried out in shock for both blasts were aimed straight for her she brought up a shield holding back the attacks with her pure magical strength qurrah let free his whip and with a single crack the clearing became chaos h arruqs eyes swam red he saw his brother in a vision of blood and water wet hair and breathless lungs he saw his daughter and through her he saw the need to finish things to end it all no longer was this frail thing of black robes and dying skin his brother a thing to be murdered that was all his last murder qurrah lashed the whip at his legs but it was too predictable to be a surprise harruq swept the flaring leather away with his swords the necromancer struck again drawing a black line across the flesh of harruqs left arm he accepted the pain willingly a few bits of bone flew from a pouch on qurrahs hip arms up to protect his eyes harruq barreled forward closing the last bit of distance between them what should have been an easy kill a stab into his unprotected brothers stomach turned horribly wrong qurrah stood his ground eyes rolled back in his head as he cast a spell condemnation rammed against his robe and recoiled swirling darkness leapt from the robe bleeding into the blade and up the hilt when it touched his hand every nerve went white his hand clenched achingly tight a death grip so that his muscles bulged and his forearms shook when he pulled back the blade the darkness retreated as if it never were the contraction of his muscles loosened with no other plan no other ideas harruq shoved his other sword at a crease between his brothers ribs again the numbing pain and the excruciating tear of every muscle stretching beyond its limits it took all his strength to pull the swords back and break contact with the horrid spell harruq gasped his arms exhausted from only two swings qurrah finished his spell invisible irons attached to every part of harruqs body his armor felt thrice its normal weight his swords felt thick and unwieldy he swung but the attack was like that of a dream connecting with the force of a feather it clacked against qurrahs side and then came the damned darkness pouring into his flesh salvation fell to the ground as much as you have trained you are still a child with knives the necromancer said he lashed with his whip harruqs reaction was half of its finely honed speed his hands lagging behind each blow fire and leather scarred his face his hands and his throat blood seeped down his neck to his armor damn you harruq said the sounds of battle roared around them fire wind and ice crashed and exploded everywhere but to their eyes they saw no death they saw no other battle the two were in their world and none but the gods could interfere harruq cut at his brother each stroke hitting like a stick against the trunk of a tree he held the sword with both hands needing every bit of strength but now the darkness leaked from the weapon to both arms the pain alone finally caused the sword to fall limp from his hands as harruq knelt and reached for it he felt fire wrap around his neck the smell of burning flesh filled his nostrils you shouldnt have come here qurrah said yanking the whip tight harruq pulled at the fire ignoring the horrid pain in his fingers and palms what breath he could draw was clouded with smoke and the bitter taste of his own charred self colorful dots swirled before his eyes desperate he let go of the stubborn end of the whip instead grabbing the middle of the length the fire roared greater his bare hands nearly blackened but his strength no matter how reduced by curse it was was still greater than his brothers one fierce yank and the handle flew from qurrahs hand the fire died the whip slackened and harruq gasped in air qurrah did not give him time to recover he whispered the words of a spell and then glared at the stubborn remembrance of his past life that refused to die hemorrhage he hissed a feeling of blood and pressure filled harruqs chest he slammed a fist against his breast roaring in defiance to the magic he felt blood slip from his flesh and he knew somewhere beneath his armor a laceration had opened but the eruption lacked power best you got harruq said forgive my pity qurrah said and my foolishness for trying to spare you pain he began to cast as the warrior took up his weapons and staggered forward both swords rammed into qurrahs throat ricocheting to either side of his neck the brief contact prevented too much of the dark armor from slipping into his arms but his muscles were already weakened harruq let out a cry both swords falling back to the ground he felt a hand close about his face he saw his brother through the gaps of his fingers qurrah looked back his eyes unforgiving merciless two things happened then first the contact spread the dark of qurrahs enchantment from the flesh of his hand to the flesh of harruqs face second the spell the necromancer cast filled all he touched with chilling cold a river of it pouring from his palm into the beaten halforcs forehead the pain of the darkness was a thousand biting wolves his face twisted and contorted contracting into a horrible visage of pain the cold flooded his mind numbing his entire being thoughts grew hazy images replaced conscious thought he knew he had to move he had to fight aullienna deserved no less he swung both arms like they were tree trunks they knocked qurrahs hand aside breaking both spells harruq gasped feeling his mind returning but not just his mind his rage he forced his fingers to close around the hilts of his swords he wasnt sure if he could feel them or not but it didnt matter staggering to his feet he bellowed a mindless strengthening roar pitiful qurrah said reaching for his bag of bones just pitiful w hen the twin spells of fire and lightning hit her shield tessanna flinched feeling her energy draining away to protect her vulnerable flesh she saw harruq charge a brief lashing of whip but then she could watch no more another dual blast ripped through the air she outstretched her fingers the translucent shield appearing once more two fireballs detonated flames licking the edges her curved barrier as the smoke died there came brug dressed in full platemail get away she said moving her hand in a slapping motion an invisible force slammed brug to the side his flight ending against the trunk of a tree someone shouted his name she didnt know who push me she cried shattering a bolt of ice into shards with lightning halting another fireball with a globe of black that swallowed it whole higher higher her pulse quickened when she saw a familiar shape shoot out of the woods gray cloaks trailed behind whipping in a chaotic pattern light glinted off drawn sabers the watcher had come to play do you miss my fire she asked another slapping motion deflecting the magically summoned boulders aside to crash into the cabin she heard the splintering of logs and the destruction of her childhood home but she felt no loss it was just rotted wood darkness ringing the edges of her fingers she greeted the assassin in her own special way black chains reached up from the ground writhing like snakes they wrapped around haern as he leapt they pulled him down cracking his chin as he landed with a thud more black chains tore upward wrapping around the assassins helpless body a sickly rattle echoed from them as he struggled i got you haern tarlak said casting one of his few spells designed to dispel magic from an area the darkness wavered the chains strength faded as they turned white and pale aurelia tore a chunk of earth into the air blocking tessannas path the earth exploded outward forming a door for the girl to walk through she approached haern who shook off the last of the chains and readied his blades i asked a question she said as burning flames enveloped her flesh did you miss my fire sorry sweetie haern said his hand reaching into a pocket beneath his cloaks im tired of being your torch his hand flipped forward hurling a small blue sapphire it hit with a thud against tessannas forehead an insignificant thing the magic inside it however was massive white light flared out in a sphere washing over her every trace of her fire died her skin exposed haern charged saber tips eager to claim an eye furious at the banishment of her fire she looked at haern and snarled the noise reached tremendous levels and within it power the assassin flew back sound and wind battering him senseless a lightning bolt shot past his head only to be deflected off tessannas hand and sent careening wild the girl clapped her hands together the black of her eyes pushing away all traces of white within them her fingernails went dark her flesh lost what little trace of color it had unsure of what spell she was casting and not caring to see the results tarlak followed his gut he tried a new tactic using a similar spell aurelia had used to control the earth instead of forming a protective wall he ripped a few large chunks directly underneath tessanna the first and largest smashed her hands and chin on its ascent the girl moaned her teeth snapping down on her tongue another section of earth flew into the air spinning her in a sideways cartwheel she landed on her shoulder blood spewed from her mouth as she cried out in pain blue light danced on aurelias fingers and then shards of ice flew from them growing larger in rapid succession tessanna rolled warding her body with her arms most pieces missed but one jagged lance tore through her palm it forced apart bone and puncturing out the other side the skin between her two middle fingers tore halfway to her wrist she did not cry she did not scream she rolled to her knees flipped her long hair away from her face and laughed it feels beautifully alive she said holding out her hand so that the blood dripped onto her dress then thisll feel like a picnic brug said having snuck up unnoticed behind her despite his noisy platemail he jammed his right hand forward the blade aiming for her heart the girl heard his voice and twirled to the side the dagger shredded her dress and nicked a rib his desire to speak ruined him tessanna ducked her eyes alight with fire she smashed her healthy palm to the ground a dome of shimmering violet surrounded them both mages tried to punch through with spells but they were unable to penetrate haern slashed once with his saber the metal bounced back a healthy shock accompanied the swing brug was beyond their help you penetrated me tessanna said laughing just a happy girl laughing as fire burned her eyes brug dove both hands punching at blurring speeds despite his speed his strength and his armor he still only attacked with plain nonmagical metal tessanna made a strange triangular shape with the fingers of her healthy hand an invisible force smashed him back he stuck for a moment to the inside of the violet dome shivering as electricity jolted through his body when he fell smoke wafted from the open parts of his armor brug a female voice shouted tessanna glanced up to see delysia emerge from hiding behind a tree the crazed girl smiled at her i missed you tessanna said drawing out her dagger so often it had cut her own flesh but many men had been on the receiving end of it as well the girl stalked toward him her dagger ready she should be watching tessanna said as she hunched down like an animal it makes this better she lunged snarling like a panther brugs arms felt dead to him he tried to defend himself but his hands refused to move he screamed once when the dagger punched through the crease between his shoulder and his arm blood spilled tessanna licked the blade as the others watched in horror not as sweet as her she giggled but itll do she shoved her dagger with all her strength brug kept his mouth shut refusing to cry out his thoughts dwindled briefly on the project he had just begun an amazing sword that would have granted him prestige among those of his craft he was only half done but it was stunning his last thought was of that sturdy blade before the dagger punched through his eye and sent him to the life beyond the others trembled with rage and grief as she pulled the dagger out an eyeball pierced halfway up the blade she pressed it off with her tongue as she giggled she held up her torn hand to aurelia the ice shard still lodge deeply within its blue color was now a deep purple from the blood that soaked into it a present for a present she said throwing her dagger at the elf it broke through the violet dome shattering the cage that had sealed brug to his death the dagger landed by aurelias feet bounced twice and then finally came to a rest pointed toward her like an arrow aurelias hands shook and she was unsure if she could calm them enough to cast another spell beside her tarlak removed his hat and let it fall to the ground hold nothing back he said his pain muffled behind his anger i wont as one they unleashed their greatest spells a solid beam of pure magic tore from aurelia white brilliance a magical flood tarlak shook as a stream of acid erupted from his hands the two attacks hit the girl simultaneously both braced themselves each of the attacks able to continue as long as they poured their strength into them they expected tessanna to raise a shield to protect herself but she did no such thing with open arms she accepted the attacks the acid bubbled over her skin hissing and burning aurelias white beam struck her in the chest much of it spilling past her small frame this too she endured her tattered dress burned away as did her flesh her stomach crunched inward bits of her ribs poked through the exposed flesh and yet she laughed both streams ended neither mage able to focus them any longer haern streaked in hoping for surprise after the torrent of spells tessanna sensed his approach without ever looking she pointed her maimed hand at him and extended her fingers to their fullest black tendrils shot forth they cut haerns flesh tore at his cloaks and slammed him to the dirt thank you she said to all of them her tattered dress fell from her body she looked like a dead aberration her ribs showing and her chest horribly burned yet her eyes and hair shimmered with life they did not understand tessanna spread her arms and from her back grew ethereal wings she turned her eyes to the sky a robe of purest black flowing over her naked body when she spoke the death in her voice chilled them where they stood you cannot harm a goddess she said bolts of shadow growing around her hands she threw them like pebbles dozens of the swelling meteors haern unable to dodge due to the tendrils that still bit into his skin screamed under the assault each one bruised like a brick and then the magic seeped in igniting every nerve with pain tarlak aurelia and even delysia summoned what shielding they could but the torrent was great and their own beings weakened two hit tarlak square in the chest sapping his breath one hit aurelias hand numbing her fingers poor delysia felt one punch through her shield and crash against her throat she fell to the ground gasping for breath that refused to come youre no goddess haern said squirming away from his biting prison she tried to kill him for his insolence her blade of darkness sliced off a chunk of his hair but drew no blood it went on to fell two trees before dissipating the assassin lunged hurling a saber as he did the weapon hit her and bounced off she tried to grab him but he twirled avoiding her touch and then slashed at her neck he felt grim satisfaction as it pierced flesh tessanna shrieked the wail of an injured banshee blood flowed down her neck be gone she screamed the command flung him through the air three more bolts of shadow followed when he smacked into the upper branches of a tree the bolts pummeled his chest he fell to the dirt moaning tessanna glared at him her good hand pressed against the wound blood her blood poured over her fingers and onto her shimmering black dress delysia rushed to haerns side tears on her face and healing light pouring from her hands for a goddess you bleed nicely tarlak said preparing another spell his head ached his temples throbbed beside him aurelia seemed to be suffering similar problems she looked unsteady on her feet as she loosed an arcing net of lightning the silverwhite swirled around tessannas body causing no damage tarlak tried another fireball but she prematurely detonated it with a spell of her own i do this for aullienna tessanna said before chanting words of a spell a wave of shadows rolled toward them within the wave they saw stars nebulas and galaxies that they had no name for then the blackness hit and all they knew was pain delysia lost her concentration her healing spell dying on her lips tarlak fell to his knees his mind spinning aurelia managed to stand the darkness parting before her as if out of respect when the wave passed the elf looked at tessanna with an expression that fueled the dark goddesss anger pity b efore qurrah could draw any bones from his bag harruq slashed it open spilling a chalky white pile to the dirt nonplussed qurrah enchanted all of them into a giant barrage of ribs teeth and fingers harruq crossed his arms and endured the bones could bruise even draw blood but they could not do serious damage unless they found his eyes mouth or throat the halforc took a blind step forward then another he felt his brothers hand latch onto his wrist and again a thieving draining sensation flooded him he gave it no time to feed both swords whipped around slashing away the wrist harruq looked down fascinated by what he saw your armor is gone harruq said lifting condemnation so that qurrah could see a single scarlet drop of blood fall from the keen edge qurrah glanced to his arm where a thin cut marred his pale skin for once fear rounded the edges of the necromancers eyes you will not dare strike qurrah said firing off a spell a bolt of shadow leapt from his fingers thudding into harruqs chest like a hammer ribs snapped before he could move a second followed striking his shoulder for an agonizing moment he thought the bones there would crack and break the pain was so intense they did not and his anger grew with each new source of pain not desiring a third blow he leapt forward his head leading the top of his skull rammed into qurrahs chest knocking the air out of another spell harruq tried an awkward cut as they both fell the blade sliced just below the knee no pain or darkness flooded into his hand no solid stone greeted his blade just soft bleeding flesh qurrah rolled back and pushed away needing distance from those cursed swords he put his weight on the cut leg which buckled from its wound he hobbled on the other harruq hefted his bulk from the dirt glaring death a bolt of lightning flashed over his head from which of the three casters he did not know the glare hurt his eyes and disorientated his vision in a haze of black qurrah turned to face his brother you are a killer qurrah said reaching a hand into a hidden pocket of his robe you prove me right with every cut just one last time harruq said he charged qurrahs hand streaked victoriously from the pocket scattering a great white mist of bones he had laboriously prepared a single word by the necromancer and they grew rigid in the air harruq tried to slam through the hovering bits tore into the flesh of his face and hands when his chest hit the bulk of it he gasped in pain blood poured down coloring the powder red his strength sapped he fell back landing hard on one elbow he heard another pop his collarbone yes brother qurrah mocked dark energy covering his hands just one last time y ou wanted to see her again didnt you aurelia asked you kept her from me tessanna seethed the elf shook her head as if things suddenly made sense to her it was your idea wasnt it you wanted to make aulliennas mind like yours she was mine to love the girl said her hands shaking mine you know it dont you aurelia said tears wanted to run down her face but she was too exhausted to cry it was you that killed her you killed what you lovedbut youve always done that havent you tessannas face froze her anger and confusion spun out of control she could think of no action that seemed right she wanted to kneel and cry she wanted to tear the elf into shreds she wanted to flee she wanted to beg for forgiveness she wanted to die so she did nothing h arruq tried to move tried to lift his swords but his arms refused another spell would come and he would be helpless before it although he had dealt death so often he felt overwhelmingly unprepared he closed his eyes terror in every fiber dimly he felt regret knowing he would never feel the soft silk of aurelias hair through his fingers again he thought of aullienna smiling up at him as she bounced on his knee no he thought no he rammed his heel against qurrahs cut knee the necromancer screamed blood ran down his leg he staggered back struggling to regain his balance on his one good leg harruq clutched his swords with renewed strength his anger fought against the curse he would not fail he would not betray aullienna he closed the distance between them slashing with both blades qurrah more fell than dove away but it was enough salvation tore through the robes and across his chest the wound too shallow to do more than spray blood across the glowing blade his good leg pushed him back to his feet he ran knowing his brother followed with legs that pumped with life and vigor qurrah had not known since birth suddenly a great force pressed into his back and then he was flying a tree stopped him the collision blacked out his vision he lay slumped his arms out as if he were embracing the trunk his breath wheezed in a most pitiful way he clutched the bark with his fingers and pushed himself around refusing to die with a blade in his back like a coward will you kill me qurrah asked a strange leer spreading across his face yes harruq said he stabbed salvation to the ground both hands closed around the hilt of condemnation he looked upon his brother beaten and bloodied a great welt swelled across his forehead blood surrounded his irises the sound of his breath labored and weak brought him back to the days when qurrah was a scrawny child unable to defend himself a child that had looked to him for protection and now he looked to him with eyes begging for death in her frozen chaos tessanna turned yearning for her lover she saw him there propped against the tree harruq towered over him the others followed her gaze every soul there watched every soul waited i was right qurrah said kill me let me die knowing that one truth im sorry harruq said his sword hesitated his arms shook his lips trembled from his gut bellowed a roar filled with anguish hate pain and love he slammed his blade deep into the trunk of the tree it drew no blood it took no life condemnation missed im sorry harruq said gasping out the words but i cant you fool tarlak said his heart sinking tessanna shrieked a cry harruq knew well it was the same sound he had made upon finding his daughter a thick bolt of lightning struck the side of his chest plowing him away from the beaten qurrah he did not resist every muscle in his body slack the goddess ran to her lover her ethereal wings fading away like smoke qurrah rose took a weak step forward and collapsed into her arms tessannas dark robe faded away naked and wounded she struggled to hold what little weight the halforc had she saw his bruises she felt the wet blood spilling on her he tried to speak but it was an inane hiss to her ears aullienna loved you aurelia shouted her magical strength was gone it was the only attack she could make tessanna shrieked back at her the sound like the cry an alley cat she turned waved her arms and then a black portal ripped into the air she carried her lover inside desperate to flee the damning words of the elf with a hiss of air the portal closed one final crack signifying its disappearance the brief silence that came after was shocking aurelia rushed to her husband crying out his name she knelt down at his side his bruised body covered with blood im so sorry he grunted before passing out oh harruq she said brushing a hand across his face she laid her head on his chest and listened to the beat of his heart tarlak went to his sister she was sobbing over haern pouring healing spell after healing spell into his beaten body the wizard took her hands and pulled her to a stand so he could embrace her hell be fine he whispered into her ear give him time hell be fine i have to help him delysia sobbed i cant let him not like brug not like tarlak shushed her she buried her head in his shoulder and cried silently he closed his eyes and rocked sidetoside thinking a thousand deaths he would not mind befalling qurrah tun they turned to look at brugs still body tarlak left her to go to him he knelt down and closed the eyelids when the vacant eye refused to stay shut he tilted the helmet to cover it but only after he kissed the mans forehead keep a drink ready for me he said standing his eyes turned to the halforc still in his wifes arms you idiot the wizard said unable to convey the weight of everything but that was close close enough to matter you damn fucking idiot they made another pyre using the leftover wood cut the day before the mood was no less somber their hearts torn the four watched the body consumed by fire will we chase them haern asked he looked healthier delysias healing spells doing much to cure the many bruises the shadow bolts had left before he answered tarlak looked over at the halforc who stood with his wifes arms around him his arm was in a sling and his face and neck a burnt mess no he said at last weve lost too many let them come to us i will not send any more to die will he leave us be tarlak cast a ring brug had made for him onto the fire only ashhur knows he said but i pray that he does harruq watched the body burn the comfort of his wife meager compared to the guilt he now carried two lives had come to repay the debt of the countless he had massacred two lives he could have spared worse qurrah remained free with his demon girl at his side the fire swayed to one side dancing in the wind he wondered if his brother felt guilt for his actions just the previous night he had sworn death and yet he could not see it through what did that mean he had spared his brothers life and done what his conscience had demanded in that brutal second where he almost plunged the blade into flesh try as he might he could not convince himself he had done the right thing he had been a coward or a fool or a failure was i wrong he whispered what was that aurelia asked glancing up at him he only shook his head nothing he stayed out later than the rest watching until the fire died deep in the night at its last flicker he wished to whatever god that might exist that might listen to have that day back over again no god answered not in a way he knew how to listen for alone he stood feeling forsaken by the world a cold wind blew against his skin a sign that winter was coming early a gainst that same wind qurrah and tessanna huddled without fire or blanket for warmth the girl shivered naked her thin body nestled into his robes neither had been able to find sleep she wasnt right tessanna muttered unable to stand the voices that echoed incessantly in her head right about what qurrah asked the girl opened her mouth to answer but could not say it so instead she asked what will we do the halforc pulled her closer burying his face into her hair to hide his few stubborn tears i have broken too many promises i will keep the rest i will go west and claim darakkens spellbook as my own i will heal your mind it is the one promise i can still keep can i come she asked his robe clutched tight in her hands i do not want to be alone please take me with you in answer qurrah lifted her face and kissed her together they shared their warmth against the biting wind when he looked to the stars his mind thought only of his brother and of how he had veered his blade at the last moment when he should have buried it to the hilt in his forehead it was in this qurrah found something to cling to some hope within the madness of the day his brother still loved him comforted he curled closer to tessanna and endured the long dreary night
