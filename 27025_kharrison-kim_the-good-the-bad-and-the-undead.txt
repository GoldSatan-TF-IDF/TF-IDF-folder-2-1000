the good the bad and the undead kim harrison to the man who knows caffeine comes first chocolate comes second romance comes thirdand when they ought to be reversed one i hitched the canvas strap holding the watering canister higher up on my shoulder and stretched to get the nozzle into the hanging plant sunlight streamed in warm through my blue institutional jumpsuit past the narrow plateglass windows was a small courtyard surrounded by vip offices squinting from the sun i squeezed the handle of the watering hose and the barest hint of water hissed through there was a burst of clattering computer keys and i moved to the next plant down phone conversation filtered in from the office past the reception desk accompanied by a belly laugh that sounded like the bark of a dog weres the higher up in the pack they were the more human looking they managed but you could always tell when they laughed i glanced down the row of hanging plants before the windows to the freestanding fish tank behind the receptionists desk yup creamcolored fins black spot on right side this was the one mr ray raised koi showing them in cincinnatis annual fish show last years winner was always displayed in his outer office but now there were two fish and the howlers mascot was missing mr ray was a den boy a rival of cincinnatis all inderland baseball team it didnt take much to put two and two together and get stolen fish so the cheerful woman behind the desk said as she stood to drop a ream of paper into the printers hopper mark is on vacation he didnt tell me i nodded not looking at the secretary dressed in her snappy creamcolored business suit as i dragged my watering equipment down another three feet mark was taking a short vacation in the stairwell of the building he had been servicing before this one knocked out with a shortterm sleepytime potion yes maam i added raising my voice and adding a slight lisp he told me what plants to water though i curled my red manicured nails under my palms before she spotted them they didnt go with the working plantgirl image i should have thought of that earlier all the ones on this floor and then the arboretum on the roof the woman smiled to show me her slightly larger teeth she was a were and fairly high up in the office pack by her amount of polish and mr ray wouldnt have a dog for a secretary when he could pay a high enough salary for a bitch a faint scent of musk came from her not unpleasant did mark tell you about the service elevator at the back of the building she said helpfully its easier than lugging that cart up all those stairs no maam i said pulling the ugly cap with the plantman logo on it tighter to my head i think hes making everything just hard enough that i dont try to take his territory pulse quickening i pushed marks cart with its pruning shears fertilizer pellets and watering system farther down the line i had known of the elevator along with the placement of the six emergency exits the pulls for the fire alarm and where they kept the doughnuts men she said rolling her eyes as she sat before her screen again dont they realize that if we wanted to rule the world we could i gave her a noncommittal nod and squirted a tiny amount of water into the next plant i kinda thought we already did a tight hum rose over the whirl of the printer and the faint office chatter it was jenks my partner and he was clearly in a bad mood as he flew out of the bosss back office and to me his dragonfly wings were bright red in agitation and pixy dust sifted from him to make temporary sunbeams im done with the plants in there he said loudly as he landed on the rim of the hanging pot in front of me he put his hands on his hips to look like a middleage peter pan grown up to be a trashman in his little blue jumpsuit his wife had even sewn him a matching cap all they need is water can i help you out here with anything or can i go back and sleep in the truck he added acerbically i took the watering canister off me setting it down to unscrew the top i could use a fertilizer pellet i prompted wondering what his problem was grumbling he flew to the cart and started rummaging green twist ties stakes and used ph test strips flew everywhere got one he said coming up with a white pellet as large as his head he dropped it in the canister and it fizzed it wasnt a fertilizer pellet but an oxygenator and slimecoat promoter whats the point of stealing a fish if it dies in transport oh my god rachel jenks whispered as he landed on my shoulder its polyester im wearing polyester my tension eased as i realized where his bad mood came from itll be okay im breaking out he said scratching vigorously under his collar i cant wear polyester pixies are allergic to polyester look see he tilted his head so his blond hair shifted from his neck but he was too close to focus on welts and it stinks i can smell the oil im wearing dead dinosaur i cant wear a dead animal its barbaric rache he pleaded jenks i screwed the cap lightly back onto the canister and hung it over my shoulder pushing jenks from me in the process im wearing the same thing suck it up but it stinks i eyed him hovering before me prune something i said through gritted teeth he flipped me off with both hands hovering backward as he went whatever patting my back pocket of the vile blue jumpsuit i found my snippers while miss office professional typed a letter i snapped open a step stool and began to clip leaves off the hanging plant beside her desk jenks started to help and after a few moments i breathed are we set in there he nodded his eyes on the open door to mr rays office the next time he checks his mail the entire internet security system is gonna trip it will take five minutes to fix if she knows what shes doing four hours if she doesnt i only need five minutes i said starting to sweat in the sun coming in the window it smelled like a garden in there a garden with a wet dog panting on the cool tile my pulse increased and i moved down another plant i was behind the desk and the woman stiffened i had invaded her territory but she had to put up with it i was the water girl hoping she attributed my rising tension to being so close to her i kept working my one hand rested on the lid of the watering canister one twist and it would be off vanessa came an irate shout from the back office here we go jenks said flying up to the ceiling and the security cameras i turned to see an irate man clearly a were by his slight size and build hanging halfway out of the back office it did it again he said his face red and his thick hands gripping the archway i hate these things what was wrong with paper i like paper a professional smile wreathed the secretarys face mr ray you yelled at it again didnt you i told you computers are like women if you shout at them or ask them to do too many things at once they shut down and you wont even get a sniff he growled an answer and disappeared into his office unaware or ignoring that she had just threatened him my pulse leapt and i moved the stool right beside the tank vanessa sighed god save him she muttered as she got up that man could break his balls with his tongue giving me an exasperated look she went into the back office her heels thumping dont touch anything she said loudly im coming i took a quick breath cameras i breathed jenks dropped down to me ten minute loop youre clear he flew to the main door perching himself on the molding above the lintel to hang over and watch the exterior hallway his wings blurred to nothing and he gave me a tiny thumbsup my skin tightened in anticipation i took off the fish tank lid then pulled the green fishnet from an inner pocket of the jumpsuit standing atop the step stool i pushed my sleeve to my elbow and plunged the net into the water immediately both fish darted to the back rachel jenks hissed suddenly at my ear shes good shes halfway there just watch the door jenks i said lip between my teeth how long could it take to catch a fish i pushed a rock over to get to the fish hiding behind it they darted to the front the phone started ringing a soft hum jenks will you get that i said calmly as i angled the net trapping them in the corner got you now jenks zipped back from the door landing feet first on the glowing button mr rays office hold please he said in a high falsetto crap i swore as the fish wiggled slipping past the green net come on im just trying to get you home you slimy finned thing i coaxed through gritted teeth almostalmost it was between the net and the glass if it would just hold still hey a heavy voice said from the hall adrenaline jerked my head up a small man with a trim beard and a folder of papers was standing in the hallway leading to the other offices what are you doing he asked belligerently i glanced at the tank with my arm in it my net was empty the fish had slipped past it um i dropped my scissors i said from mr rays office on my other side came a thump of heels and vanessas gasp mr ray damn so much for the easy way plan b jenks i said grunting as i grabbed the top of the tank and pulled in the other room vanessa screamed as the tank tipped and twentyfive gallons of icky fish water cascaded over her desk mr ray appeared beside her i lurched off the stool soaked from the waist down no one moved shocked and i scanned the floor gotcha i cried scrabbling for the right fish shes after the fish the small man shouted as more people came in from the hallway get her go jenks shrilled ill keep them off you panting i followed the fish in a hunched scrabbling walk trying to grab it without hurting it it wiggled and squirmed and my breath exploded from me as i finally got my fingers around it i looked up as i dropped it into the canister and screwed the lid on tight jenks was a firefly from hell as he darted from were to were brandishing pencils and throwing them at sensitive parts a fourinch pixy was holding three weres at bay i wasnt surprised mr ray was content to watch until he realized i had one of his fish what the hell are you doing with my fish he demanded his face red with anger leaving i said he came at me his thick hands reaching i obligingly took one of them jerking him forward and into my foot he staggered back clutching his stomach quit playing with those dogs i cried at jenks looking for a way out we have to go picking up vanessas monitor i threw it at the plateglass window id wanted to do that with ivys for a long time it shattered in a satisfying crash the screen looking odd on the grass weres poured into the room angry and giving off musk snatching the canister i dove through the window after her someone shouted my shoulders hit manicured grass and i rolled to my feet up jenks said by my ear over there he darted across the small enclosed courtyard i followed looping the heavy canister to hang across my back hands free i climbed the trellis thorns pierced my skin ignored my breath came in a quick pant as i reached the top the snapping of branches said they were following hauling myself over the lip of the flattopped tarandpebble roof i took off running the wind was hot up here and the skyline of cincinnati spread out before me jump jenks shouted as i reached the edge i trusted jenks arms flailing and feet still going i ran right off the roof adrenaline surged as my stomach dropped it was a parking lot he sent me off the roof to land in a parking lot i dont have wings jenks i screamed teeth gritted i flexed my knees pain exploded as i hit the pavement i fell forward scraping my palms the canister of fish clanged and fell off as the strap broke i rolled to absorb the impact the metal canister spun away and still gasping from the hurt i staggered after it fingers brushing it as it rolled under a car swearing i dropped flat on the pavement stretching for it there she is came a shout there was a ping from the car above me then another the pavement beside my arm suddenly had a hole in it and sharp tingles of shrapnel peppered me they were shooting at me grunting i wiggled under the car and pulled the canister out hunched over the fish i backed up hey i shouted tossing the hair from my eyes what the hell are you doing its just a fish and it isnt even yours the trio of weres on the roof stared at me one hefted a weapon to his eye i turned and started running this was not worth five hundred dollars anymore five thousand maybe next time i vowed as i pounded after jenks id find out the particulars before i charge my standard fee this way jenks shrilled bits of pavement were ricocheting up to hit me echoing the pings the lot wasnt gated and as my muscles trembled from adrenaline i ran across the street and into the pedestrian traffic heart pounding i slowed to look behind me to see them silhouetted against the skyline they hadnt jumped they didnt need to i had left blood all over that trellis still i didnt think they would track me it wasnt their fish it was the howlers and cincinnatis all inderland baseball team was going to pay my rent my lungs heaved as i tried to match the pace of the people around me the sun was hot and i was sweating inside my polyester sack jenks was probably checking my back so i dropped into an alley to change setting the fish down i let my head thump back into the cool wall of the building id done it rent was made for yet another month reaching up i yanked the disguise amulet from around my neck immediately i felt better as the illusion of a darkcompleted brownhaired bignosed woman vanished revealing my frizzy shoulderlength red hair and pale skin i glanced at my scraped palms rubbing them together gingerly i could have brought a pain amulet but i had wanted as few charms as possible on me in case i was caught and my intent to steal turned into intent to steal and do bodily harm one i could dodge the other id have to answer to i was a runner i knew the law while people passed at the head of the alley i stripped off the damp coveralls and stuffed it into the dumpster it was a vast improvement and i bent to unroll the hem of my leather pants down over my black boots straightening i eyed the new scrape mark in my pants twisting to see all the damage ivys leather conditioner would help but pavement and leather didnt mesh well better the pants scraped than me though which was why i wore them the september air felt good in the shade as i tucked in my black halter top and picked up the canister feeling more myself i stepped into the sun dropping my cap on a passing kids head he looked at it then smiled giving me a shy wave as his mother bent to ask him where he had gotten it at peace with the world i walked down the sidewalk boot heels clunking as i fluffed my hair and headed for fountain square and my ride i had left my shades there this morning and if i was lucky theyd still be there god help me but i liked being independent it had been nearly three months since i had snapped under the crap assignments my old boss at inderland security had been giving me feeling used and grossly unappreciated i had broken the unwritten rule and quit the is to start my own agency it had seemed like a good idea at the time and surviving the subsequent death threat when i couldnt pay the bribe to break my contract had been an eye opener i wouldnt have made it if not for ivy and jenks oddly enough now that i was finally starting to make a name for myself it was getting harder not easier true i was putting my degree to work stirring spells i used to buy and some i had never been able to afford but money was a real problem it wasnt that i couldnt get the jobs it was that the money didnt seem to stay in the cookie jar atop the fridge very long what i made from proving a werefox had been slipped some bane by a rival den had gone to renewing my witch license the is used to pay for that i recovered a stolen familiar for a warlock and spent it on the monthly rider on my health insurance i hadnt known that runners were all but uninsurable the is had given me a card and id used it then i had to pay some guy to take the lethal spells off my stuff still in storage buy ivy a silk robe to replace the one i ruined and pick up a few outfits for myself since i now had a reputation to uphold but the steady drain on my finances had to be from the cab fares most of cincinnatis bus drivers knew me by sight and wouldnt pick me up which was why ivy had to come cart me home it just wasnt fair it had been almost a year since i accidentally removed the hair from an entire busload of people while trying to tag a were i was tired of being almost broke but the money for recovering the howlers mascot would put me in the clear for another month and the weres wouldnt follow me it wasnt their fish if they filed a complaint at the is theyd have to explain where they had gotten it hey rache jenks said dropping down from who knew where your back is clear and what is plan b my eyebrows rose and i looked askance at him as he flew alongside matching my pace exactly grab the fish and run like hell jenks laughed and landed on my shoulder he had ditched his tiny uniform and he looked like his usual self in a longsleeve huntergreen silk shirt and pants a red bandana was about his forehead to tell any pixy or fairies whose territory we might walk through that he wasnt poaching sparkles glittered in his wings where the last of the pixy dust stirred up by the excitement remained my pace slowed as we reached fountain square i scanned for ivy not seeing her not worried i went to sit on the dry side of the fountain running my fingers under the rim of the retaining wall for my shades shed be here the woman lived and died by schedules while jenks flew through the spray to get rid of the last of the dead dinosaur stink i snapped open my shades and put them on my brow eased as the glare of the september afternoon was muted stretching my long legs out i casually took off the scent amulet that was around my neck and dropped it into the fountain weres tracked by smell and if they did follow me the trail would end here as soon as i got in ivys car and drove away hoping no one had noticed i glanced over the surrounding people a nervous anemiclooking vampire lackey out doing his lovers daytime work two whispering humans giggling as they eyed his badly scarred neck a tired witchno warlock i decided by the lack of a strong redwood smellsitting at a nearby bench eating a muffin and me i took a slow breath as i settled in having to wait for a ride was kind of an anticlimax i wish i had a car i said to jenks as i edged the canister of fish to sit between my feet thirty feet away traffic was stopandgo it had picked up and i guessed it was probably after two oclock just beginning the span of time when humans and inderlanders started their daily struggle to coexist in the same limited space things got a hell of a lot easier when the sun went down and most humans retired to their homes what do you want with a car jenks asked as he perched himself on my knee and started to clean his dragonflylike wings with long serious strokes i dont have a car ive never had a car i get around okay cars are trouble he said but i wasnt listening anymore you have to put gas in them and keep them in repair and spend time cleaning them and you have to have a place to put them and then theres the money you lavish on them its worse than a girlfriend still i said jiggling my foot to irritate him i wish i had a car i glanced at the people around me james bond never had to wait for a bus ive seen every one of his movies and he never waited for a bus i squinted at jenks it kinda loses its pizzazz um yeah he said his attention behind me i can see where it might be safer too eleven oclock weres my breath came fast as i looked and my tension slammed back into me crap i whispered picking up the canister it was the same three i could tell by their hunched stature and the way they were breathing deeply jaw clenched i stood up and put the fountain between us where was ivy rache jenks questioned why are they following you i dont know my thoughts went to the blood i had left on the roses if i couldnt break the scent trail they could follow me all the way home but why mouth dry i sat with my back to them knowing jenks was watching have they winded me i asked he left in a clatter of wings no he said when he returned a bare second later youve got about half a block between you but you gotta get moving jiggling i weighed the risk of staying still and waiting for ivy with moving and being spotted damn it i wish i had a car i muttered i leaned to look into the street searching for the tall blue top of a bus a cab anything where the hell was ivy heart pounding i stood clutching the fish to me i headed for the street wanting to get into the adjacent office building and the maze i could lose myself in while waiting for ivy but a big black crown victoria slowed to a stop getting in my way i glared at the driver my tight face going slack when the window whined down and he leaned over the front seat ms morgan the dark man said his deep voice belligerent i glanced at the weres behind me then at the car then him a black crown victoria driven by a man in a black suit could only mean one thing he was from the federal inderland bureau the humanrun equivalent of the is what did the fib want yeah who are you bother crossed him i talked to ms tamwood earlier she said i could find you here ivy i put a hand on the open window is she all right he pressed his lips together traffic was backing up behind him she was when i talked with her on the phone jenks hovered before me his tiny face frightened they winded you rache my breath hissed in through my nose i glanced behind me my gaze fell on one of the weres seeing me watching him he barked out a hail the other two started to converge loping forward with an unhurried grace i swallowed hard i was dog chow thats it dog chow game over hit the reset button spinning i grabbed the door handle and jerked it up i dove in slamming the door behind me drive i shouted turning to look out the back window the mans long face took on a tinge of disgust as he glanced behind him in his rearview mirror are they with you no does this thing move or do you just sit in it and play with yourself making a low noise of irritation he accelerated smoothly i spun in my seat watching the weres come to a halt in the middle of the street horns blew from the cars forced to stop for them turning back around i clutched my fish canister and closed my eyes in relief i was going to get ivy for this i swear i was going to use her precious maps as weed block in the garden she was supposed to pick me up not send some fib flunky pulse slowing i turned to look at him he was a good head taller than me which was saying somethingwith nice shoulders curly black hair cut close to his skull square jaw and a stiff attitude just begging for me to smack him comfortably muscled without going overboard there wasnt even the hint of a gut on him in his perfectly fitting black suit white shirt and black tie he could be the fib poster boy his mustache and beard were cut in the latest styleso minimal that they almost werent thereand i thought he might do better to lighten up on his aftershave i eyed the handcuff pouch on his belt wishing i still had mine they had belonged to the is and i missed them dearly jenks settled himself at his usual spot on the rearview mirror where the wind wouldnt tear his wings and the stiffnecked man watched him with an intentness that told me he had little contact with pixies lucky him a call came over the radio about a shoplifter at the mall and he snapped it off thanks for the ride i said ivy sent you he tore his eyes from jenks no she said youd be here captain edden wants to talk you something concerning councilman trent kalamack the fib officer added indifferently kalamack i yelped then cursed myself for having said anything the wealthy bastard wanted me to work for him or see me dead it depended on his mood and how well his stock portfolio was doing kalamack huh i amended shifting uneasily in the leather seat why is edden sending you to fetch me you on his hit list this week he said nothing his blocky hands gripping the wheel so tight that his fingernails went white the silence grew we went through a yellow light shifting to red ah who are you i finally asked he made a scoffing noise deep in his throat i was used to wary distrust from most humans this guy wasnt afraid and it was ticking me off detective glenn maam he said maam jenks said laughing he called you maam i scowled at jenks he looked young to have made detective the fib must have been getting desperate well thank you detective glade i said mangling his name you can drop me off anywhere i can take the bus from here ill come out to see captain edden tomorrow im working an important case right now jenks snickered and the man flushed the red almost hidden behind his dark skin its glenn maam and i saw your important case want me to take you back to the fountain no i said slumping in my seat thoughts of angry young weres going through my head i appreciate the lift to my office though its in the hollows take the next left im not your driver he said grimly clearly unhappy im your delivery boy i shifted my arm inside as he rolled the window up from his control panel immediately it grew stuffy jenks flitted to the ceiling trapped what the hell are you doing he shrilled yeah i exclaimed more irate than worried whats up captain edden wants to see you now ms morgan not tomorrow his gaze darted from the street to me his jaw was tight and i didnt like his nasty smile and if you so much as reach for a spell ill yank your witch butt out of my car cuff you and throw you in the trunk captain edden sent me to get you but he didnt say what kind of shape you had to be in jenks alighted on my earring swearing up a blue streak i repeatedly flicked the switch for the window but glenn had locked it i settled back with a huff i could jam my finger in glenns eye and force us off the road but why i knew where i was going and edden would see that i had a ride home it ticked me off though running into a human who had more gall than i did what was the city coming to a sullen silence descended i took my sunglasses off and leaned over noticing the man was going fifteen over the posted limit figures watch this jenks whispered my eyebrows rose as the pixy flitted from my earring the autumn sun coming in was suddenly full of sparkles as he surreptitiously sifted a glowing dust over the detective id bet my best pair of lace panties it wasnt the usual pixy dust glenn had been pixed i hid a smile in about twenty minutes glenn would be itching so bad he wouldnt be able to sit still so how come you arent scared of me i asked brazenly feeling vastly better a witch family lived next door when i was a kid he said warily they had a girl my age she hit me with just about everything a witch can do to a person a faint smile crossed his square face to make him look very unfiblike the saddest day of my life was when she moved away i made a pouty face poor baby i said and his scowl returned i wasnt pleased though edden sent him to pick me up because he had known i couldnt bully him i hated mondays two the gray stone of the fib tower caught the late afternoon sun as we parked in one of the reserved slots right in front of the building the street was busy and glenn stiffly escorted me and my fish in through the front door tiny blisters between his neck and collar were already starting to show a sorelooking pink against his dark skin jenks noticed my eyes on them and snorted looks like mr fib detective is sensitive to pixy dust he whispered its going to run through his lymphatic system hes going to be itching in places he didnt know he had really i asked appalled usually you only itched where the dust hit glenn was in for twentyfour hours of pure torture yeah he wont be trapping a pixy in a car again but i thought i heard a tinge of guilt in his voice and he wasnt humming his victory song about daisies and steel glinting red in the moonlight either my steps faltered before crossing the fib emblem inlaid in the lobby floor i wasnt superstitiousapart from when it might save my lifebut i was entering what was generally humansonly territory i didnt like being a minority the sporadic conversation and clatter of keyboards remind me of my old job with the is and my shoulders eased justices wheels were greased with paper and fueled by quick feet on the streets whether the feet were human or inderlander was irrelevant at least to me the fib had been created to take the place of both local and federal authorities after the turn on paper the fib had been enacted to help protect the remaining humans from theahmore aggressive inderlanders generally the vamps and weres the reality was dissolving the old law structure had been a paranoiac attempt to keep us inderlanders out of law enforcement yeah right the outofthecloset outofwork inderland police and federal agents had simply started their own bureau the is after forty years the fib was hopelessly outclassed taking steady abuse from the is as they both tried to keep tabs on cincinnatis varied citizens the is taking the supernatural stuff the fib couldnt as i followed glenn to the back i shifted the canister to hide my left wrist not many people would recognize the small circular scar on the underside of my wrist as a demon mark but i preferred to err on the side of caution neither the fib nor the is knew i had been involved in the demoninduced incident that trashed the universitys ancientbook locker last spring and id just as soon keep it that way it had been sent to kill me but it ultimately saved my life id wear the mark until i found a way to pay the demon back glenn wove between the desks past the lobby and my eyebrows rose in that not a single officer made one ribald comment about a redhead in leather but next to the screaming prostitute with purple hair and a glowinthedark chain running from her nose to somewhere under her shirt we were probably invisible i glanced at the shuttered windows of eddens office as we passed waving at rose his assistant her face flashed red as she pretended to ignore me and i sniffed i was used to such slights but it was still irritating the rivalry between the fib and the is was longstanding that i didnt work for the is anymore didnt seem to matter then again it could be she simply didnt like witches i breathed easier when we left the front behind and entered a sterile fluorescentlit hallway glenn too relaxed into a slower pace i could feel the office politics flowing behind us like unseen currents but was too dispirited to care we passed an empty meeting room my eyes going to the huge drymarker board where the weeks most pressing crimes were plastered pushing out the usual humanstalkedbyvamp crimes was a list of names i felt ill as my eyes dropped we were walking too fast to read them but i knew what they had to be id been following the papers just like everyone else morgan shouted a familiar voice and i spun my boots squeaking on the gray tile it was edden his squat silhouette hastening down the hallway toward us arms swinging immediately i felt better slugs take it jenks muttered rache im outta here ill see you at home stay put i said amused at the pixys grudge and if you say one foul word to edden ill amdro your stump glenn snickered and it was probably just as well i couldnt hear what jenks muttered edden was an exnavy seal and looked it keeping his hair regulation short his khaki pants creased and his body under his starched white shirt honed though his thick shock of straight hair was black his mustache was entirely gray a welcoming smile covered his round face as he strode forward tucking a pair of plasticrimmed reading glasses into his shirt pocket the captain of cincinnatis fib division came to an abrupt halt wafting the smell of coffee over me he was my height almost exactlymaking him somewhat short for a manbut he made up for it in presence edden arched his eyebrows at my leather pants and lessthanprofessional halter top its good to see you morgan he said i hope i didnt catch you at a bad time i shifted my canister and extended my hand his stubby thick fingers engulfed mine familiar and welcoming no not at all i said dryly and edden put a heavy hand on my shoulder directing me down a short hallway normally i would have reacted to such a show of familiarity with a delicate elbow in a gut edden though was a kindred spirit hating injustice as much as i did though he looked nothing like him he reminded me of my dad having gained my respect by accepting me as a witch and treating me with equality instead of mistrust i was a sucker for flattery we headed down the hallway shouldertoshoulder glenn lagging behind good to see you flying again mr jenks edden said giving the pixy a nod jenks left my earring his wings clattering harshly edden had once snapped jenkss wing off while stuffing him into a water cooler and pixy grudges went deep its jenks he said coldly just jenks jenks then can we get you anything sugar water peanut butter he turned smiling from behind his mustache coffee ms morgan he drawled you look tired his grin banished the last of my bad mood thatd be great i said and edden gave glenn a directive look the detectives jaw was clenched and several new welts ran down his jawline edden grasped his forearm as the frustrated man turned away pulling glenn down edden whispered its too late to wash the pixy dust off try cortisone glenn gave me a closed stare as he straightened and walked back the way we had come i appreciate you dropping in edden continued i got a break this morning and youre the only one i could call to capitalize on it jenks made a scoffing laugh whatsa matter got a were with a thorn in his paw shut up jenks i said more from habit than anything else glenn had mentioned trent kalamack and that had me itchy the captain of the fib drew to a stop before a plain door another equally plain door was a foot away interrogation rooms he opened his mouth to explain then shrugged and pushed the door open to show a bare room at halflight he ushered me in waiting until the door shut before turning to the twoway mirror and silently shifting the blinds i stared into the other room sara jane i whispered my face going slack you know her edden crossed his short thick arms on his chest thats lucky theres no such thing as luck jenks snapped the breeze from his wings brushing my cheek as he hovered at eye level his hands were on his hips and his wings had gone from their usual translucence to a faint pink its a setup i drew closer to the glass shes trent kalamacks secretary what is she doing here edden stood beside me his feet spread wide looking for her boyfriend i turned surprised at the tight expression on his round face warlock named dan smather edden said went missing sunday the is wont act until hes gone for thirty days shes convinced his disappearance is tied to the witch hunter murders i think shes right my stomach tightened cincinnati was not known for its serial killers but we had endured more unexplained murders in the last six weeks than the last three years combined the recent violence had everyone upset inderlander and human alike the oneway glass fogged under my breath and i backed up does he fit the profile i asked already knowing the is wouldnt have brushed her off if he had if he were dead he would so far hes only missing the dry rasp of jenkss wings broke the silence so why bring rache into it two reasons the first being ms gradenko is a witch he nodded to the pretty woman past the glass frustration thick in his voice my officers cant question her properly i watched sara jane look at the clock and wipe her eye she doesnt know how to stir a spell i said softly she can only invoke them technically shes a warlock i wish you people would get it straight that its your level of skill not your sex that makes you a witch or warlock either way my officers dont know how to interpret her answers a flicker of anger stirred i turned to him my lips pressed you cant tell if shes lying the captain shrugged his thick shoulders bunching if you like jenks hovered between us his hands on his hips in his best peter pan pose okay so you want rache to question her whats the second reason edden leaned a shoulder against the wall i need someone to go back to school and as i dont have a witch on my payroll thats you rachel for a moment i could only stare beg pardon the mans smile made him look even more like a contriving troll youve been following the papers he needlessly asked and i nodded the victims were all witches i said all single except for the first two and all experienced in ley line magic i stifled a grimace i didnt like ley lines and i avoided using them whenever i could they were gateways to the everafter and demons one of the more popular theories was that the victims had been dabbling in the black arts and simply lost control i didnt buy that no one was stupid enough to bind a demonexcept nick my boyfriend and that had been only to save my life edden nodded showing me the top of his head of thick black hair what has been kept quiet is that all of them at one point or another have been taught by a dr anders i rubbed my scraped palms anders i murmured searching my memory and coming up with a thinfaced sourlooking woman with her hair too short and her voice too shrill i had a class with her i glanced at edden and turned to the oneway glass embarrassed she was a visiting professor from the university while one of our instructors was on sabbatical taught ley lines for the earth witch shes a condescending toad flunked me out on the third class because i wouldnt get a familiar he grunted try to get a b this time so i can get reimbursed for tuition whoa jenks shouted his tiny voice pitched high edden you can just plant your sunflower seeds in someone elses garden rachel isnt going anywhere near sara jane this is kalamack trying to get his manicured fingers on her edden pushed himself away from the wall frowning mr kalamack is not implicated in this whatsoever and if you take this run gunning for him rachel ill sling your lilywhite witch butt back across the river and into the hollows dr anders is our suspect if you want the run you leave mr kalamack out of this jenkss wings buzzed an angry whine did you all slip antifreeze in your coffee this morning he shrilled its a setup this has nothing to do with the witch hunter murders rachel tell him this has nothing to do with the murders this has nothing to do with the murders i said blandly ill take the run rachel jenks protested i took a slow breath knowing i would never be able to explain sara jane was more honest than half the is agents i had once worked with a farm girl struggling to find her way in the city and help her indenturedservant family though she wouldnt know me from jack i owed her she was the sole person who had shown me any kindness during my three days of purgatory trapped as a mink in trent kalamacks office last spring physically we were as unalike as two people could possibly be where sara jane sat stiffly upright at the table in her crisp business dress with every blond hair in place and makeup applied so well it was almost invisible i stood in scrapedup leather pants with my frizzy red hair wild and untamed where she was petite having a chinadoll look with her clear skin and delicate features i was tall with an athletic build that had saved my life more times than i have freckles on my nose where she was amply curved and padded in all the right places i stopped at the curves my chest not much more than a suggestion but i felt a kinship with her we were both trapped by trent kalamack and by now she probably knew it jenks hovered beside me no he said trent is using her to reach you irritated i waved him away trent cant touch me edden do you still have that pink folder i gave you last spring the one with the disc and datebook containing evidence that trent kalamack is a manufacturer and distributor of illegal genetic products the squat man grinned yeah i keep it by my bed for when i cant sleep at night my jaw dropped you werent supposed to open it unless i went missing i peek at my christmas presents too he said relax i wont do anything unless kalamack kills you i still say blackmailing kalamack is risky its the only thing keeping me alive i said hotly then winced as i wondered if sara jane might have heard me through the glass but probably safer than trying to bring him to justiceat the present time this though he gestured to sara jane hes too smart for this if it had been anyone but trent id have to agree trent kalamack was pristine on paper as charming and attractive in public as he was ruthless and cold behind closed doors i had watched him kill a man in his office making it look like an accident with a swiftly implemented set of preparations but as long as edden didnt act on my blackmail the untouchable man would leave me alone jenks darted between me and the mirror he came to a hovering standstill worry creasing his tiny features this stinks worse than that fish walk away you gotta walk away my gaze focused past jenks upon sara jane she had been crying i owe her jenks i whispered whether she knows it or not edden shifted to stand beside me and together we watched sara jane morgan jenks was right there was no such thing as luckunless you bought itand nothing happened around trent without reason my eyes were fixed upon sara jane yeah yeah ill do it three my gaze was drawn to sara janes nails as she fidgeted across from me last time i had seen her they were clean but worn down to the quick now they were long and shapely polished a tasteful shade of red so i said looking from the fitfully flashing enamel to her eyes they were blue i hadnt known for sure you last heard from dan on saturday from across the table sara jane nodded there hadnt been a flicker of recognition when edden introduced us part of me was relieved part disappointed her lilac scent pulled the unwelcome memory of helplessness i had felt while a mink caged in trents office the tissue in sara janes hand was about the size of a walnut clenched into a ball with her trembling fingers dan called me as he was coming off of work she said the tremor reflected in her voice she glanced at edden standing beside the closed door with his arms crossed and his white sleeves rolled up to his elbows well he left a message on my machineit was four in the morning he said he wanted to have dinner together that he wanted to talk to me he never showed up thats why i know somethings wrong officer morgan her eyes went wide and her jaw clenched as she struggled not to cry its ms morgan i said uncomfortably i dont work for the fib on a regular basis jenkss wings shifted into motion as he remained perched on my foam cup she doesnt really work regularly at all he said snidely ms morgan is our inderland consultant edden said frowning at jenks sara jane dabbed at her eyes the tissue still in her grip she nudged her hair back she had cut it and it made her look even more professional as it bumped about her shoulders in a straight yellow sheet i brought a picture of him she said digging in her purse to pull out a snapshot and push it at me i looked down to see her and a young man on the deck of one of the steamers that take tourists out on the ohio river they were both smiling his arm was around her and she was leaning into him she looked happy and relaxed in blue jeans and a blouse i took a moment to study dans picture he was cleancut sturdy looking and wearing a plaid shirt just the kind of man one would expect a farm girl to bring home to mom and dad can i keep this i asked and she nodded thanks i tucked it in my bag not comfortable with how her eyes were fixed upon the picture as if she could bring him back by her will alone do you know how we can get in touch with his relatives he may have had a family emergency and needed to leave without notice dan is an only child she said dabbing at her nose with the crumpled tissue both his parents are gone they were serfed on a farm up north life expectancy isnt high for a farmer oh i didnt know what else to say technically we cant enter his apartment until hes declared missing you dont happen to have a key do you yes i she blushed through her makeup i let his cat in when he works late i glanced down at the liedetecting amulet in my lap as it briefly shifted from green to red she was lying but i didnt need an amulet to figure that out i said nothing not wanting to embarrass her further by making her admit she had the key for other more romantic reasons i was there today about seven she said eyes downcast everything looked fine seven in the morning edden uncrossed his arms and levered himself upright isnt that when youyou witches i meanare tucked in bed she gazed up at him and nodded im mr kalamacks personal secretary he works in the mornings and evenings so my schedule is split eight to noon in the morning and four to eight in the afternoon it took a while to become accustomed to it but with four hours for myself in the afternoon i was able to spend more time with dan she finished please the young woman pleaded suddenly her gaze shifting between edden and me i know somethings wrong why wont anyone help me i shifted uncomfortably as she struggled for control she felt helpless i understood her better than she knew sara jane was the latest in trents long string of secretaries as a mink i had listened in on her interview unable to warn her as she was lured into believing trents halftruths for all her intelligence she hadnt a chance to escape his charm and extravagant offers with his offer of employment trent had given her family a golden ticket out of their indentured servitude and trent kalamack was truly a benevolent employer offering high wages and outstanding benefits he gave people what they desperately wanted asking in return nothing but their loyalty by the time they realized how deep he demanded that loyalty go they knew too much to extricate themselves sara jane had escaped the farm but trent had then bought it probably to ensure that she would keep her mouth shut when she found out about his dealings in the illegal drug brimstone as well as the desperately soughtafter genetic medicines outlawed during the turn id almost tagged him with the truth but the sole other witness had died in a car explosion publicly trent served on the citys council untouchable because of his vast wealth and generous donations to charities and underprivileged children privately no one even knew if he was a human or inderlander even jenks couldnt tell which was unusual for a pixy trent quietly ran a good slice of cincinnatis underworld and both the fib and the is would sell their bosses to have a court date with him and now sara janes boyfriend was missing i cleared my throat recalling the temptation of trents offer myself seeing sara jane under control again i asked you said he works at pizza piscarys she nodded hes a driver thats how we met she bit her lip and dropped her eyes the liedetecting amulet was a steady green piscarys was an inderland eatery serving everything from tomato soup to gourmet cheesecake piscary himself was said to be one of cincinnatis master vampires nice enough from what id heard not greedy with his vamp takes eventempered on record as being dead for the last three hundred years course he was probably older than that and the nicer and more civilized an undead vampire seemed the more depraved he or she generally was my roommate thought of him as sort of a friendly uncle which made me feel ohsowarm and fuzzy inside i handed sara jane another tissue and she smiled weakly i can go out to his apartment today i said do you think you could meet me there with the key sometimes a professional can spot things others miss jenks snorted and i shifted my legs bumping the underside of the table to make him dart into the air sara jane showed relief oh thank you ms morgan she gushed i can go right now i just have to call my employer and let him know ill be a little late she gripped her purse looking like she was ready to fly out of the room mr kalamack told me to take all the time i need this afternoon i glanced at jenkss attentiongetting buzz he had a worried itoldyouso look how nice of trent to let his secretary take all the time she needs to find her boyfriend when hes probably stuffed in a closet so shell keep her mouth shut ah lets make it tonight i said thinking of my fish i need to look up a few things and whip up a few antigoon spells check my splat gun and collect my fee of course she said settling back as her expression clouded and if nothing turns up there well go on to the next step i tried to make my smile reassuring ill meet you at dans apartment a little after eight hearing the dismissal in my voice she nodded and stood jenks flitted into the air and i rose as well all right she said its out at redwood edden shuffled his feet ill tell ms morgan where it is ms gradenko yes thank you her smile was starting to look stilted im just so worried i disguised putting my liedetecting amulet away by digging through my bag and pulling out one of my cards please let me or the fib know if you hear from him in the meantime i said as i handed it to her ivy had the cards professionally printed and they looked slick yes i will she murmured her lips moving as she read vampiric charms the name nick had given my and ivys agency she met my eyes as she tucked the card in her purse i shook her hand deciding her grip was firmer this time her fingers though were still cold ill show you out ms gradenko edden said as he opened the door at his subtle gesture i sank back into my chair to wait jenks buzzed his wings for my attention i dont like it he said as our eyes met a flash of ire took me she wasnt lying i said defensively he put his hands on his hips and i waved him off my cup to take a sip of my lukewarm coffee you dont know her jenks she hates vermin but she tried to keep jonathan from tormenting me though it might have meant her job she felt sorry for you jenks said pitiful little mink with a concussion she gave me part of her lunch when i wouldnt eat those disgusting pellets the carrots were drugged rache she didnt know that sara jane suffered as much as i did the pixy hovered six inches before me demanding i look at him thats what im saying trent could be using her to get to you again and she wouldnt even know it my sigh pushed him back shes trapped i have to help her if i can i looked up as edden opened the door and poked his head in he had an fib hat on and it looked odd with his white shirt and khakis as he gestured for me jenks flitted to my shoulder you and your rescue impulses are going to get you killed he whispered as i found the hallway thanks morgan edden said as he grabbed my canister of fish and led me up front no problem i said as we entered the fibs back offices the hustle of people enfolded me and my tension eased in the blessed autonomy it offered she wasnt lying about anything other than having a key to let his cat out but i could have told you that without the spell ill let you know what i find out at dans apartment how late can i call you oh edden said loudly as we slipped past the front desk and headed for the sunlit sidewalk no need ms morgan thank you for your help well be in touch i stopped short in surprise a curl of escaped hair brushed my shoulder as jenkss wings clattered against themselves in a harsh noise what the hell he muttered my face warmed as i realized he was brushing me off i did not come down here just to invoke a lousy liedetecting amulet i said as i jerked into motion i told you id leave kalamack alone get out of my way and let me do what im good at behind me conversations were going quiet edden never hesitated in his slow stride to the door its an fib matter ms morgan let me help you out i followed tight to his heels not caring about the dark looks i was getting this run is mine edden i almost yelled your people will mess it up these are inderlanders not humans you can have the glory all i want is to be paid and see trent in jail i added silently he pushed open one of the glass double doors the sunwarmed concrete threw up a wave of heat as i stomped out after him almost pinning the short man against the building as he gestured for a cab you gave me this run and im taking it i exclaimed yanking a curl out of my mouth as the wind blew it up into my face not some stuckup arrogant cookie in an fib hat who thinks hes the greatest thing since the turn good he said lightly shocking me into taking a step back putting my canister on the sidewalk he stuffed his fib hat into his back pocket but from here on out you are officially off the run my mouth opened in understanding i was officially not here taking a breath i willed the adrenaline out of my system edden nodded as he saw my anger fizzle out id appreciate your discretion on this he said sending glenn out to pizza piscarys alone isnt prudent glenn jenks shrilled his voice scraping the inside of my skull making my eyes water no i said i already have my team we dont need detective glenn jenks left me yeah he said as he flew between the fib captain and me his wings were red we dont play well with others edden frowned this is an fib matter you will have an fib presence with you when at all possible and glenn is the only one qualified qualified jenks scoffed why not admit hes the only one of your officers who can talk to a witch without pissing his pants no i said firmly we work alone edden stood beside my canister his arms crossed to make his squat form look as immovable as a stone wall hes our new inderland specialist i know hes inexperienced hes an ass jenks snapped a grin flashed over edden i prefer rough around the edges myself my lips pursed glenn is a cocky selfassured i fumbled looking for something suitably derogatory fib flunky who is going to get himself killed the first time he runs into an inderlander who isnt as nice as i am jenks bobbed his head he needs to be taught a lesson edden smiled hes my son and i couldnt agree more he said hes what i exclaimed as an unmarked fib car pulled up to the curb beside us edden reached for the handle of the back door and opened it edden was clearly from european decent and glennglenn wasnt my mouth worked as i tried to find something that couldnt be remotely construed as being racist as a witch i was sensitive to that kind of thing how come he doesnt have your last name i managed hes used his mothers maiden name since joining the fib edden said softly hes not supposed to be under my direction but no one else would take the job my brow furrowed now i understood the cold reception in the fib it hadnt been all me glenn was new taking a position everyone but his dad thought was a waste of time im not doing this i said find someone else to babysit your kid edden put my canister into the back break him in gently you arent listening i said loudly frustrated you gave me this run my associates and i appreciate your offer to help but you asked me here back off and let us work great edden said as he slammed the cars back door shut thanks for taking detective glenn with you out to piscarys a cry of disgust slipped from me edden i exclaimed earning looks from the passing people i said no there is one sound coming past my lips one sound two letters one meaning no edden opened the front passenger door and gestured for me to get in thanks bunches morgan he glanced into the backseat why were you running from those weres anyway my breath came in a slow controlled sound damn edden chuckled and i put myself in the car and slammed the door trying to get his stubby fingers in it scowling i looked at the driver it was glenn he looked as happy as i felt i had to say something you dont look anything like your dad i said snidely his gaze was fixed with a ramrod stiffness out the front window he adopted me when he married my mother he said through clenched teeth jenks zipped in trailing a sunbeam of pixy dust youre eddens son you got a problem with that he said belligerently the pixy landed on the dash with his hands on his hips nah all you humans look alike to me edden bent to put his beaming round face in the window heres your class schedule he said handing me a yellow half page of paper with printer holes along the sides monday wednesday friday glenn will buy any books you need hold it i exclaimed alarm washing through me as the yellow paper crackled in my fingers i thought i was just going to poke around the university i dont want to take a class its the one mr smather was taking be there or you wont get paid he was smiling enjoying this edden i shouted as he backed up onto the sidewalk glenn take ms morgan and jenks to their office let me know what you find at dan smathers apartment yes sir he barked his knuckles gripping the wheel showed a fierce pressure pink patches of ivyaid decorated his wrists and neck i didnt that care that he had heard most of the conversation he wasnt welcome and the sooner he understood that the better four right at the next corner i said resting my arm on the open window of the unmarked fib car glenn ran his fingertips through his closecropped hair as he scratched his scalp he hadnt said a word the entire way his jaw slowly unclenching as he realized i wasnt going to make him talk to me there was no one behind us but he signaled before turning onto my street he had sunglasses on taking in the residential neighborhood with its shady sidewalks and patchy lawns we were well within the hollows the unofficial haven for most of cincinnatis resident inderlanders since the turn when every surviving human fled into the city and its false sense of security there has always been some mingling but for the most part humans work and live in cincinnati since the turn and inderlanders work anduhplay in the hollows i think glenn was surprised the suburb looked like everywhere elseuntil you noticed the runes scratched in the hopscotch grid and that the basketball hoop was a third again taller than nba regulation it was quiet too peaceful some of that could be attributed to inderlands schools not letting out until almost midnight but most was selfpreservation every inderlander over the age of forty had spent their earliest years trying to hide that they werent human a tradition that is unraveling with the cautious fear of the hunted vampires included so the grass is mown by sullen teenagers on friday the cars are dutifully washed on saturday and the trash makes tidy piles at the curb on wednesday but the streetlights are shot out by gun or charm as soon as the city replaces them and no one calls the humane society at the sight of a loose dog as it might be the neighbors kid skipping school the dangerous reality of the hollows remains carefully hidden we know if we color too far out of humanitys selfimposed lines old fears will resurface and they will strike out at us they would losebadlyand as a whole inderlanders like things balanced just as they are fewer humans would mean that witches and weres would start taking the brunt of vampires needs and while the occasional witch enjoyed a vampiric lifestyle at his or her own discretion wed bind together to take them out if they tried to turn us into fodder the older vampires know it and so they make sure everyone plays by humanitys rules fortunately the more savage side of inderlanders naturally gravitates to the outskirts of the hollows and away from our homes the strip of nightclubs along both sides of the river is especially hazardous since swarming highspirited humans draw the more predatorial of us like fires on a cold night promising warmth and reassurance of survival our homes are kept as human looking as possible those who strayed too far from the mr and mrs cleaver veneer were encouraged in a rather unique neighborhood intervention party to blend in a little moreor move out to the country where they couldnt do as much damage my gaze drifted over the tongueincheek sign peeping out from a bed of foxgloves day sleeper solicitors will be eaten for the most part anyway you can park up there on the right i said pointing glenns brow furrowed i thought we were going to your office jenks flitted from my earring to the rearview mirror we are he said snidely glenn scratched his jawline his short beard making a rasping sound under his nail you run your agency out of a house i sighed at his patronizing lilt sort of anywhere here is fine he pulled to the curb at keasleys house the neighborhoods wise old man who had both the medical equipment and knowhow of a small emergency room for those who could keep their mouths shut about it across the street was a small stone church its steeple rising high above two gigantic oaks it sat on an unreal four city lots and had come with its own graveyard renting out a defunct church hadnt been my idea but ivys seeing tombstones out the small stainedglass window of my bedroom had taken a while to get used to but the kitchen it came with made up for having dead humans buried in the backyard glenn cut the engine and the new silence soaked in i scanned the surrounding yards before i got out a habit begun during my notsodistant death threats which i thought prudent to continue old man keasley was on his porch as usual rocking and keeping a sharp eye on the street i gave him a wave and got a raised hand in answer satisfied he would have warned me if i had needed it i got out and opened the back door for my canister of fish ill get it maam glenn said as his door thumped shut i gave him a tired look over the cars roof drop the maam will you im rachel his attention went over my shoulder and he visibly stiffened i whipped around expecting the worst relaxing as a cloud of pixy children descended in a highpitched chorus of conversation too fast for me to follow papa jenks had been missedas usual my sour mood evaporated as the darting swooping figures in pale green and gold swirled about their dad in a disney nightmare glenn took his sunglasses off his brown eyes wide and his lips parted jenks made a piercing whistle with his wings and the horde broke enough for him to hover before me hey rache he said ill be out back if you want me sure i glanced at glenn and muttered is ivy here the pixy followed my gaze to the human and grinned undoubtedly imagining what ivy would do when meeting captain eddens son jax jenkss eldest child joined his father no ms morgan he said pitching his preadolescent voice deeper than it normally fell shes doing errands the grocery store the post office the bank she said shed be back before five the bank i thought wincing she was supposed to wait until i had the rest of my rent jax flew three circles about my head making me dizzy bye ms morgan he called out zipping off to join his siblings who were escorting their dad to the back of the church and the oak stump jenks had moved his very large family into my breath puffed out as glenn came around the back of the car offering to carry my canister i shook my head and hefted it it wasnt that heavy i was starting to feel guilty for having let jenks pix him but then i hadnt known i was going to have to babysit him at the time come on in i said as i started across the street to the wide stone steps the sound of his hardsoled shoes on the street faltered you live in a church my eyes narrowed yeah but i dont sleep with voodoo dolls huh never mind glenn muttered something and my guilt deepened thanks for driving me home i said as i climbed the stone steps and pulled open the right side of the twin wooden doors for him he said nothing and i added really thanks hesitating on the stoop he stared at me i couldnt tell what he was thinking youre welcome he finally said his voice giving me no clue either i led the way through the empty foyer into the even more empty sanctuary before we rented out the church it had been used as a daycare the pews and altar had been removed to make a large play area now all that remained were the stainedglass windows and a slightly raised stage the shadow of a huge longgone cross spread across the wall in a poignant reminder i glanced at the tall ceiling seeing the familiar room in a new way as glenn looked it over it was quiet id forgotten how peaceful it was ivy had spread tumbling mats over half of it leaving a narrow walkway running from the foyer to the back rooms at least once a week wed spar to keep fresh now that we were both independents and not on the streets every night it invariably ended with me a sweating mass of bruises and her not even breathing hard ivy was a living vampas alive as i was and in possession of a soul infected by the vamp virus by way of her at the time stillliving mother not having to wait until she was dead before the virus began molding her ivy had been born possessing a little of both worlds the living and dead caught in the middle ground until she died and became a true undead from the living she retained a soul allowing her to walk under the sun worship without pain and live on holy ground if she wanted which she did to tick her mother off from the dead came her small but sharp canines her ability to pull an aura and scare the crap out of me and her power to hold spellbound those who allowed it her unearthly strength and speed were decidedly less than a true undead but still far beyond mine and though she didnt need blood to remain sane as undead vampires did she had an unsettling hunger for it which she was continually fighting to suppress since she was one of the few living vamps who had sworn off blood i imagine ivy must have had an interesting childhood but i was afraid to ask come on in to the kitchen i said as i went through the archway at the back of the sanctuary i took off my shades as i passed my bathroom it had once been the mens bathroom the traditional fixtures replaced with a washer and dryer a small sink and a shower this one was mine the womens bathroom across the hall had been converted into a more conventional bathroom with a tub that one was ivys separate bathrooms made things a heck of a lot easier not liking the way glenn was making silent judgments i closed the doors to both ivys and my bedrooms as i passed them they had once been clergy offices he shuffled into the kitchen behind me spending a moment or two taking it all in most people did the kitchen was huge and part of the reason i had agreed to live in a church with a vampire it had two stoves an institutionalsize fridge and a large center island overhung with a rack of gleaming utensils and pots the stainless steel shone and the counter space was expansive with the exception of my beta in the brandy snifter on the windowsill and the massive antique wooden table ivy used for a computer desk it looked like the set of a cooking show it was the last thing one would expect attached to the back of churchand i loved it i set the canister of fish on the table why dont you sit down i said wanting to call the howlers ill be right back i hesitated as my manners clawed their way up to the forefront of my mind do you want a drinkor something i asked glenns brown eyes were unreadable no maam his voice was stiff with more than a hint of sarcasm making me want to smack him a good one and tell him to lighten up id deal with his attitude later right now i had to call the howlers have a seat then i said letting some of my own bother show ill be right back the living room was just off the kitchen on the other side of the hallway as i searched for the coachs number in my bag i hit the message button on the answering machine hey rayray its me came nicks voice sounding tinny through the recording shooting a glance at the hallway i turned it down so glenn couldnt hear ive got em third row back on the far right now youll have to make good on your claim and get us backstage passes there was a pause then i still dont believe youve met him talk to you later my breath came in anticipation as it clicked off i had met takata four years ago when he spotted me in the balcony at a solstice concert i had thought i was going to be kicked out when a thick were in a staff shirt escorted me backstage while the warmup band played turned out takata had seen my frizzy hair and wanted to know if it was spelled or natural and if natural did i have a charm to get something that wild to lie flat starstuck and repeatedly embarrassing myself i admitted it was natural though i had encouraged it that night then gave him one of the charms my mother and i spent my entire high school career perfecting to tame it he laughed then unwinding one of his blond dreadlocks to show me his hair was worse than mine static making it float and stick to everything i hadnt straightened my hair since my friends and i had watched the show from backstage and afterward takata and i led his bodyguards on a merry chase through cincinnati the whole night i was sure he would remember me but i hadnt a clue as to how to get in touch with him it wasnt as if i could call him up and say remember me we had coffee on the solstice four years ago and discussed how to straighten curls a smile twitched the corner of my mouth as i fingered the answering machine he was all right for an old guy course anyone over the age of thirty had seemed old to me at the time nicks was the only message and i found myself pacing as i picked up the phone and punched in the howlers number i plucked at my shirt as the number rang after running from those weres i had to take a shower there was a click and a low voice nearly growled ello ya got the howlers coach i exclaimed recognizing the weres voice good news there was a slight pause who is this he asked how did you get this number i started this is rachel morgan i said slowly of vampiric charms there was a halfheard shout directed off the phone which one of you dogs called the escort service youre athletes for gods sake cant you pin your own bitches without having to buy them wait i said before he could hang up you hired me to find your mascot oh there was a pause and i heard several war whoops in the background right i briefly weighed the trouble of changing our name against the fuss ivy would raise a thousand glossy black business cards the page ad in the phone book the matched oversized mugs she had imprinted our name on in gold foil it wasnt going to happen i recovered your fish i said bringing myself back when can someone pick it up uh the coach muttered didnt anyone call you my face went slack no one of the guys moved her while they cleaned her tank and didnt tell anyone he said she was never gone her i thought the fish was a her how could they tell then i got angry i had broken into a weres office for nothing no i said coldly no one called me mmmm sorry about that thanks for your help though whoa wait a moment i cried hearing the brushoff in his voice i spent three days planning this i risked my life and we appreciate that the coach started i spun in an angry circle and stared out at the garden through the shoulderhigh windows the sun glinted on the tombstones beyond i dont think you do coach were talking bullets but she was never lost the coach insisted you dont have our fish im sorry sorry wont keep those weres off my tail furious i paced around the coffee table look he said ill send you some tickets to the exhibition game coming up tickets i exclaimed astounded for breaking into mr rays office simon ray the coach said you broke into simons office damn thats rough bye now no wait i shouted but the phone clicked off i stared at the humming receiver didnt they know who i was didnt they know i could curse their bats to crack and their pop flies to land foul did they think i would sit back and do nothing when they owed me my rent i flopped into ivys gray suede chair with a feeling of helplessness yeah right i said softly a noncontact spell required a wand tuition at the community college hadnt covered wand making just potions and amulets i didnt have the expertise much less the recipe for anything that complicated i guess they knew who i was right enough the sound of a foot scraping linoleum came from the kitchen and i glanced at the hall swell glenn had heard the entire thing embarrassed i pulled myself up from the chair id get the money from somewhere i had almost a week glenn turned as i entered the kitchen he was standing next to that canister of useless fish maybe i could sell it i put the phone beside ivys computer and went to the sink you can sit down detective edden were going to be here a while its glenn he said stiffly its against fib policy to report to a member of your family so keep it to yourself and were going to mr smathers apartment now i made a scoffing bark of laughter your dad just loves to bend the rules doesnt he he frowned yes maam we arent going to dans apartment until sara jane gets off work then i slumped glenn wasnt the one i was angry with look i said not wanting ivy to find him while i was in the shower why dont you go home and meet me back here about seventhirty id prefer to stay he scratched at the welt showing a light pink under his watchband sure i said sourly whatever i gotta shower though clearly he was concerned id go without him the worry was wellfounded leaning to the window over the sink i shouted out into the lavish pixytended garden jenks the pixy buzzed in through the hole in the screen so fast i was willing to bet hed been eavesdropping you bellowed princess of stink he said landing beside mr fish on the sill i gave him a weary look would you show glenn the garden while i shower jenkss wings blurred into motion yeah he said going to make wide wary circles around glenns head ill babysit come on cookie youre going to get the fivedollar tour lets start in the graveyard jenks i warned and he gave me a grin tossing his blond hair artfully over his eyes this way glenn he said darting out into the hall glenn followed clearly not happy i heard the back door shut and i leaned to the window jenks what the pixy darted back in the window his face creased with irritation i crossed my arms in thought would you bring in some mullein leaves and jewelweed flowers when you get the chance and do we have any dandelions that havent gone to seed dandelions he dropped an inch in surprise his wings clattering you going soft on me youre going to make him an antiitch spell arent you i leaned to see glenn standing stiffly under the oak tree scratching his neck he looked pitiful and as jenks kept telling me i was a sucker for the underdog just get them all right sure he said hes not much good like that is he i choked back a laugh and jenks flew out the window to join glenn the pixy landed on his shoulder and glenn jumped in surprise hey glenn jenks said loudly head off toward those yellow flowers over there behind that stone angel i want to show you to the rest of my kids theyve never met an fib officer before a faint smile crossed me glenn would be safe with jenks if ivy came home early she jealously guarded her privacy and hated surprises especially ones in fib uniforms that glenn was eddens son wouldnt help she was willing to let sleeping grudges lie but if she felt her territory was being threatened she wouldnt hesitate to act her odd political status of deadvampinwaiting letting her get away with things that would put me in the is lockup turning my eyes fell upon the fish what am i going to do with youbob i said around a sigh i wasnt going to take him back to mr rays office but i couldnt keep him in the canister i cracked the top finding that his gills were pumping and he was laying almost on his side i thought perhaps i ought to put him in the tub canister in hand i went into ivys bathroom welcome home bob i murmured dumping the canister into ivys black garden tub the fish flopped in the inch of water and i hurriedly ran the taps jiggling the flow to try to keep it room temp soon bob the fish was swimming in graceful sedate circles i turned off the water and waited until it finished tinkling in and the surface grew smooth he really was a pretty fish striking against the black porcelain all silver with long cream fins and that black circle decorating one side to look like a reverse full moon i dabbled my fingertips in the water and he darted to the other end of the tub leaving him i crossed the hall to my bathroom got a change of clothes out of the dryer and started the shower as i picked the snarls out of my hair while waiting for the water to warm my eyes fell upon the three tomatoes ripening upon the sill i winced glad they hadnt been anywhere for glenn to see a pixy had given them to me as payment for smuggling her across the city as she fled an unwanted marriage and while tomatoes werent illegal anymore it was in bad taste to have them on display when one had a human guest it had been just over forty years since a quarter of the worlds human population had been killed by a militarygenerated virus that had escaped and spontaneously fastened to a weak spot in a biogenetically engineered tomato it was shipped out before anyone knewthe virus crossing oceans with the ease of an international travelerand the turn began the engineered virus had a varied effect upon the hidden inderlanders witches undead vampires and the smaller species such as pixies and fairies werent affected at all weres living vamps leprechauns and the like got the flu humans died by the droves taking the elves with them as their practice of bolstering their numbers by hybridizing with humanity backfired the us would have followed the third world countries into chaos if the hidden inderlanders hadnt stepped in to halt the spread of the virus burn the dead and keep civilization running until what was left of humanity finished mourning our secret was on the verge of coming out by way of the whatmakesthesepeopleimmune question when a charismatic living vamp named rynn cormel pointed out that our combined numbers equaled humanitys the decision to make our presence known to live openly among the humans we had been mimicking to keep ourselves safe was almost unanimous the turn as it came to be called ushered in a nightmarish three years humanity took their fear of us out on the worlds surviving bioengineers murdering them in trials designed to legalize murder then they went further to outlaw all genetically engineered products along with the science that created them a second slower wave of death followed the first once old diseases found new life when the medicines humanity had created to battle everything from alzheimers to cancer no longer existed tomatoes are still treated like poison by humans even though the virus is long gone if you dont grow them yourself you have to go to a specialty store to find them a frown pinched my forehead as i looked at the red fruit beading up with shower fog if i was smart id put it in the kitchen to see how glenn would react at piscarys bringing a human into an inderland eatery wasnt a crackerjack idea if he made a scene we might not only get no information we might get banned or worse judging that the water was hot enough i eased into it with little ow ow ows twenty minutes later i was wrapped in a big pink towel standing before my ugly pressboard dresser with its dozen or so bottles of perfume carefully arranged on top the blurry picture of the howlers fish was tucked between the glass and the frame sure looked like the same fish to me the delighted shrieks of pixy children filtered in through my open window to soften my mood very few pixies could manage to raise a family in the city jenks was stronger in spirit than most would ever know he had killed before to keep his garden so his children wouldnt starve it was good to hear their voices raised in delight the sound of family and security which scent was it now i murmured fingers hovering over my perfumes as i tried to remember which one ivy and i were currently experimenting with every so often a new bottle would show up without comment as she found something new for me to try i reached for one dropping it when jenks said from right beside my ear not that one jenks i clutched my towel closer and spun get the hell out of my room he darted backward as i made a grab for him his grin widened as he looked down at the leg i accidentally showed laughing he swooped past me and landed on a bottle this one works good he said and youre going to need all the help you can get when you tell ivy youre going to make a run for trent again scowling i reached for the bottle wings clattering he rose pixy dust making temporary sunbeams shimmer through the glittering bottles thanks i said sullenly knowing his nose was better than mine now get out no wait he hesitated by my small stainedglass window and i vowed to sew up the pixy hole in the screen whos watching glenn jenks literally glowed with parental pride jax theyre in garden glenn is shooting wild cherry pits straight up with a rubber band for my kids to catch before they hit the ground i was so surprised i almost could ignore that my hair was dripping wet and i was wearing nothing but a towel hes playing with your kids yeah hes not so badonce you get to know him jenks vaulted through the pixy hole ill send him inside in about five minutes okay he said through the screen make it ten i said softly but he was gone frowning i shut the window locked it and checked twice that the curtains hung right taking the bottle jenks had suggested i gave myself a splash cinnamon blossomed ivy and i had been working for the last three months to find a perfume that covered her natural scent mixing with mine this was one of the nicer ones whether undead or alive vampires moved by instinct triggered by pheromones and scent more at the mercy of their hormones than an adolescent they gave off a largely undetectable smell that lingered where they did an odoriferous signpost telling other vamps that this was taken territory and to back off a far cry better than the way dogs did it but living together the way we were ivys smell lingered on me she had once told me it was a survival trait that helped increase a shadows life expectancy by preventing poaching i wasnt her shadow but there it was anyway what it boiled down to was the smell of our natural scents mingling tended to act like a blood aphrodisiac making it harder for ivy to best her instincts nonpracticing or not one of nicks and my few arguments had been over why i put up with her and the constant threat she posed to my free will if she forgot her vow of abstinence one night and i couldnt fend her off the truth was she considered herself my friend but even more telling was that she had loosened the death grip she kept on her emotions and let me be her friend as well the honor of that was heady she was the best runner id ever seen and i was continually flattered that she left a brilliant career at the is to work with mesave my ass ivy was possessive domineering and unpredictable she also had the strongest will of anyone i had met fighting a battle in herself that if she won would rob her of her life after death and she was willing to kill to protect me because i called her my friend god how could you walk away from something like that apart from when we were alone and she felt safe from recrimination she either held herself with a cool stiffness or fell into a classic vampire mode of sexy domination that i had discovered was her way of divorcing herself from her feelings afraid that if she showed a softening she would lose control i think she had pinned her sanity on living vicariously through me as i stumbled through life enjoying the enthusiasm with which i embraced everything from finding a pair of red heels on sale to learning a spell to laying a bigbadugly out flat and as my fingers drifted over the perfumes she had bought for me i wondered again if perhaps nick was right and our odd relationship might be slipping into an area i didnt want it to go dressing quickly i made my way back to the empty kitchen the clock above the sink said it was edging toward four i had loads of time to make a spell for glenn before we left pulling out one of my spelling books from the shelf under the center island counter i sat at my usual spot at ivys antique wooden table contentment filled me as i opened the yellowed tome the breeze coming in the window had a chill that promised a cold night i loved it here working in my beautiful kitchen surrounded by holy ground safe from everything nasty the antiitch spell was easy to find dogeared and spotted with old splatters leaving the book open i rose to pull out my smallest copper vat and ceramic spoons it was rare that a human would accept an amulet but perhaps if he saw me making it glenn might his dad had taken a pain amulet from me once i was measuring the springwater with my graduated cylinder when there was a scuffing on the back steps hello ms morgan glenn called as he knocked and opened the door jenks said i could come right in i didnt look up from my careful measuring in the kitchen i said loudly glenn edged into the room he took in my new clothes running his eyes from my fuzzy pink slippers up my black nylons to my matching short skirt past my red blouse to the black bow holding my damp hair back if i was going to see sara jane again i wanted to look nice in glenns hands was a wad of mullein leaves dandelion blossoms and jewelweed flowers he looked stiffly embarrassed jenksthe pixysaid you wanted these maam i nodded to the island counter you can put them over there thanks have a seat with a stilted haste he crossed the room and set the cuttings down hesitating briefly he pulled out what was traditionally ivys chair and eased into it his jacket was gone and his shoulder holster with his weapon looked obvious and aggressive in contrast his tie was loose and the top button of his starched shirt was unfastened to show a wisp of dark chest hair wheres your jacket i asked lightly trying to figure out his mood the kids he hesitated the pixy children are using it as a fort oh hiding my smile i rummaged in my spice rack to find my vial of celandine syrup jenkss capacity to be a pain in the butt was inversely proportional to his size his ability to be a stanch friend was the same apparently glenn had won jenkss confidence how about that satisfied the show of his gun wasnt intended to cow me i added a dollop of celandine swishing the ceramic measuring spoon to get the last of the sticky stuff off an uncomfortable silence grew accented by the whoosh of igniting gas i could feel his gaze heavy upon my charm bracelet as the tiny wooden amulets gently clattered the crucifix was selfexplanatory but hed have to ask if he wanted to know what the rest were for i had only a paltry threemy old ones were burnt to uselessness when trent killed the witness wearing them in a car explosion the mix on the stove started to steam and glenn still hadnt said a word soooo i drawled have you been in the fib long yes maam it was short both aloof and patronizing can you stop with the maam just call me rachel yes maam ooooh i thought it was going to be a fun evening peeved i snatched up the mullein leaves tossing them into my greenstained mortar i ground them using more force then necessary i set the mush to soak in the cream for a moment why was i bothering to make him an amulet he wasnt going to use it the brew was at a full boil and i turned the flame down setting the timer for three minutes it was in the shape of a cow and i loved it glenn was silent watching me with a wary distrust as i leaned my back against the edge of the counter im making you something to stop the itching i said god help me but i feel sorry for you his face hardened captain edden is making me take you i dont need your help angry i took a breath to tell him he could take a flying leap off a broomstick but then shut my mouth i dont need your help had once been my mantra but friends made things a lot easier my brow furrowed in thought what was it that jenks did to persuade me oh yeah swear and tell me i was being stupid you can go turn yourself for all i care i said pleasantly but jenks pixed you and he says youre sensitive to pixy dust its spreading through your lymph system you want to itch for a week just because youre too stiffnecked to use a paltry itch spell this is kindergarten stuff i flicked the copper vat with a fingernail and it rang an aspirin a dime a dozen it wasnt but glenn probably wouldnt accept it if he knew how much one of these cost at a charm shop it was a classtwo medicinal spell i probably should have put myself inside a circle to make it but id have to tap into the everafter to close one and seeing me under the influence of a ley line would probably freak glenn out the detective wouldnt meet my eyes his foot twitched as if he was struggling to not scratch his leg through his pants the timer dingedor mooed ratherand leaving him to make up his mind i added the blossoms of jewelweed and dandelion crushing them against the side of the pot with a clockwisenever withershinsmotion i was a white witch after all glenn gave up all pretense at trying not to scratch and slowly rubbed his arm through his shirtsleeve no one will know ive been spelled not unless they did a spell check on you i was mildly disappointed he was afraid to openly show he was using magic the prejudice wasnt unusual but then after having taken an aspirin once id rather be in pain than swallow another i guess i wasnt one to talk all right it was a very reluctant admission okeydokey i added the grated goldenseal root and turned it to a high boil when the froth took on a yellow tint that smelled like camphor i turned off the heat nearly done this spell made the usual seven portions and i wondered if hed demand i waste one on myself before trusting i wasnt going to turn him into a toad that was an idea i could put him in the garden to police the slugs from the hostas edden wouldnt miss him for at least a week glenns eyes were on me as i pulled out seven clean redwood disks about the size of a wooden nickle and arranged them on the counter where he could see just about done i said with a forced cheerfulness thats it he questioned his brown eyes wide thats it no lighting candles or making circles or saying magic words i shook my head youre thinking of ley line magic and its latin not magic words ley line witches draw their power right from the line and need the trappings of ceremony to control it im an earth witch thank god my magic is from ley lines too but its naturally filtered through plants if i was a black witch much of it would come through animals feeling as if i was back doing my graduate labwork exam i dug in the silverware drawer for a finger stick the sharp prick of the blade on my fingertip was hardly noticeable and i massaged the required three drops into the potion the scent of redwood rose thick and musty overpowering the camphor smell i had done it right i had known i had you put blood in it he said and my head came up at his disgusted tone well duh how else was i supposed to quicken it put it in the oven and bake it my brow furrowed and i tucked a strand of my hair that had escaped my bow back behind my ear all magic requires a price paid by death detective white earth magic pays for it by my blood and killing plants if i wanted to make a black charm to knock you out or turn your blood to tar or even give you the hiccups id have to use some nasty ingredients involving animal parts the really black magic requires not just my blood but animal sacrifice or human or inderlander my voice was harsher than i had intended and i kept my eyes down as i measured out the doses and let them soak into the redwood disks much of my stunted career at the is involved bringing in gray spell crafterswitches that took a white charm such as a sleep spell and turned it to a bad usebut id brought in black charm makers as well most had been ley line witches since just the ingredients needed to stir a black charm were enough to keep most earth witches white eye of newt and toe of frog hardly try blood drawn from the spleen of a stillliving animal and its tongue removed as it screamed its last breath into the ether nasty i wont make a black charm i said when glenn remained silent not only is it demented and gross but black magic always comes back to get you and when i had my way it involved my foot in his gut or my cuffs on his wrists choosing an amulet i massaged three more drops of my blood onto it to invoke the spell it soaked in quickly as if the spell pulled the blood from my finger i extended the charm to him thinking of the time i had been tempted to stir a black spell i survived but came away with my demon mark and all id done was look at the book black magic always swings back always its got your blood in it he said in revulsion make another and ill put mine in it yours yours wont do squat it has to be witch blood yours doesnt have the right enzymes to quicken a spell i held it out again and he shook his head frustrated i gritted my teeth your dad used one you whiny little human take it so we can all move on with our lives i thrust the amulet belligerently at him and he gingerly took it better i said as his fingers encircled the wooden disk um yeah he said his squarejawed face suddenly slack it is of course it is i muttered slightly mollified i hung the rest of my amulets in my charm cupboard glenn silently took in my stash each hook carefully labeled thanks to ivys analretentive need to organize whatever it made her happy and was no skin off my nose i closed the door with a loud thump and turned thank you ms morgan he said surprising me youre welcome i said glad he had finally dropped the maam dont get any salt on it and it should last for a year you can take it off and store it if you want when the blisters go away it works on poison ivy too i started to clean up my mess im sorry for letting jenks pix you like that i said slowly he wouldnt have if he had known you were sensitive to pixy dust usually the blisters dont spread dont worry about it he stretched for one of ivys catalogs at the end of the table pulling his hand back at the picture of the curved stainlesssteel knives on special i slid my spelling book away under the center island counter glad he was loosening up when it comes to inderlanders sometimes the smallest things can pack the hardest punch there was a loud boom of the front door closing stiffening i crossed my arms before me only now recognizing that it had been ivys motorcycle tooling up the road a moment before glenn met my eyes sitting straighter as he recognized my alarm ivy was home but not always i finished five eyes on the empty hallway i motioned for glenn to stay seated i didnt have time to explain i wondered how much edden had told him or if this was going to be one of his nasty but effective ways to smooth glenns edges rachel came ivys melodious voice and glenn stood checking the creases in his gray slacks yeah that would help did you know theres an fib car parked in front of keasleys sit down glenn i warned and when he didnt i moved to stand between him and the open archway to the hall yuck ivy exclaimed her voice muffled theres a fish in my bathtub is it the howlers when are they coming to get it there was a hesitation and i managed a sick smile at glenn rachel she called out closer are you in here hey we should go out to the mall tonight bath and bodyworks is rereleasing an old scent with a citrus base we need to hit the sample bottles see how it works you know celebrate you making rent what is that you have on now the cinnamon thats a nice one but it only lasts three hours would have been nice to have known that earlier im in the kitchen i said loudly ivys tall blackclad form strode past the opening a canvas sack of groceries hung from her shoulder her black silk duster fluttered after her boot heels and i could hear her looking for something in the living room i didnt think you would be able to pull the fish thing off she said there was a hesitation then where in hell is the phone in here i said crossing my arms uneasily ivy pulled up short in the archway as she saw glenn her somewhat oriental features went blank in surprise i could almost see the wall come down as she realized we werent alone the skin around her eyes tightened her small nose flared taking in his scent cataloging his fear and my concern in an instant lips tight she put her canvas bag of groceries on the counter and brushed her hair out of her eyes it fell to her midback in a smooth black wave and i knew it was bother not nerves that had prompted her to tuck it behind an ear ivy had once had money and still dressed like it but her entire early inheritance had gone to the is to pay off her contract when she quit with me put simply she looked like a scary model lithe and pale but incredibly strong unlike me she wore no nail polish no jewelry apart from her crucifix twin black chain anklets about one foot and very little makeup she didnt need it but like me she was basically broke at least until her mother finished dying and the rest of the tamwood estate came to her i was guessing that wouldnt be for about two hundred yearsbare minimum ivys thin eyebrows rose as she looked glenn over bringing your work home again rachel i took a breath hi ivy this is detective glenn you talked to him this afternoon sent him to pick me up my look went pointed we were going to talk about that later ivy turned her back on him to unpack the groceries nice to meet you she said her tone flat then to me she muttered sorry something came up glenn swallowed hard he looked shaky but was holding up i guess edden hadnt told him about ivy i really liked edden youre a vampire he said ooooh ivy said weve got a bright one here fingers fumbling around the string of his new amulet he pulled a cross from behind his shirt but the sun is up he said sounding as if he had been betrayed my my my ivy said and a weatherman too she turned with a snide look im not dead yet detective glenn only the true undead have light restrictions come back in sixty years and i might be worried about a sunburn seeing his cross she smiled patronizingly and pulled out from behind her black spandex shirt her own extravagant crucifix that only works on undead vamps she said as she turned back to the counter where did you get your schooling bmovies glenn backed up a step captain edden never said you worked with a vampire the fib officer stammered at eddens name ivy spun it was a blindingly fast motion and i started this wasnt going well she was starting to pull an aura damn i glanced out the window the sun would be down soon double damn i heard about you the officer said and i cringed at the arrogance in his voice which he was using to cover his fear even glenn couldnt be stupid enough to antagonize a vamp in her own house that gun at his side wasnt going to do him any good sure he could shoot her and kill her but then shed be dead and shed rip his freaking head off and no jury in the world would convict her of murder seeing as he killed her first youre tamwood glenn said his bravado clearly scraped from a misplaced feeling of security captain edden gave you three hundred hours of community service for taking out everyone on his floor didnt he what was it he made you do a candy striper right ivy stiffened and my mouth dropped open he was that stupid it was worth it ivy said softly her fingers were shaking as she set the bag of marshmallows gently on the counter my breath caught shit ivys brown eyes had gone black as her pupils dilated i stood shocked at how quickly it had happened it had been weeks since she vamped out on me and never without warning the angry shock of finding someone in an fib uniform in her kitchen might have accounted for some of it but in hindsight i had a sick feeling that letting her walk in on glenn hadnt been the best thing his fear had hit her hard and fast giving her no time to prepare herself against temptation his sudden fright had filled the air with pheromones they acted as a potent aphrodisiac only she could taste jerking into play thousandyearold instincts fixed deep in her viruschanged dna in a breath they had turned her from my slightly disturbing roommate to a predator that could kill both of us in three seconds flat if the desire to sate her longsuppressed hunger outweighed the consequences of draining an fib detective it was that balance that frightened me i knew where i was on her personal scale of hunger and reason where glenn stood i hadnt a clue like flowing dust her posture melted and she leaned back against the counter on one bent elbow hip cocked deathly still she ran her gaze up glenn until it locked upon his eyes her head tilted with a sultry slowness until she was eyeing him from under her straight bangs only now did she take a slow deliberate breath her long pale fingers flicked about the deep vneck of her spandex shirt tucked into her leather pants youre tall she said her gray voice pulling remembered fear from me i like that it wasnt sex she was after it was dominance she would have bespelled him if she could have but shed have to wait until she was dead before she had power over the unwilling swell i thought as she pushed herself from the counter and headed for him shed lost it it was worse than the time she found nick and i snuggled up together on her couch not watching pro wrestling i still didnt know what had set her off thenshe and i had a concrete understanding that i wasnt her girlfriend plaything lover shadow or whatever the newest term for vampire flunky was these days my thoughts scrambled for a way to bring her back without making things worse ivy drifted to a stop before glenn the hem of her duster seeming to move in slow motion as it edged forward to touch his shoes her tongue slipped across her very white teeth hiding them even as they flashed with a recognizable restrained power she put a hand to either side of him at head height pinning him to the wall mmmm she said breathing in through parted lips very tall lots of leg beautiful beautiful dark skin did rachel bring you home for me she leaned into him almost touching he was only a few inches taller than she was she tilted her head as if to give him a kiss a drop of sweat slid down his face and neck he didnt move tension pulling every muscle tight you work for edden she whispered her eyes fixed on the line of moisture as it pooled at his collarbone hed probably be upset if you died her eyes darted to his at the sound of his quick breath dont move i thought knowing if he did instincts would take over he was in trouble with his back to the wall like that ivy i said trying to distract her and avoid having to tell edden why his son was in intensive care edden gave me a run glenn is along for the ride i willed myself not to shudder as she turned the black pits her eyes had become to me they tracked me as i put the island counter between us she stood unmoving but for a hand tracing glenns shoulder and neck her finger running a perfect half inch above him uh ivy i said hesitantly glenn might want to leave now let him go my request seemed to break through and she took a quick clean breath bending her elbow she pushed herself away from the wall glenn darted out from under her weapon drawn he stood in the archway to the hall his feet spread and his gun trained upon ivy the safety clicked off and his eyes were wide ivy turned her back on him and went to the bag of forgotten groceries it might look as if she was ignoring him but i knew she was aware of everything down to the wasp bumping about at the ceiling back hunched she set a bag of shredded cheese on the counter tell that bloodsack of a captain i said hi the next time you see him she said her soft voice carrying a shocking amount of anger but the hungerthe need to dominatewas gone knees weak i let my breath out in a long puff of air glenn i suggested put the gun away before she takes it from you and the next time you insult my roommate im going to let her tear your throat out understand his eyes flicked to ivy before he holstered the weapon he stayed in the archway breathing hard thinking the worst had to be over i opened the fridge hey ivy i said lightly to try and get everyone back to normal toss me the pepperoni ivy met my gaze from across the kitchen and blinked the last of her runaway instincts from her pepperoni she said her voice huskier than usual yeah she felt a cheek with the back of her hand frowning at herself she crossed the kitchen with what i recognized as a deliberately slow pace thanks for bringing me down she said softly as she handed me the pouch of cut meat i should have warned you im sorry i put the pepperoni away and straightened giving glenn a black look his face was grayed and drawn as he wiped the perspiration away i think he just figured out we were in the same room with a predator held back by pride and courtesy maybe he learned something today edden would be pleased i shuffled through the groceries and pulled out the perishables ivy leaned close as she put a can of peaches away whats he doing here she asked loud enough for glenn to hear im babysitting she nodded clearly waiting for more when it wasnt forthcoming she added its a paying job right i glanced at glenn uh yeah a missing person i snuck a glance at her relieved to see her pupils were almost back to normal can i help she asked ivy had done almost nothing but run for missing persons since she quit the is but i knew she would side with jenks that it was a ploy of trent kalamacks once she learned it was sara janes boyfriend putting off telling her would only make it worse though and i wanted her to come out to piscarys with me id get more information that way glenn stood with an affected casualness as ivy and i put the groceries away not seeming to care that we were ignoring him oh come on rachel the vamp cajoled who is it ill put my feelers out she looked as far from a predator now as a duck i was used to the shifts in temperament but glenn looked bewildered uh a witch named dan i tuned away hiding my head in the fridge as i put the cottage cheese away hes sara janes boyfriend and before you get all huffy glenn is coming with me to look at his apartment i figure we can wait until tomorrow to check out piscarys he works there as a driver but no way is glenn coming with me to the university there was a heartbeat of silence and i cringed waiting for her shout of protest it never came i looked past the door of the fridge going slack in surprise ivy had put herself at the sink and was hunched over it a hand to either side it was her count to ten spot it had never failed her yet she pulled her eyes up and put them on me my mouth went dry it had failed you are not taking this run she said the smooth monotone of her voice pulling the chill of black ice through me panic flashed before settling into a churning burn in the pit of my stomach all that existed was her pupilblack eyes she inhaled taking my warmth her presence seemed to swirl behind me until i fought to keep from turning around my shoulders tensed and my breath came fast she had pulled a fullblown soulstealing aura something was different though this wasnt anger or hunger i was seeing this was fear ivy was afraid im taking the run i said hearing a thin thread of fear in my voice trent cant touch me and i already told edden i would no you arent silk duster furling she jerked into motion i started finding her right before me almost as soon as i noticed she had moved face whiter than usual she pushed the fridge door shut i jumped to get out of the way i met her eyes knowing if i showed the fright that was making my stomach knot she would feed on it making her fervor stronger id learned a lot in the last three months some of it the hard way some of it i wished i hadnt needed to know the last time you took on trent you almost died she said sweat trickling down her neck to disappear behind the deep v of her shirt she was sweating the key word there is almost i said boldly no the key word is died i could feel the heat coming from her and stepped back glenn was in the archway watching me with wide eyes as i argued with a vamp there was a knack to it ivy i said calmly though i was shaking inside im taking this run if you want to come with glenn and me when we talk to piscary my breath cut off ivys fingers were around my throat gasping my air exploded from me as she slammed me up against the kitchen wall ivy i managed before she picked me up with one hand and pinned me there air coming in short insufficient pants i hung off the floor ivy put her face next to mine her eyes were black but they were wide with fear you arent going to talk to piscary she said panic a silver ribbon through the gray silk of her voice you arent taking this run i braced my feet against the wall and pushed a breath of air made it past her fingers and my back smacked back into the wall i kicked out at her and she shifted to the side her hold on me never altered what the hell are you doing i rasped let me go ms tamwood glenn shouted drop the woman and step to the center of the room digging my fingers into her onehanded grip i looked past ivy glenn was behind her his feet braced ready to shoot no my voice grated get out get out of here ivy wouldnt listen to me if he was here she was afraid what the hell was she afraid of trent couldnt touch me there was a sharp whistle of surprise as jenks darted in howdy campers he said sarcastically i see rachel told you about her run huh ivy get out i demanded my head pounding as ivys grip tightened holy crap the pixy exclaimed from the ceiling his wings flashing into a frightened red shes not kidding i know lungs hurting i pried at the fingers around my neck managing a ragged breath ivys pale face was drawn the black of her eyes was total and absolute and laced with fear seeing the emotion on her was terrifying ivy let her go jenks demanded as he hovered at eye level its not that bad really well just go with her get out i said taking a clean breath as ivys eyes went confused and her grip faltered panic took me as her fingers shook sweat trickled down her forehead pinched in confusion the whites of her eyes showed strong against the black jenks darted to glenn you heard her the pixy said get out my heart raced as glenn hissed are you crazy we leave and that bitch will kill her ivys breath came in a whimper it was as soft as the first snowflake but i heard it the smell of cinnamon filled my senses we gotta get out of here jenks said either rachel will get ivy to let go or ivy will kill her you might be able to separate them by shooting ivy but ivy will track her down and kill her the first chance she gets if she overthrows rachels dominance rachel is dominant i could hear the disbelief in glenns voice and i frantically prayed theyd get out before ivy finished throttling me the buzz of jenkss wings was as loud as my blood humming in my ears how else do you think rachel got ivy to back off of you you think a witch could do that if she wasnt in charge get out like she said i didnt know if dominant was the right word but if they didnt leave the point would be moot the honest to gods truth was in some twisted fashion ivy needed me more than i needed her but the dating guide ivy had given me last spring so i would stop pressing her vampinstinct buttons hadnt had a chapter on what to do if you find yourself the dominant i was in uncharted territory getout i choked as the edges of my sight shifted to black i heard the safety click back on glenn reluctantly holstered his weapon as jenks flitted from him to the rear door and back again the fib officer retreated looking angry and frustrated i stared at the ceiling and watched the stars edging my sight as the screen door squeaked shut ivy i rasped meeting her eyes i stiffened at their black terror i could see myself in their depths my hair wild and my face swollen my neck suddenly throbbed under her fingers where they pressed against my old demon bite god help me but it was starting to feel good the remembrance of the euphoria that had surged through me last spring as the demon sent to kill me had ripped my neck open and filled it with vamp saliva ivy open your fingers a little so i can breathe i managed spittle dripping down my chin the heat from her hand made the smell of cinnamon stronger you told me to let him go she snarled baring her teeth as her grip tightened until my eyes bulged i wanted him and you made me let him go my lungs tried to work moving in short splurges as i struggled for air her hold slackened i took a grateful gulp of air then another her face was grim waiting dying with a vampire was easy living with one took more finesse my jaw ached where it rested upon her fingers if you want him i whispered go get him but dont break your fast in anger i took another breath praying it wouldnt be my last unless its for passion it wont be worth it ivy she gasped as if i had hit her face thunderstruck her grip loosened without warning i fell into a heap against the wall hunching into myself i gagged on the air i felt my throat my stomach knotting as the demon bite on my neck continued to tingle in bliss my legs were askew and i slowly straightened them sitting with my knees to my chest i shook my charm bracelet back to my wrist wiped the spit from me and looked up i was surprised to find ivy still there usually when she broke down like this she went running to piscary but then she had never broken down quite like this before she had been afraid she had pinned me to the wall because she had been afraid afraid of what of me telling her she couldnt tear out glenns throat friend or not id leave if i saw her take someone in my kitchen the blood would give me nightmares forever are you okay i rasped hunching into myself when it triggered a spate of coughing she didnt move sitting at the table with her back to me she had her head in her hands i had figured out shortly after we had moved in together that ivy didnt like who she was hated the violence even as she instigated it struggled to abstain from blood even as she craved it but she was a vampire she didnt have a choice the virus had fixed itself deep into her dna and was there to stay you are what you are that she had lost control and let her instincts have sway meant failure to her ivy i got to my feet listing slightly as i stumbled to her i could still feel the impressions of her fingers around my neck it had been bad but nothing like the time she had pinned me to a chair in a cloud of lust and hunger i pushed my black bow back where it belonged you all right i reached out then drew back before touching her no she said as my hand dropped her voice was muffled rachel im sorry ii cant she hesitated taking a ragged breath dont take this run if its the money its not the money i said before she could finish she turned to me and my anger that she might try to buy me off died a shiny ribbon of moisture showed where she had tried to wipe it away id never seen her cry before and i eased myself down in the chair beside her i have to help sara jane she looked away then im going out to piscarys with you she said her voice holding a thin memory of its usual strength i clutched my arms about myself one hand rubbing the faint scar on my neck until i realized i was unconsciously doing it to feel it tingle i was hoping you would i said as i forced my hand down she gave me a frightened worried smile and turned away six pixy children swarmed around glenn as he sat at the kitchen table as far from ivy as he could without looking obvious about it jenkss kids seemed to have taken an unusual liking to the fib detective and ivy sitting before her computer was trying to ignore the noise and darting shapes she gave me the impression of a cat sleeping before a bird feeder seemingly ignoring everything but very aware if a bird should make a mistake and get too close everyone was overlooking that we had nearly had an incident and my feelings for being saddled with glenn had waned from dislike to a mild annoyance at his new and unexpected tact using a diabetic syringe i injected a sleepytime potion into the last of the thinwalled blue paint balls it was after seven i didnt like leaving the kitchen a mess but i had to make these little gems up special and there was no way i would go out to meet sara jane at a strange apartment unarmed no need to make it that easy for trent i thought as i took off my protective gloves and tossed them aside from the nested bowls under the counter i pulled out my gun i had originally kept it in a vat hanging over the island counter until ivy pointed out id have to put myself in plain sight to reach it keeping it at crawling height was better glenn perked up at the sound of iron hitting the counter waving the chattering greenclad adolescent pixy girls off his hand you shouldnt keep a weapon out like that he said scornfully do you have any idea how many children are killed a year because of stupid stunts like that relax mr fib officer i said as i wiped the reservoir out no one has died from a paint ball yet paint ball he questioned then he turned condescending playing dressup are we my brow furrowed i liked my mini splat gun it felt nice in my hand heavy and reassuring despite its palm size even with its cherry red color people generally didnt recognize it for what it was and assumed i was packing best of all i didnt need a license for it peeved i shook a pinkynailsized red ball out from the box resting on the shelf above my charms i dropped it in the chamber ivy i said and she looked up from her monitor no expression on her perfect oval face tag she went back to her screen her head shifting slightly the pixy children squealed and scattered flowing out of the window and into the dark garden to leave shimmering trails of pixy dust and the memory of their voices slowly the sound of crickets came in to replace them ivy wasnt the type of roommate who liked to play parcheesi and the one time i sat with her on the couch and watched rush hour i had unwittingly triggered her vamp instincts and nearly got bitten during the last fight scene as my body temp rose and the smell of our scents mingling hit her hard so now with the exception of our carefully orchestrated sparing sessions we generally did things with lots of space between us her dodging my splat balls gave her a good workout and improved my aim it was even better at midnight in the graveyard glenn ran a hand over his closecut beard waiting it was clear something was going to happen he just didnt know what ignoring him i set the splat gun on the counter and started to clean up the mess id made in the sink my pulse increased and tension made my fingers ache ivy continued to shop on the net the clicks of her mouse sounding loud she reached for a pencil as something got her attention snatching the gun i spun and pulled the trigger the puff of sound sent a thrill through me ivy leaned to the right her free hand came up to intercept the ball of water it hit her hand with a sharp splat breaking to soak her palm she never looked up from her monitor as she shook the water from her hand and read the caption under the casket pillows christmas was three months away and i knew she was stumped as to what to get her mother glenn had stood at the sound of the gun his hand atop his holster his face slack he alternated his gaze between ivy and me i tossed him the splat gun and he caught it anything to get his hand away from his pistol if that had been a sleepytime potion i said smugly shed be out cold i handed ivy the roll of paper towels we kept on the island counter for just this reason and she nonchalantly wiped her hand off and continued to shop head bowed glenn eyed the paintball gun i knew he was feeling the weight of it realizing it wasnt a toy he walked to me and handed it back they ought to make you license these things he said as it filled my grip yeah i agreed lightly they should i felt him watching as i loaded it with my seven potions not many witches used potions not because they were outrageously expensive and lasted only about a week uninvoked but because you needed to get a good soaking in saltwater to break them it was messy and took a heck of a lot of salt satisfied that id made my point i tucked the loaded splat gun into the small of my back and put on my leather jacket to cover it i kicked off my pink slippers and padded into the living room for my vampmade boots by the back door ready to go i asked as i leaned against the wall in the hallway and put them on youre driving glenns tall shape appeared in the archway dark fingers expertly tying his tie youre going like that brow furrowing i looked down at my red blouse black skirt nylons and anklehigh boots something wrong with what ive got on ivy made a rude snort from her computer glenn glanced at her then me never mind he said flatly he snuggled his tie tight to make him look polished and professional lets go no i said getting in his face i want to know what you think i should put on one of those polyester sacks you make your female fib officers wear theres a reason rose is so uptight and it has nothing to do with her having no walls or her chair having a broken caster face hard glenn sidestepped me and headed up the hallway grabbing my bag i acknowledged ivys preoccupied wave goodbye and strode after him he took up almost the entire width of the hall as he walked and put his arms into his suits jacket at the same time the sound of the lining rubbing against his shirt was a soft hush over the noise of his hardsoled shoes on the floorboards i kept to my cold silence as glenn drove us out of the hollows and back across the bridge it would have been nice had jenks come with us but sara jane said something about a cat and he prudently decided to stay home the sun was long down and traffic had thickened the lights from cincinnati looked nice from the bridge and i felt a flash of amusement as i realized glenn was driving at the head of a pack of cars too wary to pass him even the fibs unmarked vehicles were obvious slowly my mood eased i cracked the window to dilute the smell of cinnamon and glenn flipped the heater on the perfume didnt smell as nice anymore now that it had failed me dans apartment was a town house tidy clean and gated not too far from the university good access to the freeway it looked expensive but if he was taking classes at the university he could probably swing it just fine glenn pulled into the reserved spot with dans house number on it and cut the engine the porch light was off and the drapes were pulled a cat was sitting on the secondstory balcony railing its eyes glowing as it watched us saying nothing glenn reached under the seat and moved it back closing his eyes he settled in as if to nap the silence grew and i listened to the cars engine tick as it cooled off in the dark i reached for the radio knob and glenn muttered dont touch that peeved i sank back dont you want to question some of his neighbors i asked ill do it tomorrow when the sun is up and youre at class my eyebrows rose according to the receipt edden had given me class ran from four to six it was an excellent time to be knocking on doors when humans would be coming home diurnal inderlanders well up and nightwalkers stirring and the area felt like a mixed neighborhood a couple came out of a nearby apartment arguing as they got into a shiny car and drove away she was late for work it was his fault if i was following the conversation properly bored and a little nervous i dug in my bag until i found a finger stick and one of my detection amulets i loved these thingsthe detection amulet not the finger stickand after pricking my finger for three drops of blood to invoke it i found that there was no one but glenn and me within a thirtyfoot radius i draped it about my neck like my old is badge as a little red car pulled into the lot the cat on the railing stretched before dropping out of sight onto the balcony it was sara jane and she whipped her car into the spot directly behind us glenn took notice saying nothing as we got out and angled our paths to meet her hi she said her heartshaped face showing her worry in the light from the street lamp i hope you werent waiting long she added her voice carrying the professional air of the office not at all maam glenn said i tugged my leather coat closer against the cold as she jingled her keys fumbling for one that still carried a shiny newcut veneer and opened the door my pulse increased and i glanced at my amulet with thoughts of trent going through me i had my splat gun but i wasnt a brave person i ran away from bigbaduglies it increased my life span dramatically glenn followed sara jane in as she flipped on the lights illuminating the porch and apartment both nervous i crossed the threshold wavering between closing the door to keep anyone from following me in and leaving it open to keep my escape route available i opted to leave it cracked you got a problem glenn whispered as sara jane made her confident way to the kitchen and i shook my head the town house had an open floor plan with almost the entire downstairs visible from the doorway stairs ran a straight unimaginative pathway to the second floor knowing my amulet would warn me if anyone new showed up i relaxed there was no one here but us three and the cat yowling on the secondfloor balcony ill go up and let sarcophagus in sara jane said as she headed for the stairs my eyebrows rose thats the cat right ill come with you maam glenn offered and he thumped upstairs after her i did a quick reconnaissance of the downstairs while they were gone knowing wed find nothing trent was too good to leave anything behind i just wanted to see what kind of a guy sara jane liked the kitchen sink was dry the garbage can was stinky the computer monitor was dusty and the cat box was full clearly dan hadnt been home in a while the floorboards above me creaked as glenn walked through the upstairs perched on the tv was the same picture of dan and sara jane aboard the steamer i picked it up and studied their faces setting the framed photo back on the tv as glenn clumped downstairs the mans shoulders took up almost the entirety of the narrow stairway sara jane was silent behind him looking small and walking sideways in her heels upstairs looks fine glenn said as he rifled through the stack of mail on the kitchen counter sara jane opened the pantry like everything else it was wellorganized after a moment of hesitation she pulled out a pouch of moist cat food mind if i check his emails i asked and sara jane nodded her eyes sad i jiggled the mouse to find that dan had a dedicated alwayson line just like ivy strictly speaking i shouldnt have been doing this but as long as no one said anything from the corner of my eye i watched glenn run his eyes over sara janes smartly cut business dress as she tore the bag of cat food open and then down my outfit as i bent over the keyboard i could tell by his look that he thought my clothes were unprofessional and i fought back a grimace dan had a slew of unopened messages two from sara jane and one with a university address the rest were from a hardrock chat room of some sort even i knew better than to open any of them tampering with evidence should he turn up dead glenn ran a hand across his short hair seemingly disappointed that he had found nothing unusual i was guessing it wasnt because dan was missing but that he was a witch and as such should have dead monkey heads hanging from the ceiling dan appeared to be an average on his own young man he was perhaps tidier than most but sara jane wouldnt date a slob sara jane set a bowl of food on the placement next to a water bowl a black cat slunk downstairs at the clink of porcelain it hissed at sara jane not coming to eat until she left the kitchen sarcophagus doesnt like me she said needlessly hes a oneperson familiar a good familiar was like that the best chose their owners not the other way around the cat finished the food in a surprisingly short amount of time then jumped onto the back of the couch i scratched the upholstery and he came close to investigate he stretched out his neck and touched my finger with his nose it was how cats greeted each other and i smiled id love to have a cat but jenks would pix me every night for a year if i brought one home remembering my stint as a mink i shuffled through my purse trying to be discreet i invoked an amulet to do a spell check on the cat nothing not satisfied i dug deeper for a pair of wirerimmed glasses ignoring glenns questioning look i popped open the hard case and carefully put the souglytheycouldworkasbirthcontrol glasses on i had bought them last month spending three times my rent with the excuse that they were tax deductible the ones that didnt make me look like a nerd reject wouldve cost me twice that ley line magic could be bound in silver just as earth magic could be kept in wood and the wire frames were spelled to let me see through disguises invoked by ley line magic i felt kind of cheesy using them thinking that it dumped me back into the realm of warlocks in that i was using a charm that i couldnt make but as i scratched sarcophaguss chin sure now by the lack of any change that he wasnt dan trapped in a cats form i decided i didnt care glenn turned to the phone would you mind if i listened to his messages he asked sara janes laugh was bitter go ahead theyre from me the snap of the hard case was loud as i put my glasses away glenn punched the button and i winced as sara janes recorded voice came into the silent apartment hey dan i waited an hour it was carew tower right there was a hesitation then a distant well give me a call and youd better get some chocolate her voice turned playful youve got some serious groveling to do farm boy the second was even more uncomfortable hi dan if youre there pick up again a pause um i was just kidding about the chocolate ill see you tomorrow love you bye sara jane stood in the living room her face frozen he wasnt here when i came over and i havent seen him since she said softly well glenn said as the machine clicked off we havent found his car yet and his toothbrush and razor are still here wherever he is he hadnt planned on staying it looks like something has happened she bit her lip and turned away amazed at his lack of tact i gave glenn a murderous look you have the sensitivity of a dog in heat you know that i whispered glenn glanced at sara janes hunched shoulders sorry maam she turned a miserable smile on her maybe i should take sarcophagus home no i quickly assured her not yet i touched her shoulder in sympathy and the smell of her lilac perfume pulled from me the chalky tastememory of drugged carrots i glanced at glenn knowing he wouldnt leave so i could talk to her alone sara jane i asked hesitantly i have to ask you this and i apologize do you know if anyone has threatened dan no she said her hand rising to her collar and her face going still no one how about you i asked have you been threatened any way any way at all no no of course not she said quickly her eyes dropping and her pale features going even whiter i didnt need an amulet to know she was lying and the silence grew uncomfortable as i gave her a moment to change her mind and tell me but she didnt aare we done she stammered and nodding i adjusted my bag on my shoulder sara jane headed to the door her steps quick and stilted glenn and i followed her out onto the cement landing it was too cold for bugs but a broken spiderweb stretched by the porch light thank you for letting us look at his apartment i said as she checked the door with trembling fingers ill be talking with his classmates tomorrow perhaps one of them will know something whatever it is i can help i said trying to put more meaning into my voice yes thank you her eyes went everywhere but to mine and she had fallen into her professional office tone again i appreciate you coming over i wish i could be more help maam glenn said in parting sara janes heels clicked smartly on the pavement as she walked away i followed glenn to his car glancing back to see sarcophagus sitting in an upstairs window watching us sara janes car gave a happy chirp before she set her purse inside got in and drove away i stood in the dark beside my open door and watched her taillights vanish around a corner glenn was facing me standing at the driver side with his arms resting on the roof of the car his brown eyes were featureless in the buzz of the street lamp kalamack must pay his secretaries very well for the car she has he said softly i stiffened i know for a fact he does i said hotly not liking what he was implying shes very good at her job and she still has enough money to send home for her family to live like veritable kings compared to the rest of the farms employees he grunted and opened his door i got in sighing as i fastened my belt and settled into the leather seats i stared out the window at the dark lot growing more depressed sara jane didnt trust me but from her point of view why should she taking this kind of personal arent you glenn asked as he started the car you think because shes a warlock she doesnt deserve help i said sharply slow down thats not what i meant glenn shot me a quick look as he backed the car into motion he flipped the heater on full before he shifted into drive and a strand of hair tickled my face im just saying youre acting like you have a stake in the outcome i ran a hand over my eyes sorry its okay he said sounding as if he understood so he hesitated what gives he pulled into traffic and in the light of a street lamp i glanced at him wondering if i wanted to be that open with him i know sara jane i said slowly you mean you know her type glenn said no i know her the fib detective frowned she doesnt know you yeah i rolled the window all the way down to get rid of the smell of my perfume i couldnt stand it anymore my thoughts kept returning to ivys eyes black and frightened thats what makes it hard the brakes made a slow squeak as we stopped at a light glenns brow was furrowed and his beard and mustache made deep shadows on him would you talk human please i gave him a quick mirthless smile did your dad tell you about how we nearly brought trent kalamack in as a dealer and manufacture of genetic drugs yeah that was before i transferred to his department he said the only witness was an is runner who died in a car bombing the light changed and we moved forward i nodded edden had told him the basics let me tell you about trent kalamack i said as the wind pushed against my hand when he caught me rifling through his office looking for a way to bring him into the courts he didnt turn me in to the is he offered me a job anything i wanted cold i angled the vent toward me hed pay off my is death threat set me up as an independent runner give me a small staff everythingif i worked for him he wanted me to run the same system i had spent my entire professional life fighting he offered me what looked like freedom i wanted it so badly i might have said yes glenn was silent wisely not saying anything there wasnt a cop alive who hadnt been tempted and i was proud that i had passed that test when i turned him down his offer became a threat i was spelled into a mink at the time and he was going to torture me mentally and physically until i would do anything to get it to stop if he couldnt have me willingly hed be satisfied with a warped shadow eager to please him i was helpless just like sara jane is i hesitated to gather my resolve i had never admitted that aloud beforethat i had been helpless she thought i was a mink but she gave me more dignity as an animal than trent gave me as a person i have to get her away from him before its too late unless we can find dan and get him safe she doesnt have a chance mr kalamack is just a man glenn said really i said with a bark of sarcastic laughter tell me mr fib detective is he human or inderlander his family has been quietly running a good slice of cincinnati for two generations and no one knows what he is jenks cant tell what he smells like and neither can the fairies he destroys people by giving them exactly what they wantand he enjoys it i watched the passing buildings without seeing them glenns continued silence pulled my eyes up you really think dans disappearance has nothing to do with the witch hunter murders he asked yeah i resettled myself not comfortable with having told him so much i only took this run to help sara jane and pull trent down you going to run tattling to your dad now the lights from oncoming traffic illuminated him he took a breath and let it out you do anything in your little vendetta to jeopardize me proving dr anders is the murderer and ill tie you to a bonfire in fountain square he said softly in threat you will go to the university tomorrow and you will tell me everything you learn his shoulders eased just be careful i eyed him the passing lights illuminating him in flashes that seemed to mirror my uncertainty it sounded as if he understood imagine that fair enough i said settling back my head turned as we turned left instead of right i glanced at him with a feeling of déjà vu where are we going my office is the other way pizza piscarys he said theres no reason to wait until tomorrow i eyed him not wanting to admit id promised ivy i wouldnt go out there without her piscarys doesnt open until midnight i lied they cater to inderlanders i mean how often does a human order a pizza glenns face went still in understanding and i picked at my nail polish it will be at least two before they slow down enough to be able to talk to us thats two in the morning right he asked well duh i thought that was when most inderlanders were hitting their stride especially the dead ones why dont you go home sleep in and well all go out tomorrow he shook his head youll go tonight without me a puff of affront escaped me i dont work like that glenn besides if i do youll go out there alone and i promised your dad id try to keep you alive ill wait witches honor lie yes betray the trust of a partnereven unwelcome onesno he gave me a quick suspicious glance all right witches honor seven rache jenks said from my earring take a squint at that guy is he trolling or what i tugged my bag up higher onto my shoulder and peered through the unseasonably warm september afternoon at the kid in question as i walked through the informal lounge music tickled my subconscious the volume of his radio set too low to hear well my first thought was that he must be hot his hair was black his clothes were black his sunglasses were black and his black duster was made of leather he was leaning against a vending machine trying to look suave as he talked to a woman in a gothic black lace dress but he was blowing it no one looks sophisticated with a foam cup in his hand no matter how sexy his twoday stubble is and no one wore goth but outofcontrol teen living vamps and pathetically sad vamp wannabes i snickered feeling vastly better the big campus and the conglomeration of youth had me on edge i had gone to school at a small community college taking the standard twoyear program followed by a fouryear internship with the is my mother would have never been able to afford tuition at the university of cincinnati on my dads pension extra death benefit aside i glanced at the faded yellow receipt edden had given me it had the time and days my class met and right down at the lower righthand corner was the cost of it alltax lab fees and tuition all totaled up into one appalling sum just this one class was nearly as much as a semester at my alma mater nervous i shoved the paper in my bag as i noticed a were in the corner watching me i looked out of place enough without wandering around with a class schedule in my grip i might as well have hung a card around my neck saying continuing adult education student god help me but i felt old they werent much younger than i was but their every move screamed innocence this is stupid i muttered to jenks as i left the informal commissary i didnt even know why the pixy was with me must be edden had sicked him on me to make sure i went to class my vampmade boots clicked smartly as i strode through the windowed elevated walkway connecting the business arts building with kantack hall a jolt went through me as i realized my feet were hitting the rhythm of takatas shattered sight and though i still couldnt really hear the music the lyrics settled themselves deep into my head to drive me nuts sift the clues from the dust from my lives of my will i loved you then i love you still i should be with glenn interviewing dans neighbors i complained i dont need to take the freaking class just talk to dans classmates my earring swung like a tire swing and jenkss wings tickled my neck edden doesnt want to give dr anders any warning that shes a suspect i think its a good idea i frowned my steps growing muffled as i found the carpeted hallway and began watching the numbers on the doors count up you think its a good idea do you yeah but theres one thing he forgot he snickered or maybe he didnt i slowed as i saw a group standing outside a door it was probably mine whats that well he drawled now that youre taking the class you fit the profile adrenaline zinged through me and vanished how about that i murmured damn edden anyway jenkss laughter was like wind chimes i shifted my heavy book to my other hip scanning the small gathering for the person most likely to spill the best gossip a young woman looked up at me or jenks rather smiling briefly before turning away she was dressed in jeans like me with an expensivelooking suede coat over her tshirt casual yet sophisticated nice combination dropping my bag to the carpet tile i leaned back against the wall like everyone else a noncommittal four feet away i surreptitiously looked at the book by the womans feet noncontact extensions using ley lines a tiny wash of relief went through me i had the right book at least maybe this wouldnt be so bad i glanced at the frosted glass of the closed door hearing a muted conversation from inside must be the previous class hadnt let out yet jenks rocked my earring pulling on it i could ignore that but when he started singing about inchworms and marigolds i batted him off the woman beside me cleared her throat just transfer in she asked beg pardon i asked as jenks flitted back she popped her gum her heavily madeup eyes going from me to the pixy there arent many of us ley line students i dont remember seeing you do you usually take night classes oh i pushed myself away from the wall and faced her no im taking a class to ah move ahead at work she laughed as she tucked her long hair back hey im right there with you but by the time i get out of here theres probably not going to be any jobs left for a film production manager with ley line experience everyone seems to be minoring in art these days im rachel i extended my hand and this is jenks nice to meet you she said taking it for an instant janine jenks buzzed to her alighting on her hastily raised hand pleasure is all mine janine he said actually making a bow she beamed utterly delighted obviously she hadnt had much contact with pixies most stayed outside the city unless employed in the few areas pixies and fairies excelled in camera maintenance security or good oldfashioned sneaking around even so fairies were far more commonly employed since they ate insects instead of nectar and their food supply was more readily available uh does dr anders actually teach the class or does she have an aide do it i asked janine chuckled and jenks flitted back to my earring youve heard about her she asked yes she teaches seeing as theres not that many of us janines eyes pinched especially now we started with more than a dozen but we lost four when dr anders told us the murderer was taking only ley line witches and to be careful and then dan went and quit she slumped back against the wall sighing the witch hunter i asked stifling my smile i had chosen the right person to stand beside i made my eyes wide youre kidding her face went worried i think thats some of the reason why dan left and it was a shame too the man was so hot he could make a sprinkler spark in a rainstorm he had a big interview wouldnt tell me anything i think he was afraid id apply for it too looks like he got the job my head bobbed as i wondered if this was the news he was going to tell sara jane on saturday but then a slow burn started in me that perhaps supper at carew tower had been a dump dinner and he chickened out and left without telling her anything are you sure he quit i asked maybe the witch hunter i left my sentence open and janine smiled reassuringly yes he quit he asked if i wanted to buy his magnetic chalk if he got the job the bookstore wont take them back once you break the seal my face went slack in sudden real alarm i didnt know i needed chalk oh ive got one you can borrow she said as she rummaged in her purse dr anders usually has us sketching something or other pentagrams northsouth apogeesyou name it weve traced it she lumps the lab in with the lecture thats why we meet here instead of a lecture hall thanks i said as i accepted the metallic stick and gripped it along with my book pentagrams i hated pentagrams my lines were always crooked id have to ask edden if he would pay for a second trip to the bookstore but then remembering the cost of the class he would probably never be reimbursed for i decided to go pick up my old school supplies from my mom swell better give her a call janine saw my sick look and misunderstanding it she rushed to say oh dont worry rachel the murderer isnt after us really dr anders said to be careful but hes only going for experienced witches yeah i said wondering if i would be considered experienced or not i guess the conversations around us ceased as dr anderss voice shrilled from behind the door i dont know whos killing my students ive been to too many funerals this month to listen to your foul accusations and ill sue you from here back to the turn if you slander my name janine looked alarmed as she picked up her book and held it to her chest the students in the hallway shifted from foot to foot and exchanged uneasy looks from my earring jenks whispered so much for keeping dr anders in the dark about her possible suspect status i nodded wondering if edden would let me drop the class now its denon in there with her jenks added and i took a quick breath what i can smell denon he reiterated hes in there with dr anders denon i thought wondering what my old boss was doing out from behind his desk there was a soft murmur followed by a loud pop everyone in the hall but jenks and me jumped janine reached up and touched her ear as if she had just been knocked a good one didnt you feel that she asked me and i shook my head she just set a circle without drawing a real one first i eyed the door along with everyone else i didnt know you could set a circle without drawing it i also didnt like that everybody but jenks and i had been able to tell she had done it feeling as if i was in over my head i picked my bag up the low rumble of my old bosss voice pulled a chill from me denon was a living vamp like ivy but he was lowblood rather than high having been born a human and infected with the vamp virus later by one of the true undead and where ivy had political power because shed been born a vamp and thus was guaranteed to join the undead even if she should die alone with every drop of blood in her denon would always be secondclass having to trust that someone would bother to finish turning him after he died get out of my room dr anders demanded before i file harassment charges the students all shifted nervously i wasnt surprised when the frosted glass darkened with a shape behind it i stiffened with the rest when the door opened and denon walked out the man almost had to turn sideways to clear the door frame i still maintained my belief that denon had been a boulder in a previous lifea smooth riverworn boulder massing about a ton maybe being lowblood and having only human strength he had to work hard to keep up with his dead brethren the results were a trim waist and oodles of bunching muscles they pulled at his white dress shirt as he sauntered into the hallway the stark cotton stood in sharp contrast with his complexion drawing my eye and holding itjust as he wanted the class fell back as he eased past a cold presence seemed to flow out of the room and pool about him the remnants of the aura he had probably pulled on dr anders a confident dominating smile curved over him as his eyes fastened on me uh rachel jenks muttered as he flitted to janine ill see you inside okay i said nothing suddenly feeling too thin and vulnerable ill save you a seat janine said but i didnt look from my old boss there was a soft rustle as the hallway emptied i had been scared of the man and i was ready and willing to be scared of him now but something had changed though still moving with the grace of a predator the ageless look he once carried was gone the hungry cast in his eye which he didnt bother to hide told me he was still a practicing vamp but i was guessing he had lost favor and was no longer tasting the undead though they were probably still feeding upon him morgan he said his words seeming to backwash against the brick wall behind me and give me a shove forward his voice was just like him practiced powerful and full of a heavy promise i heard you were whoring for the fib or are we just bettering ourselves hello mr denon i said not dropping his pupilblack eyes you get bumped down to runner the hungry lust in his eyes faltered into anger and i added looks like youre doing the runs you gave me rescuing familiars out of trees checking for valid licenses how are those homeless bridge trolls doing anyway denon shifted forward his eyes intent and his muscles tense my face went cold and i found my back against the wall the sun streaming in from the distant walkway seemed to dim like a kaleidoscope it swirled to look twice as far away as it was my heart leapt then settled back into its usual pace he was trying to pull an aura but i knew he couldnt do it without me giving him the fear to feed it i wouldnt be afraid cut the crap denon i said boldly my stomach knotting i live with a vamp who could eat you for breakfast save the aura for someone who cares still he pressed close until he was the only thing i could see i had to look up and it ticked me off his breath was warm and i could smell the tang of blood on it my pulse pounded and i hated that he knew i was afraid of him still anyone here but you and me he said his voice as smooth as chocolate milk hand moving in a slow controlled motion i reached for the grip of my splat gun the brick scraped my knuckles but as my fingers touched the handle my confidence raced back just you me and my splat gun touch me and ill drop you i smiled right back at him what do you suppose i put in my splat balls might be kind of hard to explain why someone from the is had to come out here and hose you off with saltwater huh id say that would be good for a laugh for at least a year i watched his eyes shift to hate back up i said clearly if i pull it i use it he backed up walk away from this morgan he threatened this is my run that explains why the is is spinning its wheels maybe you should go back to ticketing parked cars and let a professional take care of it his breath hissed out and i found strength in his anger ivy was right there was fear in the back of his soul fear that someday the undead vampires that fed on him would lose control and kill him fear that they wouldnt bring him back as one of their brothers he should be afraid this is an is matter he said interfere and ill have you down in lockup he smiled flashing me his human teeth if you thought being in kalamacks cage was bad wait until you see mine my confidence cracked the is knew about that dont get your falsies in a twist i said snidely im here on a missing person not your murders missing person he mocked thats a good story id stick with it try to keep your tag alive this time he gave me a final glance before he started down the hallway to the sun and the distant sound of the commissary you wont be tamwoods pet forever he said not turning around then im coming for you yeah whatever i said even as a sliver of my old fear tried to surface i quashed it as i pulled my hand away from the small of my back i wasnt ivys pet though living with her gave me a heap of protection from cincinnatis vamp population she wasnt in a position of power but as the last living member of the tamwood family she had a leaderinwaiting status honored by wise vamps both living and dead i took a deep breath to try to dispel the weakness in my knees great now i had to go into class after they had probably started thinking my day couldnt possibly get any worse i gathered myself and walked into the room lit brightly from the bank of windows overlooking the campus as janine had said it was set up like a lab with two people sitting on stools at each of the high slate tables janine was by herself talking to jenks clearly having saved me the spot next to her ozone from dr anderss hastily constructed circle caught at me the circle was gone but my sinuses tingled at the remnants of power i glanced at its source at the front of the room dr anders sat at an ugly metal desk before a traditional blackboard she had her elbows on the table her head in her hands i could see her thin fingers trembling and i wondered if it was from denons accusations or that she had pulled upon the everafter strong enough to make a circle without the aid of a physical manifestation the class seemed unusually quiet her hair was back in a severe bun gray streaks making unflattering lines through the black she looked older than my mother dressed in a conservative pair of tan slacks and a tasteful blouse trying not to draw attention to myself i slipped past the first two rows of tables and sat beside janine thanks i whispered her eyes were wide as i tucked my bag under the table you work for the is i glanced at dr anders i used to i quit last spring i didnt think you could quit the is she said her face going even more full of wonder shrugging i pushed my hair out of the way so jenks could land on his usual spot it wasnt easy i followed her attention to the front of the room as dr anders stood the tall woman was as scary as i remembered with a long thin face and a nose that wouldnt be out of place on a preturn depiction of a witch no wart though and her complexion wasnt green she reeked of tenure gathering the classs attention by simply standing the tremor was gone from her hands as she took up a sheaf of papers dropping a pair of wirerimmed glasses down to perch on her nose she made a show of studying her notes id have been willing to bet they had a spell on them to see through ley line charms as well as correct her sight and i wished i had the gall to put my own glasses on and see if she used ley line magic to make her look that unattractive or if it was all her a sigh shifted her narrow shoulders as she looked up her gaze going right to mine through her spelled glasses i see she said her voice making my spine crawl that we have a new face today i gave her a false smile it was obvious she recognized me her face had scrunched up like a prune rachel morgan she said here i said my voice flat a wisp of annoyance flashed over her i know who you are low heels clicking she came to stand before me leaning forward she peered at jenks who might you be pixy sir uh jenks maam he stammered his wings moving fitfully to tangle in my hair jenks she said her tone bordering on the respectful im glad to make your acquaintance youre not on my class list please leave yes maam he said and much to my surprise the usually arrogant pixy swung himself off my earring sorry rache he said hovering before me ill be in the faculty lounge or the library nick might still be working sure ill find you later he gave dr anders a head bob and zipped out the still open door im sorry dr anders said is my class interfering with your social life no dr anders its a pleasure seeing you again she pulled back at the faint sarcasm is it from the corner of my sight i saw janines mouth hanging open what i could see of the rest of the class looked about the same my face burned i dont know why the woman had it in for me but she did she was as nice as a hungry crow to everyone else but i got the ravenous badger dr anders let her papers fall to my table with a slap my name was circled in a thick red marker her thin lips tightened almost imperceptibly why are you here she asked we are two classes into the semester its still adddrop week i countered feeling my pulse increase unlike jenks i had no problem fighting authority but as the song went authority always won i dont even know how you managed to get the approval for taking this class she said caustically you have none of the prerequisites all my credits transferred in and i got a year for lifeexperiences true enough but edden was the real reason i had been able to skip right to a fivehundredlevel class you are wasting my time ms morgan she said you are an earth witch i thought i had made that very clear to you you dont possess the control to work ley lines beyond what you need to close a modest circle she leaned over me and i felt my blood pressure rise im going to flunk you out of my class faster than before i took a steadying breath glancing at the shocked faces clearly they had never seen this side of their beloved instructor i need this class dr anders i said not knowing why i was trying to appeal to her stunted compassion except that if i got kicked out edden might make me pay the tuition im here to learn at that the prickly woman picked up her papers and retreated to the empty table behind her her gaze roved over the class before settling on me having trouble with your demon several in the class gasped janine actually shrank away from me damn that woman i thought my hand going to cover my wrist not even here for five minutes and she alienates me from the entire class i should have worn a bracelet my jaw clenched and my breathing increased as i fought to not respond dr anders seemed satisfied you cant reliably hide a demon mark with earth magic she said her voice raised in the sound of instruction you need ley line magic for that is that why youre here ms morgan she mocked shaking i refused to drop her eyes i hadnt known that no wonder my charms to disguise it never worked past sundown her wrinkles went deeper as she frowned professor peltzers demonology for modern practitioners is in the next building over perhaps you should excuse yourself and see if its not too late to change classes we do not deal in the black arts here i am not a black witch i said softly afraid if i raised my voice i would start shouting i pushed up my sleeve to show my demon mark refusing to be ashamed of it i did not call the demon who gave me this i fought it off i took a slow breath unable to look at anyone most of all janine who had pushed as far from me as she could get im here to learn how to keep it off of me dr anders i will not take any demonology classes im afraid of them the last was a whisper but i knew everyone heard dr anders seemed taken aback i was embarrassed but if it kept her off my case then it was embarrassment well spent the womans footsteps were loud as she clacked to the front of the room go home ms morgan she said to the blackboard i know why youre here i did not kill my past students and i take offense in your unsaid accusation and with that pleasant thought she turned flashing the class a tightlipped smile if the rest of you will please retain your copies of eighteenth century pentagrams we will be having a quiz on them friday for next week i want you to go over chapters six seven and eight in your texts and to do the even practices at the end of each janine at the sound of her name the woman jumped she had been trying to get a good look at my wrist i was still shaking my fingers trembling as i wrote down the assignment janine you would do well to do the odds on chapter six as well your control in releasing stored ley line energy leaves something to be desired yes dr anders she said whitefaced and go sit by brian she added you can learn more from him than ms morgan janine didnt hesitate before dr anders had even finished janine picked up her purse and book moving to the next table i was left alone feeling sick janines borrowed chalk sat next to my book like a stolen cookie i would also like to evaluate your linkages with your familiars on friday as we will be starting a section on longterm protection over the next few weeks dr anders was saying so please bring them in it will take some time to get through all of you those at the end of the alphabet can expect to be held beyond the usual class time there was a weary groan from some of the students but it lacked a certain joviality that i sensed was usually there my stomach dropped i didnt have a familiar if i didnt get one by friday shed flunk me same as last time dr anders smiled at me with the warmth of a doll is that a problem ms morgan no i said flatly starting to want to pin the murders on her whether she had committed them or not no problem at all eight thankfully there was no line when we pulled up to pizza piscarys in glenns unmarked fib car ivy and i slid out almost as soon as the car stopped it hadnt been a very comfortable ride for either of us the memory of her pinning me to the kitchen wall still newpenny bright her manner had been odd this evening subdued but excited i felt like i was going to meet her parents in a way i suppose i was piscary was the wayback originator of her livingvamp family line glenn yawned as he slowly got out and put his jacket on but he woke up enough to wave off jenks flitting around his head he didnt seem at all uneasy about going into what was strictly an inderland eatery i could almost see the chip on his shoulder maybe he was a slow learner the fib detective had agreed to exchange his stiff fib suit for the jeans and faded flannel shirt ivy had tucked in the back of her closet in a box labeled leftovers in a faded black marker they fit glenn exactly and i didnt want to know where she had gotten them or why they had several neatly mended tears in some rather unusual places a nylon jacket hid the weapon he refused to leave behind but i had left my splat gun at home it would be useless against a room full of vamps a van eased into the lot to take an empty space at the far end my attention drifted from it to the brightly lit delivery takeout window as i watched another pizza went out the car lurching into the street and speeding away with the quickness that told of a large engine pizza drivers have made good money since they successfully lobbied for hazard pay past the parking lot was the soft lapping of water on wood long strips of light glinted on the ohio river and the taller buildings of cincinnati reflected in wide streaks on the flat water piscarys was waterfront property situated in the middle of the more affluent strip of clubs restaurants and nightspots it even had a landing where yachttraveling patrons could tie up tobut getting a table overlooking the dock would be impossible this late ready ivy said brightly as she finished adjusting her jacket she was dressed in her usual black leather pants and silk shirt looking lanky and predatory the only color to her face was her bright red lipstick a chain of black gold hung about her neck in place of her usual crucifixwhich was now tucked in her jewelry box at home it matched her ankle bracelets perfectly she had gone further to paint her nails with a clear coat giving them a subtle shine the jewelry and nail polish were unusual for her and after seeing it i had opted to wear a wide silver band instead of my usual charm bracelet to cover my demon mark it felt nice to get dressed up and id even tried to do something with my hair the red frizz i ended up with almost looked intentional i kept a step behind glenn as we moved to the front door inderlanders mixed freely but our group was more odd than usual and i was hoping to get in and out quickly with the information we came for before we attracted attention the van that pulled in after us was a pack of weres and they were noisy as they closed the gap between us glenn ivy said as we reached the door keep your mouth shut whatever the officer said antagonistically my eyebrows rose and i took a wary step back jenks landed upon my big hoop earrings this ought to be good he snickered ivy grabbed glenns collar picking him up and slamming him against the wooden pillar supporting the canopy the startled man froze for an instant then kicked out aiming for ivys gut ivy dropped him to evade the strike with a vamp quickness she picked him back up and slammed him into the post again glenn grunted in pain struggling to catch his breath ooooh jenks cheered thats going to ache in the morning i jiggled my foot and glanced at the pack of weres couldnt you have taken care of this before we left i complained look you little snack ivy said calmly putting herself in glenns face you will keep your mouth shut you do not exist unless i ask you a question go to hell glenn managed his face reddening under his dark skin ivy shifted him a smidgen higher and he grunted you stink like a human she continued her eyes shifting toward black piscarys is all inderlanders or bound humans the only way youre going to get out of here with all your parts intact and unpunctured is if everyone thinks youre my shadow shadow i thought it was a derogatory term thrall was another toy would be more accurate it referred to a human recently bit now little more than a walking source of sex and food and mentally bound to a vamp they were kept submissive as long as possible decades sometimes my old boss denon had been counted among them until he curried the favor of the one who had granted him a more free existence face ugly glenn broke her hold and fell to the ground go turn yourself tamwood he rasped rubbing his neck i can take care of myself this wont be any worse than walking into a goodoldboys bar in deep georgia yeah she questioned pale hand on her cocked hip anyone there want to eat you the were pack flowed past us and inside one jerked doing a double take as he saw me and i wondered if my stealing that fish was going to be a problem music and chatter drifted out cutting off as the thick door shut i sighed it sounded busy now wed probably have to wait for a table i offered glenn a hand up as ivy opened the door glenn refused my help tucking his antiitch spell back behind his shirt as he struggled to find his pride squished under ivys boots somewhere jenks flitted from me to his shoulder and glenn started go sit somewhere else pixy he said around a cough oh no jenks said merrily dont you know a vamp wont touch you if theres a pixy on your shoulder its a wellknown fact glenn hesitated and my eyes rolled what a crock we filed in behind ivy as the were pack was being led to their table the place was crowded not unusual for a workday piscarys had the best pizza in cincinnati and they didnt take reservations the warmth and noise relaxed me and i took off my coat the roughcut thick support beams seemed to prop up the low ceiling and a rhythmic stomping to the beat of stings rehumanize yourself filtered down the wide stairs past them were wide windows looking out over the black river and the city beyond a threestory obscenely expensive motorboat was tied up the docking lights shining on the name across the bow solar pretty collegeage kids moved efficiently about in their skimpy uniforms some more suggestive than others most were bound humans since the vamp staff traditionally took the less supervised upstairs the hosts eyebrows rose as he took glenn in i could tell he was the host because his shirt was only half undone and his name tag said so table for three lighted or non lighted i interjected before ivy could say different i didnt want to be upstairs it sounded rowdy it will be about fifteen minutes then you can wait at the bar if you like i sighed fifteen minutes it was always fifteen minutes fifteen little minutes that dragged to thirty then forty and then you were willing to wait ten more so you didnt have to go to the next restaurant and start all over again ivy smiled to show her teeth her canines were no bigger than mine were but sharp like a cats well wait here thanks looking almost enraptured by her smile the host nodded his chest showing beneath his open shirt was scattered with pale scars it wasnt what the hosts were wearing at dennys but who was i to complain there was a soft look about him that i didnt like in my men but some women did it wont be long he said his eyes fixing to mine as he noticed my attention on him his lips parted suggestively do you want to order now a pizza went by on a tray and as i jerked my gaze from him i glanced at ivy and shrugged we werent there for dinner but why not it smelled great yeah ivy said an extra large everything but peppers and onions glenn jerked his attention from what looked like a coven of witches applauding the arrival of their dinner eating at piscarys was an event you said we werent going to stay ivy turned black swelling within her eyes im hungry is that okay with you sure he muttered immediately ivy regained her composure i knew she wouldnt vamp out here it might start a cascading reaction from the surrounding vampires and piscary would lose his a rating on his mpl maybe we can share a table with someone im starved she said jiggling her foot mpl was short for mixed public license what it meant was a strict enforcement of no blood drawn on the premises standard stuff for most places serving alcohol since the turn it created a safe zone that we frail dead means dead folk needed if you had too many vamps together and one drew blood the rest had a tendency to lose control no problem if everyones a vampire but people didnt like it when their loved ones night on the town turned into an eternity in the graveyard or worse the clubs and nightspots without a mpl existed but they werent as popular and didnt make as much money humans liked mpl places since they could safely flirt without someone elses bad decision turning their date into an out of control bloodthirsty fiend at least until the privacy of their own bedroom where they might survive it and vamps liked it tooit was easier to break the ice when your date wasnt uptight about you breaking his or her skin i looked around the semiopen room seeing only inderlanders among the patrons mpl or not it was obvious glenn was attracting attention the music had died and no one had put in another quarter apart from the witches in the corner and the pack of weres in the back the downstairs was full of vamps in various levels of sensuality ranging from casual to satin and lace a good part of the floor was taken up in what looked like a deathday party the sudden warm breath on my neck jerked me straight and it was only ivys bothered look that kept me from smacking whoever it was spinning my tart retort died swell kisten the living vamp was ivys friend and i didnt like him some of that was because kist was piscarys scion a loose extension of the master vampire who did his daylight work for him it didnt help that piscary had once bespelled me against my will through kist something i hadnt known was possible at the time it also didnt help that he was very very pretty making him very very dangerous by my reckoning if ivy was a diva of the dark then kist was her consort and god help me he looked the part short blond hair blue eyes and chin holding enough stubble to give his delicate features a more rugged cast made him a sexy bundle of promised fun he was dressed more conservatively than usual his biker leather and chains replaced with a tasteful shirt and slacks his ishouldcarewhatyouthinkbecause attitude remained though the lack of biker boots put him a shade taller than me with the heels i had on and the ageless look of an undead vampire shimmered in him like a promise to be fulfilled he moved with a catlike confidence having enough muscle to enjoy running your fingertips over but not so much that it got in the way ivy and he had a past i didnt want to know about since she had been a very practicing vamp at the time i was always struck with the impression that if he couldnt have her hed be happy with her roommate or the girl next door or the woman he met on the bus this morning evening love he breathed in a fake english accent his eyes amused because he had surprised me i pushed him back with a finger your accent stinks go away until you get it right but my pulse had increased and a faint pleasant tickle from the scar on my neck brought all my proximity alarms into play damn it id forgotten about that he glanced at ivy as if for permission then playfully licked his lips as she frowned her answer i scowled thinking i didnt need her help fending him off seeing it she made a puff of exasperated air and pulled glenn to the bar enticing jenks to join them with the promise of a honeyed toddy the fib detective glanced at me over his shoulder as he went knowing something had passed between the three of us but not what alone at last kist shifted to stand shouldertoshoulder with me and look across the open floor i could smell leather though he wasnt wearing any that i could see at least cant you find a better opening line than that i said wishing i hadnt driven ivy away it wasnt a line his shoulder was too close to mine but i wouldnt shift away and let him know it bothered me i snuck a glance at him as he breathed with a heavy slowness his eyes scanning the patrons even as he took in my scent to gauge my state of unease twin diamond earrings glittered from one ear and i remembered the other had only one stud and a healed tear a chain made out of the same stuff as ivys was the only hint of his usual badboy attire i wondered what he was doing here there were better places for a living vamp to pick up a datesnack his fingers moved with a restless motion always pulling my eyes back to him i knew he was throwing off vamp pheromones to soothe and relax meall the better to eat you with my dearbut the prettier they are the more defensive i get my face went slack as i realized i had matched my breathing to his subtle bespelling at its finest i thought purposely holding my breath to get us out of sync and i saw him smile as he ducked his head and ran a hand over his chin normally only an undead vampire could bespell the unwilling but being piscarys scion gave kist a portion of his masters abilities he wouldnt dare try it here though not with ivy watching from the bar around her bottled water i suddenly realized he was rocking moving his hips with a steady suggestive motion stop it i said as i turned to face him disgusted theres an entire string of women watching you at the bar go bother them its much more fun to bother you taking my scent deep into him he leaned close you still smell like ivy but she hasnt bitten you my god you are a tease were friends i said affronted shes not hunting me then she wont mind if i do annoyed i pulled away he followed me until my back found a support post stop moving he said as he put his hand against the thick post beside my head pinning me though air still showed between us i want to tell you something and i dont want anyone else to hear it like anyone could hear you over the noise i scoffed the fingers behind my back bending into a fist that wouldnt make my nails cut my palm if i had to slug him you might be surprised he murmured his eyes intent i fixed on them looking for and recognizing the barest hint of swelling black even as his nearness sent a promise of heat from my scar id lived long enough with ivy to know what a vamp looked like when they were close to losing it he was fine his instincts curbed and his hunger sated i was reasonably safe so i relaxed easing my shoulders down his lustreddened lips parted in surprise at my acceptance at how close he was eyes bright he breathed languorously slow tilting his head and leaning in so his lips brushed the curve of my ear the light shimmered on the black chain around his neck drawing my hand up it was warm and that surprise kept my fingers playing with it when i should have stopped the clatter of dishes and conversation retreated as i exhaled into his soft unrecognizable whisper a delicious feeling ran through me sending the sensation of molten metal through my veins i didnt care that it was from him triggering my scar into play it felt so good and he hadnt even said a word i recognized yet sir came a hesitant voice from behind him kists breath caught for three heartbeats he held himself still unmoving as his shoulders tensed in annoyance my hand dropped from his neck someone wants you i said looking beyond him to the host shifting nervously a smile edged over me kist was tempting a break in the mpl and someone had been sent to rein him in laws were good things they kept me alive when i did something stupid what kist said flatly id never heard his voice carry anything but sultry petulance before and the power in it sent a jolt through me its unexpectedness making it all the more demanding sir the party of weres upstairs theyre starting to pack oh i thought that was not what i had expected kist straightened his elbow and pushed away from the post irritation flickering across him i took a clean breath my unhealthy disappointment mixing with a distressingly small waft of selfpreserving relief i told you to tell them we were out of bane kist said they came in reeking of it we did sir the waiter protested taking a step back as kist pulled entirely away from me but they coerced tarra into admitting there was some in the back and she gave it to them kists annoyance turned into anger who gave tarra the upstairs i told her to work the lower floor until that were bite healed over kist worked at piscarys surprise surprise i hadnt thought the vamp had the presence of mind to do anything useful she convinced samuel to let her up there saying shed get better tips the waiter said sam kist said from between closed teeth emotion crossed him the first hints of coherent thoughts that didnt revolve around sex and blood surprising me full lips pressed together he scanned the floor all right pull everyone as if for a birthday and get her out of there before she sets them off cut off the bane complimentary desert for any who want it blond stubble catching the light he glanced up as if able to see through the ceiling to the noise upstairs the music was high again and jeff beck filtered down loser somehow it seemed to fit as they all slurred the lyrics together the wealthier patrons in the lower floor didnt seem to mind piscary will have my hide if we lose our a rating over a were bite kist said and as exciting as that might be i want to be able to walk tomorrow kists easy admission of his relationship with piscary took me aback but it shouldnt have though i always equated the giving and taking of blood with sex it wasnt especially if the exchange was between a living and an undead vampire the two held vastly different views probably because one had a soul and the other didnt the bottle the blood came in mattered to most living vamps they picked their partners with care usuallybut not alwaysfollowing their sexual gender preferences on the happy chance that sex might be included in the mix even when driven by hunger the giving and taking of blood often fulfilled an emotional need a physical affirmation of an emotional bond in much the same way that sex couldbut didnt always have to undead vampires were even more meticulous choosing their companions with the care of a serial killer seeking domination and emotional manipulation rather than commitment gender didnt enter into the equationthough the undead wouldnt turn down the addition of sex since it imparted an even more intense feeling of domination akin to rape even with a willing partner any relationship that grew from such an arrangement was utterly onesided though the bitee usually didnt accept it thinking their master was the exception to the rule it gave me pause that kist seemed eager for another encounter with piscary and i wondered as i glanced at the young vampire beside me if it was because kist received a large measure of strength and status by being his scion unaware of my thoughts kist furrowed his brow in anger wheres sam he asked the kitchen sir his eye twitched kist looked at the waiter as if to say what are you waiting for and the man hurried away bottled water in hand ivy snuck up behind kist pulling him farther from me and you thought i was stupid for majoring in security instead of business management she said you sound almost responsible kisten be careful or youll ruin your reputation kist smiled to show his sharp canines the air of harried restaurant manager falling from him the perks are great ivy love he said curving a hand around her backside with a familiarity she tolerated for an instant before hitting him you ever need a job come see me shove it up your ass kist he laughed dropping his head for an instant before bringing his sly gaze back to mine a group of waiters and waitresses were headed up the wide stairway clapping in time and singing some asinine song it looked annoying and innocuous nothing like the rescue mission it really was my eyebrows rose kist was good at this almost as if reading my mind he leaned close im even better in bed love he whispered his breath sending a delicious dart of sensation down to the pit of my being he shifted out of my reach before i could push him away and still smiling walked off halfway to the kitchen he turned to see if i was watching which i was hell everything female in the placealive dead or in betweenwas watching i pulled my attention from him to find a curiously closed look on ivy you arent afraid of him anymore she said flatly no i said surprised to find i wasnt i think its because he can do something other than flirt she looked away kist can do a lot of things he gets off on being dominated but when it comes to business hell slam you to the ground soon as look at you piscary wouldnt have a fool for a scion no matter how good he is to bleed her lips pressed together until they went white tables ready i followed her gaze to the single empty table against the far wall away from the windows glenn and jenks had joined us when kist left and as a group we wove through the tables settling on the halfcircle bench with all our backs to the wallinderlander human inderlanderand waited for the waiter to find us jenks had perched himself on the low chandelier and the light coming through his wings made green and gold spots on the table glenn silently took everything in clearly trying not to look nonplussed at the sight of the scarred wellputtogether waiters and waitresses whether male or female they were all young with smiling eager faces that had me on edge ivy didnt say anything more about kist for which i was grateful it was embarrassing how quickly vamp pheromones acted on me turning get lost to get over here thanks to the excessive amount of vamp saliva the demon pumped into me while trying to kill me my resistance to vamp pheromones was almost nil glenn carefully put his elbows on the table you havent told me how class went jenks laughed it was hell on earth two hours of nonstop nitpicking and putdowns my mouth dropped open how do you know that i snuck back in what did you do to that woman rachel kill her cat my face burned knowing jenks had witnessed it made it worse the woman is a hag i said glenn if you want to string her up for killing those people you go right ahead she already knows shes a suspect the is was there stirring her into a tizzy i didnt find anything that remotely resembled possible motive or guilt glenn pulled his arms from the table and sat back nothing i shook my head just that dan had an interview after fridays class im thinking that was the big news he was going to spring on sara jane he dropped all his classes friday night jenks said just made the adddrop with a full refund must have done it by email i squinted up at the pixy sitting by the lightbulbs to stay warm how do you know his wings blurred to nothing and he grinned i checked out the registrars office during class break you think the only reason i went was to look pretty on your shoulder ivy drummed her fingernails you three arent going to talk shop all night are you ivy girl came a strong voice and we all looked up a short spare man in a cooks apron was making a beeline for us from across the restaurant weaving gracefully through the tables my ivy girl he called over the noise back already and with friends i glanced at ivy surprised to see a faint blush coloring her pale cheeks ivy girl ivy girl jenks said from on high what the hell is that ivy rose to give him an embarrassedlooking hug as he halted before us making an odd picture since he was nearly six inches smaller than she was he returned it with a fatherly pat on the back my eyebrows rose she hugged him the cooks black eyes glittered in what looked like pleasure the scent of tomato paste and blood drifted to me he was clearly a practicing vamp i couldnt tell yet if he was dead hi piscary ivy said as she sat and jenks and i exchanged looks this was piscary one of cincinnatis most powerful vamps id never seen such an innocuous looking vampire piscary was actually an inch or two shorter than i was and he carried his slight wellproportioned build with a comfortable ease his nose was narrow and his widespaced almondshaped eyes and thin lips added to his exotic appearance his eyes were very dark and they shone as he took his chefs hat off and tucked it behind his apron ties he kept his skull cleanshaven and his honeyamber skin glinted in the light from over our table the lightweight pale shirt and pants he wore might have been offtherack but i doubted it they gave him the air of comfortable middle class his eager smile enforcing the picture in my mind piscary ran much of the darker side of cincinnati but looking at him i wondered how my usual healthy distrust of undead vamps sank to a wary caution piscary i asked as in pizza piscarys the vampire smiled showing his teeth they were longer than ivyshe was a true undeadand looked very white next to his dusky completion yes pizza piscarys is mine his voice was deep for such a small frame and it seemed to carry the strength of sand and wind the faint remnants of an accent made me wonder how long he had been speaking english ivy cleared her throat jerking my attention away from his quick dark eyes somehow the sight of his teeth hadnt instilled my usual kneejerk alarm piscary ivy said this is rachel morgan and jenks my business associates jenks had flitted down to the hotpepper shakers and piscary gave him a nod before turning to me rachel morgan he said slowly and with care ive been waiting for my ivy girl to bring you to see me i think shes afraid ill tell her she cant play with you anymore his lips curved into a smile im charmed i held my breath as he took my hand with a high gentility that stood in sharp contrast to his looks he lifted my fingers bringing them close to his lips his dark eyes were fixed on mine my pulse quickened but i felt as if my heart were somewhere else he inhaled over my hand as if scenting the blood humming within them i stifled a shiver by clenching my jaw piscarys eyes were the color of black ice i boldly returned his gaze intrigued at the hints beyond their depths it was piscary who looked away first and i quickly pulled my hand from him he was good really good he had used his aura to charm rather than frighten only the old ones could do that and there hadnt been even a twinge from my demon scar i didnt know whether to take that as a good sign or bad laughing goodnaturedly at my sudden obvious suspicion piscary sat down on the bench beside ivy as three waiters struggled to get by with round platters glenn didnt seem at all upset ivy hadnt introduced him and jenks kept his mouth shut my shoulder pressed into glenn as he shoved me down until i was nearly hanging off the edge to make room for piscary you should have told me you were coming piscary said id have saved you a table ivy shrugged we got one okay half turning piscary looked to the bar and shouted bring up a bottle of red from the tamwood cellar a sly grin came over him your mother wont miss one glenn and i exchanged a worried look a bottle of red uh ivy i questioned oh good god she said its wine relax relax i thought easier said than done with my rear hanging half off the seat and surrounded by vampires have you ordered piscary asked ivy but his gaze was on me suffocating i have a new cheese that uses a justdiscovered species of mold to age all the way from the alps yes ivy said an extra large with everything but onions and peppers he finished showing his teeth in a wide smile as he turned from me to her my shoulders slumped as his gaze left me he looked like nothing more than a friendly pizza chef and it was setting off more alarm bells than if he had been tall thin and slunk about seductively in lace and silk ha he barked and i stifled my jump im going to make you dinner ivy girl ivy smiled to look like a tenyearold thank you piscary id like that course you would something special something new on the house it will be my finest creation he said boldly i will name it after you and your shadow im not her shadow glenn said tightly shoulders hunched and his eyes on the table i wasnt talking about you piscary said and my eyes widened ivy stirred uneasily rachel isnt my shadow either she sounded guilty and an instant of confusion crossed the old vamps face really he said and ivy visibly tensed then what are you doing with her ivy girl she wouldnt look up from the table piscary caught my eye again my heart pounded as a faint tingle rippled across my neck at my demon bite suddenly the table was too crowded i felt pressed upon at all sides and the claustrophobic feeling beat at me shocked at the change my breath left me and i held the next one damn thats an interesting scar on your neck piscary said his voice seeming to scour my soul it hurt and felt good all at the same time is it vamp my hand rose unbidden to hide it jenkss wife had sewn me up and the tiny stitches were almost invisible i didnt like that he had noticed them its demon i said not caring if glenn told his dad i didnt want piscary thinking id been bitten by a vamp ivy or otherwise piscary arched his eyebrows in a mild surprise it looks vampiric so did the demon at the time i said my stomach tightening in the memory the old vamp nodded ah that would explain it he smiled chilling me a ravaged virgin whose blood has been left unclaimed what a delectable combination you are ms morgan no wonder my ivy girl has been hiding you from me my mouth opened but i could think of nothing to say he stood with no warning ill have your dinner out in a moment leaning to ivy he murmured talk to your mother she misses you ivy dropped her eyes with a casual grace piscary snagged a stack of plates and breadsticks from a passing tray enjoy your evening he said as he set them on our table he made his way back to the kitchen stopping several times to greet the more welldressed patrons i stared at ivy waiting for an explanation well i said bitingly you want to explain why piscary thinks im your shadow jenks snickered taking his handsonhips peter pan poseatop the pepper shaker ivy shrugged in obvious guilt he knows we live under the same roof he just assumed yeah i got it annoyed i chose a breadstick and slumped against the wall ivys and my arrangement was odd no matter what angle you looked at it she was trying to abstain from blood the lure to break her fast almost irresistible as a witch i could fend her off with my magic when her instincts got the better of her i had dropped her once with a charm and it was that memory that helped her master her cravings and keep her on her side of the hallway but what bothered me was that it was shame that made her let piscary believe what he wantedshame for turning her back on her heritage she didnt want it with a roommate she could lie to the world pretending she had a normal vamp life with a livein source of blood yet remain true to her guilty secret i told myself i didnt care that it protected me against other vamps but sometimes sometimes it rankled me that everyone assumed i was ivys toy my sulk was interrupted by the arrival of the wine slightly warm as most vamps liked it it had been opened already and ivy took control of the bottle avoiding my look as she poured three glasses jenks made do with the drop on the mouth of the bottle still peeved i settled back with my glass and watched the other guests i wouldnt drink it because the sulfur it broke down into tended to wreak havoc with me id have told ivy but it was none of her business it wasnt a witch thing just my own personal quirk that gave me headaches and made me so light sensitive that i had to hide in my room with a washcloth over my eyes it was an oddly related lingering remnant of a childhood affliction that had me in and out of the hospital until puberty kicked in id take the developed sulfur sensitivity any day in exchange for my misery as a child weak and sickly as my body tried to kill itself the music had started again and my unease at piscary slowly filtered away driven out by the music and background conversations everyone could ignore glenn now that piscary had talked to us the rattled human downed his wine as if it were water ivy and i exchanged glances as he refilled his glass with shaking hands i wondered if he was going to drink until he passed out or try to tough it out sober he took a sip of his next glass and i smiled he was going to split the difference glenn gave ivy a wary glance and leaned close to me how could you meet his eyes he whispered hard to hear above the surrounding noise werent you afraid hed bespell you the man is over three hundred years old i said realizing piscarys accent was old english if he wanted to bespell me he wouldnt have to look into my eyes face going sallow behind his short beard glenn pulled away leaving him to mull that around for a bit i jerked my head to get jenkss attention jenks i said softly why dont you take a quick peek in back check out the employees break room see whats up ivy topped her glass off piscary knows were here for a reason she said hell tell us what we want to know jenks will only get himself caught the small pixy bristled get turned tamwood he snarled why am i here if not to sneak around the day i cant evade a baker is the day i he cut his thought short uh he reiterated yeah ill be right back pulling a red bandanna from a back pocket he put it around his waist like a belt it was a pixys version of a white flag of truce a declaration to other pixies and fairies that he wasnt poaching should he stumble into anyones jealously guarded territory he buzzed off just below the ceiling headed for the kitchen ivy shook her head hes going to get caught i shrugged and edged the breadsticks closer they wont hurt him settling back i watched the contented people enjoy themselves thinking of nick and how long it had been since wed been out id started on my second breadstick when a waiter appeared already silent the table went expectant as he cleared away the crumbs and used plates the mans neck from behind the blue satin shirt was a mass of scars the newest still redrimmed and sore looking his smile at ivy was a little too eager a little too much like a puppy i hated it wondering what his dreams had been before he became someones plaything my demon bite tingled and my gaze roved across the crowded room to find piscary himself bringing our food heads turned as he passed drawn by the fabulous smell that had to be emanating from the elevated platter the level of conversation notably dropped piscary settled the platter before us an eager smile hovering about him his need for his cooking skills to be recognized looking odd on someone with so much hidden power i call it temeres need he said oh my god glenn said in disgust clear over the hush its got tomatoes on it ivy elbowed him in the gut hard enough to knock the wind out of him the room went silent except for the noise filtering down from upstairs and i stared at glenn uh how wonderful he wheezed sparing glenn a glance piscary cut it into wedges with a professional flourish my mouth watered at the smell of melted cheese and sauce that smells great i said admiringly my earlier distrust lulled by the prospect of food my pizzas never come out like this the short man raised his thin almost nonexistent eyebrows you use sauce from a jar i nodded then wondered how he knew ivy looked to the kitchen where is jenks he should be here for this my staff is playing with him piscary said lightly i imagine hell be out soon the undead vamp slid the first piece onto ivys plate then mine then glenns the fib detective pushed his plate away with one finger in disgust the other patrons whispered waiting to see our reaction to piscarys latest creation ivy and i immediately picked our slices up the smell of cheese was strong but not enough to hide the odor of spice and tomatoes i took a bite my eyes closed in bliss there was just enough tomato sauce to carry the cheese just enough cheese to carry the toppings i didnt care if it had brimstone on it it was so good oh burn me at the stake now i moaned chewing this is absolutely wonderful piscary nodded the light shining on his shaven head and you ivy girl ivy wiped her chin free of sauce its enough to come back from the dead for the man sighed ill rest easy this sunrise i slowed my chewing turning with everyone else to glenn he was sitting frozen between ivy and me his jaw clenched with a mix of determination and nausea uh he said glancing down at the pizza he swallowed looking as if the nausea was winning out piscarys smile vanished and ivy glared at him eat it she said loud enough for the entire restaurant to hear and start at the point not the crust i warned him glenn licked his lips it has tomatoes on it he said and my lips pursed this was exactly what i had been hoping to avoid one would think we had asked him to eat live grubs dont be an ass ivy said caustically if you really think the t angel virus skipped forty tomato generations and appeared in an entirely new species for your benefit ill ask piscary to bite you before we leave that way you wont die but just turn vamp glenn scanned the waiting faces realizing he was going to have to eat some pizza if he wanted to walk out under his own power visibly swallowing he awkwardly picked the slice up his eyes screwed up and he opened his mouth the noise from upstairs seemed loud as everyone downstairs watched their breath held he took a bite his face distorting wildly the cheese made twin bridges from him to the pizza he chewed twice before his eyes cracked open his jaw slowed he was tasting it now his eye caught mine and i nodded slowly he pulled the pizza away until the cheese separated yes piscary leaned to put his expressive hands atop the table genuinely interested in what a human thought of his cooking glenn was probably the first in four decades to sample it the mans face was slack he swallowed uh he grunted from around a partially full mouth its uh good he looked shocked its really good the restaurant seemed to heave a sigh piscary straightened to all of his short height clearly delighted as the conversations started up with a new excited edge to them youre welcome here anytime fib officer he said and glenn froze clearly worried that he had been made piscary grabbed a chair behind him and swung it around hunched over the table across from us he watched us eat now he said as glenn lifted the cheese to look at the tomato sauce under it you didnt come here for dinner what can i do for you ivy set her pizza down and reached for her wine im helping rachel find a missing person she said flicking her long hair needlessly back one of your employees trouble ivy girl piscary asked his resonate voice surprisingly gentle with regret i took a sip of wine thats what we want to find out mr piscary its dan smather piscarys few wrinkles folded into a soft frown as he gazed at ivy with telltale motions so slight they were almost undetectable she fidgeted her eyes both worried and defiant my attention jerked to glenn he was pulling the cheese off his pizza appalled i watched him gingerly pile it into a mound can you tell us the last time you saw him mr piscary the man asked clearly more interested in denuding his pizza than our questioning certainly piscary eyed glenn his brow furrowed as if not sure whether to be insulted or pleased as the man ate the pizza now nothing more than bread and tomato sauce it was early saturday morning after work but dan isnt missing he quit my face went slack in surprise it lasted for three heartbeats then my eyes narrowed in anger it was starting to fall together and the puzzle was a lot smaller than i had thought a big interview dropping his classes quitting his job standing his girlfriend up at a we have to talk dinner my eyes flicked to glenn and he gave me a brief disgusted look as he came to the same conclusion dan hadnt disappeared he had gotten a good job and ditched his smalltown girlfriend pushing my glass away i fought off a feeling of depression he quit i said the innocuouslooking vamp looked over his shoulder to the front door as a rowdy group of young vamps swirled in and what looked like the entire wait staff flocked to them with loud calls and hugs dan was one of my best drivers he said im going to miss him but i wish him luck he said it was what he was going to school for the slight man brushed the flour from the front of his apron security maintenance i think he said i exchanged weary looks with glenn ivy straightened on the bench her usual aloof mien looking strained a sick feeling went through me i didnt want to be the one to tell sara jane she had been dumped dan had gotten a career job and cut all his old ties the cowardly sack of crap i would have bet he had a second girlfriend on the side he was probably hiding out at her place letting sara jane think he was dead in an alley and laughing as she fed his cat piscary shrugged his entire body moving with the slight motion if i had known he was good at security i might have made him a better offer though it would be hard to give more than mr kalamack im just a simple restaurant owner at trents name i started kalamack i said he got a job with trent kalamack piscary nodded as ivy sat stiffly on the bench her pizza sitting untouched but for the first bite yes he said apparently his girlfriend works for mr kalamack too i believe her name is sara you might want to check with her if you are looking for him his longtoothed smile went devious shes probably the one that got him the job if you know what i mean i knew what he meant but from the sound of it sara jane hadnt my heart pounded and i started to sweat i knew it trent was the witch hunter he lured dan with a promise of employment and probably nacked him when dan tried to back out realizing what side of the law trent worked it was him damn him back to the turn i had known it thanks mr piscary i said wanting to leave so i could start cooking up some spells that night my stomach tightened the pleasant slurry of pizza and my gulp of wine going sour in my excitement trent kalamack i thought bitterly you are mine ivy set her empty wineglass onto the table i met her eyes triumphantly my pleased emotion faltering as she watched herself refill it she never ever drank more than one glass rightly concerned about lowered inhibitions my thoughts went back to how she had flaked out in the kitchen after i told her i was going after trent again rachel ivy said her gaze fixed on the wine i know what youre thinking let the fib handle it or give it to the is glenn stiffened but remained silent the memory of her fingers around my neck made it easy for me to find a flat tone ill be fine i said piscary rose his bare head coming below the hanging light come see me tomorrow ivy girl we need to talk that same wash of fear that i saw in her yesterday swept her something was going on that i wasnt aware of and it wasnt something good ivy and i were going to have to have a talk too piscarys shadow fell over me and i looked up my expression froze he was too close and the smell of blood overwhelmed the sharp tang of tomato sauce his black eyes fixed to mine something shifted as sudden and unexpected as ice cracking the old vamp never touched me but a delicious tingle raced through me as he exhaled my eyes widened in surprise his whisper of breath followed his thoughts through my being backwashing into a warm wave that soaked into me like water through sand his thoughts touched the pit of my soul and rebounded as he whispered something unheard my breath caught as the scar on my neck suddenly throbbed in time with my pulse shocked i sat unmoving as trails of promised ecstasy raced from it a sudden need pulled my eyes wide and my breath came fast piscarys intent gaze was knowing as i took another breath holding it against the hunger swelling in me i didnt want blood i wanted him i wanted him to pull upon my neck to savagely pin me to the wall to force my head back and draw the blood from me to leave behind a swelling sensation of ecstasy that was better than sex it beat upon my resolve demanding i respond i sat stiffly unable to move my pulse pounding his potent gaze flowed down my neck i shuddered at the sensation as my stance shifted inviting him the pull grew worse tantalizingly insistant his eyes caressed my demon bite my eyes slipped shut at the tendrils of aching promise if he would just touch mei ached for even that my hand crept unbidden to my neck abhorrence and blissful intoxication warred within me drowned out by a hurting need show me rachel i felt his voice chime through me wrapped in the thought was compulsion beautiful beautiful thoughtless compulsion my need shifted to anticipation i would have it all and moresoon warm and content i traced a fingernail from my ear to my collarbone poised on the brink of a shudder as my fingernail bumped over each and every scar the hum of conversation was gone we were alone wrapped in a muzzy swirl of expectation he had bespelled me i didnt care god help me it felt so good rachel ivy whispered and i blinked my hand was resting against my neck i could feel my pulse lifting rhythmically against it the room and the loud noise snapped back into existence with a painful rush of adrenaline piscary was kneeling before me one hand upon mine as he looked up his pupilblack gaze was sharp and clear as he inhaled tasting my breath as it flowed back through him yes he said as i pulled my hand from his my stomach in knots my ivy girl has been most careless almost panting i stared at my knees pushing my sudden fear down to mix with my fading craving for his touch the demon scar on my neck gave a final pulse and faded my held breath escaped me in soft sound it carried a hint of longing and i hated myself for it in a motion of smooth grace he stood i stared at him seeing and loathing his understanding of what he had done to me piscarys power was so intimate and certain that the thought i could stand against it rightly never occurred to him beside him kist looked like a child even when borrowing his masters abilities how could i ever be afraid of kisten again glenns eyes were wide and uncertain i wondered if everyone knew what had happened ivys fingers gripped the stem of her empty wineglass her knuckles white with pressure the old vamp leaned close to her this isnt working ivy girl you either get control of your pet or i will ivy didnt answer sitting with that same frightened desperate expression still shaking i was in no position to remind them that i wasnt a possession piscary sighed looking like a tired father jenks flitted erratically to our table with a faint whine what the hell am i here for he snarled as he landed on the salt shaker and started brushing himself off what smelled like cheese dust sifted down to the table and there was sauce on his wings i could be home in bed pixies sleep at night you know but noooo he drawled i had to volunteer for babysitting rachel give me some of your wine do you know how hard it is to get tomato sauce out of silk my wife is gonna kill me he stopped his harangue realizing no one was listening he took in ivys distressed expression and my frightened eyes what the turn is going on he said belligerently and piscary drew back from the table tomorrow the old vamp said to ivy he turned to me and nodded his goodbye jenks looked from me to ivy and back again did i miss something nine wheres my money bob i whispered as i dropped the stinky pellets into ivys bathtub jenks had sent his brood out to the nearest park yesterday to bring back a handful of fish food for me the pretty fish gulped at the surface and i washed the smell of fish oil off my hands fingers dripping i looked at ivys perfectly arranged pink towels after a moment of hesitation i dried my hands then smoothed them out so she couldnt tell id used one i spent a moment trying to arrange my hair under my leather cap then strode out into the kitchen boots thumping my eyes went to the clock above the sink fidgeting i went to the fridge opening it to stare at nothing where the devil was glenn rachel ivy muttered from her computer stop youre giving me a headache i shut the fridge and leaned against the counter he said hed be here at one oclock so hes late she said one finger on the computer screen as she jotted down an address an hour i exclaimed cripes i could have been out to the fib and back by now ivy clicked to a new page if he doesnt show ill loan you bus fare i turned back to the window and the garden thats not why im waiting for him i said even though it was yeah right she clicked her pen open and shut so fast it almost hummed why dont you make us some breakfast while you wait i bought toaster waffles sure i said feeling a tug of guilt i wasnt in charge of breakfastjust dinnerbut seeing as we ate out last night i felt i owed her something the deal was ivy did the grocery shopping if i made supper originally the arrangement had been to keep me from running into assassins at the store and creating a new meaning to the phrase cleanup in aisle three but now ivy didnt want to cook and refused to renegotiate just as well the way things were going i wouldnt have enough for a can of spam by weeks end and rent was due sunday i opened the door to the freezer and pushed aside the halfempty cartons of ice cream to find the frozen waffles the box hit the counter with a hard clunk yum yum ivy gave me a raised eyebrow look when i struggled to open the damp cardboard soooo she drawled as i dug my red nails into the top and tore it completely off when the handydandy pulltab broke when are they coming to get the fish my eyes darted to mr fish swimming in his brandy snifter on the kitchen windowsill the one in my bathtub she added oh i exclaimed flushing well her chair creaked as she leaned back rachel rachel rachel she lectured ive told you before you have to get the money up front before the run angry that she was right i jammed two waffles into the toaster and shoved them down they popped back up and i smacked them down again it wasnt my fault i said the stupid fish was never missing and no one bothered to tell me but ill have the rent by monday promise its due sunday there was a distant pounding at the front door theres glenn i said striding out of the kitchen before she could say anything more boots clattering i went down the hall and into the empty sanctuary come on in glenn i shouted voice echoing against the distant ceiling the door remained shut so i pushed it open stopping short in surprise nick hey hi he said his lanky height looking awkward on the wide stoop his long face was slack in question and his thin eyebrows were high tossing his black enviably straight bangs from his eyes he asked whos glenn a smile quirked the corners of my mouth at his hint of jealousy eddens son nicks face went empty and i grinned grabbing his arm and pulling him inside hes an fib detective were working together oh the volume of emotion behind that one word was better than a years worth of dates nick edged past me his sneakers hushed on the wooden floor his blue plaid shirt was tucked into his jeans and i caught him before he made it to the sanctuary pulling him back into the dark foyer the skin about his neck almost seemed to glow in the dusk nicely tanned and so smooth it begged for my fingers to trace the outline of his shoulders wheres my kiss i complained the worried look pinching his eyes vanished giving me a lopsided smile he put his long hands about my waist sorry he said you kind of threw me there aw i gently kidded him whatre you worried about mmmm he ran his gaze down me and back up plenty eyes almost black in the dim light he pulled me closer sending the smell of musty books and new electronics to fill my senses i tilted my head up to find his lips a warm feeling starting in my middle oh yeah this was how i liked to start my day being narrow of shoulders and somewhat spare nick didnt exactly fit the whiteknightonahorse mold but he had saved my life by binding an attacking demon leading me to think a brainy man could be as sexy as a muscular one it was a thought that solidified to fact the first time nick had gallantly asked if he could kiss me then left me breathless and pleasantly shocked after id said yes but by saying he wasnt musclebound i didnt mean nick was a weakling his lanky build was surprisingly strong as i learned the time we wrestled over the last spoon of chunky monkey and broke ivys lamp and he was athletic in a lean sort of way his long legs able to keep up with me whenever i coerced him into driving me out to the zoo for their early open hours for runners only those hills were killers on the calves nicks strongest appeal though was that his relaxed flowwiththepunches exterior hid a wickedly quick almost frightening mind his thoughts jumped faster than mine taking them places id never think to go threat brought quick decisive action with little regard to future consequences and he wasnt afraid of anything it was the last that i both admired and worried about he was a magicusing human he should be afraid of a lot and he wasnt but best of all i thought as i eased myself against him he didnt care one whit that i wasnt human his lips were soft against mine with a comfortable familiarity not a hint of a beard ruined our kiss my hands linked behind his waist and i tugged him suggestively into me off balance we shifted until my back hit the wall our kiss broke as i felt his lips curl against mine in a smile at my forwardness you are a wicked wicked witch he whispered you know that dont you i came over here to give you the tickets and here you are getting me all bothered his bangs were a soft whisper against my fingertips yeah you probably ought to do something about that i will his grip on me loosened but youre just going to have to wait his hand ran a deliciously light path across my backside as he stepped away is that a new perfume playful mood faltering i turned away yes i had thrown my cinnamon scent out that morning ivy hadnt said a word upon finding the thirtydollaranounce bottle making our trash smell like christmas it had failed me i hadnt the stomach to wear it again rachel it was the beginning of a familiar argument and i stiffened being in the unusual circumstances of having been raised in the hollows nick knew more about vamps and their scenttriggered hungers than i did im not moving out i said flatly could you just he hesitated his long pianist hands moving in short jerky motions to show his frustration as he saw my jaw clench were doing okay im very careful guilt for having not told him she had pinned me against the kitchen wall pulled my eyes down he sighed his narrow body shifting here he twisted to reach into his back pocket you hold the tickets i lose everything that lays around longer than a week remind me to keep moving then i quipped to lighten the mood as i took them i glanced down at the seat numbers third row fantastic i dont know how you do it nick he flashed his teeth in a pleased smile the hint of cunning swelling in his eyes hed never tell me where hed gotten them nick could find anything and if he couldnt he knew someone who could i had a feeling the guarded wariness he showed to authority stemmed from here in spite of myself i found this as yet unexplored part of nick deliciously daring and as long as i didnt know for sure do you want some coffee i asked shoving the tickets into my pocket nick glanced past me into the empty sanctuary ivy still here i said nothing and he read my answer in the silence she really does like you i lied no thanks he shifted to the door ivy and nick didnt get along i hadnt a clue why ive got to get back to work im on lunch break disappointment slumped my shoulders okay nick worked fulltime at the museum at eden park cleaning artifacts when he wasnt moonlighting at the university library helping them catalog and move their more sensitive volumes to a more secure location i thought it amusing that our breakin to the universitys ancientbook locker was probably what prompted the move i was sure nick had taken the job so he could borrow the very tomes they were trying to safeguard he was working both jobs until the end of the month and i knew it left him tired he turned to leave and i reached after him with a sudden thought hey you still have my largest spell pot dont you wed used it for making chili three weeks ago for a dirty harry marathon at his place and id never brought it back he hesitated his hand on the door latch you need it edden is making me take a ley line class i said not wanting to tell him that i was working on the witch hunter murders not yet i wasnt going to ruin that kiss with an argument i need a familiar or the witch will flunk me that means the big spell pot oh he was silent and i wondered if he was going to figure it out anyway sure he said slowly tonight soon enough when i nodded he added okay see you then thanks nick bye pleased i had wrangled a promise to see him tonight i pushed the door open stopping halfway when a masculine voice called out in protest i looked to find glenn on the stoop juggling three sacks of fast food and a tray of drinks glenn i exclaimed reaching for the drinks there you are come on in this is nick my boyfriend nick this is detective glenn nick my boyfriend yeah i liked that shifting the sacks to one hand glenn extended his hand how do you do he said formally still outside he was dressed in a sharplooking gray suit making nicks casual clothes seem untidy my eyebrows rose at nicks hesitation before shaking glenns hand i was positive it was because of glenns fib badge dont want to know dont want to know nice to meet you nick said then turned to me ill uh see you tonight rachel kay bye it sounded a bit forlorn even to me and nick shifted from foot to foot before leaning forward to give me a kiss on the corner of my mouth i thought it was more to prove his boyfriend status than any attempt to show affection whatever sneakers silent nick hastened down the steps to his saltrusted blue pickup at the curb i felt a wash of worry at his hunched shoulders and stilted pace glenn too was watching but his expression was more curious than anything else come on in i repeated as i eyed the sacks of food and shifted the door wider glenn took his sunglasses off one hand tucking them into the inner breast pocket of his suit with his athletic build and tidy beard he looked like a preturn secret service guy thats nick sparagmos he asked as nick drove away the one who was a rat my hackles rose at how he had said it as if turning into a rat or mink was morally wrong i put a hand on my hip the tray of drinks tilting dangerously close to spilling ice and soda pop obviously his dad had told him more of the story than glenn had let on youre late i stopped to get us all lunch he said stiffly mind if i come in i fell back and he crossed the threshold he hooked the door with his foot closing it with a tug behind him the smell of fries became overpowering in the sudden dusk in the foyer thats a nice little outfit he said how long did it take you to paint it on affronted i looked down at my leather pants and the red silk blouse tucked into them wearing leather before sunset had worried me until ivy convinced me that the high quality of the leather i bought elevated the look from white witch trash to wealthy witch class she ought to know but i was still sensitive to it this is what i wear to work i snapped it saves on skin grafts if i have to run and end up sliding on pavement got a problem with it keeping his comments to a noncommittal grunt he followed me to the kitchen ivy looked up from her map silently taking in the burger bags and drinks well she drawled i see you survived the pizza i could still have piscary bite you if you want my mood lifted at glenns suddenly closed expression he made an ugly noise deep in his throat and i went to put the frozen waffles away seeing that the toaster hadnt been plugged in you scarfed down that pizza fast enough last night i said admit it you liiiiiked it i ate it to stay alive motions sharp he stood at the table and pulled the bags to him seeing a tall black man in an expensive suit and shoulder holster unpacking paperwrapped food made an odd picture i went home and prayed to the porcelain god for two hours straight he added and ivy and i exchanged amused looks pushing her work aside ivy took the burger that was the most unsquished and the fullest envelope of fries i slouched into a chair beside glenn he moved to the end of the table not even trying to make it look casual thanks for breakfast i said eating a fry before unwrapping my burger with a rustle of paper he hesitated his death grip on his fib officer persona loosening as he undid the lowest button to his jacket and sat the fib is paying for it actually this is my breakfast too i didnt get home until the sun was almost up you put in a long day his faint tone of acceptance eased my shoulders another notch not really it just starts about six hours later than yours wanting ketchup for my fries i levered myself up and went to the fridge i hesitated in my reach for the red bottle ivy caught my eye shrugging after i pointed to it yeah i thought he was invading our lives he ate the pizza last night why should ivy and i suffer because of him that decided i pulled it out and set the bottle on the table with a bold thump much to my disappointment glenn didnt notice so ivy said reaching across the table and taking the ketchup youre going to babysit rachel today dont take her on the bus they wont stop for her he glanced up starting as ivy laced her burger with the red sauce uh he blinked clearly having lost his thought his eyes were fixed upon the ketchup yes im going to show her what we have so far on the murders a smile quirked the corner of my mouth at a sudden thought hey ivy i said lightly pass me the clotted blood not missing a beat she pushed the bottle across the table glenn froze oh my god he whispered harshly his face going sallow ivy snickered and i laughed relax glenn i said as i squirted ketchup over my fries i lounged in my chair giving him a sly look as i ate one its ketchup ketchup he pulled his paper place mat with his food closer are you insane nearly the same stuff you were slurping last night ivy said i pushed the bottle toward him it wont kill you try some his eyes riveted to the red plastic glenn shook his head his neck was stiff and he pulled his food closer no aw come on glenn i coaxed dont be a squish i was kidding about the blood whats the point of having a human over if you cant jerk him around a little he stayed sullen eating his burger as if it were a chore not an enjoyable experience but without ketchup it might be a job look i said persuasively as i edged closer and turned the bottle around heres whats in it tomatoes corn syrup vinegar salt i hesitated frowning hey ivy did you know they put onion and garlic powder in ketchup she nodded wiping a stray bit of ketchup off the corner of her mouth glenn looked interested leaning closer to read the fine print above my freshly painted nail why he asked whats wrong with onions and garlic he got a knowing look in his brown eyes and settled back ah he said wisely garlic dont be stupid i set the bottle down garlic and onions have a lot of sulfur so do eggs they give me migraines mmmm glenn said smugly as he picked the ketchup bottle up between two fingers to read the label for himself whats natural flavors you dont want to know ivy said her voice pitched dramatically glenn set the bottle down i couldnt help my snort of amusement the sound of an approaching motorcycle pulled ivy to her feet thats my ride she said crumpling her wrapper and pushing her halfeaten carton of fries to the middle of the table she stretched her lanky body reaching for the ceiling glenn ran his attention over her then looked away my gaze met ivys it sounded like kists cycle i wondered if this had anything to do with last night seeing my apprehension ivy grabbed her purse thanks for breakfast glenn she turned to me see you later rachel she added as she breezed out shoulders easing glenn looked at the clock above the sink then went back to eating i was scraping the last of the ketchup up with a fry as ivys demand filtered in from the street go turn yourself kist im driving i smiled as the bike accelerated and the street grew quiet finished i crumpled my paper into a ball and stood glenn wasnt done and as i cleared the table i left the ketchup from the corner of my sight i watched him eye it its good on burgers too i said dropping to crouch beside the island counter and pick out a spell book there was the sound of sliding plastic book in hand i turned to find he had pushed the bottle away he wouldnt meet my eyes as i sat down at the table mind if i check on something before we leave i asked opening to the index go ahead his voice had turned cold again and deciding it was the spell book i sighed and leaned over the faded print i want to stir a spell for the howlers to change their mind about not paying me i said hoping he would relax if he knew what i was doing i thought i might pick up what i dont have in the garden while im out you dont mind an extra stop do you no it was marginally less cold and i took that as a good sign he was noisily stirring the ice with his straw and i purposely edged closer so he could see look i said pointing at the blurring print i was right if i want to send their pop flies foul i need a noncontact spell for an earth witch such as myself noncontact meant wands id never made one before but my eyebrows rose at the ingredients i had everything but the fern seed and the wand how much could a dowel of redwood cost why do you do it his voice had a touch of belligerence and blinking i closed the book disappointed i went to put it away turning to face him with my back against the island counter make spells its what i do im not going to hurt anyone not with a spell anyway glenn set his supersized cup down his dark fingers loosened their grip and slid away leaning back in his chair he hesitated no he said how can you live with someone like that ready to explode with no warning oh i reached for my drink you just caught her on a bad day she doesnt like your dad and she took it out on you and you did ask for it dickhead i slurped the last of my drink and threw the cup away ready i said as i got my bag and coat from a chair glenn stood and adjusted his suit coat before crossing in front of me to throw his stuff away under the sink she wants something he said and every time she looks at you i see guilt whether she means to or not shes going to hurt you and she knows it affronted i gave him an upanddown look shes not hunting me trying to keep a lid on my anger i headed down the hallway at a fast pace glenn was close his hardsoled shoes a heartbeat behind mine are you telling me yesterday was the first time she attacked you my lips pursed and the thumps of my boots went all the way up my spine there had been lots of almosts before i figured out what pushed her buttons and quit doing it glenn said nothing clearly hearing the answer in my silence listen he said as we emerged into the sanctuary i may have looked like the dumb human last night but i was watching piscary bespelled you easier than blowing out a candle she pulled you from him by simply saying your name that cant be normal and he called you her pet is that what you are it sure looks like it to me im not her pet i said she knows it i know it piscary can think what he wants shoving my arms into my coat i pushed my way out of the church and stormed down the steps his car was locked and i yanked at the handle angry i waited for him to unlock it and its none of your business i added the fib detective was silent as he opened his door then paused to look at me over the roof of the car he put on his shades hiding his eyes youre right its not my business the door unlocked and i got in slamming it to make the car shake glenn slid softly in behind the wheel and shut his door damn right it isnt your business i muttered in the closeness of his car you heard her last night im not her shadow she wasnt lying when she said that i also heard piscary say if she didnt get control of you he would a flash of real fear tightened me unwanted and unsettling im her friend i asserted all she wants is a friend that isnt after her blood ever think of that a pet rachel he said softly as he started the car i said nothing tapping my fingers on the armrest i wasnt ivys pet and not even piscary could make her turn me into one ten the late september afternoon sun was warm through my leather jacket as i rested my arm on the cars window the tiny vial of salt on my charm bracelet shifted in the wind to clink against my wooden cross and reaching out i adjusted the side mirror to watch the traffic hanging a car length behind it was nice to have a vehicle at my beck and call wed be at the fib in fifteen minutes not the forty it would take by bus afternoon traffic and all take a right at the next light i said pointing i watched in disbelief as glenn drove straight through the intersection what the turn is wrong with you i exclaimed i have yet to get in this car and you go where i want you to glenns expression was smug behind his sunglasses shortcut he grinned his teeth startlingly white it was the first real smile i had seen on him and it took me aback sure i said waving a hand in the air show me your shortcut i doubted it would be faster but i wasnt going to say anything not after that smile my head turned to follow a familiar sign on one of the passing buildings hey stop i shouted spinning halfway around in my seat its a charm shop glenn checked behind him and made an illegal uturn i gripped the top of the window as he made another pulling up right before the shop and parking at the curb i opened the door and grabbed my bag ill just be a minute i said and he nodded moving his seat backward and leaning his head against the headrest leaving him to nap i strode into the shop the bells above the door jingled and i took a slow breath feeling myself relax i liked charm shops this one smelled like lavender dandelion and the bite of chlorophyll bypassing the readymade spells i went straight to the back where the raw materials were may i help you i looked up from a posy of bloodroot to find a tidy eager salesman leaning over the counter he was a witch by the smell of himthough it was hard to tell with all the scents in there yes i said im looking for fern seed and a dowel of redwood suitable for a wand ah he said triumphantly we keep our seeds right over here i paralleled his path from my side of the counter to a display of amber bottles he ran his fingers over them bringing down one the size of my pinky and extending it i wouldnt take it indicating he should put it on the counter he looked affronted as i dug about in my bag then held an amulet over the bottle i assure you maam he said stiffly its the highest quality i gave him a weak smile as the amulet glowed a faint green i was under a death threat this spring i explained you cant blame me for being cautious the doorbells jingled and i glanced back to see glenn come in the salesman brightened snapping his fingers and taking a step back youre rachel rachel morgan right i know you he pressed the bottle into my hands on the house so glad to see you survived what were the odds on you three hundred to one it was two hundred i said slightly offended i watched his gaze dart over my shoulder to glenn his smile freezing as he realized he was human hes with me i said and the man gasped trying to disguise it with a cough his eyes lingered on glenns halfhidden weapon the turn take it i missed my cuffs the wands are over here he said his tone giving me clear indication he didnt approve of my choice of companions we store them in a desiccation box to keep them fresh glenn and i followed him to a clear spot beside the cash register the man pulled a wooden box the size of a violin case out opened it and turned it with a flourish so i could see i sighed as the sent of redwood came rolling out my hand rose to touch them dropping as the salesman cleared his throat what spell are you stirring ms morgan he asked his tone going professional as he eyed me over his glasses the rims were wood and id bet my panties they were spelled to see through earth magic disguise charms i want to try a noncontact spell foroh breaking wood already under stress i said stifling a tinge of embarrassment any of the smaller ones will do he said his gaze shifting between glenn and me i nodded my eyes fixed upon the pencilsize wands how much nine hundred seventyfive he said but to you id sell it for nine dollars you know i said slowly i should make sure i have everything before i actually get the wand no sense having it lay around and pick up moisture before i need it the salesmans smile turned stiff of course in one smooth motion he snapped the case closed and tucked it away i winced withering inside how much for the fern seed i asked knowing his earlier offer had been made only because i was buying a wand fivefifty i had thati thought head bowed i dug about in my bag i had known wands were expensive but not that expensive money in hand i glanced up to find glenn eyeing a rack of stuffed rats as the salesman rang up my purchase glenn leaned close and still staring at the rats whispered what are those used for i have no idea i got my receipt and jammed everything in my bag trying to find a shred of dignity i headed for the door glenn trailing behind the bells jingled as we reached the pavement again in the sun i took a cleansing breath i wasnt going to spend nine hundred bucks to possibly get my fivehundreddollar fee glenn surprised me by opening the car door for me and as i settled in the seat he leaned against the frame of the open window ill be right back he said and strode inside he was out in a moment with a small white bag i watched him cross in front of the carwondering timing himself between the traffic he opened the door and slid in behind the wheel well i asked as he set the package between us what did you get glenn started the car and pulled out into traffic a stuffed rat oh i said surprised what the devil was he going to do with it even i didnt know what it was for i was dying to ask all the way to the fib building but managed to keep my mouth shut even as we slipped into the cold shade of their underground parking glenn had a reserved spot and my heels echoed as i found the pavement with the pained slowness i remembered from my dad glenn slowly unkinked himself as he got out and tugged the sleeves of his jacket down he reached back in for his rat and gestured to the stairs still silent i followed him into the concrete stairway we only had to go up one flight and he held the door for me as we went in the back door he took his shades off as we entered and i pushed my hair out of my eyes and under my cap the air conditioner was on and i looked over the small entryway thinking it was worlds away from the busy front lobby glenn plucked a visitor pass from behind a cluttered desk signing me in and giving the man on the phone a nod i clipped it on my lapel as i followed him to the openaired offices hi rose glenn said as he came to eddens secretary is captain edden available ignoring me the older woman put a finger on the paper she was typing from and nodded hes in a meeting want me to tell him youre here glenn took my elbow and started hustling me past her when he gets out no rush ms morgan and i will be here for the next few hours yes sir she said going back to her typing hours i thought not liking the way he hadnt let me talk to rose i wanted to find out what their dress code was the fib couldnt have that much information the is had primary jurisdiction of the crimes my office is over there glenn said pointing to the bank of offices with walls and a door that lined the cubicledivided space the few officers at their desks looked up from their paperwork as glenn almost pushed me forward i was getting the distinct impression that he didnt want anyone to know i was there nice i said sarcastically as he ushered me into his office the offwhite room was almost barren the dirt obvious in the corners a new computer screen sat on a nearly empty desk it had old speakers a nasty chair sat behind it and i wondered if there was a decent chair in the entire building the desk was laminated white but the grime embedded into it from past use made it almost gray there was nothing in the wire trash can beside it watch the phone lines glenn said as he swept past me and dropped his bagorat on the file cabinet his jacket came off and he meticulously hung it on a wooden hanger which then went on a hat tree looking over the ugly room i wondered what his apartment was like the twin phone lines from the jack behind the long table ran across the open floor to his desk it had to be an osha violation having them strung like that but if he didnt care if someone pulled his phone off the desk by tripping on it then why should i why dont you put your desk over there i asked looking at the papercluttered table in the logical spot for a desk standing hunched over his keyboard he looked up my back would be to the door and i wouldnt be able to see the main floor oh there were no knickknacks of any kindnothing of a personal nature at allthe single shelf holding only folders leaking papers it didnt look as if he had been here long light rectangular shadows showed where pictures had once hung the only thing on the walls besides his detective certificate was a dusty bulletin board with hundreds of sticky notes thumbtacked to it hanging right over that long table they were faded and curling with cryptic messages only glenn could probably decipher what are these i asked as he checked to see that the blinds on his window overlooking the open floor were closed notes from an old case im working on he had a preoccupied tone in his voice as he edged back to his keyboard and typed in a string of letters why dont you sit down i stood in the middle of his office staring at him where i finally asked he looked up reddening as he realized he was standing over the only chair ill be right back he moved around his desk coming to an awkward halt before me until i got out of his way his gait was stilted as he edged past me and strode out thinking his office was the most inhospitable slice of fib bureaucracy i had seen yet i took off my hat and coat hanging them on the nail sticking out from the back of his door bored i wandered to his desk a welcome screen with a blinking prompt waited a rattle preceded glenn as he pushed a rolling swivel chair into his office giving me an apologetic look he set it next to his i dropped my bag on his barren desk and sat beside him leaning forward to see i watched him type in three passwords dolphin tulip and monica old girlfriend i wondered they showed up on the screen as asterisks but he was a twofingered typist and it wasnt hard to follow okay he said pulling to him a notepad with a list of names and id numbers i glanced at the first and looked back at the screen with a painful slowness he furrowed his brow and started to type them in tap pause tap tap oh just give me that i said pulling the keyboard close keys chattering happily i typed in the first then grabbed the mouse and clicked the all button making the only limit to the retrieval being those entries made in the last twelve months a query came on the screen and i hesitated which printer i asked glenn said nothing and i turned to see him leaning back in his chair with his arms crossed before him i bet you take the remote away from your boyfriend too he said pulling the keyboard back in front of him and reclaiming the mouse well its my tv i said hotly then added sorry actually it was ivys mine was lost in the big salt dip which was just as well since it would have looked like a toy next to ivys glenn made a small noise at the back of his throat he slowly typed the next name in checking it against the list before moving to the next i impatiently waited my eyes went to the crumpled bag on the file cabinet an inane desire to take the rat out filled me this must be why he had said wed be here for hours itd be faster to cut the letters out and paste them in a note thats not the same printer i said seeing he had switched them i didnt know you wanted to look at everything he said his voice preoccupied as he picked letters off the keyboard im sending the rest to the basements printer slowly he typed in the last string of numbers and hit enter i dont want to hear about tying this floors printer up he added i fought to hide a smirk didnt want to hear about it how much could there be glenn stood and i stared up at him ill get them stay put till i get back i nodded as he left swiveling my chair from side to side i waited listening to the background chatter coming in a smile eased over me i hadnt realized how much i missed the camaraderie of my fellow is runners i knew if i went out of glenns office the conversations would stop and the looks would go cold but if i stayed here and listened i could pretend someone might stop by to say hi or ask my opinion on a tough case or tell me a dirty joke to see me laugh sighing i rose to take glenns rat out of the bag i set the ugly beadyeyed thing on the cabinet where it could watch him a scuffing at the door pulled me around oh hi i said seeing that it wasnt glenn maam the heavy fib officer eyed first my leather pants then my visitors badge i shifted so he could see better the badge not my pants im rachel i said im helping detective glenn hes getting some printouts rachel morgan he said i thought you were an old hag my mouth opened in anger then shut in understanding the last time he saw me i probably did look like an old hag that was a disguise i said as i crumpled the bag and threw it away this is the real me he ran his eyes over my outfit again okay he turned to leave and i breathed easier he was gone when glenn strode in a decidedly preoccupied air about him there was a nicesize packet of paper in his grip and i thought the fibs information gathering must be on par with the is after all he stood for a moment in the center of his office then pushed the papers on his long table against the wall to one end heres the first one he said dropping the reports on the cleared spot ill be right back with the ones from the basement i froze in my reach for them the first one i had thought that was all of them i took a breath to ask him but he was gone the thickness of the report was impressive i wheeled my chair to the table and positioned it sideways so i wouldnt have my back to the door sitting i crossed my legs and pulled the wad of pages into my lap i recognized the front picture of the first victim because the is had released it to the papers she had been a nicelooking older woman with a motherly smile by the makeup and jewelry it looked like they lifted her photo from a professional picture like those poses you get for anniversaries and such she had been three months from retiring from a security firm that designed magicresistant safes died from complications from rape this was all old news i shuffled to the coroners report my gaze dropping to the picture my gut clenched and i flipped the report closed suddenly cold i stared out of glenns door to the open offices a phone rang and someone picked it up i took another breath and held it i forced myself to breathe holding it again so i wouldnt hyperventilate i suppose in a loose fashion it could be considered rape the womans insides had been pulled out from between her legs and were dangling to her knees i wondered how long she had stayed alive through the ordeal then wished i hadnt stomach turning i vowed to not look at any more pictures fingers shaking i tried to concentrate on the report the fib had been surprisingly through leaving me with only one question stretching i snagged the cordless phone from the desk my jaw hurt from having clenched it too long as i dialed the number listed for next of kin an older man answered no i assured him when he tried to hang up on me im not a dating service vampiric charms is an independent runner firm im currently working with the fib to identify the person who attacked your wife the picture of her lying twisted and broken on the gurney flashed before me i shoved it down to where it would probably stay until i tried to sleep i hoped he hadnt seen the picture i prayed he hadnt found her body i apologize for calling mr graylin i said in my best professional voice i have only one question did your wife happen to talk to a mr trent kalamack anytime before her death the councilman he said his voice thick with astonishment is he a suspect perish the thought i lied im following up one of the faint leads that we have concerning a stalker working his way up to him oh there was a moment of silence then yes as a matter of fact we did the zing of adrenaline pulled me upright we met him at a play this spring the man was saying i remember because it was the pirates of penzance and i thought the lead pirate looked like mr kalamack we had dinner afterwards at carew tower and laughed about it hes not in any danger is he no i said my heart pounding id ask you to keep our line of investigation quiet until weve proven it false im very sorry about your wife mr graylin she was a lovely woman thank you i miss her he hung up the phone in the uncomfortable silence i set the phone down waiting three heartbeats before whispering an exuberant yes spinning my swivel chair around i found glenn standing in the doorway what are you doing he asked dropping another stack of papers before me i grinned continuing to shift back and forth in my chair nothing he went to his desk and punched a button on the phones cradle frowning as the last number called appeared on the tiny screen i never said you could call these people his face went angry and his posture became stiff that man is trying to put this behind him he doesnt need you dredging it up for him again i only asked one question legs crossed i swiveled smiling glenn glanced behind him into the open offices you are a guest here he said roughly if you cant play by my rules he stopped why are you still smiling mr and mrs graylin had dinner with trent a month before she was attacked the man straightened to his full height and drew back a step his eyes narrowed mind if i call the next i asked he looked at the phone beside my hand then back to the open floor with a forced casualness he shut his door halfway keep it down pleased with myself i pulled the stack of papers closer glenn went back behind his computer typing with an annoying slowness my mood quickly sobered as i scanned the coroners report skipping the picture portion this time apparently the man had been eaten alive from the extremities inward they knew he had been alive at the time by the tearing pattern of the wounds and they were fairly confident he had been eaten by the lack of body parts trying to ignore the mental picture my imagination provided i called the contact number there was no answer not even a machine i called his former place of work next my intuition settling into a nice groove at the name of the place seary security the woman there was very nice but she didnt know anything telling me that mr searys wife was away at a health resort trying to relearn how to sleep she did look in her files though telling me that they had been contracted to install a safe on the kalamack estate security i murmured pinning mr searys packet to the bulletin board atop glenns sticky notes to get it out of my way hey glenn you have any more of those sticky notes he rummaged in his desk drawer tossing me a pack shortly followed by a pen i scrawled the name of mr searys workplace and stuck it to his report after a moments thought i did the same to the womans writing safe designer on it i added a second sticky note with talked to t circled in black ink a scuffing in the hallway brought my eyes up from the third report i made a noncommittal smile recognizing the overweight cop minibag of chips in hand he acknowledged me and glenns nod coming to a rest in the doorway glenns got you doing his secretary work he asked his goodoldboy tone almost thick enough to cut no i said smiling sweetly trent kalamack is the witch hunter and im just taking a moment to tie the links together he grunted eyeing glenn glenn wearily returned his look adding a shrug rachel he said this is officer dunlop dunlop this is ms morgan charmed i said not offering my hand lest i get it back covered in potatochip grease not getting the hint the man walked in crumbs falling to the tile floor whatcha got he said coming to peer at my thick reports stuck to the board atop glenns faded sticky notes too soon to say i pushed him out of my space with a finger in his gut excuse me he backed up but didnt leave going instead to see what glenn was doing heaven save me from cops on break the two talked over glenns suspicions concerning dr anders their rising and falling voices soothing i blew chip crumbs off my papers my pulse quickening as i saw that the third victim had worked at the city racetrack in weather control it was a very difficult field of work heavy in ley line magic the man had been pressed to death while working late stirring up a fall shower to dampen down the track for the next days race the actual implement of death was unknown there had been nothing in the stables heavy enough i didnt look at that picture either it had been at this point that the media realized the three deaths were connected despite the varying methods of death and named the sadistic freak the witch hunter a quick phone call got me his sister who said of course he knew trent kalamack that the councilman often called her brother to ask about the state of the track but that she hadnt heard if he had talked to mr kalamack before his death or not and that she was just sick about her brothers death and did i know how long it took for insurance checks to come in i finally got my condolences wedged in between her chattering and hung up on her everyone handled death differently but that was offensive did he know mr kalamack glenn asked yup i pinned the packet to the board and stuck a note to it with the words weather maintenance on it and his job is important because it takes a heckuva lot of ley line skill to manipulate the weather trent raises racehorses he could have easily been out there and talked to him and no one would have given it a second thought i added another note with knew t on it old dunlopthecop made an interested noise and ambled over he hung a respectful three feet behind me this time done with this one he asked fingering the first for now i said and he pulled it from the board some of glenns notes fluttered down to fall behind the table glenns jaw tightened feeling like someone was starting to take me seriously i sat straighter the overweight man ambled back to glenn making noises as he found the pictures he dropped the report onto glenns desk and i heard the patter of chip crumbs another officer came in and an impromptu meeting seemed to be taking shape as they clustered around glenns computer screen i turned my back on them and looked at the next report the fourth victim had been found in early august the papers had said the cause of death was severe blood loss what they hadnt said was that the man had been disemboweled torn apart as if ravaged by animals his boss had found him in the basement of his workplace still alive and trying to push his insides back into him where they belonged it was more difficult than usual since he only had one arm the other hanging by his underarm skin here you go maam a voice said at my elbow and i jerked heart pounding i stared at a young fib officer sorry he said as he extended a sheaf of papers detective glenn asked me to bring these up when they finished didnt mean to startle you his eyes dropped to the report in my hand nasty isnt it thank you i said accepting the reports my fingers were trembling as i dialed the number for the victims boss when there was no next of kin jims a tired voice said after the third ring my greeting froze in my throat i recognized his voice it was the announcer at cincinnatis illegal rat fights heart pounding i hung up missing the button the first time i stared at the wall the room had gone silent glenn i said my throat tight i turned to see him surrounded by three officers all looking at me yeah my hands shook as i extended the report across the small space will you look at the crime scene photos for me his face blank he took it i turned to his wall of sticky notes listening to the pages turn feet shuffled what am i looking for he asked i swallowed hard rat cages i asked oh my god someone whispered how did she know i swallowed again i couldnt seem to stop thanks with motions slow and deliberate i took the report and stuck it to the bulletin board my handwriting was shaky as i wrote t availability and stuck it on the pages the report said he had been a bouncer at a dance club but if he was one of dr anderss students he had been skilled with ley lines and was more likely the head of security at jims rat fights i reached for the fifth packet with a grim feeling it was trenti knew it was trentbut the horror of what he had done was killing any joy i might find in it i felt the men behind me watching as i leafed through the report recalling that the fifth victim found three weeks ago had died the same way as the first a call to her tearful mother told me she had met trent in a specialty bookstore last month she remembered because her daughter had been surprised that such a young important man was interested in collectable preturn fairytale anthologies after confirming that her daughter had been employed in a security subscription firm i gave her my condolences and hung up the background murmurs of the excited men added to my numb state i carefully wrote my big t making sure the lines were clear and straight i stuck it beside the copy of the womans work id picture she had been young with straight blond hair to her shoulders and a pretty oval face just out of college the memory of the picture i had seen of the first woman on the gurney flashed into my mind i felt the blood drain from me cold and lightheaded i stood the mens conversations stopped as if i had rung a bell wheres the ladies room i whispered my mouth dry turn left go to the back of the room i didnt have time to say thanks low heels clacking i strode out of the room i looked neither left nor right moving faster as i saw the door at the end of the room i hit the door at a run reaching the toilet just in time retching violently i lost my breakfast tears streamed down my face the salt mixing with the bitter taste of vomit how could anyone do that to another person i wasnt prepared for this i was a witch damn it not a coroner the is didnt teach its runners how to deal with this runners were runners not murder investigators they brought their tags in alive even the dead ones my stomach was empty and when the dry heaves finally stopped i stayed where i was sitting on the floor of the fib bathroom with my forehead against the cold porcelain trying not to cry i suddenly realized someone was holding my hair out of the way and had been for a while it will go away rose whispered almost to herself promise tomorrow or the next day youll close your eyes and it will be gone i looked up rose dropped her hand and took a step back beyond the proppedopen door was the row of sinks and mirrors really i said miserably she smiled weakly thats what they say im still waiting i think they all are feeling foolish i awkwardly got to my feet and flushed the toilet i brushed myself off glad the fib kept their bathroom cleaner than i kept mine rose had gone to a sink giving me a moment to gather myself i left the stall feeling embarrassed and stupid glenn would never let me live this down better rose asked as she dried her hands and i gave her a loosenecked nod ready to burst into tears again because she wasnt calling me a newbie or making me feel inadequate or that i wasnt strong here she said taking my purse from a sink and handing it to me i thought you might want your makeup i nodded again thanks rose she smiled the age lines in her face making her look even more comforting dont worry about it this is a bad one she turned to go and i blurted how do you deal with it how do you keep from falling apart thatwhat happened to them is horrible how can a person do that to another rose took a slow breath you cry you get angry then you do something about it i watched her leave the clack of her quick heels sounding sharp before the door closed yeah i can do that eleven it took more courage than i wanted to admit to walk out of the ladies bathroom i wondered if everybody knew i had lost it rose had been unexpectedly kind and understanding but i was sure the fib officers would use it against me pretty little witch too soft to play with the big boys glenn would never look past it i darted a nervous glance over the openair offices my steps faltering as i didnt find mocking knowing faces but empty desks no everyone was standing outside of glenns office peering in loud voices were coming from inside excuse me i murmured holding my bag close to myself as i pushed past the uniformed fib officers i halted just over the threshold finding the room full of arguing people with weapons and handcuffs morgan the cop who had been eating chips grabbed my arm and pulled me farther in you all right now i caught myself stumbling at my abrupt entrance yes i said hesitantly good i called the last one for you dunlop met my eyes they were brownand it seemed i could see right to his soul they were so frank hope you dont mind i was dying of curiosity he ran a hand across his mustache wiping the grease from it as his gaze went to the six reports tacked over glenns notes my gaze swept the room every man and woman glanced at me as the weight of my eyes fell on them recognizing me before going back to his or her conversation they all knew i had spewed my guts but by their lack of comment it seemed i had broken the ice in some twisted fashion perhaps falling apart proved to them that i was just as human as they weresort of glenn was sitting at his desk with his arms crossed saying nothing as he watched the separate arguments he gave me a wry eyebrowraised look by the sound of it most of the room wanted to arrest trent but a few were too cowed by his political muscle and wanted more there was less tension in the room than i would have expected seeing as they were all shouting at each other humans appeared to enjoy doing things by loud committee i put my purse on the floor beside the table and sat down to look at the last report the paper had said the latest victim had been a former olympic swimmer hed died in his bathtub drowning he worked for a local tv station as the celebrity weatherman but had gone to school for ley line manipulation the note stuck to it said in a stilted print that his brother didnt know if he talked to trent or not i pulled the report from the board and made myself look it over paying more attention to the conversations around me than the print hes laughing at us a streethardened swarthy woman said as she argued with a thin nervouslooking officer everyone but glenn and i were standing and i felt like i was at the bottom of a well mr kalamack isnt the witch hunter the man protested in a nasally voice he gives more to cincinnati than santa claus that fits the profile dunlop butted in youve seen the reports whoever is doing this is certifiable twin lives probably a schizophrenic there was a soft murmur from the surrounding officers as the arguments swirled down to just this one for what it was worth i agreed with dunlop whoever was doing this was an itsybitsyskitzy trent filled that description nicely the nervous man straightened gaze darting about the room for support okay the murderer is mental yes he admitted in an irritating whine but ive met mr kalamack the man is no more a murderer than my mother is i flipped to the coroners report learning that our olympic swimmer had indeed died in his bathtub but that it had been full of witch blood a bad feeling started to push out the horror it takes a lot of blood to fill a bathtub a lot more than one person has more like two dozen where had it all come from a vampire wouldnt have wasted it like that the discussion concerning the thin cops mother became loud and i wondered if i should tell them about benevolent mr kalamack killing his lead geneticist and blaming it on a bee sting nice neat and tidy murder without hardly lifting a hand trent had given the widowed wife and orphaned fifteenyearoldgirl the upgraded benefits package and an anonymous full university scholarship stop thinking with your wallet lewis dunlop said swinging his ample middle around aggressively just because the man gives to the fib charity auction that doesnt make him a saint i say that makes him more suspicious we dont even know if hes human glenn flicked a glance at me what does that have to do with anything dunlop started clearly remembering i was here absolutely nothing he said loudly as if the volume of his voice could erase the hidden underlying racial slur but the man has something to hide i silently agreed starting to like the overweight cop despite his lack of tact the officers clustered at the door looked over their shoulders into the open offices they exchanged looks and backed up one of them said afternoon captain as he ducked out of the way and i wasnt surprised when eddens squat bulk replaced theirs in the doorframe what is going on he said pushing his roundframed glasses back up his nose another fib officer made a silent farewell to me and slipped out hi edden i said not getting up from my swivel chair ms morgan the short man said a hint of anger on him as he shook my offered hand and raised his eyebrows at my leather pants rose said you were here im not surprised to find you in the middle of an argument he looked at glenn and the tall fib officer shrugged not a bit apologetic as he got to his feet captain glenn said taking a deep breath we were conducting a freeflow exercise concerning the possible alternate suspects for the witch hunter murders no you werent edden said and my eyes went to his at the anger in his voice you were gossiping about councilman kalamack hes not a suspect yes sir glenn agreed as dunlop gave me an unreadable look and edged quietly out of the room surprisingly agile for his size but i believe ms morgan is entertaining a valid thought path surprised at the support i blinked at glenn edden didnt even look at me stop the college psychobabble glenn dr anders is our prime suspect youd better have a good reason for pulling your energies from there yes sir glenn said not at all upset ms morgan has found a direct link from four of the six victims to mr kalamack and a probable window of opportunity for contact with mr kalamack in the other two instead of being excited as i would have expected edden slumped i stood up as he came close to look at the records tacked to the wall his tired eyes went from one to the next the last of the fib officers left and i went to stand beside glenn with a united front maybe he might stop wasting our time and let us go after trent feet spread wide edden put his hands on his hips and stared at the sticky notes tacked to the reports i found i was holding my breath and let it out unable to resist i said all but the last victim used ley lines heavily in their daily work and theres a slow progression from those highly skilled down to those just out of school and not yet using their degrees i know eddens voice was flat which is why dr anders is a suspect she is the last ley line witch of any repute left in cincinnati actively practicing i think shes getting rid of the competition especially as most of the victims were working in security related fields or trent just hasnt gotten to her yet i said softly the woman is a cacti edden turned putting his back to the reports morgan why would trent kalamack be killing ley line witches he has no motive he has the same motive youve given dr anders i said getting rid of the competition maybe he offered them a job and when they refused he killed them it would fit in with sara janes missing boyfriend not to mention what he did to me creases appeared in eddens forehead which brings up the question as to why he would let his secretary come to the fib i dont know i said my voice rising as i became frustrated maybe the two are unrelated maybe she lied about him knowing she came to us maybe the man is crazy and wants to get caught maybe hes so sure we cant find our asses in the dark that hes thumbing his nose at us he had them killed edden i know it he talked to them before they died what more do you need i was almost shouting i knew it wouldnt get me anywhere with edden but this bureaucracy was part of the reason i had quit the is and it rankled to find myself trying to convince the boss again head bowed and hand on his chin glenn took a step back leaving me alone i didnt care its not against the law to talk to trent kalamack edden said his eyes level with mine half the city knows him youre going to ignore that he talked to every one of these people i protested his face went red behind his eyeglasses they looked too small for his round face i cant accuse a councilman of phone calls and casual conversations he said thats his job my pulse quickened trent killed those people i said softly and you know it what you know isnt worth goose shit rachel its what i can prove and i cant prove anything with this he flicked a hand at the nearest report making it flutter then search his compound i demanded morgan edden shouted shocking me i wont authorize a search on the evidence that he talked to the victims i need more then let me talk to him ill get it god bless it he swore you want me fired rachel is that it do you know what will happen if i let you go through his compound and find nothing nothing i said wrong i will have accused a wellrespected man of murder he is a councilman a benefactor of most of the charities and hospitals on both sides of the state line the fib will become a foul word in human and inderland households alike my reputation will be shot frustrated i stood toetotoe with him able to look the man right in the eye i didnt know you became an fib officer to better your reputation glenn shifted making a soft sound of warning edden stiffened his jaw clenching until white spots appeared on his forehead rachel he said with a soft threat this is an official fib investigation and we are going to do it my way youve allowed yourself to become emotionally involved and your judgment is compromised my judgment i shouted he stuck me in a freaking cage and put me in the rat fights edden took a step closer im not he said pointing at me going to let you waltz into his office and telegraph your vendettabased suspicions while were gathering evidence even if we do question him you willnotbethere edden i protested no he barked rocking me back a step this conversation is over i took a breath to tell him it wasnt over until i said so but he had walked out angry i struck out after him edden i called after his swiftly vanishing shadow for a squat man he moved fast a door slammed edden ignoring the watching fib officers i stormed through the open offices past rose and to his closed door i reached for the handle then hesitated it was his office angry or not i couldnt barge in frustrated i stood outside his door and shouted edden i tucked a strand of hair behind my ear you and i both know trent kalamack is able and willing to commit murder if you wont let me talk to him through the fib then i quit i took off my visitors badge as if it meant something and threw it on roses desk you hear me ill go talk to him by myself eddens door jerked open and i took a step back he stood before me his khaki slacks creased and his plaid shirt starting to come untucked he loomed out into the hallway pushing me almost into roses desk with a stubby finger i told you if you came into this gunning for mr kalamack id sling your witch ass back across the river and into the hollows you made a commitment to work with detective glenn on this and im holding you to it but if you talk to mr kalamack ill toss you in my own lockup for harassment i took a breath to protest but my resolve faltered now get out of here edden almost growled you have a class tomorrow and ill deduct the tuition from your compensation if you dont go thoughts of rent money intruded despising that money not what was right would be what stopped me i glared at him you know he killed those people i said tightly shaking in unspent adrenaline i walked away i passed through the silent fib officers at their desks on my way to the front id take the bus home twelve i fell hard as ivy cut my legs from under me i rolled away already aching where my hip had hit the floor my heart pounded in time with the twin pains on the back of my calves i tossed a strand of hair that had escaped my exercise band from my eyes putting a hand against the wall of the sanctuary i used it for balance as i got to my feet lungs heaving i ran the back of my hand across my forehead to wipe the sweat from me rachel ivy said from eight feet away pay attention i almost hurt you that time almost i shook my head to clear my vision i had never seen her move away she was so quick of course i might not have seen her move since i was falling on my can at the time ivy took three loping steps toward me eyes wide i twisted my body in a tight circle to the left sending my right foot into her midsection grunting she clutched her stomach and stumbled backward ow she complained retreating i hunched over putting my hands on my knees to signal i wanted a breather ivy obediently moved farther away and waited trying not to show that i had hurt her from my position i glanced at her standing in a band of green and gold afternoon sun streaming in through the sanctuarys windows the black body stocking and soft slippers she wore when we sparred with each other made her look more predatory than usual her straight black hair was tied back accentuating her tall lean appearance face blank and pale she waited for me to catch my breath so we could continue the practice was more for me than her she insisted it would extend my life expectancy should i run up against a bigbadugly without my spells or a direction to run i always came away from of our sparring bruised and headed for my charm cupboard how that extended my life was beyond me more practice making pain amulets maybe ivy had arrived home early from her afternoon with kist surprising me with the offer to work out i was still seething over eddens refusal to let me question trent and needed to burn off some anger and so said yes as usual within fifteen minutes i was hurting and breathing hard while she had yet to break a sweat ivy danced impatiently from foot to foot her eyes were a nice steady brown i kept a close watch on her when we worked out together not wanting to push her too close to her limits she was fine whats up she asked as i straightened youre more aggressive than usual i bent my leg back to stretch my leg muscle and pull the cuff of my sweatpants back down about my ankle every one of the victims talked to trent before they died i said stretching the truth edden wont let me question him i pulled the other leg then nodded ivys breath quickened i dropped to a crouch as she darted forward too quick for thought i ducked her blow sweeping my leg at her feet calling out she flung herself in a backflip to avoid it landing on her hands and then feet i jerked back to keep her foot from hitting my jaw on the way by so ivy questioned softly waiting as i stood up so trent is the murderer can you prove it not yet i lunged for her she danced out of the way jumping onto the thin windowsill as soon as her feet landed she pushed off somersaulting right over me i spun to keep her in view red spots of exertion were starting to show on her she was dipping into her vamp repertoire to evade me encouraged i followed up striking with my fists and elbows so quit and finish the run yourself ivy said between blocks and counterstrikes my wrists smacking into her blocks hurt but i kept at it i told him thats what i was going to do strike block block strike and he threatened to lock me up for harassment told me i should concentrate on dr anders pull six feet back pant sweat why was i doing this again a smile real and unusual flashed across her face and was gone sneaky bastard she said i knew god had put him on earth to be more than a happy meal edden i wiped at the sweat dripping from my nose hes more of a big kids meal isnt he i gestured for her to come get me eyes glinting in amusement she obliged attacking with a barrage of blows ending with a strike to my solar plexus that sent me reeling your concentration is slipping she said breathing hard as she watched me kneel gasping on the floor you should have seen that coming i had but my arm was going numb and slow from having been hit too many times im all right i wheezed this was the first time id seen her break a sweat and i wasnt going to stop now i shakily got to my feet and held up two fingers then one my hand went down and she lunged with a supernatural quickness alarmed i blocked her vampquick blows retreating off the mats and almost into the foyer she grabbed my arm as i reached the threshold flinging me over her and back onto the mats my back hit with a thump knocking the wind from me i felt her feet padding after me adrenaline surged still not breathing i rolled until i hit the wall she was hot after me landing to pin me there eyes alight she leaned over me edden is a wise man she said between breaths a strand of hair that had escaped her tie tickling my face sweat dampened her brow you should listen to him and leave trent alone et tu brute i wheezed grunting i jerked my knee up to her groin she sensed it coming and fell back i had known she was too fast to let it land but it got her off mewhich was what id wanted ivy stood her usual eight feet back and waited for me to rise it was slower this time i rubbed my shoulder as i took her in avoiding eye contact to let her know i wasnt ready not bad she admitted but you didnt follow it up mr big bad ugly isnt going to stand aside and wait for you to regain your balance and neither should you i gave her a weary look from around my red frizz of hair trying to keep up with her much less best her was hard id never had to think about overcoming a vampire before since the is didnt send witches to tag them and whatever else the is took care of its own on or off the job unless they wanted you dead what are you going to do she asked as i felt my ribs through my sweatshirt about trent i said breathless talk to him without edden or glenn knowing ivys rocking motion faltered with a warning shout she leapt forward instinct and practice saved me as i ducked she spun in a tight circle and i jerked out of the way ivy followed with a series of blows that backed me to the wall her voice echoed against the empty walls of the sanctuary filling it with sound shocked at her sudden ferocity i pushed myself from the wall and fought back using every trick that she had taught me i became angry that she wasnt even trying with her vamp speed and strength i was a moving target dummy my eyes widened as ivys face went savage she was going to show me something new swell she shouted and spun i foolishly did nothing as her foot slammed into my chest sending me into the wall of the church my breath whooshed out and pain crushed my lungs she darted away leaving me to hang gasping staring at the floor i saw the green and gold sunbeams shake as the stainedglass windows to either side of me shivered still not breathing i looked up to see ivy sauntering away her slow mocking pace ticked me off anger burned giving me strength still having not caught my breath i jumped her ivy cried out in surprise as i landed on her back grinning savagely my legs went around her waist i grabbed a fistful of her hair and jerked her head back sliding an arm around her throat to choke her gasping she backpedaled i let go knowing she was going to slam me against the wall again i dropped to the floor and she tripped over me she went down i grappled for her catching her around the neck again she bucked against the floor twisting her body at an impossible angle breaking my hold heart pounding i flipped myself to my feet finding ivy standing eight feet awaywaiting my exhilaration at having surprised her vanished as i realized something had shifted she was moving from foot to foot with an unnerving fluid grace the first sign of her vamp background getting the better of her immediately i straightened and waved my arms in surrender thats it i panted i have to get cleaned up im done ive got to do my homework but instead of backing off as she always did she started to circle her movements were languorously slow and her eyes were fixed to mine my heart pounded and i spun to keep her in view tension laced through me tightening my muscles one by one she came to a halt in a sunbeam the light glinting on her black body stocking like it was oil her hair was free the black band lying between us where i had accidentally ripped it off her thats the trouble with you rachel she said her soft voice echoing you always quit when it starts to get good youre a tease nothing but a goddamned tease excuse me i asked the pit of my stomach clenching i knew exactly what she meant and it scared the crap out of me her face tightened forewarned i braced myself as she lunged i blocked her fists driving her away with a foot aimed at her knees knock it off ivy i shouted as she jerked out of my reach i said im done no you arent her gray voice settled over me like silk im trying to save your life little witch a big bad vamp isnt going to stop because you tell him to hes going to keep coming until he gets what he wants or you drive him away im going to save your lifeone way or another youll thank me when its over she darted forward catching my arm she twisted it trying to force me to the floor i gasped and kicked her legs from under her we went down my breath exploding out of me panicking i pushed away and rolled to my feet i found her waiting her usual eight feet backcircling a subtle heat had soaked into her movements her head was lowered and she was eyeing me from around her hair her lips were parted and i could almost see her breath passing through them i backed away fear grew as the ring of brown around her pupils flashed to black damn swallowing i ran a hand over myself foolishly trying to wipe her sweat off i had known better than to jump her i had to get her smell off me and now my fingers touched the demon scar on my neck and my breath caught it was tingling from the pheromones she was pumping into the air double damn stop ivy i said cursing the quaver that had crept into my voice were done knowing my life hung on what happened in the next few seconds i turned my back on her in a false show of confidence either i would make it to my room and its two locks or i wouldnt the hair on the back of my neck prickled as i paced past her my heart pounded and i held my breath she did nothing as i neared the hallway and my breath slipped out no we arent she whispered the sound of moving air pulled me around she attacked silently her eyes lost in black i fended off her blows by instinct she wasnt even trying ivy caught my arm and i cried out in pain as she spun me around crushing my back against her i leaned forward as if trying to break her grip as her arms tightened and her body leaned to find our balance i slammed my head backward into her chin grunting she dropped her grip and stumbled back adrenaline sang through me she was between me and my spells if i went for the front door id never make it this was my fault damn it back to the turn i shouldnt have jumped her i shouldnt have become aggressive she was driven by instinct and i had pushed her too far i stood watching her come to a swaying halt in a sunbeam standing sideways she tilted her head and touched the corner of her mouth my stomach clenched as her fingertip came away colored in blood her eyes met mine as she rubbed the blood between her fingers and smiled i shuddered at the sight of her sharp canines first blood rachel ivy no i shouted as she lunged she caught me before i had moved a step gripping my shoulder she flung me to the front of the church i hit the wall where the altar had once stood slipping down to the floor i struggled for air as she paced to me everything hurt her eyes were black pits her movements were smooth with power i tried to roll away she caught me yanking me up come on witch ivy said gently her black owlfeather voice in stark contrast to her painful grip on my shoulder i taught you better youre not even trying i dont want to hurt you i panted one arm clutched around my middle she held me to the wall under the shadow of a long gone cross the blood from her lip made a red jewel caught at the corner of her mouth you cant she whispered heart pounding i jerked to get away failing let me go ivy i panted you dont want to do this a cloying scent of incense pulled the memory of her pinning me to her chair last spring if you do this i said frantically ill leave youll be alone she leaned close putting the flat of her free forearm against the wall by my head if i do this you wont leave a heated smile curved over hershowing a hint of teethand she pressed closer but you could get away if you really wanted to what do you think ive been teaching you the last three months do you want to get awayrachel panic lanced deep into me my heart beat wildly and ivy sucked her breath in as if i had slapped her fear was an aphrodisiac and id just given her a jolt lost in the blackness of instinct and need her muscles went tensionwire tight do you want to get away little witch she murmured her breath against my demon scar sending a surge of tingling through me my intake of breath went to my core seeming to turn my blood to liquid metal as it conducted a pulse through me get off i panted the delicious feeling coursing from my neck to fill me it was my scar she was playing on my demon scar as piscary had done she licked her lips make me she hesitated the hard hunger shifting to something more playful and insidious tell me it doesnt feel good when i do this breath easing from her in a sigh she watched my eyes as her finger ran a trail from my ear across my neck and down my collarbone i almost buckled at the sensation of her nail finding the faint bumps of scar tissue stimulating the scar back into full play my eyes closed as i remembered that the demon had taken ivys face when it ripped out my throat filling the wound with a dangerous cocktail of neurotransmitters to make pain into pleasure yes i breathed almost moaning god help me it does pleasestop her body shifted against mine i know how it feels she said the hunger racing from it to fill your body the need it stirs until the only thought burning in you is to touch the craving to fulfill it ivy i whimpered stop i cant i dont want to my eyes flashed open at her silence the drop of blood at the corner of her mouth was gone i could feel the blood pounding through me i knew my reactions were tied to the demon scar that she was sending out pheromones to restimulate the pseudovamp saliva that remained in me to make pain into pleasure i knew it was one of the survival adaptations vamps relied upon to bind people to them ensuring that they had a willing supply of blood i knew all of this but it was getting harder to remember harder to care it wasnt sexual it was need hunger heat ivy put her forehead against the wall beside mine as if to gather her resolve her hair made a silk curtain between us i felt the warmth from her through her body stocking i couldnt move wiretight with fear and want wondering if she would sate it or if i would be strong enough of will to push her away you dont know what its been like living beside you rachel she said her whisper coming from behind her hair as if from a confessional grate i knew youd be frightened if you knew how vulnerable your scar makes you youve been marked for pleasure and unless you have a vampire to claim and protect you they all will take advantage of it taking what they want and passing you to the next until youre nothing but a puppet begging to be bled i was hoping you might be able to say no that if i taught you enough you would be able to drive a hungry vampire away but you cant dear heart the neurotoxins have soaked in too far its not your fault im sorry my breath came in small pants each one sending the promise of coming pleasure through me flowing back to renew that which ebbed building on those that came before i held my breath trying to find the will to tell her to get off me oh god i was failing ivys voice went soft persuasive piscary said this is the only way to keep you to keep you alive i would be kind rachel i wouldnt ask anything you didnt want to give you wouldnt be like those pathetic shadows at piscarys but strong an equal he showed me when he bespelled you that it wouldnt hurt her voice went little girl soft the demon already broke you the pain is over it will never hurt again he said you would respond and my god rachel you did its as if a master broke you and youre mine fear flashed through me at her hard possessive tone she turned her head her hair falling back to show her face her black eyes were an ancient hunger faultless in their innocence i saw what happened under piscary what you felt with no more than a finger touching your skin i was too frightened and enraptured by the waves of feeling coming off my neck in time with my pulse to move imagine she whispered what its like when its not your finger but my teethslicing clean and pure through you the thought sent a pulse of heat through me i went slack in her grip my body rebelling against my railing thoughts tears slipped down my face warm on my cheeks to fall on my collarbone i couldnt tell if they were tears of fear or need dont cry rachel she said tilting her head to brush her lips upon my neck in time with her words i almost passed out from the ache of desire i didnt want it to be like this either but for you she whispered id break my fast her teeth grazed my neck taunting i heard a soft moan shocked to realize it came from me my body cried out for it but my soul screamed no the eager pliant faces at piscarys intruded lost dreams wasted lives existence turned to serve someone elses need i tried to push her away but failed my will was a ribbon of cotton falling apart with the slightest tug ivy i protested hearing my whisper wait i couldnt say no but i could say wait she heard pulling away to look at me she was lost in a haze of anticipation and rapture numb terror struck through me no i said panting as i fought the pheromoneinduced high i had said it somehow i had said it wonder and hurt crossed her face a breath of awareness returning to her black eyes no she sounded like a hurt child my eyes closed in the ripples of ecstasy that flowed from my neck as her fingernails continued to trace the scars where her lips had let off no i managed feeling unreal and disconnected as i weakly tried to push her away no my eyes flashed open as her grip on my shoulder tightened i dont think you mean that she snarled ivy i shrieked as she pulled me against her adrenaline scoured my veins pain followed it punishing me for my defiance terrified i found the strength to keep her from my neck she pulled me with an increasing power her lips drew back from her teeth my muscles began to shake slowly she pulled me closer her soul was lost from her eyes her hunger shone like a god my arms trembled ready to give out god save me i thought desperately my eyes finding the cross incorporated into the ceiling ivy jerked as a metallic bong reverberated through the air she stiffened the need in her flickered her eyebrows rose in bewilderment and her focus wavered breath held i felt her grip slacken fingers slipping from me she collapsed at my feet with a sigh behind her stood nick with my largest copper spell pot nick i whispered tears blurring my vision i took a breath and reached out for him passing out as he touched my hand thirteen it was warm and stuffy i could smell cold coffee starbucks two sugars no cream i opened my eyes to find a red stringy mass of my hair blocking my sight my arm aching i pushed it out of the way it was quiet with only the hushed sound of traffic and the familiar hum of nicks alarm clock to break the stillness i wasnt surprised to find i was in his bedroom safe on my occasional side of the bed facing both the window and the door nicks dilapidated dresser with the missing knob never looked so good the light slanting in past the drawn curtains was faint i was guessing it was getting close to sunset a glance at his clock showed i knew it was accurate nick was a gadget guy and the clock received a signal from colorado every midnight to reset it from the atomic clock there his watch was the same way why someone had to be that accurate was beyond me i didnt even wear my wristwatch the gold and blue afghan nicks mother had crocheted him was snuggled under my chin smelling faintly of ivory soap what i recognized as a pain amulet lay on the nightstandright beside the finger stick nick thought of everything if he could have invoked it he would have i sat up looking for him knowing by the scent of coffee that he was probably nearby the afghan pooled about me as i swung my feet to the floor muscles protesting i reached for the amulet my ribs hurt and my back was sore head bowed i pricked my finger for the three drops of blood to invoke the charm even before i slipped the cord over my head i felt myself relax in immediate relief it was all muscle aches and bruises nothing that wouldnt heal i squinted in the artificial dusk an abandoned coffee cup pulled my eyes to a slump of clothes on the chair it moved in a gentle rhythm becoming nick asleep with his long legs sprawled out before him he was sockfooted since he wouldnt let shoes on his carpet and his big feet pulled a smile from me i sat content to do nothing for the moment nicks day started six hours earlier than mine and a faint stubble made early shadows on his long face slack in slumber his chin rested on his chest his short black hair falling to hide his eyes they opened as a primitive part of him felt my gaze on him my smile grew as he stretched in the chair a sigh slipping from him hi rayray he said his voice pooling like brown puddlewarm water about my ankles how are you doing im okay i was embarrassed that he had witnessed what happened embarrassed hed saved me and heartily glad he had been there to do both he came to sit beside me his weight making me slide into him my breath made a relieved contented sound as i fell against him he put his arm around me and gave me a sideways squeeze i rested my head against his shoulder taking the scent of old books and sulfur deep into me slowly my heartbeat became obvious as i sat and did nothing taking strength simply from his presence are you sure youre all right he asked his hand buried deep in my hair as he held me i pulled away to look at him yes thanks wheres ivy he didnt say anything and my face went slack in alarm she didnt hurt you did she his hand dropped from my hair shes on the floor where i left her nick i protested pushing myself away from him so i could sit straight how could you just leave her there i stood looking for my bag and realizing he hadnt brought it i was still barefoot too take me home i said knowing the bus wouldnt pick me up nick had risen when i did his face flashed into alarm and his eyes dropped shit he said under his breath im sorry i thought you said no to her his gaze flicked to mine and away his long face looking pained disappointed and red with embarrassment aw shit shit shit he muttered im really sorry yeah yeah come on ill get you home maybe she hasnt woken up yet im really really sorry i thought you said no oh god i shouldnt have interfered i thought you said no he was hunched with discomfort and bewildered i reached out and pulled him back before he could walk out the bedroom door nick i said as he jerked to a halt i did say no nicks eyes widened even farther his lips parted and he stood there seeming unable to even blink but you want to go back i sat on the bed and looked up at him well yeah shes my friend i gestured in disbelief i cant believe you just left her lying there nick hesitated confusion thick in his pinched eyes but i saw what she tried to do he said she almost bit you and you want to go back my shoulders slumped and i dropped my gaze to the stainspotted ugly yellow carpet it was my fault i said softly we were sparring and i was angry i glanced up not with her with edden then she got cocky and it ticked me off so i jumped her catching her off guardlanded on her back pulled her head back by her hair and breathed on her neck his lips pressed together nick lowered himself to sit on the edge of the chair and put his elbows on his knees let me get this straight you decided to spar with her while you were angry you waited until you were both emotionally charged and then you jumped her he exhaled loudly through his nose are you sure you didnt want her to bite you i made a sour face at him i did say it wasnt her fault not wanting to argue with him i got up and moved his arms to make a spot for me in his lap he made a surprised grunt then curved his arms about me as i sat down i tucked my head against his cheek and shoulder breathing in his masculine scent the memory of the vampsalivainduced euphoria flickered through me and was gone i hadnt wanted her to bite mei hadntbut a niggling thought wouldnt go away that the baser pleasuredriven side of me might have i had known better it hadnt been her fault and as soon as i could convince myself of that and get out of nicks lap i was going to call and tell her so i snuggled and listened to the traffic as nick ran a hand over my head he seemed inordinately relieved nick i questioned what would you have done if i hadnt said no he took a slow breath put your spell pot just inside the door and left he said his voice rumbling up through me i straightened and he winced as my body weight shifted against him you would have let her tear out my throat he wouldnt meet my eyes ivy wouldnt have drained you and left you for dead he said reluctantly even in the frenzy you had her whipped up to i heard what she offered you that was no one night stand it was a life commitment my demon scar tingled at his words and frightened i pushed the feeling away just how long were you standing there i asked going cold with the thought that the nightmare might have been far more than ivy simply losing control his grip around me tightened as his eyes failed to reach mine long enough to hear her ask to make you her scion i wasnt going to stand in your way if it was something you wanted my mouth dropped open and i pulled my arm from around behind him you would have walked away and let her make me into a plaything a flash of anger flickered in his brown eyes a scion rachel not a shadow or plaything or even a thrall theres a world of difference you would have walked away i exclaimed not willing to get out of his lap for fear pride might make me leave his apartment you would have done nothing his jaw clenched but he made no move to dump me onto the floor i am not the one living in a church with a vamp he said i dont know what you want i can only go on what you tell me and what i see you live with her you date me what am i supposed to think i said nothing and he added in a softer voice what ivy wants is not wrong or unusual its a cold scary fact shes going to need a trustworthy scion in about forty years or so and she likes you to tell you the truth its a damn fine offer but you had better make up your mind as to what you want before time and vamp pheromones make it for you his voice grew halting reluctant you wouldnt be a plaything not with ivy and you would be safe with her untouchable by just about every nasty thing cincinnati has gaze distant my thoughts lit on small seemingly unrelated instances of friction between ivy and nick seeing them in a new light shes been hunting me all this time i whispered feeling the first hints of real fear the wrinkles around nicks eyes creased no its not just blood shes after though an exchange is involved but i have to be honest you complement each other like no vamp and scion pair ive seen a flicker of unknown emotion swelled and died within his eyes its a chance at greatnessif youre willing to give up your dreams and bind yourself to hers you would always be second but you would be second to a vamp slated to rule cincinnati nicks hand ceased its motion over my hair if i made a mistake he said carefully not looking at me and you want to be her scion then fine ill drive you and your toothbrush home and walk away letting you two finish what i interrupted his hand began moving again my only regret will be that i wasnt enough to lure you away from her my eyes drifted across nicks hodgepodge of furniture hearing the busy traffic outside his apartment it was so unlike ivys church with its wide open spaces and breathing room all i had wanted was to be her friend she desperately needed one unhappy with herself and wanting to be something more something clean and pure something untouched and unsullied she was trying so hard to escape her vampiric existence and i knew she harbored a belief that someday i might find a spell to help her i couldnt leave and destroy the one thing that kept her going god save me if i was a fool but i admired her indomitable will and belief that someday shed find what she sought despite the potential threat she posed her asinine demands for organization and her strict adherence to structure she was the first person id roomed with who said nothing about my mindslips like draining the water heater or neglecting to turn off the heat before opening the windows id lost too many friends over such petty arguments i didnt want to be alone anymore the scary thing was that nick was right we did do well together and now i had a new fear i hadnt realized the threat of my vamp scar until she told me marked for pleasure and unclaimed passed from vampire to vampire until i begged to be bled remembering the waves of euphoria and how hard it had been to say no i saw how easy ivys prediction could turn real though she hadnt bitten me i was sure the word on the streets was that i was taken goods and to back off damn how did i get to this place do you want me to take you back nick whispered pulling me close i shifted my shoulder to mold myself into him if i was smart id ask his help in moving my stuff out of the church tonight but what came out of my mouth was a small not yet ill call to make sure shes all right though im not going to be her scion but i cant leave her to be alone i said no and i think shell respect that what if she doesnt i tucked in closer i dont know maybe ill put a bellon her he chuckled but i thought i heard a trace of pain in it i felt his amusement fade his chest shifted my head as he breathed what happened had scared me more than i wanted to admit you arent under a death threat anymore he whispered why dont you leave i didnt move hearing his heartbeat i dont have the money i protested softly wed been over this before i told you that you can move in with me i smiled though he couldnt see it my cheek scraping against his cotton shirt his apartment was small but that wasnt why i had always kept our sleepovers to the weekends he had his own life and i would get in his way if he had to take me in more than small doses it would last for a week and then we would hate each other i said knowing from experience it was true and im the only thing keeping her from falling back into being a practicing vamp so let her fall shes a vampire i sighed not finding the strength to get angry she doesnt want to be ill be more careful itll be all right i put a confident persuasive tone in my voice but was left wondering if i was trying to convince him or me rachel nick breathed his breath shifting the hair atop my head i waited almost able to hear him trying to decide whether he should say anything more the longer you stay he said reluctantly the harder its going to be to resist the vampinduced euphoria that demon that attacked you last spring pumped more vamp saliva into you than a master vampire if witches could be turned youd be one by now as it is i think ivy could bespell you simply by saying your name and shes not even dead yet youre making unsafe rationalizations for staying in an unsafe situation if you think you will ever want to leave you should go now believe me i know how good a vampire scar feels when a vamps need kicks in i know how deep the lie goes and how strong the lure i sat up my hand going to cover my neck you know his eyes went sheepish i went to high school in the hollows you dont think i got through that without being bitten at least once my brow rose at his almost guilty look you have a vamp bite where he wouldnt meet my eyes it was a summer fling and she wasnt dead so i didnt contract the vamp virus there wasnt much saliva in it to begin with so it stays pretty quiet unless i get in a situation where there are a lot of vampire pheromones its a trap you know that dont you i slumped back into him nodding nick was safe his scar was old and made by a living vampire barely out of adolescence mine was new and laced with so much neurotoxin that piscary could set it into play with just the weight of his eyes nick went still and i wondered if his scar had flamed to life when hed walked into the church it might explain why he had said nothing and simply watched how good had his scar felt i wondered unable to blame him where is it i asked slowly your vamp scar nick jiggled me farther up onto his lap never mind thatwitch he said playfully i suddenly became very aware of him pressing up against me his arms draped around me to keep me from falling off i glanced at the clock i had to go to my moms and get my old ley line stuff before i could do my homework if i didnt do it tonight it wouldnt get done my gaze tilted to nicks and he smiled he knew why i was looking at the clock is this it i asked shifting on his lap i pulled the collar of his shirt aside to show a faint white scar on his upper shoulder from a deep scratch he grinned i dont know mmmm i said bet i could tell as he laced his hands to cradle me about the hips i undid the top button of his shirt the angle was awkward and i shifted to straddle his lap my knees to either side of him his hands moved to hold me a trifle lower and arching my eyebrows at our new position i leaned closer my fingers went behind his neck and i nuzzled aside his collar to set my lips against the scar leaving it with an audible pop nick took a noisy breath shifting under me into more of a slouch so he wouldnt have to hold me from falling thats not it he said his hand went to my back tracing a trail down my spine bumping as he found the waistband of my sweats okay i murmured as his fingers tugged the hem of my sweatshirt he reached up under it his fingertips making a long tingle across my skin i know it isnt this one bending over him i let my hair fall about his chest as i flicked my tongue against first one then the second puncture mark i had given him when id been a mink and thought he was a rat trying to kill me he said nothing and i carefully worried the threemonthold scar with gentle teeth no he said his voice suddenly strained you gave me those thats right i breathed my lips grazing his neck as i steadily worked my way to his ear with little hopkisses hmmm i breathed i guess ill have to do some investigating you are aware mr sparagmos that i am professionally trained in the field of investigation he said nothing his free hand making a delicious sensation as he traced a path along the small of my back testing i pulled back and his hands followed the curves of my waist under my sweatshirt with an increasing pressure i was glad it was near dark so still and warm an eager anticipation was in his gaze and leaning forward to brush the tips of my hair over his face i whispered close your eyes his entire body shifted as he sighed doing as i asked nicks touch became more insistent and i settled my forehead into the crook between his neck and shoulder eyes closed i felt for the buttons on his shirt enjoying the rising feeling of expectation as each one gave way i struggled with the last tugging his shirt out from his jeans his hands fell from me and he twisted to pull his shirt free i tilted my head and gently bit his earlobe dont you dare help i whispered his lobe still between my teeth i shivered as he resumed his touch his hands warm against my back all the buttons were undone and i ran my lips across the faint notches rimming his ear with a quick motion he reached up pulling my face to his his lips were demanding a soft sound urged me to respond had it been him or me dont know dont care one hand was buried deep in my hair holding me to him as his lips and tongue explored his motions grew aggressive and i pushed him back into the chair liking his rough touch he hit the slats with a thump pulling me down with him his stubble was prickly and lips still on mine he reached around pulling me close with a grunt of effort he lurched to his feet carrying me my legs wrapped around him as he moved us to the bed my lips felt cold as he pulled away setting me down gently his arms slipped from me as he knelt over me i looked up at him his shirt still on but open to show lean muscles running down to disappear beneath his waistband i had tossed one of my arms artfully over my head and i reached up with the other to draw a line from his chest downward tugging at his jeans button fly i thought in a wash of impatience god help me i hated button fly his dusky smile faltered and he almost shuddered as i gave up for a moment and reached behind him tracing the curve of his back following it as far as i could reach it wasnt nearly far enough and i pulled him down toward me slumping forward nick supported himself on the flat of a forearm a sigh escaped me as i got my hands to where i wanted them to be warm and with the delightful mix of gentle pressure and rough skin nick sent his hand searching under my shirt i ran my hand over his shoulders feeling his muscles bunch and ease he scooted lower and i gasped in surprised as he nuzzled my midriff his teeth searching for the hem of my sweatshirt my breath came faster and a whispered pant of anticipation slipped from me as he tugged my shirt upward his hands pushing against my waist hasty with a sudden need i dropped my hands from fumbling at his button fly to help him get my shirt off it scraped my nose in passing taking my amulet with it my held breath slipped out in a sound of relief nicks teeth were a teasing hint as he tugged at my tightfitting exercise bra i shuddered arching my upper back in encouragement he buried his face at the base of my neck my demon scar running from my collarbone to my ear gave a knifeedged pulse of feeling and i froze into a frightened wariness it had never done that before when id been with nick i didnt know whether to enjoy it or lump the feeling in with the terror of the scars origin sensing my sudden fear nick slowed his body nudging mine once twice then halting in a slow stillness he brushed my scar with his lips i couldnt move as waves of promise raced through me settling low and insistent in my body my heart pounded as i compared it to ivys vamppheromone induced ecstasy and found it identical it felt too good to dismiss out of hand nick hesitated his breath harsh in my ear slowly the feeling ebbed should i stop he whispered his voice husky with need i closed my eyes reaching downward to work almost frantically at his button fly no i moaned it almost hurts becareful his breath came in a quick sound matching mine more insistent he ran a hand under my bra and made soft kisses against my scarred neck an unhelped sound escaped me as i got the last of his buttons undone nicks lips ghosted up the underside of my chin and found my mouth his touch was gentle and i lunged my tongue deep into him he pushed back his stubble harsh our breath came in tandem his continuing gentle fingers on my neck sent a sudden spasm through me i traced my hands down his open shirt to find his jeans breath fast i pushed his clothes down to where i could hook my foot into them and push them all the way off hungry for him i sent my hands searching stretching to find what i wanted nicks breath caught as i grasped him feeling the tight smooth skin between my fingers and thumb his head dropped from mine burying it between my breasts nuzzling as my bra had somehow disappeared he pushed his hips against me hinting and i pushed pack my heart pounded strong and insistent my scar sent waves through me though nicks searching lips were nowhere near it i abandoned myself to the demon scar letting the feeling flow through me id figure out later if it was wrong or not my hands quickened their motion against him feeling the difference between him and a male witch finding it roused me further leaving one hand to caress him i grasped the hand not supporting his weight over me and led him to the drawstring on my sweats he snatched my wrist pinning it up over my head on the pillow refusing to accept my help a jolt struck through me he nipped at my neck and darted away the barest hint of teeth bringing a gasp from me nicks hands tugged at my waistband pulling my sweats and underwear off in a fierce need i arched my back to help free them from my hips and a heavy hand pinned my shoulder to the bed i opened my eyes and nick leaned over me and breathed my job witch but my sweats were gone i reached downward for him and he shifted his weight nudging his knee against the inside of my thigh again i arched my lower back reaching straining to find him he fell to cover me his lips on mine we begin to move against each other slowly almost tauntingly he moved inside of me i clutched at his shoulders racked with tingling jolts as his lips found my neck my wrist he panted in my ear oh god rachel she bit my wrist the surges of feeling came in time with our bodies rhythm as i hungrily found his wrist he moaned as i fastened on it i grazed my teeth across it sucking hungrily as he did the same on my neck the ache rose in me and out of my mind in need i bit nicks old scar making it mine trying to take it away from the one who first marked him pain shot through my neck and i cried out nick hesitated then again pinched a fold of scarred skin between his teeth i did the same with his wrist to tell him it was all right silent with a desperate need his mouth lunged hungrily into me want crept up from within i felt it swell i seduced it closer willing it to happen now i thought almost crying oh god make it now together nick and i shuddered our bodies responding as one as a wave of euphoria washed from me into him it rebounded striking me with twofold strength i gasped clutching at him he groaned as if in pain again the wave took us pulling us back poised we hung at the point of climax trying to hold it forever slowly it ebbed jolts of dying pleasure sending tremors through us both as the tension eased from us in stages nicks weight gradually pressed down atop me his breath was rough in my ear exhausted i made a conscious effort to unkink my hands from his shoulder the imprints of my fingers made red lines on his skin i lay for a moment feeling a dying tingle from my neck then it was gone i ran my tongue along the inside of my teeth no blood i hadnt broken his skin thank god still atop me nick shifted his weight so i could breathe easier rachel he whispered i think you almost killed me breath slowing i said nothing thinking i could forego my threemile run today my heartbeat eased filling me with a relaxed lassitude i pulled his wrist close eyeing the old scar showing a stark white against the red roughened skin i felt a twinge of embarrassment to see i had given him a hickey no guilt though for having marked him hed probably known what would happen better than i had and my neck was undoubtedly in a similar state did i care not right now maybe later when my mom spotted it i gave his tender skin a kiss and set his arm down why did it feel like one of us was a vampire i asked my demon scar was never that sensitive before and you i left my sentence unfinished i had nibbled a good share of his body over the last two months and never provoked such a response in him not that i was complaining looking exhausted he eased himself off me and fell groaning on the bed must have been from ivy getting things started he said his eyes closed as he faced the ceiling im going to be sore tomorrow i grabbed the afghan and pulled it to cover me cold now without his body heat shifting to my side i leaned close and whispered sure you want me to move out of the church i think im beginning to see why threesomes are so popular in the vamp circles nicks eyes opened as he grunted you are trying to kill me arent you chuckling i stood wrapping the afghan around me my fingers touched my neck to find the skin sore but unbroken i wouldnt say it had been wrong to take advantage of the sensitivities ivy set into play but the vehement need of it had me concerned almost too exquisitely intense to control no wonder ivy had such a hard time thoughts slow and speculative i dug about in the bottom drawer of nicks dresser for one of his old shirts and made my way to his shower fourteen hello nicks recorded voice came from my answering machine sounding smooth and polished youve reached morgan tamwood and jenks of vampiric charms independent runners they are currently unavailable please leave a message and let us know if you would prefer a daylight or evening return call i gripped the black plastic of nicks phone tighter and waited for the beep having nick leave the outgoing message on our machine had been my idea i liked his voice and i thought it very posh and professional for us to appear to have a man as a receptionist course that all went out the window when they saw the church ivy i said wincing at the guilt i could hear in my voice pick up if youre there nick walked past me from the kitchen his hand trailing across my waist as he went into his living room the phone remained silent and i rushed to fill the gap before the machine clicked off hey im at nicks um about earlier sorry it was my fault i glanced at nick doing the bachelor tidy shuffle as he swooped about shoving things out of sight under the couch and behind cushions nick says hes sorry for hitting you i do not he said and i covered the receiver thinking her vamp hearing might catch it hey umm i continued im going to my moms to pick up some stuff but ill be back around ten if you get home before me why dont you pull the lasagna out and well have that tonight we can eat around midnight make it an early dinner so i can get my homework done i hesitated wanting to say more well i hope you get this i finished lamely bye i clicked the phone off and turned to nick what if shes still knocked out his eyes tightened i didnt hit her that hard i slumped to lean against the wall it was painted an icky brown and didnt go with anything else nothing in nicks apartment went with anything else so it kind of fitin a warped sort of way it wasnt that nick didnt care about continuity but that he looked at things differently the time i found him wearing a blue sock with a black he had blinked at me and said they were the same thickness his books too werent cataloged alphabeticallyhis oldest tomes had no title or authorbut by some ranking system i had yet to figure out they lined an entire wall of his living room giving me the eerie feeling of being watched whenever i was there he had tried to get me to store them in my closet for him after his mother dumped them on his doorstep early one morning id kissed him soundly and refused they creeped me out nick leaned into the kitchen and grabbed his keys the sliding sound of metal pulled me from the wall and to the door i glanced over my outfit before following him into the hall blue jeans tuckedin black cotton t and the flipflops i used when we swam in his apartments pool i had left them last month and found them washed and hung up in nicks closet i dont have my bag i muttered as he gave the door a firm tug to lock it you want to stop at the church on the way his offer didnt sound genuine and i hesitated wed have to cross half of the hollows to get there it was after sundown the streets were getting busy and it would take forever there wasnt much in my bag in terms of money and i wouldnt need my charmsi was only going to my momsbut the thought of ivy flat out on the floor was intolerable could we he took a slow breath and with his long face twisted into a stilted expression he nodded i knew he didnt want to and the bother of that made me almost miss the step out of the apartment house and onto the dark parking lot it was cold there wasnt a cloud in the sky but the stars were lost behind the city lights my feet felt drafty in their flipflops and when i clutched my arms about myself nick handed me his coat i shrugged into it my anger at his reluctance to check on ivy easing at the warmth and lingering smell of him on the thick fabric a faint whine came from a street lamp my dad would have called it a thief light just enough illumination to let a thief know what he was doing the sound of our feet was loud and nick reached for my door ill get it he said gallantly and i smirked as he fought with the handle grunting as he gave it a final yank and the latch released nick had been working his new job for only three months but somehow managed to get a beatup blue ford truck already i liked it it was big and ugly which was why he had gotten it so cheap he said it was the only thing they had on the lot that didnt scrunch his legs up to his chin the clear coat was peeling and the tailgate was rusting out but it was transportation i lurched up and in putting my feet squarely on the offensive floor mat from the previous owner as nick slammed the door shut the truck shook but it was the only way to be sure the door wouldnt fly open when we went across railroad tracks as i waited for nick to come around the back a flickering shadow over the hood caught my eye i leaned forward squinting something almost smacked the window and i jumped jenks i exclaimed recognizing him the glass between us did nothing to hide his agitation his wings were a gossamer blur shimmering in the street lamp as he frowned a floppy widebrimmed red hat looking gray in the uncertain light was on his head and his hands were on his hips my guilty thoughts flashed to ivy and i rolled the window down pushing it along when it got stuck halfway he darted inside and took off his hat when the hell are you two going to get a speaker phone he snarled i belong to this crappy firm as much as you and i cant use the phone he had come from the church i didnt know he could move that fast what did you do to ivy he continued as nick silently got in and shut his door i spend the afternoon with glenda the good trying to calm him down after you yelled at his dad then i come home to find ivy having hysterics on the bathroom floor is she all right i asked then looked at nick get me home nick started the truck jerking back as jenks landed on the gearshift shes fineas much as she ever is jenks said his anger shifting to worry dont go back yet get off that i said flicking a hand under him jenks flitted up then down staring at nick until the man put his hands back on the wheel no the pixy said i mean it give her some time she heard your message and is calming down jenks flew to sit on the dash before me man what did you do to her she was going on and on about not being able to protect you and that piscary was going to be angry with her and she didnt know what she was going to do if you left his tiny features grew worried rache maybe you should move out this is too weird even for you i felt cold at the undead vampires name maybe i hadnt pushed her too far maybe piscary had put her up to it we wouldve been fine had she quit when i first said to hed probably figured out that ivy wasnt the dominant one in our odd relationship and wanted her to rectify the situation the little prick it wasnt his business nick put the car in gear and the tires cracked and popped against the gravel lot church he questioned i glanced at jenks and he shook his head it was the wisp of fear on him that decided it for me no i said id wait give her time to collect herself nick seemed as relieved as jenks we pulled out into traffic headed for the bridge good jenks said eyeing my lack of earrings he vaulted up to sit on the rearview mirror what the hell happened anyway i rolled my window back up feeling the coldness of the coming night in the damp breeze i pushed her too far while we were working out she tried to make me heruhtried to bite me nick knocked her out with my spell pot she tried to bite you i looked from the passing night to jenks seeing in the light from the car behind us his wings go still then blur to nothing and go still again jenks looked from nicks embarrassed face to my worried one ohhh he said his eyes widening now i get it she wanted to bind you to her so only she could make your vamp scar resonate to vamp pheromones you turned her down my god she must be embarrassed no wonder shes upset jenks shut up i said stifling the urge to grab him and toss him out the window he would only catch up at the first red light the pixy flitted to nicks shoulder eyeing the lights glowing on the dash nice truck thanks stock nicks gaze slid from the taillights of the car ahead to jenks modified jenkss wings blurred then steadied whats your top end one fifty with nos damn the pixy swore admiringly as he flew back to the rearview mirror check your lines i smell a leak nicks eyes darted to a grimy obviously not factoryinstalled lever under the dash before returning to the road thanks i wondered slowly he rolled his window down a crack no problem i opened my mouth to ask then closed it must be a guy thing sooooo jenks drawled we going to your moms i nodded yeah want to come he rose an inch as we hit a pothole hovering crosslegged sure thanks her rose of sharon is probably still blooming think shed mind if i took some of the pollen home why dont you ask her i will a grin came over him youd better put some makeup on that love bite jenks i exclaimed my hand going to cover my neck i had forgotten my face warmed as jenks and nick exchanged looks in some asinine macho thing god help me i felt as if i was back in the cave me mark woman so glurg keep his furry hands off her nick i pleaded keenly feeling the lack of my bag can i borrow some money i have to stop at a charm shop but the only thing more embarrassing than buying a complexion spell is buying one with a hickey on your neck especially when most of the shop owners knew me so i opted for autonomy and asked nick to stop at a gas station of course the spell rack by the register was empty so i ended up plastering my neck with conventional makeup covergirl dont you believe it nick said it looked all right but jenks laughed his wings red he sat on nicks shoulder and chatted about the attributes of the pixy girls he had known before meeting matalina his wife the randy pixy kept it up all the way to the outskirts of cincinnati where my mom lived while i tried to touch up my makeup in the visors mirror left down that street i said wiping my fingers off on each other its the third house on the right nick said nothing as he pulled to the curb in front of my house the porch light was on for us and i swear i saw the curtain flutter i hadnt been there for a few weeks and the tree id planted with my dads ashes was turning the spreading maple was almost shading the garage in the twelve years it had been in the ground jenks had already buzzed out nicks open door and as nick leaned to get out i reached for his arm nick i questioned he paused at the worried tone in my voice easing back against the ageworn vinyl as i drew my hand away and looked at my knees um i want to apologize for my mombefore you meet her i blurted he smiled his long face going soft he leaned across the front seat and gave me a quick kiss moms are terrible arent they he got out and i waited impatiently until he came around and jerked my door open for me nick i said as he took my hand and we started up the walk i mean it shes a little whacked my dads death really threw her shes not a psychopath or anything but she doesnt think about what shes saying if it comes into her head it comes out her mouth his pinched expression eased is that why i havent met her yet i thought it was me you i questioned then winced inside oh the humanwitch thing i said softly so he wouldnt have to no actually i had forgotten about that suddenly nervous i checked my hair and felt for my missing bag my toes were cold and the flipflops were loud and awkward on the cement steps jenks was hovering beside the porch light looking like a huge moth i rang the bell and stood beside nick please make it one of her good days im glad it wasnt me nick said yeah jenks said as he landed on my shoulder your mom ought to meet him seeing as hes bonking her daughter and all jenks i exclaimed then steeled my face as the door opened rachel my mom cried swooping forward and giving me a hug i closed my eyes and returned her embrace she was shorter than i was and it felt odd hair spray caught in my throat over the faint whiff of redwood i felt bad about not telling her the full truth about quitting the is and the death threats id survived i hadnt wanted to worry her hi mom i said pulling back this is nick sparagmos and you remember jenks of course i do its good to see you again jenks she stepped back into the threshold a hand briefly going to her faded straight red hair and then her calflength sweater dress a knot of worry loosened in me she looked good better than the last time the mischievous glint was back in her eyes and she moved quickly as she ushered us inside come in come in she said putting a small hand on nicks shoulder before the bugs follow you the hall light was on but it did little to illuminate the shadowy green hallway pictures lined the narrow space and i felt claustrophobic as she gave me another fierce hug beaming as she pulled away im so glad you came she said then turned to nick so youre nick she said giving him a onceover her lower lip between her teeth she nodded sharply as she saw his scuffed dress shoes then her lips twisted in thought as she saw my flipflops mrs morgan he said smiling and offering his hand she took it and i winced as she pulled him staggering into a hug she was a great deal shorter than he was and after his first startled moment he grinned at me over her head how wonderful to meet you she said as she let him go and turned to jenks the pixy had put himself at the ceiling hi mrs morgan you look nice tonight he said warily dipping slightly thank you she smiled her few wrinkles deepening the house smelled like spaghetti sauce and i wondered if i should have warned mom that nick was human well come all the way in can you stay for lunch im making spaghetti no problem to make a little more i couldnt help my sigh as she led the way to the kitchen slowly i started to relax mom seemed to be watching her mouth more than usual we entered the kitchen bright from the overhead light and i breathed easier it looked normalhuman normal my mom didnt do much spelling anymore and only the dissolution vat of saltwater by the fridge and the copper spell pot on the stove gave anything away she had been in high school during the turn and her generation was very discreet we just came to pick up my ley line stuff i said knowing my idea to get it and run was a lost cause since the copper pot was full of boiling water for pasta its no trouble she said as she added a sheaf of spaghetti ran her eyes down nick then added another its after seven youre hungry arent you nick yes mrs morgan he said despite my pleading look she turned from the stove content and you jenks i dont have much in the yard but youre welcome to what you can find or i can mix up some sugar water if youd like jenks brightened thank you maam he said flitting close enough to send the wisps of her red hair waving ill check the yard would you mind if i gathered the pollen from your rose of sharon it will do my youngest a world of good this late in the season my mother beamed of course help yourself those damned fairies have just about killed everything looking for spiders her eyebrows arched and i froze in a moment of panic she had a thought no telling what it was might you happen to have any children who would be interested in a late summer job she asked and my breath escaped me in a relieved sound jenks landed on her offered hand wings glowing a satisfied pink yes maam my son jax would be delighted to work your yard he and my two eldest daughters would be enough to keep the fairies out ill send them tomorrow before sunup if you like by the time you have your first cup of coffee there wont be a fairy in sight marvelous my mother exclaimed those damn bastards have been in my yard all summer drove my wrens away nick started at the foul word coming from such a mildlooking lady and i shrugged jenks flew an arching path from the back door to me in an unspoken request for me to open it if you dont mind he said hovering by the knob ill just nip out and take a look i dont want them running into anything unexpected hes just a boy and i want to be sure he knows what to watch out for excellent idea my mother said her heels clacking on the white linoleum she flicked on the back light and let him out well she said as she turned eyeing nick sit down please would you like something to drink water coffee i think i have a beer somewhere coffee would be great mrs morgan nick said as he pulled a chair from under the table and lowered himself into it i opened the fridge for the coffee and my mom took the bag of grounds out of my hands fussing with soft mother sounds until i sat beside nick the scraping of my chair was loud and i wished she wasnt making such a fuss nick grinned clearly enjoying my disquiet coffee she said as she puttered about i admire a man who likes coffee with lunch you have no idea how glad i am to meet you nick its been so long since rachel brought a boy home even in high school she wasnt much for dating i was starting to wonder if she was going to lean the other way if you know what i mean mom i exclaimed feeling my face go as red as my hair she blinked at me not that theres anything wrong with that she amended scooping out the grounds and filling the filter i couldnt look at nick hearing the amusement in him as he cleared his throat i put my elbows on the table and dropped my head into my hands but you know me my mother added her back to us as she put the coffee away i cringed waiting for whatever was going to come out of her mouth im of the mind that its better to have no man than the wrong one your father now he was the right man sighing i looked up if she was talking about dad she wouldnt be talking about me such a good man she said motions slow as she went to the stove she stood sideways so she could see us as she took the lid off the sauce and stirred it you need the right man to have children with we were lucky with rachel she said even so we almost lost her nick sat up interested how so mrs morgan her face went long in an old worry and i rose to plug the coffeemaker in since she had forgotten the coming story was embarrassing but it was a known embarrassment much better than what she might come out with especially after having mentioned children i sat down beside nick as my mom started in with the usual opening line rachel was born with a rare blood disease she said we had no idea it was there just waiting for an inopportune match to show itself nick turned to me his eyebrows raised you never told me that well she doesnt have it anymore my mother said the nice woman at the clinic explained everything saying that we were fortunate with rachels older brother and that we had a oneoutoffour chance that my next child would be like rachel that sounds like a genetic disorder he said you usually dont get better from those my mother nodded and turned the flame down under the boiling pasta rachel responded to a course of herbal remedies and traditional medications shes our miracle baby nick didnt look convinced so i added my mitochondria were kicking out this odd enzyme and my white blood cells thought it was an infection they were attacking healthy cells as if they were invaders mostly the bone marrow and anything that had to do with blood production all i know was i was tired all the time the herbal remedies helped but it was when puberty kicked in that everything seemed to settle down im fine now except for being sensitive to sulfer but it did shorten my life span by about ten years least thats what they tell me nick touched my knee under the table im sorry i flashed him a smile hey whats ten years i wasnt supposed to make it to puberty i didnt have the heart to tell him that even with ten years sliced off my life expectancy i was still going to live decades past him but he probably already knew that monty and i met at school nick my mother said bringing the conversation back to its original topic i knew she didnt like talking about the first twelve years of my life it was so romantic the university had just started their paranormal studies and there was a lot of confusion about prerequisites anyone could take anything i had no business being in a ley line class and the only reason i signed up for it was because the gorgeous hunk of witch in front of me at the registrars office was and all my alternate classes were full her spoon in the pot slowed and steam wafted over her funny how fate seems to push people together sometimes she said softly i took that class to sit next to one man but ended up falling in love with his best friend she smiled at me your father all three of us partnered for the lab i would have flunked if it hadnt been for monty im not a ley line witch and since monty couldnt stir a spell to save his life he set all my circles for me the next two years in return for me invoking all his charms for him until he graduated i had never heard this one before and as i rose to get three coffee mugs my gaze fell upon the pot of red sauce brow pinching i wondered if there was a tactful way to spill it down the garbage disposal she was cooking in her spell pot again too i hoped she had remembered to wash it in saltwater or lunch might be a bit more interesting than usual how did you and rachel meet my mother asked as she nudged me away from the pot and set a loaf of frozen bread to bake in the oven eyes suddenly wide i shook my head in warning at nick his eyes flicked from me to my mother ah a sporting event the howlers she questioned nick looked to me for help and i sat beside him we met at the rat fights mom i said i bet on the mink and he bet on the rat rat fights she said making a face nasty business that who won they got away nick said his eyes soft on mine we always imagined they escaped together and fell madly in love and are living in the citys sewers somewhere i choked back a laugh but my mother let hers flow freely my heart seemed to catch at the sound i hadnt heard her laugh in delight in a long time yes she said as she set her oven mitts aside i like that minks and rats just like monty and me with no more children i blinked wondering how she had jumped from rats and minks to her and dad and how that related to them not having any more children nick leaned close and whispered minks and rats cant procreate either my mouth opened in a silent oh and i thought that perhaps nick with his odd way of seeing the world might understand my mother better than i did nick dear my mom said as she gave the sauce a quick clockwise turn you dont have a cellular disease in your family do you oh no i thought in panic as nick answered evenly no mrs morgan call me alice she said i like you marry rachel and have lots of kids mom i exclaimed nick grinned enjoying it but not right away she continued enjoy your freedom together for a while you dont want children until youre ready you are practicing safe sex yes mother i shouted shut up god help me get through this night she turned one hand on her hip the other holding the dripping spoon rachel if you didnt want me to bring it up you should have spelled your hickey i stared at her my mouth agape mortified i rose and pulled her into the hall excuse us i managed seeing nick grinning mom i whispered in the safety of the hall you ought to be on medication you know that her head drooped he seems like a nice man i dont want you to drive him away like you do all your other boyfriends i loved your father so i just want you to be that happy immediately my anger fizzled to nothing seeing her standing alone and upset my shoulders shifted in a sigh i should come over more often i thought mom i said hes human oh she said softly guess there isnt much safer sex than that is there i felt bad as the weight of that simple statement fell on her and i wondered if that might change her opinion of nick there could never be any children between nick and me the chromosomes didnt line up right finding that out for sure had been the end of a longrunning controversy among inderlanders proving that witches unlike vamps and weres were a separate species from humans as much as pixies or trolls vamps and weres whether bitten or born to their status were only modified humans though witches mimicked humanity almost perfectly we were as different as bananas from fruit flies at a cellular level with nick i would be barren i had told nick the first time our cuddling turned to something more intent afraid he would notice if something didnt look quite right i had been almost sick with the thought he would react in disgust about the different species thing then i almost cried when his only wideeyed question had been it all looks and works the same doesnt it at the time i honestly hadnt known we had answered that question together flushing at such thoughts in front of my mother i gave her a weak smile she returned it pulling her slight body up straight well she said ill go open a jar of alfredo then tension drained from me and i gave her a hug her grip had a new tightness to it and i responded in kind id missed her thanks mom i whispered she patted my back and we stepped apart not meeting my eyes she turned to the kitchen ive an amulet in the bathroom if you want it third drawer down she took a breath and with a cheerful face headed into the kitchen with quick short steps i listened for a moment deciding nothing had changed as she chattered happily to nick about the weather while packing the tomatobased sauce away relieved i thumped down the shadowed hall in my flipflops my moms bathroom looked eerily like ivysminus the fish in the bathtub i found the amulet and after washing off the covergirl i invoked the spell pleased at the result a final primp and sigh at my hair and i hustled back to the kitchen no telling what my mom would tell nick if i left her alone with him too long sure enough i found them together with their heads almost touching as she pointed at the photo album he had a cup of coffee in his hands the steam drifting between them mom i complained this is why i never bring anyone over jenkss wings made a harsh clatter as he rose from my mothers shoulder aw lighten up witch weve already got past the naked baby pictures i closed my eyes to gather my strength moving with a happy swing in her step my mother went to stir the alfredo sauce i took her place by nick pointing down thats my brother robert i said wishing he would return my phone calls and theres my dad i said feeling a soft emotion fill me i smiled back at the photo missing him he looks nice nick said he was the best i turned the page and jenks landed on it hands on his hips as he strolled over my life carefully arranged in neat little rows and columns thats my favorite picture of him i said tapping an unlikely looking group of elevenand twelveyearold girls standing before a yellow bus we were all sunburned our hair three shades lighter than usual mine was cropped short and stuck out all over my dad was standing beside me a hand on my shoulder as he smiled at the camera i felt a sigh slip from me those are all my friends at camp i said thinking my three years there had been some of my best summers look i said pointing you can see the lake it was way up in new york somewhere i only went swimming once since it was so cold made my toes cramp up i never went to camp nick said looking at the faces intently it was one of those makeawish camps i said they kicked me out when they figured out i wasnt dying anymore rachel my mother protested not everyone there was dying most were my mood went somber as my gaze roved over the faces and i realized i was probably the only one in the picture still alive i tried to remember the name of the thin blackhaired girl standing beside me not liking it when i couldnt she had been my best friend rachel was asked to not come back after she lost her temper my mom said not because she was getting well she got it into her head to punish a little boy for teasing the girls little boy i scoffed he was older than everyone else there and a bully what did you do nick asked a glint of amusement in his brown eyes i got up to put coffee in my mug threw him into a tree jenks snickered and my mother rapped the spoon on the side of the sauce pot dont be modest rachel tapped the ley line the camp was built on and threw him thirty feet up jenks whistled and nicks eyes grew wide i poured out the coffee embarrassed it hadnt been a very good day the brat had been about fifteen and was tormenting the girl whose shoulder my arm was draped over in the picture i had told him to leave her alone and when he pushed me down i lost it i hadnt even known how to draw on a ley line it just kind of happened the kid landed in a tree fell and cut his arm there had been so much blood i got scared the young vamps in the camp all had to take a special overnight trip across the lake until they could dig up the dirt he had bled on and burn it my dad had to fly up and sort things out it was the first time i had used ley lines and basically the last until i went to college since my dad had tanned my hide but good id been lucky they hadnt made me leave right then and there i went back to the table looking at him smiling at me from the photo mom can i have this picture i lost mine this spring whena misaligned spell took them out i met nicks eyes the shared understanding in them reassuring me hed say nothing about my death threats my mom sidled close thats a nice one of your father she said pulling the photo out and handing it to me before she went back to the stove i sat down in my chair and looked at the faces searching for a name for any of them i could recall none it bothered me um rachel nick said peering down at the album what amanda i silently asked the darkhaired girl was that your name jenkss wings flashed into motion sending my hair to dance about my face holy crap he exclaimed i looked down to the picture that had been under the one now in my hand and felt my face go white it was the same day since the background was of the bus but this time instead of being surrounded by preadolescent girls my dad was next to a man who was a dead ringer for an older trent kalamack my breath wouldnt come out the two men were smiling squinting against the sun they had an arm companionably about each others shoulders and were clearly happy i exchanged frightened looks with jenks mom i finally managed who is this she came close making a small sound of surprise oh i had forgotten i had that one thats the man who owned the camp your father and he were such good friends it broke your dads heart when he died and so tragically too not six years after his wife i think that was part of the reason your dad lost the will to fight they died only a week apart you know no i didnt i whispered staring down it wasnt trent but the resemblance was eerie it had to be his father my dad had known trents father i put a hand to my stomach in a sudden thought i had gone to camp with a rare blood disease and left every year feeling better trent dabbled in genetic research his father might have done the same my recovery had been called a miracle perhaps it had been outlawed immoral genetic manipulation god help me i breathed three summers at camp months of not waking until almost sundown the unexplained soreness in my hip the nightmares i still occasionally woke from of a cloying vapor how much i wondered what had trents father taken from my dad in payment for the life of his daughter had he exchanged it for his own rachel nick said are you okay no i concentrated on breathing staring at the picture can i have this one too mom i asked hearing my voice as if it werent my own oh i dont want it she said and i slipped it out fingers trembling thats why it was underneath you know i cant throw anything of your fathers away thanks i whispered fifteen i wedged one of my fuzzy pink slippers off and dismally scratched the back of my calf with my toe it was after midnight but the kitchen was bright gleams of fluorescent light reflecting off my copper spell pots and hanging utensils standing at the stainless steel island i ground the pestle into the mortar pulping the wild geranium into a green paste jenks had found it in a vacant lot for me trading one of his precious mushrooms for it the pixy clan that worked the lot had gotten the better end of the deal but i think jenks felt sorry for them nick had made us sandwiches about a half an hour ago and the lasagna was put away into the fridge still hot my bologna sandwich had been tasteless i didnt think i could blame it all on the fact that nick hadnt put ketchup on it as i asked saying he couldnt find any in the fridge stupid human foible id find it endearing if it didnt tick me off so much ivy had yet to show and i wouldnt eat the lasagna by myself in front of nick i wanted to talk to her but id have to wait until she was ready she was the most private person i knew not even telling herself what her feelings were until she found a logical reason to justify them bob the fish swam in my nexttothelargest spell pot beside me on the counter i was going to use him as my familiar i needed an animal and fish were animals right besides jenks would flip out if i so much as hinted at a kitten and ivy had given her owls to her sister after one narrowly escaped being torn apart when it caught jenkss youngest daughter jezebel was fine the owl might be able to fly again someday depressed i continued to grind the leaves to a pulp earth magic held more power when made between sunset and midnight but tonight i was having difficulty concentrating and it was already past one my thoughts kept circling back to that photo and the makeawish camp a heavy sigh escaped me nick looked up from the opposite side of the counter where he was perched on a bar stool finishing off the last of the bologna sandwiches give it up rachel he said smiling to soften his words clearly knowing where my thoughts lay i dont think youve been tampered with and even if you were how could anyone prove it i let the pestle fall still and pushed the mortar away my father died because of me i said if it hadnt been for me and my damned blood disease hed still be here i know it his long face went sad in his mind it was probably his fault you were sick that made me feel a whole lot better and i slumped where i stood maybe they were just friends like your mom said nick offered and maybe trents father tried to blackmail my dad into something illegal and died because he wouldnt do it at least he had taken trents dad with him nick stretched his long arm out to snag the photo still on the counter where i had dropped it i dont know he said his voice soft as he gazed at it they look like friends to me i wiped my hands off on my jeans and leaned to take the picture my eyes crinkled as i scanned my dads face sealing my emotions away i handed it back i didnt get well because of herbal remedies and spells ive been tampered with it was the first time i had said it aloud and my stomach tightened but youre alive he offered i turned away and measured six cups of springwater the tinkling as it ran into my largest copper spell pot sounded loud what if it got out i asked unable to look at him theyd pack me up and put me away on some frozen island like i was a leper afraid whatever he did to me might mutate into something and start another plague oh rachel nick slipped from his stool anxious i busied myself needlessly drying the measuring cup he came up behind me giving me a backward hug before turning me around to face him youre not a plague waiting to happen he cajoled meeting my eyes if trents father cured your blood disease then he did but it was just that he fixed it nothings going to happen see im still here he smiled alive and everything i sniffed not liking that it bothered me so much i dont want to owe him anything you dont this was between your father and trents and thats assuming it even happened his hands were warm around my waist my feet were between his and i laced my fingers behind his back and balanced my weight against his own just because your dad and trents father knew each other it doesnt mean anything he said right i thought sarcastically we let go of each other at the same time stepping reluctantly away while nick stuck his head in the pantry i checked over my recipe for the transfer medium the text i had for binding a familiar was in latin but i knew the scientific names of the plants enough to follow it i was hoping nick would help with the incantation thanks for keeping me company i said knowing that he had a halfday shift at the university tomorrow and a night shift at the museum if he didnt leave soon he wouldnt get any sleep before he had to go to work nick glanced at the black hallway as he sat down on his stool with a bag of chips i was hoping to be here when ivy came back why dont you spend the night at my house my lips curled in a smile ill be fine she wont come home until shes calmed down but if youre going stay for a while how about sketching some pentagrams for me the crackle of plastic stopped nick looked at my black paper and silver chalk stacked suspiciously on the counter then to me amusement lit his eyes and he finished rolling down the edges of the bag im not going to do your homework rayray i know what they look like i protested putting the clippings of my hair into the spell pot and pushing them down with my ceramic spoon until they sank i promise ill copy them myself later but if i dont hand them in tomorrow shell flunk me and edden will deduct the cost of tuition from my fee its not fair nick the woman has it in for me nick ate a chip skepticism pouring from him you know them i nodded and he wiped his hand on his jeans before pulling my textbook closer all right he challenged as he tilted the book so i couldnt see what does a pentagram of protection look like my breath escaped me in a relieved whoosh and i added the sanicle decoction id prepared earlier standard graph with two braided lines in the outer circle okayhow about divination new moons sketched at the points and a mobius strip in the center for balance the amused glint in nicks eye turned to surprise summoning he prompted i smiled and dropped the pulped wild geranium into the brew the bits of green hung suspended as if the water were a gel cool which one summoning internal power or a physical entity both internal power has acorns and oak leaves in the midpoints and summoning an entity uses a celtic chain binding the points smug at his obvious surprise i adjusted the flame under the pot and dug in my silverware drawer for a finger stick okay im impressed the book slipped down and he grabbed a handful of chips youll copy them for me i asked delighted promise youll do them yourself later deal i said cheerfully i had already finished the short essays now all i had to do was make bob my familiar and id be set piece of cake i looked at bob and cringed yeah piece of cake thanks i said softly as nick straightened my black drawing paper by tapping the ends on the counter ill make them sloppy so she thinks you did them he said i gave him a raised eyebrow look thanks a lot i amended dryly and he grinned done with the brew i jabbed my finger and massaged out three drops of blood the scent of redwood blossomed as they plunked into the pot and the spell quickened so far so good earth witches dont use pentagrams nick said as he sharpened the chalk by rubbing it against a piece of scrap paper how come you know them careful to keep my bloodied finger clear i polished my scrying mirror with a velveteen scarf borrowed from ivy a shudder sifted through me at the cold feel of it i hated scrying it gave me the willies from those pentagram jelly glasses i said nick looked up the lost look on his face making me feel good for some reason you know those jelly jars you can use for juice glasses when theyre empty these had pentagrams on the bottom and their uses written on the side i lived on peanut butter and jelly sandwiches that year my mood went soft at the memory of my dad quizzing me over toast nick rolled his sleeves up and started sketching and i thought i was bad for digging to the bottom of my cereal box for the toy i was done with the prep work and ready to do some serious spelling time to set my circle in or out i asked and nick looked up from my homework blinking seeing his confusion i added im ready to set my circle do you want to be in or out of it he hesitated you want me to move only if you want to be out of it his look turned incredulous youre going to enclose the entire island is that a problem noooo nick scooted his bar stool closer witches must be able to hold more ley line power than humans i cant make a circle much bigger than three feet across i smiled i dont know id ask dr anders if she wouldnt make me feel like an idiot i think it depends my mom cant hold a circle bigger than three feet either soin or out in my breath slipped from me in relief good i was hoping youd say that leaning over the counter i plunked my spell book down beside him i need your help translating this you want me to do your homework and help you bind your familiar too he protested i winced the only spell i could find in my books was in latin nick looked at me in disbelief rachel i sleep at night i glanced at the clock above the sink its only onethirty sighing he slid the book to him i knew he wouldnt be able to resist once he started and sure enough his mild annoyance shifted to hot interest before he had read more than a paragraph hey this is old latin i leaned across the counter until my shadow covered the print i can read the plant names and im sure i made the transfer medium right as its standard but the incantation is iffy he wasnt listening anymore his brow furrowed as he ran a long finger under the text your circle needs to be modified to resolve and gather power thanks i said glad he was going to help i didnt mind muddling through most things but spelling was an exact science and just the idea that i needed a familiar made me uncomfortable most witches had them but ley line witches needed them as a matter of safety dividing ones aura helped prevent a demon from pulling you into the everafter poor bob nick went back to sketching pentagrams for me glancing up as i pulled my twenty pound bag of salt from under the counter and set it thumping on top acutely aware of his eyes on me i scraped a handful from the clumping mass at ivys insistence i had blown off the security deposit and etched a shallow circle in the linoleum ivy had helped actually ivy had done all of it using a string and chalk contraption to be sure the circle was perfect id sat on the counter and let her have at it knowing it would tick her off if i got in her way the result was an absolutely perfect circle she had even taken a compass and marked true north with black nail polish to show me where to start my circle now peering down to find the black dot i carefully sifted salt moving clockwise around the island until i found my starting point i added the doodads for protection and divination put the green candles at the appropriate places then lit them from the flame that id used to make the transfer medium nick watched with half his attention i liked that he accepted me as a witch when we had met id worried that since he was one of the few humans who practiced the black arts i would eventually have to smack him up and turn him in but nick had taken demonology to improve his latin and get through a language development class not to summon demons and the novelty of a human who accepted magic with such ease was a definite turnon last chance to leave i said as i turned the gas burner off and moved the media to the center island nick made a noise deep in his throat setting his perfect pentagram aside and starting on the next envious of his smooth straight lines i pushed my paraphernalia aside to make a clear spot on the counter across from him the memory of being punished for having unknowingly tapped into a ley line and flinging the camp bully into a tree flashed through me i thought it stupid that my dislike of ley lines might stem from the childhood incident but i knew it was more than that i didnt trust ley line magic it was too easy to lose sight of which side ones magic was on with earth witchcraft it was easy if you have to slaughter goats its probably a good bet its black magic ley line magic required a death payment too but it is a more nebulous death taken from your soul much harder to quantify and easier to dismissuntil its too late the cost for white ley line witchcraft was negligible tantamount to me pulling weeds and using them in my spelling but the unfiltered power available through ley lines was seductive it took a strong will to stick to selfimposed limits and remain a white ley line witch the boundaries that looked so reasonable and prudent when set often seemed foolish or timid when the strength of a line coursed through you id seen too many friends go from the pulling weeds analogy to slaughtering goats without even realizing theyd made the jump to the black arts and they never listened saying i was jealous or a fool eventually id find myself hauling their asses down to the is lockup when they put a black charm on the cop who pulled them over for going fifty in a thirtyfive zone maybe that was why i couldnt keep my friends those were the ones that bothered me basically good people who had been tempted by a power greater than their will they were pitiable their souls slowly eaten away to pay for the black magic they played with but it was the professional black witches who scared me those strong enough to foster the souldeath onto someone else to pay for their magic eventually though the souldeath found its way home probably dragging a demon along with it all i knew was there was screaming and blood and great big booms that shook the city and then i didnt have to worry about that particular witch anymore i wasnt that strong of will i knew it accepted it and avoided the problem by shunning ley lines whenever i could i hoped that taking a fish as my familiar wasnt the start of a new path but just a speed bump in my current road glancing at bob i vowed thats all it would be all witches had familiars and there was nothing in that binding spell that would hurt anyone taking a slow breath i closed my eyes to prepare myself for the coming disorientation of connecting to a ley line slowly i willed my second sight into focus the stench of burnt amber tickled my nose an unseen wind shifted my hair though the kitchen window was closed it was always windy in the everafter i imagined the walls that surrounded me becoming transparent and in my minds eye they did my second sight strengthened and the sensation of being outside grew until the mental scenery beyond the walls of the church became as real as the counter unseen under my fingers eyes closed to block my mundane vision i glanced over the nonexistent kitchen with my minds eye nick didnt show up at all and the memory of the churchs walls had vanished to faint silvery chalk lines through them i could see the surrounding landscape it was parklike with a glowing red haze reflecting off the bottom of clouds where cincinnati would be hiding behind the stunted trees it was common knowledge that the demons had their own city built on the same ley lines as cincinnati the trees and plants carried a similar reddish glow and though no wind whispered through the linden tree outside the kitchen the branches of the stunted everafter trees tossed in the wind that lifted my hair there were people who got off on the discrepancies between reality and the everafter but i thought it freaking uncomfortable someday id go up carew tower and look at the broken glowing demon city with my second sight my stomach tightened yeah sure i would my gaze was drawn to the graveyard by the stark almost glowing white tombstones they and the moon were the only things that seemed to exist without that red glow unchanged in both worlds and i stifled a shudder the ley line made a solidlooking red smear running due north at head height above the tombstones it was smallnot even twenty yards i guessedbut so underused that it seemed stronger than the enormous ley line the university straddled conscious that nick was probably watching with his own second sight i stretched out my will and touched the ribbon of power i staggered forcing my eyes to remain shut as my grip tightened on the counter my pulse leapt and my breath quickened swell i whispered thinking the force surging into me seemed stronger than the last time i stood and did nothing as the influx continued trying to equalize our strengths my fingertips tingled and my toes ached as it backwashed at my theoretical extremities which mirrored my real ones finally it began to balance and a trace of energy left me to rejoin the line it was as if i was part of a circuit and the lines passage left a growing residue that made me feel slimy the link with the ley line was heady and no longer able to keep my eyelids closed they flew open my cluttered kitchen replaced the silver outlines queasy with disorientation i tried to reconcile my minds eye with my more mundane vision using them simultaneously though i couldnt see nick with my second sight it would cast shadows upon him through my usual vision sometimes there was no difference but i was willing to bet nick wouldnt be one of those people our eyes met and i felt my face go slack his aura was rimmed in black it wasnt necessarily bad but it pointed to an uncomfortable direction his narrow build looked gaunt and where his bookish mien gave him a scholarly air before now it had undertones of danger but what shocked me was the black circular shadow upon his left temple it was where the demon he had saved me from had put its mark an iou that nick would someday have to repay immediately i looked at my wrist my skin showed only the usual upraised scar tissue in the shape of a circle with a line running through it that didnt mean that was all nick could see though holding my arm up i asked him is it glowing black he nodded solemnly his usual appearance starting to overshadow his threatening look as my minds eye began to falter under the strength of my mundane sight its the demon mark isnt it i said as i ran my fingers over my wrist i didnt see any hint of black but i couldnt see my aura either yes he said softly did uh anyone tell you that you look really different while channeling a ley line i nodded my balance wavering as the two realities clashed different was better than scary as all hell which is what ivy had called me once do you want out of the circle i havent closed it yet no immediately i felt better a properly closed circle couldnt be broken except by its maker he didnt mind being trapped inside with me and his show of trust was gratifying all right then here goes taking a steadying breath i mentally moved the narrow rill of salt from this dimension to the everafter my circle made the jump with the sharpness of a snapping rubber band against my skin i started as the salt winked out of existence replaced with an equal ring of everafter the spinetingling jolt was expected but it got me every time i hate it when it does that i said as i glanced at nick but he was staring at my circle whoa he breathed in awe look at that did you know they were going to do that i followed his gaze to the candles and my jaw dropped they had gone transparent the flames still flickered but the green wax glowed with an utterly unreal look nick slid from his stool edging carefully around the counter to avoid hitting the circle he crouched by one of the candles and i almost panicked when he extended a finger to touch it no i shouted and he jerked his hand back um i think they shifted to the everafter with the salt i dont know what touching them will do just dont okay he nodded as he stood looking properly cowed he went back to his stool he didnt pick up the chalk though he was going to watch i smiled weakly at him not liking that i was at such a disadvantage with ley line magic but if i followed the recipe id be fine all but the barest remnant of power i had drawn from the ley line was now running through my circle i could feel it pressing against my skin the moleculethin slice of the everafter was a red smear between me and the rest of the world making a dome arching just over my head nothing could get through the bands of alternating realities the oblong sphere was mirrored below me as well and if it had run into any pipes or electrical lines the circle would not have been perfect but vulnerable to breakage at that point though most of the ley line force had gone into sealing the circle there was already a secondary buildup beginning in me it was slower almost insidiously so it would continue until i broke the circle and disconnected from the ley line ley line witches knew how to properly store power but i didnt and if i remained connected to the line too long it would drive me insane the bare hour id need would come nowhere near too long satisfied the circle was secure i let my second sight die completely the vision of nicks aura was lost to me ready for step two he asked and i nodded setting his pentagrams completely aside he pulled the old book closer his brow furrowed as he ran a finger under the text to leave a chalk mark as he read next you remove all charms and spells from yourself he looked up maybe you should have taken a salt bath no the only charms i have are amulets i pulled the spell i had gotten from my mom off the cord tugging at my hair i felt my neck giving nick a lopsided grin at his attention on it after a moments hesitation i worked my pinkie ring off and set it aside i knew it nick exclaimed i knew you had freckles it was the ring wasnt it he was reaching out and i handed it to him across the clutter between us my dad gave it to me for my thirteenth birthday i said see the wood inlay i have to renew it every year nick glanced at me from under his bangs i like your freckles embarrassed i took my ring back and set it aside what do i do now he glanced down um prepare the transfer medium done i said giving the spell pot a sharp tap to hear it ring this wasnt so bad okay he was silent and the ticking clock seemed to grow loud still reading he said now you have to stand on your scrying mirror and push your aura down into your reflection his brown eyes pinched in worry as they met mine you can do that in theory thats why i was so picky about the circle until i get my aura back ill be vulnerable to all sorts of things he nodded his gaze distant in thought will you watch and tell me if it works i cant see my own aura sure it isnt going to hurt is it i shook my head as i took up the scrying mirror and set it on the floor looking down at its black surface i was reminded of why i had worked so hard to avoid ley line magic its perfect blackness seemed to soak up the light but at the same time was still shiny i couldnt see myself in it and it pegged my creepy meter barefoot nick added and i kicked off my slippers taking a deep breath i stepped onto the mirror it was as cold as it was black and i stifled a shiver feeling i might fall through it as if it were a pothole euwie i said making a face at the pulling sensation from under my feet nick stared standing up and looking over the counter at my feet its working he said his face suddenly pale swallowing i took my hands and ran them down my head as if pushing off water an ache set my head to throb oh yeah nick said sounding sick that pulls it off much faster it feels awful i muttered as i continued to push my aura down to my feet i knew it was going by the soft ache its absence left behind there was a taste of metal on my tongue and i glanced at the black surface my mouth dropping as i saw my reflection in it for the first time my red hair hung about my face looking just as i would have expected but my features were lost behind a smear of amber is my aura brown i asked its bright gold nick answered as he dragged his stool around to my side of the counter mostly i think you got it all can we move on hearing the unease in his voice i met his eyes please good he sat and pulled the book onto his lap head bowed he read the next passage okay put the scrying mirror into the transfer medium being careful not to let your fingers touch the media or your aura will reattach and youll have to start over i refused to look in the mirror worried that id see myself trapped in it shoulders tense i scuffed my slippers back on my feet ached and my head throbbed with the beginnings of a migraine if i didnt finish this quickly i was going to be stuck in a dark room with a washcloth all day tomorrow taking up the mirror i gingerly slipped it into the media the specks of wild geranium flashed to nothing dissolved by my aura it was eerie even by my standards and i couldnt help an ooooh of appreciation whats next i asked wanting to be done with it so i could take my aura back nicks head was bent over the book next you need to anoint your familiar with the transfer medium but you have to be careful to not touch the media yourself he looked up how do you anoint a fish i felt my face go slack i dont know maybe i could just slip him into the vat along with the mirror i reached for the book on his lap turning the page isnt there anything about making a fish your familiar i questioned everything else is in there nick pushed my hands from the pages as one tore no go put your fish in the spell pot if it doesnt work well try something else my mood went sour i dont want my aura smelling like fish i said as i dipped a hand into bobs bowl and he snickered bob didnt want to go in the spell pot trying to catch his darting shape in a round bowl was almost impossible getting him out of the bathtub had been easyi simply drained it until he was beachedbut now after a frustrating moment of near misses i was ready to dump him onto the floor finally i got him and dripping water over the counter dropped him in i peered into the spell pot watching his gills pump the amber liquid okay i said hoping he was all right hes anointed whats next just an incantation and when the transfer medium goes clear you can take back the aura your familiar left you incantation i said thinking ley line magic was stupid earth magic didnt need incantations earth magic was precise and beautiful in its simplicity my eyes shifted to the notthere candles and i stifled a shudder here ill read it for you he stood up with the book and i made a spot for it beside bob in the bowl i leaned close to him over the book thinking he smelled good manly good intentionally bumping into him i felt a warm current that was probably his aura too busy deciphering the text he didnt notice sighing i put my attention on the book nick cleared his throat his eyebrows bunched and his lips moved as he whispered the words sounding dark and dangerous i caught about one in every three words he finished giving me one of his half smiles how about that he said it rhymes a sigh shifted my shoulder do i need to say it in latin i wouldnt think so the only reason they made these things rhyme is so the witch can remember them its the intent behind the words rather than the words themselves that does the trick he bent back over the book give me a moment and ill translate it i think i can even make it rhyme for you latin is very loose in its interpretation okay nervous and jittery i tucked my hair behind an ear and looked into the spell pot bob didnt look happy pars tibi totum mihi vinctus vinculis prece factis nick looked up ah some to you but all to me bound by ties made so by plea i dutifully repeated it feeling silly invocations could it be any more hokey next id be standing on one foot and shaking a posy of feathers at the full moon nicks finger ran under the print luna servata lux sanata chaos statutum pejus minutum his brow furrowed lets go with moon made safe ancient light made sane chaos decreed taken tripped if bane i echoed him thinking ley line witches had a substantial lack of imagination mentem tegens malum ferens semper servus dum duret mundus ah id say protection recalled carrier of worth bound before the worlds rebirth oh nick i complained are you sure youre translating that right thats dreadful he sighed try this then he thought for a moment you could also translate it as lee of mind bearer of pain slave until the worlds are slain that i could live with and i said it feeling nothing we both peered in at bob waiting for the amber liquid to go clear my head pounded but other than that nothing happened i think i did it wrong i said scuffing my slippers ohshit nick swore and i looked up to find him staring over my shoulder at the doorway to the kitchen he swallowed hard his adams apple bobbing the hair on the back of my neck pricked my demon scar gave a pulse breath catching i spun around thinking ivy must be home but it wasnt ivy it was a demon sixteen nick i cried stumbling back the demon grinned it looked like an aristocratic brit except that i recognized it as the one who put on ivys face and tore out my throat that spring my back found the counter i had to run i had to get out of here it would kill me flailing to put the counter between us i hit the spell pot watch the brew nick shouted reaching out even as the bowl tipped i gasped tearing my gaze from the demon long enough to see bobs bowl spill auralaced water spilled over the counter in an amber wash bob slid out flopping rachel nick exclaimed get the fish he has your aura he can break the circle im in a circle i thought strangling my panic the demon isnt it cant hurt me rachel nicks shout tore my eyes from the grinning demon nick was desperately trying to catch bob flopping on the counter and keep the spilled water from reaching the edge my face went cold i was willing to bet just the auralaced water would be enough to break the circle i lunged for the paper towels as nick fumbled for bob i made a mad dash around the counter laying squares of white to sop up rivulets before they could make puddles on the floor that would run to the circle my heart pounded and i frantically alternated my attention from the water to the demon standing with a bewildered amused expression in the archway to the hall gotcha nick whispered his breath exploding from him in a ragged sound as he finally gained control of the fish not the saltwater i warned as nick held him over my dissolution pot here i shoved bobs original bowl at nick ordinary water sloshed out and i blotted it up as nick dropped bob in the fish shuddered sinking to the bottom with his gills pumping silence descended framed by the heavy rasping of our breathing and the ticking of the clock above the sink nicks and my eyes met over the bowl as one we turned to the demon it looked pleasant enough having taken the shape of a young man with a mustache elegant and polished it was dressed as an eighteenth century businessman in a suit of green velvet with lace trim and long tails round glasses were perched atop its thin nose they were smoked to hide its red eyes though able to shift its form and shape at willbecoming everything from my roommate to a punk rockerits eyes stayed the same unless it made the effort to take on all the abilities of whomever it was mimicking hence my demon bite laced with vamp saliva a tremor shook me as i recalled that its pupils were slitted like a goats fear tightened my stomach and i hated being afraid i forced my hands to unclench their grip on my elbows pulled myself straight and tossed my head ever think of updating your wardrobe i mocked i was safe in a circle i was safe in a circle my breath caught as a red mist of everafter hazed it the demons clothes molded to a modernday business suit id expect to see on a fortunetwenty executive this is so common it said its resonate britishladen accent perfect for the stage but i wouldnt want it said that i wasnt accommodating it took its glasses off and my breath hissed in i stared at the alienness of its eyes jerking as nick touched my arm nick looked warynot nearly scared enough to please meand i felt a flush of embarrassment at my earlier panic but damn it demons scared the crap out of me no one risked calling up demons since the turn except for whoever called this one up to maul me last spring and then there had been the one that attacked trent kalamack maybe demon summoning was more common than i wanted to admit i hated that nicks respect for them stopped short of terror they fascinated him and i was afraid his search for knowledge would someday lead him to make a foolish decision letting the tiger turn and eat him the demon smiled to show thick flat teeth as it glanced over its attire it made a deepinthought sound and the wool disappeared to become a black tshirt tucked into leather pants with a gold chain belted around narrow hips a black leather jacket appeared and the demon stretched in a cloud of sensuality showing every curve of the new attractive muscle pulling its tshirt tight across its chest blond hair cut short grew as it shook its head and its height lengthened i felt myself pale it had become kist pulling my old fear of him right out of my head the demon seemed to take great delight in changing into whatever frightened me the most i wouldnt let it shake me i wouldnt oh this is nice the demon said its accent shifting to a sultry badboy drawl to match its new look youre afraid of the prettiest people rachel mariana morgan i rather like being this one licking its lips suggestively it sent its gaze across my neck lingering on the scar it had given me while i was sprawled on the floor of the university librarys basement lost in a haze of vampsalivainduced ecstasy as it killed me the memory sent my heart pounding my hand rose to cover my neck the pressure from its gaze pushed on my skin making it tingle stop it i demanded frightened as it sent the scar into play and tendrils of feeling ran like molten metal from my neck to my groin my breath hissed in through my nose i said stop it the blue of kists eyes went wide and flashed to red seeing my resolve the demons outlines blurred you arent afraid of this one anymore it said its voice shifting to become lower and laden with a proper british accent again pity i do so like to be young and testosterone laden but i know what frightens you lets keep that a secret hum no need to let nick sparagmos know not yet he may want to buy the information nicks breathing sounded harsh beside me as the demon doffed the bikers hatwhich promptly vanished in a haze of everafter redand shifted returning to its previous form of british nobility in lace and green velvet it smiled at me over its round smoked glasses this will do in the meantime it said i jumped as nick touched me why are you here he asked no one called you the demon said nothing glancing over the kitchen with undisguised curiosity showing a predatorial grace it began to circle the bright room its shiny buckled boots silent on the linoleum i know you are new to all of this it mused aloud as it tapped at mr fishs brandy snifter on the windowsill and the fish quivered but generally the summoner is outside the circle and the summoned is on the inside it turned on a heel to send its long coattails furling ill give you that for free rachel mariana morgan because you made me laugh i havent laughed since the turn we all laughed at that my pulse had slowed but my knees felt watery i wanted to sit down but didnt dare how can you be here i asked this is holy ground the vision of british grace opened my fridge making a tsktsk sound it shuffled through the leftovers coming out with a halfempty container of fudge frosting oh yes i do like this arrangement being on the outside is ever so much more interesting i think ill answer that query for free as well oozing old world charm it pulled the top of the frosting off the blue plastic disappeared in a smear of everafter and the demon dipped the gold spoon that had taken its place into the container this isnt holy ground it said as it stood in my kitchen in a gentlemans frock and ate frosting the kitchen was added after the sanctuary was blessed you could have the entire grounds sanctified but then youd connect your bedroom to the ley line in the graveyard ooooh and wouldnt that be delightful a sick feeling twisted my stomach at what that might mean eyebrows raised it looked at me over its smoked glasses its red eyes showing a shocking amount of sudden ire you had better have something worth hearing or im going to be royally buggered i straightened in understanding it thought i had summoned it with an offer of information to pay off my iou my pulse jackhammered back into full throttle as the container of frosting vanished from the demons hand and it came close to the circle dont i blurted as it tapped the sheet of everafter between us the demons face lost its amusement and expression deadly serious it ran its attention over the seam with the floor i gripped nicks arm as it mumbled about tearing summoners limb from limb interrupted teas and how inconsiderate it was to pull someone from their dinner or wednesday night telly adrenaline shook me as the demon dissolved to a red mist and sank through the floorboards i clutched at nick my knees threatening to give way hes checking for pipes i said there are no pipes i looked fear made my shoulders hurt as i waited for the demon to rise through the floor at my feet and kill me i looked i asserted trying to convince myself i knew the circle bisected rocks and roots and the top of it went into the attic but as long as there wasnt an open path like a phone or gas line the circle was secure even a laptop could break a circle if it was connected to the net and an email came in oh good hes back nick breathed as the demon reappeared outside the circle and i stifled a laugh knowing it would sound hysterical what kind of a life did i have when seeing a demon was a good thing the demon stood before us taking a tin of what probably wasnt snuff out of a tiny vest pocket and sniffing a pinch of black powder into both nostrils you cast a wellbuilt circle it said between cultured sneezes as good as your fathers my eyes widened and i stepped to the circles edge what do you know of my dad reputation rachel mariana morgan it simpered strictly reputation he was not in my realm of expertise when he was alive now that hes dead im interested i specialize in secrets as does nick sparagmos it seems it put the tin away and pulled ivys chair out from before her computer now it said idly as it shook the mouse and brought up the internet as amusing as this is can we get on with it your circle is tight i wont be killing you now its red eyes went sly later perhaps i followed its gaze to the clock over the sink it was oneforty i hoped ivy didnt walk in on this an undead vamp might survive a demon attack but a live one would stand as much of a chance as me i took a breath to tell it to go away because i didnt call it but a thought stopped me cold it knew nicks last name it had said it twice it knows your last name i said turning to nick why does it know your name nicks mouth opened and his eyes slid to the demon ah why does it know your name i demanded my hands on my hips i was tired of being afraid and nick was a convenient outlet youve been calling it up havent you well he said his long face reddening you idiot i shouted i told you not to call it you promised you wouldnt no he said his hands taking a grip on my shoulders i didnt you said i wouldnt and it just sort of happened i didnt even mean to call him the first time the first i exclaimed how many times have there been nick scratched the bristles on his cheek see i was sketching pentagramsfor practice i wasnt going to do anything he appeared thinking i was trying to call him with some information to pay off my debt thank god i was in a circle nick glanced at the soggy papers with their silver chalk lines just like he showed up tonight together we turned to the demon and it sent its shoulders to rise and fall in a shrug it seemed more than willing to wait out our argument more interested in ivys favorites list than us at the moment its an it not a him i said and im not going to let you blame this on the demon how very kind of you rachel mariana morgan the demon said and i scowled nick was starting to look angry on sudden impulse i pushed the hair from his left temple my breath caught as i saw two lines bisecting his demon scar instead of one nick i wailed you know what happens when you get too many of those he took a bothered step back and his brown hair fell to hide it it can pull you into the everafter i shouted wanting to smack him a good one i had only one line through my demon scar and the worry still kept me up at night nick said nothing watching me with unrepentant eyes damn it all to hell he wasnt even trying to explain himself talk to me i exclaimed rachel he said nothing is going to happen im being careful but you have two ious i protested if you dont make good you belong to it he smiled confidently and i cursed his belief that the printed word held all the answers and he would be safe if he followed the rules its okay he said as he took my shoulders again ive only entered into a trial contract trial contract i stammered floored nick this isnt twenty cds for a penny with only three more to buy its trying to take your soul the demon chuckled and i flicked a glance at it thats not going to happen nick soothed i can call on him whenever i want same as if i gave him my soul and at the end of three years i walk away with no ties or commitments if it sounds like too good a deal you arent looking at the fine print still he smiled his face showing confidence instead of the terror he should have been feeling i read the fine print his finger rose to touch my lips and stop my outburst all of it i get minor questions answered for free and i can put larger questions to him on credit my eyes closed nick did you know your aura is rimmed in black you look like a wraith in my minds eye so do you love nick whispered pulling me close shocked i did nothing as his arms went about me my aura was as tainted as his i hadnt done anything but let it save my life he has all the answers rachel nick whispered and i felt my hair move with his breath i cant help it the demon cleared its throat and i pulled away from nick nick sparagmos is my best student since benjamin franklin the demon said its accent making it sound completely reasonable as it touched ivys screen to make it go blue it didnt fool me though the thing couldnt be swayed by pity guilt or remorse if it had found a way past my circle it would have killed us both for the audacity of calling it from the everafterwhether it had been intentional or not though attila could have gone far if he had been able to look past the military applications it continued looking at its nails and it is hard to best leonardo di ser piero da vinci for outright cleverness name dropper i muttered and the demon inclined its head graciously it was more obvious than words that if nick had the demon at his beck and call for three years he would agree to anything to keep it there which was exactly what the demon was counting on um rachel nick said as he took my elbow since hes here you might want to arrange for a summoning name from him so he doesnt show up every time you close a circle and draw a pentagram thats how he got my name i gave it to him for his summoning name i know your names rachel mariana morgan the demon said i want a secret my stomach clenched sure i said tiredly scrambling for something i had a few of those my eyes fell on the photo of my dad and trents father and i silently held it up to the transparent sheet of everafter wheres the secret in that the demon mocked two men standing before a bus then it blinked i watched fascinated as the horizontal slits went wide until its eyes were almost black it stood reaching out for it a muttered curse slipped past its lips as its fingers smacked into the barrier i smelled burnt amber my pulse leapt at its sudden interest maybe it was enough to completely pay off my debt interested i taunted clear my debt and ill tell you who they both are the demon fell back chuckling oh you think its that important it mocked but its eyes tracked the photo as i set it on the counter behind me without warning it shifted forms the red blur of everafter melted and flowed i stared appalled as it took on my face it even had freckles it was like staring into a mirror and my skin crawled as my image moved without my volition nick went ashen his long face slack as he stared from me to it i know who both men are the demon said in my voice the one is your father the other is trenton aloysius kalamacks father but the camp bus its eyes fastened on me in a devious delight rachel mariana morgan you have indeed given me a secret it knew trents middle name then the same demon attacked us both someone had wanted us both dead for an instant i was tempted to ask the demon who then dropped my eyes i could find that out on my own and it wouldnt cost me my soul call us even for you having taken me through the ley lines and leave me forever i said and the demon laughed i wondered if my teeth were really that big when i opened my mouth oh you are a love it said in my voice and its accent seeing that picture is enough to buy a summoning name perhaps but if you want to absolve your debt i need something more something that could mean your death if it was whispered into the right ear the thought that i might be rid of it completely filled me with a reckless daring what if i told you why i was there at that camp nick moved nervously beside me but if i got rid of the demon forever it would be worth it the demon snickered you flatter yourself that cant be worth your soul then ill tell you why i was there if i can summon you safely even without a circle i blurted thinking it didnt want to clear my debt simply so it would have a chance at me later at that the demon laughed turning my stomach as its appearance grotesquely shifted back to the british gentleman even as it roared in mirth a promise of safety without a circle it said wiping its eyes when it could speak again theres nothing on this godstinking earth thats worth that i swallowed hard my secret was goodand all i wanted was to be free of itbut it wouldnt believe it was worth it unless i told it first i had a rare blood disease i said before i could change my mind i think trents father fixed it with his illegal genetic therapy the demon chortled you and several thousand other brats coattails furling it strode to the edge of the circle i backpedaled to the counter heart pounding you had better start taking this seriously or i will lose my good it jerked as it caught sight of my book open to the charm for binding a familiar temper it finished the word trailing to nothing where did you it stammered then it blinked sending its goatslitted eyes over me then nick i couldnt have been more surprised when a small sound of disbelief escaped it oh it said sounding shocked damn me thrice nick reached behind me closing the book and covering it with my sheets of black paper suddenly i felt ten times more nervous my gaze roved over the transparent candles and the pentagram made out of salt what in hell was i doing the demon backed away with a deepinthought toetoheel motion whitegloved hand to its chin it eyed me with a new intentness giving me the sensation that it could see through me as easily as i could see through those green candles i had lit not knowing what they were for its quick shift from anger to surprise to an insidious contriving went right to my core shaking me well now lets not be hasty it amended its brow furrowed as it glanced at the gadgetstrewn watch that appeared on its wrist the instant it looked down the watch was a twin to nicks what to do what to do kill you or keep you hold to tradition or bow to progress i do believe the only thing that will stand up in court is to let you decide it smiled and an unstoppable shiver shook me and we do want this to be legal very very legal frightened i slid down the counter to tuck into nick when did what was legal mean anything to a demon i will not kill you if you summon me without a circle the demon said abruptly its heels making a sharp tap on the linoleum as it backed up excitement showing in its jerky motions if im right i will be giving you this anyway well know soon it grinned wickedly i can hardly wait either way youre mine i jumped as nick took my elbow ive never heard of a promise of safety without a circle he whispered his gaze pinched ever thats because its only given to the walking dead nick sparagmos the bad feeling in the pit of my stomach started working its way upward tightening every muscle on the way there was nothing on this godstinking earth worth a riskfree summoning but it gave me that instead of absolving me from my debt oh that had to be good i had overlooked something i knew it resolute i pushed the feeling aside id made bad deals before and survived them fine i said my voice quavering im done with you i want you to go directly back to the everafter with no deviations along the way the demon glanced at its wrist again such a harsh mistress it said elegantly in a grand mood as it opened the freezer and took out a frozen box of microwave fries but as youre in the circle and im out here ill leave when i damn well please its whitegloved hand was enveloped in a red smear clearing to show the fries steaming opening the fridge it frowned no ketchup two pm i thought glancing at the clock why was that important nick i whispered going cold take the batteries out of your watch now what the clock above the sink said five minutes to two i wasnt sure how accurate it was just do it i shouted its connected to colorados atomic clock it sends out a pulse at midnight their time to reset everything the pulse will break the circle just like an active phone line or gas pipe oh shit nick said his slack face going white damn you witch the demon shouted furious i almost had you both nick was frantically working at his watch his long fingers prying at the back do you have a coin i need a dime to get the back off his eyes were frightened as they jerked to the clock above the sink his hand went into a pocket searching give it here i exclaimed snatching the watch i threw it on the counter plucking the meattenderizing hammer from the rack above me i swung no nick cried as pieces of watch went everywhere we had three minutes yet i shrugged off his grip and beat at it you see i exclaimed bringing the hammer down again and again you see how clever it is adrenaline made my motions jerky as i brandished the wooden hammer at him it knew you had that watch it was just waiting thats why it agreed to giving me a safe summoning with a cry of frustration i threw the hammer at the demon it hit the unseen wall of the circle and bounced back to clatter at my feet there wasnt much left of nicks watch but a bent back and shards of quartz nick slumped against the counter the fingers of one hand pressing into his forehead as he bowed his head i thought he wanted to teach me nick whispered all those times he was just trying to get me to keep him with me until the circle broke he jumped as i touched his shoulder staring at me with frightened eyes finally he was frightened do you understand now i said bitterly its going to kill you its going to kill you and take your soul tell me you wont call it again please nick took a quick breath he met my eyes shaking his head ill be more careful he whispered frustrated i spun to the demon get out of here like i told you to i shouted with an unearthly grace the demon stood the vision of a british gentleman took a moment to adjust the lace about its throat and then its cuffs motions slow and deliberate it pushed the chair back under the table it inclined its head to me its red eyes watching from over its glasses congratulations on binding your familiar rachel mariana morgan it said summon me with the name algaliarept tell anyone my name and youre mine by default and dont think that because you dont have to be in a circle to summon me that youre safe you are mine not even your soul is worth your freedom and with that it vanished in a smear of red everafter leaving the scent of grease and fried potatoes seventeen i sat at the lab stool and tapped my ankle against the rungs how much longer do you think she can drag this out i asked janine as i tossed my head to dr anders the woman was at her desk before the blackboard testing one of the students janine popped her gum and twirled a finger in her enviably straight hair her previous fear of my demon mark had turned into a rebellious daring after i told her i got it through my past work with the is yes it was ninety percent a lie but i couldnt bear her distrust of me familiar evaluations take forever the young woman agreed the fingers of her free hand were gentling the fur between her cats ears the white manx had his eyes closed clearly enjoying the attention my gaze slid to bob i had put him in one of those big peanut butter tubs with a lid to get him there janine had oooohed over him but i knew it was a sympathy oooh most everyone had cats one had a ferret i thought that was cool and the man to whom it belonged said they made the best familiars bob and i were the only two left to be evaluated and the room was almost empty but janine was waiting for paula the student with dr anders i nervously pulled bobs bucket closer and glanced out the window to the lights just now flickering on over the parking lot i was hoping to see ivy that night we still hadnt crossed paths since nick knocked her out i knew shed been around there was coffee in the pot that afternoon and the messages were cleared she had gotten herself up and out before i woke up that wasnt like her at all but i knew better than to force a conversation before she was ready hey janine said jerking my attention back paula and i are going out to piscarys for some lunch before the sun goes down and the place fills up with undead vamps do you want to come well wait for you her offer pleased me more than i wanted to admit but i shook my head thanks no ive already made plans to meet my boyfriend nick was working in the next building over and as he quit today about the time my class was supposed to end we were going to mickyds for his dinner and my lunch bring him along janine urged her thick blue eyeliner clashing with her otherwise tasteful appearance having one guy at a table of girls always brings the goodlooking single men to the table i couldnt help my smile noooo i hedged not wanting to tell her piscary scared the peas out of me set my demon scar tingling and was my roommates uncle for lack of a better word nicks human i said itd be kind of awkward youre dating a human janine whispered harshly hey is it true what they say i gave her a sideways look as paula finished with dr anders and joined us about what i asked as paula shoved her unwilling cat into a collapsible carrier amid yowls and spitting i stared appalled as she zipped the door shut you know janine nudged my arm do they have uh are they really pulling my eyes from the shaking carrier i grinned yeah they do they really are yowsers janine exclaimed reaching to take paulas arm you here that paula i gotta charm me a human before i get too old to appreciate him paula was flushed looking especially red against her blond hair stop it she hissed shooting a glance at dr anders what janine said not a bit flustered as she opened her carrier and her cat voluntarily went in curling up and purring i wouldnt marry one but whats wrong with rolling around with a human while youre looking for mr right my dads first wife was human our conversation was cut short as dr anders cleared her throat janine grabbed her purse and slid off the lab stool giving the two women a thin smile i reluctantly dragged bobs peanut butter tub off the lab bench and made my way forward nicks pentagrams were tucked under my arm and dr anders didnt look up as i slid the container onto the open space of her desk i wanted to wrap this up and get out of here nick was going to drive me out to the fib tonight after lunch so i could talk to sara jane glenn had asked her to come in so he could get an idea of dans daily patterns and i wanted to ask her about trents whereabouts the last few days glenn wasnt happy about my angle of investigation but it was my run too damn it nervous i forced myself to the back of the chair beside dr anderss desk wondering if jenks was right and sara janes coming to the fib was trents roundabout way to get his claws into me one thing was certain dr anders wasnt the witch hunter she was nasty but she wasnt a murderer the two women hesitated in the doorway to the hall their cat carriers pulling them both off balance see you monday rachel janine said i gave her a wave and dr anders made an annoyed noise deep in her throat the uptight woman put a blank form on top of the stack of papers and printed my name in large block letters turtle dr anders guessed as she glanced at my container fish i said feeling like an idiot at least you know your limits she said being an earth witch it would be difficult for you to hold enough everafter to bind a rat to you much less the cat im sure you wanted her voice was just shy of patronizing and i had to unkink my hands from their tight grip you see ms morgan dr anders said as she opened the lid and took a peek the more power you can channel the smarter your familiar needs to be i have an african gray parrot as my familiar she brought her gaze to mine is that your homework i stifled a surge of annoyance and handed her a pink folder full of short essays under it were nicks waterspotted pentagrams the black paper curling and warped dr anderss lips were so tight they were bloodless thank you she said tossing nicks sketches aside without even a cursory glance youve got a reprieve ms morgan but you dont belong in my class and i will remove you the first chance i get i kept my breathing shallow i knew she wouldnt dare say that if anyone else was in the room well she murmured as if tired lets see how much aura your fish was able to accept it took a lot my mood shifted to one of nervousness nick had looked over my aura before he left last night pronouncing it to be rather thin it would slowly replace itself but in the interim i felt vulnerable dr anders kept her opinion of my obvious fluster to herself gaze going distant she dipped her fingers into bobs water the skin on the back of my neck tightened and it seemed as if my hair drifted in the wind that always seemed to blow in the everafter i watched fascinated as a blue smear from her hands enveloped bob it was ley line power having turned from red to blue as it reflected the dominant color in the womans aura it was unlikely that dr anders was drawing upon the universitys ley line the power had been taken earlier and stored it made for faster spell casting i was willing to bet having a sphere of everafter in her gut was what made the woman so sour the blue haze about bob vanished as dr anders drew her fingers out of the water take your fish and get out the woman said brusquely consider yourself flunked floored i could do nothing but stare what i finally managed dr anders wiped her fingers dry on a tissue and threw it in her trash can under her desk this fish isnt bound to you if it were the ley line force i cloaked it with would have turned to the color of your aura her gaze went indistinctas if she was looking through methen her focus sharpened your aura is a sickly gold what have you been doing ms morgan to get it soiled with such a thick haze of red and black but i followed the instructions i cried not standing up as she began writing on my form im missing a good chunk of my aura where is it maybe a bug got into your circle she said irately go home call your familiar and see what comes heart pounding i licked my lips how the hell do you call your familiar she looked up from her writing putting her crossed arms down upon the page you dont know how to call your familiar it wasnt a question i lifted my left shoulder and let it fall in a shrug what could i say ill do it she muttered give me your hand i started as she grabbed my wrist her bony grip was surprisingly strong the metallic taste of ash coated my tongue as dr anders muttered an incantation it was like chewing tinfoil and i pulled away as soon as her fingers slackened rubbing my wrist i watched bob willing him to swim to the surface or toward me or something he just sat on the bottom and swished his tail i dont understand i whispered feeling betrayed by my books and the spellcasting abilities i was so confident in i followed the instructions to the letter dr anders was positively smug you will find ms morgan that unlike earth magic ley line manipulation requires more than an unimaginative adherence to rules and todo lists it needs talent and a certain amount of freethinking and adaptability go home make a pet out of whatever shows up on your doorstep and dont come back to my classroom but i did everything right i protested standing up as she made shooing motions and shuffled her papers in dismissal i stood on the scrying mirror and pushed my aura off i got it into the transfer medium without touching it i put bob in with it dr anders jerked turning her thin face up to me scrying mirror i said the incantation i continued nick said it didnt matter if i couldnt say it in latin frustrated i stood before her desk and fumed if i left it would be over it wasnt the money anymore it was this woman thinking i was stupid latin dr anderss face was slack i said it i protested replaying the night in my head and then my breath caught and my face went cold and then the demon showed up i whispered sinking down on the chair before my knees gave way oh god did it take my aura did the demon take my aura demon she looked appalled you called a demon i panicked sitting there at the nasty womans desk i was scared out of my panties and i didnt care if she knew it algaliarept had my aura it got through the circle i babbled forcing myself to not clutch at her arm somehow it got my aura through the circle ms morgan dr anders exclaimed if a demon got in your circle you would not be sitting in front of me youd be in the everafter with it begging for your death frightened i sat where i was with my arms clasped about me i was a runner not a demon killer the woman looked angry as she tapped her pen on the desktop what were you doing summoning a demon those things are dangerous i didnt i gushed you gotta believe me it showed up on its own see i owe it a favor for taking me through the ley lines after it was sent to kill me it was the only way to get back to ivy before i bled to death and it thought that i was trying to call it to settle my debt what with the circle and pentagrams that nick was copying foruhme her eyes flicked to the waterspotted drawings your boyfriend did these did he again i nodded unable to outright lie to her i was going to redo them myself later i said i didnt have time to do two weeks of homework and catch a murderer both dr anders stiffened i did not kill my past students my eyes dropped and i felt myself start to calm i know she took a breath holding it for a moment before letting it out i felt some kind of ley line force pass between us and sat wideeyed wondering what she was doing you dont think i killed them she finally said and the feeling that i was chewing tinfoil stopped so why are you in my class captain edden of the fib sent me to find evidence that youre the witch hunter i said he wont pay me if i dont follow up on his idea youre obnoxious overbearing and the meanest thing ive seen since my fourthgrade teacher but youre not a murderer the older woman slumped as the tension drained from her thank you she whispered you dont know how good it is to hear someone say that she pulled her head up shocking me with a weak smile the notmurdering part she added the adjectives ill ignore seeing a hint of humanity in her i blurted i dont like ley lines dr anders wheres the rest of my aura she took a breath to say something stopping as her gaze went over my shoulder to the door i spun in my chair at the tentative knock on the frame nick peeked round the open door and i felt my face light up i apologize dr anders he said making a show of his university work id clipped to his shirt can i interrupt for a moment im with a student she said the professional tone back in her voice ill be with you in a moment if youd like to wait in the hall could you shut the door please nick winced looking awkward as he stood in his jeans and casual shirt in the doorway ah its rachel i need to see im really sorry for interrupting like this im working in the next building over he turned to look down the hall and back i wanted to see that she was all right and possibly find out how much longer it was going to be who are you dr anders asked her face blank thats nick i said sheepishly my boyfriend hunched in embarrassment nick fidgeted i dont know why im even bothering you he said ill go wait in the lounge a flash of what looked like horror passed over dr anders she looked from me to nick then surged to her feet heels clacking she pulled him in and shut the door behind him stay there she said as she left him bewildered in front of her desk nicks pentagrams sat before us like guilt given substance standing before the windows with her back to us dr anders looked at the dark parking lot where did you get a familiar binding spell that was in latin she asked nick touched my shoulder in sympathy and i wished id never gotten him into this uh out of one of my old spell books i admitted thinking she wanted nick there for verification it was the only charm i could find on such short notice but i know the pentagrams i just didnt have the time to do them theres a binding incantation in the appendix of your textbook she said sounding tired you were supposed to use that one it wasnt the pentagrams she was worried about and a cold feeling slid through me as she turned around the wrinkles in her face looked harsh in the fluorescent light tell me exactly what you did at nicks encouraging nod i said uh first i made the transfer medium then i closed the circle modified to summon and protect nick interrupted and i was inside it with her wait a moment dr anders said just how big was your circle i tucked my hair back glad she wasnt barking at me anymore maybe six feet around across she took a breath and sat down motioning me to continue um then i stood on my scrying mirror and pushed off my aura what was that like she whispered elbows on her desk as she stared out the window damnuhdarn uncomfortable i got the mirror into the transfer medium without touching the surface my aura precipitated out into the media and then i put bob into it into the transfer medium i nodded though she wasnt looking at me i figured that was the only way to anoint a fish then i said the incantation actually nick interrupted i said the incantation first in latin then translated it for her giving her an alternate interpretation on the last part thats right i admitted i said it and then the demon showed up i glanced at nick but it didnt bother him as much as it bothered me then i knocked over bobs bowl my aura was all over him i was afraid he might break the circle if my aura touched it it would have dr anders was staring at the parking lot again is that why some of my aura is missing i asked did i throw it away with the paper towels dr anders brought her gaze to mine no i think you made nick your familiar my jaw dropped i spun in my chair and looked up at nick his hand had fallen from my shoulder and he took a wideeyed step back what i exclaimed you can do that nick asked no you cant dr anders said sentient beings with free will cant be bound to another by incantation but you mixed earth magic with ley line magic ive never heard of binding a familiar like that where did you get that book my attic i whispered i looked up at nick oh nick i said embarrassed im really sorry you must have picked up my aura when you were trying to catch bob nick looked confused im your familiar he whispered his long face quizzical dr anders made a bittersounding bark of laughter its nothing to be proud of ms morgan taking a human as a familiar is heinous its slavery demonic hold up i stammered feeling myself go cold it was an accident the womans eyes turned hard remember what i said about a practioners abilities being linked to his or her familiar demons use people as familiars the more powerful the person is the more power the demon can wield through him or her thats why they are forever trying to educate the foolish in the dark arts they teach them gain control over their souls then make them their familiars you used demon magic by mixing earth and ley line witchcraft i put a hand to my stomach im sorry nick i whispered he was pale and he stood unmoving by my shoulder it was an accident dr anders made a rude noise accident or not its the foulest thing ive heard of you have put nick in a great deal of danger how i fumbled for his hand it was cold in mine and he gave my fingers a squeeze because hes carrying some of your aura ley line witches give their familiars a portion of their aura to act as an anchor when they pull on a ley line if something goes wrong the familiar is pulled into the everafter not the witch but more important familiars insulate you from going insane from channeling too much ley line force ley line witches dont hold the energy they store from a line in themselves they keep it in their familiars simon my parrot holds it for me and i draw upon it as i need when were together im stronger when hes ill my abilities decrease if hes closer to a line than i am i can reach it through him if things go wrong he dies not me i gulped cold as dr anders eyed me as if i had done it on purpose thats why animals are used as familiars she said coldly not people nick i murmured im sorry that was what three times now id said it dr anderss face wrinkled up sorry until we get him unbound you will not store any ley line energy its too dangerous i dont know how to bind ley line force i admitted i had made nick my familiar wait a moment the woman put a thin hand to her forehead you dont know how to store ley line force at all you made a circle six feet across strong enough to keep out a demon using energy straight from the line you didnt use any previously stored energy at all i shook my head you dont know how to hold even an ounce of everafter again i shook my head the woman sighed your father was right you knew my dad i questioned why not everyone else seemed to i taught one of his undergrad classes she said though i didnt know it at the time i didnt see him again until thirteen years ago when we met to discuss you she sat back and cocked her eyebrows he asked me to flunk you if you ever showed up in my class whwhy i stammered apparently he knew how much strength you could pull from a line as he wanted me to persuade you to turn to earth witchcraft instead of line magic he said it would be safer my class was overcrowded that year and bending to a fathers wish to protect his daughter was no skin off my nose i had assumed he meant safer for you in hindsight i think he meant everyone else safer i whispered feeling ill making a human your familiar isnt normal ms morgan dr anders said could you do it nick asked and i flicked a glance at him glad he had asked not me she looked affronted probably if i had the binding spell but i wouldnt its demonic the only reason im not calling inderland security is because it was an accident which we will soon rectify thanks i breathed numb i had made nick my familiar i had used demon magic to bind him to me dizzy i put my head between my knees figuring it was marginally more dignified then passing out and falling to the floor i felt nicks hand on my back and stifled a hysterical laugh what had i done nicks voice came out of the blackness as i closed my eyes and struggled to keep from throwing up you can break the spell i thought familiars were lifelong bonds they generally arefor the familiar she sounded tired but you can unbind one if your skill rises to the point where your familiar is holding you back and then you have to supplant the old familiar with a better one but what is better than a person nick i pulled my head from between my knees to find dr anders grimacing i need to see that book she said theres probably something in it about how to unbind a person demons are notorious for taking something better when it comes along id like to know how a book of demon magic ended up in your attic in the first place i live in a church i whispered it was there when i moved in i glanced out the window my sick feeling starting to diminish nick had my aura that was better than a demon having it and we would be able to undo thissomehow i had told glenn id meet him at the fib tonight but nick came first ill go get the book i said looking at the closed door can we do this here or does it have to be somewhere more private we can go to my kitchen ive a ley line in the backyard dr anders had lost all of her ugliness now she looked simply tired i cant do anything tonight she said glancing apologetically at nick but let me give you my address she reached for a pen scribbling across the folded evaluation of me and my familiar you can leave the book with the gateman and ill get to it this weekend why not tonight i asked as i took the paper im busy tonight ill be giving a presentation tomorrow and i have to prepare an updated successfailure statement she flushed which turned her years younger who for i asked the cold feeling returning to the pit of my stomach mr kalamack my eyes closed in a strengthgathering blink dr anders i said hearing nick shift from foot to foot beside me trent kalamack is the one killing the ley line witches the woman flashed back to her usual mien of scorn dont be foolish ms morgan mr kalamack is no more a murderer than i am call me rachel i said thinking we ought to be on a firstname basis and kalamack is the witch hunter ive seen the reports he talked to every one of the victims within a month before their death dr anders opened a lower drawer and pulled out a tasteful black purse i talked with him last spring at graduation and im still alive hes interested in discussing my research if i can capture his attention he will fund me and i can do what i really want ive been working six years to put this together and im not going to lose my chance to catch a benefactor because of some fool coincidence i shifted to the edge of my chair wondering how i could go from hating her to being worried so quickly dr anders please i said glancing up at nick i know you think im a scatterbrained flop but dont do this ive seen the reports on the people hes killed every one of them died in terror and trent talked to all of them ah rachel nick interrupted you dont know that for sure i spun to him you arent helping dr anders stood with her purse get me the book ill look at it this weekend no i protested seeing her tying up the ends of our conversation hell kill you with no more thought than swatting a fly my jaw gritted as she gestured to the door let me come with you then i said as i stood up ive done escort service for humans into the hollows i know how to stay quiet and watch your back the womans eyes narrowed i am a doctor of ley line magic you think you can protect me better than i can protect myself i took a breath to protest then let it out youre right i said thinking it would be easier to follow her without her knowing could you at least tell me when youre meeting with him id feel better if i could give you a call when youre supposed to be home she sent one eyebrow up tomorrow night at seven were dining at the restaurant atop carew tower is that a public enough place to please you i would have to borrow some money from ivy if i was going to follow her up there a glass of water cost three bucks and a lousy house salad was twelveor so id heard i didnt think i had a nice enough dress either but i wasnt going to let her meet with trent unwatched nodding i put the strap of my bag over my shoulder and stood by nick yes thank you eighteen the early afternoon sun had almost worked its way from the kitchen a last band making a thin sliver along the sink and counter i was sitting at ivys antique table leafing through her catalogs and finishing my breakfast of coffee id been up for only an hour or so nursing my cup and waiting for ivy i had made a full carafe hoping to lure her into talking to me she still wasnt ready having evaded me on the excuse of having to research her latest run i wished shed talk to me the turn take it id be happy if shed just listen it didnt seem possible she would put this much weight on the incident she had slipped before and we had gotten past it sighing i stretched my legs out under the table i turned the page to a collection of closet organizers my eyes drifting aimlessly i didnt have much to do today until glenn jenks and i went to tail dr anders that night nick had loaned me some money and i had a party dress that wouldnt look too cheap and would hide my splat gun edden had been thrilled when i told him i was going to follow the womanuntil i stupidly admitted she was meeting with trent we had nearly come to blows over it shocking the officers on the floor at this point i didnt care if edden threw me in jail hed have to wait until i did something and by then id have what i needed glenn wasnt happy with me either id played the daddysboy card to get him to keep his mouth shut and come with me tonight i didnt care trent was killing people my eyes roving over the catalog fastened on an oak desk the kind detectives had in preturn movies a sigh escaped me in an exhalation of desire it was beautiful with a deep luster that pressboard lacked there were all sorts of little cubbies and a hidden compartment behind the bottom left drawer according to the sell line it would fit nicely in the sanctuary a grimace pulled my face down as i thought of my pathetic furniture some still in storage ivy had beautiful furniture with smooth lines and a heavy weight the drawers never stuck and the metal latches clicked smartly when they closed i wanted something like that something permanent something that arrived on my doorstep fully assembled something that could stand a dip in saltwater if i ever got another death threat put on me it would never happen i thought pushing the catalog away getting nice furniture not the death threat my eyes slid from the shiny paper to my ley line textbook i stared at it thinking i could channel more power than most my dad hadnt wanted me to know dr anders thought i was an idiot there was only one thing i could do taking a breath i pulled the book closer i thumbed to the back and the appendices stopping at the incantation for binding a familiar it was all ritualistic with notations referring to techniques i hadnt a clue on the incantation was in english and there were no brews or plants involved at all it was as alien to me as geometry and i didnt like feeling stupid the pages made a pleasant sound as i rifled to the front of the book looking for something i could understand i slowed inserting my thumb as i found an incantation for diverting objects in motion cool i thought it was exactly why i had wanted a wand sitting straighter i crossed my knees and leaned over the book you were supposed to draw on stored ley line energy to manipulate small things and connect right to a line for things with a lot of mass or that were moving quickly the only physical thing i needed was an object to serve as a focal point i looked up as jenks flitted in the open kitchen window hey rache he said cheerily whatcha doing reaching for the furniture catalog i slid it smoothly over the textbook not much i said as i looked down youre in a good mood i just got back from your moms shes cool you know he flew to the center island counter landing on it to put himself at nearly my eye level jax is doing well if your mom is cotton to the idea im going to let him have a go at making a garden big enough to support him cotton i questioned turning a page to some beautiful phone tables i blanched at the price how could something that small cost so much yeah you know cool aokay keen kosher i know what it means i said recognizing it as one of my mothers favorite phrases and thinking it odd jenks would have picked it up have you talked to ivy yet he asked no my frustration was obvious in the short word jenks hesitated then with a clattering of wings he flew a swooping path to land upon my shoulder sorry i forced a pleasant expression as i pulled my head up and tucked a curl behind my ear yeah me too he made an irate noise with his wings sooo whatcha hiding under the catalog looking through ivys leather outlets my jaw tightened its nothing i said softly you looking to buy furniture he scoffed give me a break peeved i waved him away yeah i want furniture something other than pressboardexcuse meengineered wood ivys stuff makes mine look like trailerpark plastic jenks laughed the wind from his wings shifting the hair about my face so get yourself something nice the next time you have some money like that will ever happen i muttered jenks zipped under the table not trusting him i bent to see what he was doing hey stop it i cried moving my foot as i felt a tug on my shoe he darted away and when i came up from retying my lace i found he had pulled the catalog off the textbook his hands were on his hips as he stood on it reading jenks i complained i thought you didnt like ley lines he said flitting up and then right back down where he had been especially now that you cant use them without endangering nick i dont i said wishing i hadnt told him about having accidentally made nick my familiar but look this stuff is easy jenks was silent his wings drooping as he looked at the charm you gonna try it no i said quickly nick will be okay if you pull your energy right off the line hell never know jenks turned sideways so he could see me and the print both it says right here you dont have to use stored energy but can pull it off the line see right here in black and white yeah i said slowly not convinced jenks grinned you learn how to do this and you could get back at the howlers you still have those tickets for next sundays game dont you yeah i said cautiously jenks strutted down the page his wings a red blur in excitement you could make them pay you and since you have eddens paycheck coming for your rent you could get a nice oak shoe rack or something yeeeeah i hedged jenks eyed me slyly from under his blond bangs unless youre afraid my eyes narrowed anyone ever tell you youre a real prick he laughed rising up with a glittering sunbeam of pixy dust if i had a quarter he mused flitting close he landed on my shoulder is it hard leaning over the book i swung my hair to one side so he could see too no and thats what worries me theres an incantation and i need a focusing object ill have to connect to a ley line and theres a gesture my brow furrowed and i tapped the book it couldnt be this easy you gonna try it the thought that algaliarept might know i was pulling on the line flitted through me but seeing that it was daylight and we had an agreement i thought it was safe enough yeah sitting straighter i settled myself reaching out with my second sight i fumbled for the line the sun completely overwhelmed any vision of the everafter but the ley line was clear enough in my minds eye looking like a streak of dried blood hanging above the tombstones thinking it was really ugly i cautiously reached out a thought and touched it my breath hissed in through my nose and i stiffened you okay rache jenks questioned launching himself off my shoulder head bowed over the book i nodded the energy flowed through me faster than before equalizing the strengths very quickly it was almost as if the previous times had cleared the channels worried about using too much i tried to push some of it down through me and out of my feet it didnt do any good the incoming force simply filled me back up again resigned to the uncomfortable feeling i mentally shook my second sight from me and looked up jenks was watching me in concern i gave him an encouraging smile and he nodded apparently satisfied how about this jenks said flying to my stash of water paint balls the red sphere was as big as his head and clearly heavy but he managed it all right its as good as anything i agreed toss one up and ill try to shift it thinking this was easier than grinding plants and boiling water i said the incantation and made a swooping loop of a figure in the air with my hand imagining it was like writing your name with a sparkler on the fourth of july i said the last word as jenks tossed the ball up ow i shouted as a surge of ley line force burned my left hand i looked at jenks in bewilderment as he laughed what did i do wrong he flitted close with the red ball tucked under his arm caught when it fell back to him you forgot your focusing object here use this ah embarrassed i took the red ball as he dropped it into my hand lets try it again i said and cradled it in my recessive hand as the book had instructed feeling the cool smoothness of it i said the incantation and etched the figure in the air with my right hand jenks tossed a second ball with a sharp whistle of his wings startled i let loose a surge of power this time it worked i stifled a yelp as i felt the ley line energy dart through my hand following my attention right to the ball it hit it knocking it into the wall to make a dripping smear yes i exclaimed meeting jenkss grin with my own look at that it worked jenks flew to the counter to get another ball try it again he prompted tossing it eagerly to the ceiling it came faster this time i found i could do the incantation and gesture simultaneously holding the ley line energy with my will until i wanted to release it with that came a great deal of control and soon i was no longer hitting them with so much force that they broke when they hit the wall my aim was getting better too and the sink was littered with the balls id been bouncing off the screen mr fish on the sill wasnt happy jenks was a willing partner zipping about the kitchen throwing the red balls at the ceiling my eyes widened as he threw one at me instead hey i cried sending the ball through the pixy hole in the screen not at me what a good idea he said then grinned wickedly as he made a sharp whistle three of his kids zipped in from the garden all talking at once they brought the smell of dandelions and asters with them toss them at ms morgan he said handing his sphere to the girl in pink hold it i protested ducking as the girl pixy threw it with as much skill and power as her father i looked behind me to the dark splat against the yellow wall then back to them my mouth opened in the instant i had looked away they all had gotten splat balls get her jenks cried jenks i said laughing as i managed to divert one of the four balls the three i missed rolled harmlessly to the floor the smallest pixy skimmed over the linoleum tossing them upward to where his sisters caught them four against one isnt fair i shouted as they took aim again my eyes darted to the hallway as the phone rang time i called out lurching to escape into the living room time out still smiling i reached for the phone jenks hovered in the archway waiting hello vampiric charms rachel speaking i said ducking the ball he threw at me i could hear pixy giggles from the kitchen and wondered what they were up to rachel came nicks voice what the blue blazes are you doing hi nick i paused to mouth the incantation i held the energy until jenks lobbed a ball at me i was getting better almost hitting him with the diverted splat ball jenks stop it i protested im on the phone he grinned then darted out i flopped into one of ivys cushy matching suede chairs knowing he wouldnt risk getting water on it and have ivy come after him hey youre up already you want to do something i asked draping my legs over one arm and lolling my neck on the other i shifted the red ball i was using as a focusing object between two fingers daring it to break with the pressure i had it under um maybe he said are you by chance pulling on a ley line i waved jenks to stop as he swooped in yes i said sitting up and putting my feet on the floor im sorry i didnt think you would feel it im not drawing it through you am i jenks landed on top of a picture frame i was sure he could hear nick though the pixy was on the other side of the room no nick said a hint of laughter in his voice tiny through the receiver im sure id be able to tell but its odd im sitting here reading and all of a sudden it feels like youre here with me the best way to describe it is when youre over here and im making dinner watching you watch tv youre doing your own thing not looking for my attention but being really noisy its kind of distracting you watch me watch tv i asked uncomfortable and he chuckled yeah its a lot of fun you jump up and down a lot my brow furrowed as jenks snickered sorry i muttered but then a faint tickle of warning pulled me straighter nick was up reading he usually spent his saturday in bed catching up on sleep nick what book are you reading ah yours he admitted i only had one book that hed be interested in nick i protested as i scooted to the edge of my chair and gripped the phone tighter you said youd take it to dr anders after blowing off my trip to the fib because i was frazzled worse than my hair nick had taken me home id thought he offered to deliver the book because of my new and healthy phobia of the literally damned tome obviously nick had other plans and it hadnt made it that far she wasnt going to look at it last night he said defensively and its safer in my apartment than sitting in a guardhouse getting coffee rings if you dont mind id like to keep it one more night there is something in it i want to ask the demon he paused clearly waiting for me to protest my face warmed idiot i said obliging him you are an idiot dr anders told you what that demon is trying to do it nearly kills both of us and youre still pumping it for information i heard nick sigh im being careful he said and i made a frightened bark of laughter rachel i promise ill take it over first thing tomorrow she isnt going to look at it until then anyway he hesitated and i could almost hear him gather his resolve im going to call him please dont make me do this behind your back id feel better if someone knew why so i can tell your mother what killed you i said sharply then caught myself eyes closing i squeezed the red ball between my fingers he was silent waiting i hated that i had no right to tell him to stop not even as his girlfriend summoning demons wasnt illegal it was just really really stupid promise youll call me when youre done i asked feeling my stomach quiver im up until about five sure he breathed thanks i want to hear how your dinner with trent goes you bet i echoed talk to you later if you survive i hung up meeting jenkss eyes he was hovering in the middle of the room a splat ball tucked under his arm you two are going to end up as dark smears on ley line circles he said and i flicked the splat ball i held at him he caught it onehanded moving several feet before stopping its momentum he flung it back and i dodged it hit ivys chair without breaking thankful for small favors i picked it up and headed for the kitchen now jenks shrilled as i entered the bright room get her shrieked a dozen pixies jerked out of my depression i cowered as a hailstorm of splat balls hit me breaking against my covered head darting to the fridge i opened the door and hid behind it adrenaline made my blood seem to sing i grinned at the sound of six or more splats against the metallic door you little beggars i shouted peeking up to see them flitting over the far end of the kitchen like insane fireflies my eyes widened there must have been twenty of them splat balls littered the floor rolling slowly away from me thrilling in it i said my incantation three times fast and bounced the next three missiles right back at them jenkss kids shrieked in delight their silk dresses and pants a blur of color pixy dust made trails of slowly falling sunshine jenks was standing on the ladle hanging from the rack over the center island counter the sword he used to fight off fairies was in his grip and he brandished it high as he shouted encouragement under his noisy direction they banded together giggled whispers punctuated by excited shouts filled the air as they organized grinning i hid behind the door with my ankles cooling in the draft from the fridge i said the incantation over and over feeling the ley line force swell behind my eyes they were going to attack en masse knowing i couldnt deflect them all now jenks shouted his tiny saber swinging he launched himself from the ladle i cried out at the cheerful ferocity of his kids swarming at me laughing in protest i sent the red balls flying little thumps beat at me from the ones i missed gasping for air i rolled under the table they followed me bombarding me i was out of incantations i give up i cried careful not to hit any of jenkss kids as i put my hands on the underside of the table i was covered in spots of water and i pushed back the damp strands of hair stuck to my face i give up you win they cheered and the phone started ringing again proud and exuberant jenks bellowed out a stirring song about beating invaders from their land and coming home to seedlings sword held high he made a circuit around the room gathering his kids up in tow all singing in glorious harmony they flowed out the window and into the garden i sat in the sudden silence on the kitchen floor under the table my entire body shifted as i took a deep breath smiling as i exhaled whew i puffed still chuckling as i wiped a hand under my eye no wonder the fairy assassins sent to kill me last year hadnt had a chance jenkss kids were clever quickand aggressive still smiling i rolled to my feet and padded into the living room to get the phone before the machine picked it up poor nick i was sure he felt that last one nick i blurted before he could say anything im sorry jenkss kids had me under the kitchen table and were throwing splat balls at me god help me but it was funny theyre in the garden right now making rings around the ash tree and singing about cold steel rachel it was glenn and my mirth died at his worried tone what i said looking at the trees through the shoulderhigh windows the spots of water covering me were suddenly cold and i clasped an arm around myself ill be there in ten minutes he said can you be ready i pushed my damp hair back why whats happened i asked i heard him cover the receiver and shout something at someone you got your warrant to search kalamacks property he said when he returned how i questioned not believing edden had caved not that im complaining glenn hesitated he took a slow breath and i heard excited voices in the background dr anders called me last night he said she knew you were going to follow her so she moved her presentation to last night and asked me to go with her instead the witch i exclaimed softly wishing i could have seen what glenn had worn i bet it had been sharp but when he remained silent the cold feeling in my stomach solidified into a sour lump im sorry rachel glenn said softly her car went off roebling bridge this morning pushed over the rail by what appeared to be a huge bubble of ley line force they just pulled her car from the river were still looking for the body nineteen my foot jiggled as i impatiently stood beside the stack of manuals and empty paper cups that lined the sill of trents gatehouse jenks was on my earring muttering darkly as he watched quen punch a button on the phone id seen quen only once beforepossibly twice the first time he was masquerading as a gardener actually managing to catch jenks in a glass ball i had a growing suspicion that quen had been the third rider who tried to run me down on horseback the night i stole my blackmail disc from trent it was a feeling that solidified when jenks told me quen smelled just like trent and jonathan quen reached in front of me for a pen and i jerked back not wanting him to touch me still on the phone he smiled carefully showing me extremely white even teeth this one i thought knew what i was capable of this one wouldnt underestimate me as jonathan continually did and though it was nice being taken seriously for once i wished quen was as egotistical and chauvinistic as jonathan was trent had once said quen was willing to take me on as a studentafter the security officer got over his desire to kill me for infiltrating the kalamack compound i wondered if i would have survived having him as a teacher quen looked about the age my father would be if he were still alive he had very dark hair that curled about his ears green eyes that always seemed to be watching me and a dancers grace that i knew came from a lifetime of martial arts practice dressed in a black security uniform with no insignia he looked like he belonged to the night he was a shade taller than i was in heels and the strength in his lightly wrinkled physique had me on edge his fingers were quick on a keyboard and his eyes were faster the only weakness id noticed was a slight limp and unlike everyone else in the room besides me he had no weapon that i could see captain edden stood beside me looking squat but capable in his khaki pants and white shirt glenn was in another of his black suits trying to look collected despite his obvious nervousness edden too looked worried that he was going to have egg on his face if we didnt find anything i adjusted my bag higher onto my shoulder and fidgeted it was full of charms to find dr anders dead or alive i had made glenn wait while i whipped them up using the paper she had written her address on as the focal object if there was a shoe box left of her the charms would light red with them was a lie amulet my wireframed glasses to see through ley line disguises and a spell checker i was going to take the opportunity while talking to trent to see if he used a charm to disguise his appearance nobody looks that good without help outside parked in the lot beside the gatehouse were three fib vans the doors were open and the officers looked hot as they waited in the heat of an unseasonably warm afternoon the breeze from jenkss wings sent a wisp of hair to tickle my neck can you hear him i breathed as quen turned away and began speaking into the phone oh yeah the pixy muttered hes talking to jonathan quen is telling him hes standing in the gatehouse with you and edden with a warrant to search the property and he bloody well just better wake him up him being trent i guessed and felt my earring swing as jenks nodded i looked at the clock over the door seeing it was a little after two must be nice edden cleared his throat as quen hung up trents security officer made no bones about letting us know he was unhappy his light wrinkles deepened as his jaw clenched and his green eyes were hard captain edden mr kalamack is understandably upset and would like to speak with you while your people carry out your search of course edden said and a small sound of disbelief escaped me why are you being so nice i muttered as quen ushered us through the heavy glass and metal doors and back into the strong sun rachel edden breathed tension carrying through his whisper you will be polite and gracious or you will wait in the car gracious i thought since when were exnavy seals gracious hardnosed aggressive politically correct to the point of being anal ahhe was being politically correct edden leaned close as he held the door to one of the vans for me and then were going to nail his ass to a tree he added confirming my suspicions if kalamack murdered her well get him he said his eyes on quen as the man swung into an estate vehicle but if we bull in here like storm troopers a jury will let him go even if he confesses its all in the procedure ive stopped traffic in and out no one leaves without a search i squinted at him putting a hand to my hat to keep it from blowing off id much rather have screamed in with twenty cars and sirens blazing but id have to be satisfied with this the drive up the threemile entry road through the wood trent maintained about his estate was quiet since jenks had gone with glenn in the estate car to try and figure out what kind of inderlander quen was we followed quens security vehicle around the last turn and pulled into the empty visitors parking lot i couldnt help but be impressed by trents main building the threestory edifice was settled in among the surrounding vegetation as if it had been here for hundreds of years rather than forty the white marble sent glints of sunlight to pool against the trees like a sunrise from the west large pillars and wide shallow steps made an inviting entry surrounded by trees and gardens the office buildings had a sense of permanence those in the city lacked several smaller buildings sprawled from the main one attached by covered walkways trents renowned walled gardens took up much of the side and back the acres of welltended plants surrounded by fields of grass and then his eerie plannedout forest i was the first one out of the van my gaze crossing the road to the distant lowslung buildings where trent raised his thoroughbreds a tour bus was just leaving obnoxiously noisy and emblazoned with advertisements to visit trents gardens jenks flitted up to land on my shoulder since my current earrings were too small for him to perch on grumbling about his inability to figure out what quen was i turned back to the main building and started up the stone steps heels clicking in a steady cadence edden was quick behind me my gut tightened when i saw a familiar silhouette waiting for us by the marble pillars jonathan i whispered my dislike for the extremely tall man swinging into a slow hatred just once id like to climb those stairs and not have his haughty eyes on me my lips went tight and i suddenly was glad for having worn my best suitdress despite the unseasonable heat jonathans suit was exquisite it had to have been tailored to him since he was too tall to be able to buy anything off the rack his dark hair was graying around the temples and the wrinkles around his eyes were embedded as if acid had etched them in concrete he had been a child during the turn seemingly marked forever by its fear in his gaunt almost malnourished stance tidy and overdressed his manner screamed british englishman but his accent was as midwestern as mine he was clean shaven his cheeks and thin lips never stirring from a perpetual frown unless it was at someones expense he had grinned the entire three days i had been a mink trapped in a cage in trents office his vivid blue eyes alive and eager as he tormented me quen strode quickly up the stairs to pull ahead of me my eye started to tic as the two men put their heads together they turned jonathans professional smile laced with professional irritation nice captain edden he said extending his thin hand as edden and i halted before them eddens muscular build looked almost dumpy as he shook hands with him im jonathan mr kalamacks publicity adviser mr kalamack is waiting for you he added the congeniality in his voice never reaching his eyes he asked me to relay his desire to help any way he can jenks snickered from my shoulder he could tell us where he stashed dr anders he whispered it but both quen and jonathan stiffened i pretended to check the french braid id put my hair insubtly threatening to smack jenksthen put my hands behind my back to forestall a handshake with jonathan i wouldnt touch him unless it was my fist in his gut damn i really missed my handcuffs thank you edden said eyebrows raised at the evil glances jonathan and i were exchanging well try to make this as quick and nonintrusive as possible as i stood and glowered edden pulled glenn aside keep the search lowkey but thorough he said as jonathans eyes flicked over my shoulder to the fib officers assembling in a loose conglomeration on the wide steps they had brought several dogs with them all wearing blue body sleeves with fib emblazoned on them in yellow their tails waved enthusiastically and they were clearly eager to get to work glenn nodded and i swung my bag around here i said pulling out a handful of charms and dumping them into his grip i primed them on the way over theyre set to find dr anders whether she is dead or alive give them to whoever will take them theyll turn red if they get within a hundred feet of her ill make sure every team has one glenn said his brown eyes startled as he tried to keep from dropping them hey rache jenks said as he flitted off my shoulder glenn asked me to tag along with him you mind i cant do anything sitting pretty on your shoulder sure go ahead i said thinking he could search the garden better than a pack of dogs a worried frown crossed jonathans long face and i beamed sarcastically at him pixies and fairies werent allowed on the grounds as a general rule and id wear my panties on the outside for a week if someone would tell me what trent was afraid jenks might find quen and jonathan exchanged a silent look the shorter mans lips went tight and his green eyes pinched looking as if hed rather make mud pies out of crap than leave jonathan alone to accompany us with trent quen hustled after jenks my eyes tracked the security officer as he all but flowed down the stairs his hurried grace mesmerizing jonathan straightened as he returned his attention to us mr kalamack is waiting for you in his front office he said stiffly as he opened a door i gave him a nasty smile as i lurched into motion touch me and ill hurt you i threatened as i yanked open the door next to the one jonathan held the main lobby was spacious and eerily empty the hushed murmur of business silenced with everyone gone for the weekend not waiting for jonathan i went straight down the wide corridor to trents office hands fumbling in my purse i pulled out my ungodly expensive and criminally ugly charmed ley line glasses and put them on my nose jonathan gave up on his show of decorum leaving edden behind to catch up with me i strode down the hallway my fists clenched and heels thumping i wanted to see trent i wanted to tell him what i thought of him and spit in his face for having tried to break my will by putting me in the citys illegal rat fights the frosted doors to either side of me were open showing empty desks farther down was a reception desk tucked into an alcove across from trents door sara janes desk was as neat and organized as the woman herself heart pounding i reached for the handle of trents door jerking back as jonathan caught up giving me a look that could rock an attacking dog back on his haunches the tall man knocked on trents wooden door waiting until his muffled voice came before opening it edden came even with me his cross look faltering in shock as he saw my glasses on edge i touched my hat and tugged my jacket straight maybe i should have asked ivy for a loan and gotten the pretty ones the sound of water over rocks filtered out of trents office and i entered hot on jonathans heels trent rose from behind his desk as i came in i took a breath to give him a snide but sincere greeting i wanted to tell him i knew he had killed dr anders i wanted to tell him he was scum i wanted to get in his face and scream that i was better than him that he would never break me that he was a manipulative bastard and i was going to bring him down but i did nothing taken aback by his calm inner core of strength he was the most selfpossessed man i had ever met and i stood silent as his thoughts visibly shifted from other matters to focus on me and no he didnt use a ley line charm to make him look that good it was all him every strand of his wispy almost transparent hair was in place his gray silklined suit was unwrinkled accenting the narrowwaisted wideshouldered physique i had spent three days ogling as a mink standing taller than i was he gave me his trademark smile an enviable mix of warmth and professional interest he adjusted his jacket with a casual slowness his long fingers drawing my attention as he manipulated the last button there was only a single ring on his right hand and like me he wore no watch at all trent was supposed to be only three years older than imaking him one of the wealthiest bachelors on the freaking planetbut the suit made him look older even so his nicely defined jawline as well as his smooth cheeks and small nose made him look suited more for the beach than the boardroom still smiling that confident almost pleased smile he ducked his head taking his wirerimmed glasses off and tossing them to the desktop embarrassed i put my own charmed spectacles away in their hard leather case my eyes went to his right arm as he came around to the front of his desk it had been in a cast the last time i saw him which was probably why the gun hed shot at me missed there was a faint ring of lighter skin between his hand and the cuff of his jacket that the sun hadnt yet had a chance to darken i stiffened as his gaze drifted over me resting briefly on the pinky ring he had stolen from me and returned to prove he could finally settling on my neck and the almost invisible scarring from my demon attack ms morgan i wasnt aware you could work for the fib he said by way of greeting making no move to shake my hand im a consultant i said ignoring how his liquid voice had pulled my breath tight i had forgotten his voice all amber and honeyif color and taste could describe a soundresonant and deep each syllable clear and precise yet blending into the next like liquid it was mesmerizing in a way that only ancient vampires could match and it bothered me that i liked it i met his gaze trying to show a mirror image of his confidence jittery i extended my arm forcing him to respond his hand came out to meet mine with the barest of hesitations a stab of satisfaction warmed me in that i had made him do something he didnt want to even if it was something this small feeling cocky i slipped my hand into trents though his green eyes were cold with the knowledge that id forced him into touching me his grip was warm and firm i wondered how long he had been practicing it satisfied i loosened my grip but instead of doing the same trents hand slipped from mine with an intimate slowness that wasnt at all professional i would have said he had just made a pass at me but for the slight tightening of his eyes which spoke of a wary caution mr kalamack i said refusing to wipe my hand on my skirt youre looking good as are you his smile was frozen in place and his right hand was almost behind his back i understand youre doing reasonably well with your little investigation firm i imagine its difficult when youre just starting out little investigation firm my unease flashed into irritation thank you i managed a smile quirking the corner of his mouth trent turned his attention to edden as the two professional men made polite politically correct and hypocritical niceties i glanced over trents office his fake window still showed a live shot of one of his yearling pastures the artificial light shining through the video screen to make a warm patch of glowing carpet there was a new school of black and white fish in the zoosize fish tank and the freestanding aquarium had been moved into a recess built into the wall behind his desk the spot where my cage had been held a potted orange tree and the scentmemory of food pellets made my stomach clench the camera at the ceiling in the corner blinked its little red light at me its a pleasure to meet you captain edden trent was saying the smooth cadence of his voice luring my attention i wish it could be under better circumstances mr kalamack eddens sharp staccato sounded harsh against trents voice i apologize for any inconvenience incurred while we search your grounds jonathan handed trent the warrant and he looked at it briefly before handing it back corporal evidence leading to an arrest in the deaths known as the witch hunter murders he said his eyes flicking to mine thats a little broad isnt it putting down dead body looked crass i said tightly and edden cleared his throat the barest hint of worry we might find nothing staining his professional stance i noticed edden had fallen into a parade rest and wondered if the exnavy seal even knew it you were the last person to see dr anders i added wanting to see trents reaction thats out of line ms morgan edden muttered but i was more interested in the emotion that passed over trent anger frustration but not shock trent glanced at jonathan who made the slightest shrug id ever seen slowly trent sat back on his desktop his long suntanned hands clasped in front of him i wasnt aware that she had died he said i never said she was dead i said my heart pounded as edden gripped my arm in warning shes missing trent said doing a creditable job of showing only relief thats good that she is missing and notahdead i had dinner with her last night the barest hint of worry flickered over trent as he gestured to the two chairs behind us please sit down he said as he went behind his desk im sure you have some questions for meseeing as youre searching my grounds thank you sir i do edden took the seat closest to the hallway my eyes tracked jonathan as he closed trents door he remained standing beside it looking defensive i eased myself down in the remaining seat in the artificial sun forcing myself to the back of the chair trying for an air of nonchalance i set my bag on my lap and felt in my jacket pocket for a finger stick the prick of the blade zinged through me i eased my bleeding finger into my bag carefully searching for the charm now lets see trent lie and get away with it trents expression froze at the clatter of my amulet put your truth spell away ms morgan he accused i said i would be happy to answer captain eddens questions not submit to an interrogation your warrant is for search and seizure not crossexamination morgan edden hissed his thick hand extended give me that grimacing i wiped my fingertip clean and handed the amulet over edden stuffed it in a pocket my apologies he said his round face tight ms morgan is tenacious in her desire to find the person or persons responsible for so many deaths she has a dangerousthis was directed at metendency to forget she has to function within the laws parameters trents wispy hair rose in the current from the air vents seeing my gaze on it he ran a hand over his head hinting at irritation she means well how patronizing was that angry i set my bag on the floor with a thump dr anders meant well too i said did you kill her after she turned down your offer of employment jonathan stiffened and eddens hands jerked as if he was trying to keep them in his lap and away from around my neck im not going to warn you again rachel he growled trents smile never flickered he was angry and trying not to show it i was glad i could paint the walls with my feelings it was far more satisfying no its all right trent said clasping his fingers together and leaning forward to set them on his desk if it will ease ms morgans belief that im capable of such monstrous crimes ill be more than happy to tell you what we discussed last night though he was talking to edden his gaze didnt shift from mine we were discussing the possibility of my funding her research ley line research i questioned he picked up a pencil the motion as he twirled it giving away his discomfort he really should have broken himself of the habit ley line research he agreed the vein of which has little practical value i was indulging my curiosity nothing more i think you offered her a job i said and when she refused to work for you you had her killed just like all the other ley line witches in cincinnati morgan edden exclaimed pulling himself upright in his chair go wait in the van he rose giving trent an apologetic look mr kalamack im very sorry ms morgan is entirely out of line and is not acting under fib authority in her accusations i spun in my chair to face him its what he tried to do to me why would dr anders be any different eddens face went red behind his little round glasses i clenched my jaw ready to argue right back he took an angry breath letting it out at the knock at the door jonathan opened it stepping back as glenn came in ducking his head briefly to trent in acknowledgment i could tell by his hunched furtive expression that the search wasnt going well he murmured something to edden and the captain scowled growling something back trent watched the exchange with interest his brow smoothing and the faint tension in his shoulders easing the pencil was set aside and he leaned back in his chair jonathan went to trent putting a hand on his desk as he leaned to whisper in trents ear my attention flicked from jonathans condescending smile to eddens worried frown trent was going to come out of this looking like an injured citizen brutalized by the fib damn jonathan straightened and trents green eyes met mine softly mocking eddens voice rasped at my awareness as he told glenn to have jenks doublecheck the gardens trent was going to get away with it he killed those people and he was going to get away with it frustration gripped me as glenn gave me a helpless look and left closing the door behind him i knew my charms were good but they might not work if trent was using ley line magic to hide her my face went slack ley line magic if he was hiding her with ley line magic i could find her with the same i glanced at trent seeing his satisfaction falter at the sudden questioning look i knew i must be wearing trent held up a finger to jonathan keeping the tall man quiet as he focused on me clearly trying to figure out what i was thinking making a search charm using earth magic was clearly white witchcraft it followed that one made using ley line magic would be white as well the cost upon my karma would be negligible far less than say lying about my birthday to get a free drink and whether stemming from earth or ley line magic a search charm was covered under the search and seizure warrant my heartbeat quickened and i reached to touched my hair i didnt know the incantation but nick might have it in his books and if trent used ley line magic to cover his tracks there would have to be a line close enough to use interesting i need to make a call i said hearing my voice as if it were from outside my head trent seemed at a loss for words i liked seeing the emotion on him youre welcome to use my secretarys phone he said i have my own i said digging in my bag thank you edden gave me a suspicious glance and went to talk to trent and jonathan by his polite stance and appeaseing look i thought he might be trying to smooth the political waves his failed fib visit was going to cause tense i rose going to the far corner to try and stay out of the cameras view as well as their earshot be there i whispered as i scrolled through my short list and hit the send button pick up nicky please pick uphe might be getting groceries he could be doing his laundry or taking a nap or in the shower but i was willing to bet my nonexistent paycheck that he was still reading that damned book my shoulders relaxed as someone picked up he was home i loved a predictable man ello he said sounding preoccupied nick i breathed thank god rachel whats up concern laced his voice pulling my shoulders tight again i need your help i said glancing at edden and trent trying to keep my voice soft im at trents with captain edden we got a search warrant will you look in your books for a ley line charm to findumdead people there was a long hesitation thats what i like about you rayray he said as i heard the sound of a sliding book followed by a thump you say the sweetest things i waited my stomach knotting as the sound of turning pages came faintly over the phone dead people he murmured not fazed at all while the butterflies battered my stomach with jackhammers dead fairies dead ghosts will an invocation for ghosts do no i picked at my nail polish watching trent watch me as he talked to edden dead kings dead livestock ah dead people my pulse increased and i fumbled in my bag for a pen okay he was silent reading it over its simple enough but i dont think you can use it during the daytime why not you know how tombstones in our world show up in the everafter well the charm makes unmarked graves in our world do the same but you have to be able to see into the everafter with your second sight and you cant do that unless the sun is down i can if im standing in a ley line i whispered feeling cold id never seen that tidbit of information written in a book my dad had told me when i was eight rachel he protested after a moments hesitation you cant if that demon knows youre in a ley line hell try to pull you the rest of the way into the everafter it cant it doesnt own my soul i whispered turning to hide my moving lips he was silent and my breath sounded loud to me i dont like it he finally said i dont like you calling up demons and its an it not a him the phone was silent i glanced at trent then turned my back on him i wondered how good his hearing was yes nick said but he owns twothirds of my soul and onethird of yours what if souls dont add up like numbers nick i said my voice harsh with worry its an all or nothing affair it doesnt have enough on me it doesnt have enough on you im not walking out of here without proving trent killed that woman whats the incantation i waited my knees going weak got a pen he finally said and i nodded forgetting he couldnt see the gesture yes i said jiggling the phone to write on my palm like a test cheat sheet okay its not long ill translate everything but the invocation word in english only because we dont have a word that means the glowing ashes of the dead and i think its important you get that part exactly right give me a moment and i can make it rhyme nonrhyming is fine i said slowly thinking this just kept getting better and better glowing ashes of the dead what kind of language needed its own word for that he cleared his throat and i readied my pen dead unto dead shine as the moon silence all but the restless he hesitated and then the trigger word is favilla favilla i repeated writing it phonetically any gesture no it doesnt physically act on anything so you dont need a gesture or focus object do you want me to repeat it no i said a little sick as i looked at my palm did i really want to do this rachel he said his voice sounding worried through the speaker be careful yeah i said my pulse fast in anticipation and worry thanks nick i bit my lower lip in a sudden thought hey um keep my book for me until i talk to you okay rayray he questioned warily ask me later i said flicking a glance at edden then trent i didnt have to say another word he was a smart man wait dont hang up he said the concern in his voice giving me pause keep me on the line i cant sit here and feel those tugs on me without knowing if youre in trouble or not i licked my lips and forced my hand down from where it had been playing with the end of my braid using nick as my familiar went against every moral fiber i hadand id like to think i had a lot of thembut i couldnt walk away i wouldnt even try it if i wasnt sure nick would be unaffected ill give you to captain edden okay edden he said faintly his worry taking on an edge of selfpreservation i turned back to the three men captain i said drawing their attention id like to try a different finding spell before we leave eddens round face was pinched with frustration were done here morgan he said gruffly weve taken up more than enough of mr kalamacks time i swallowed trying to look like i did this every day this one works differently his breath went in and out in a rough sound can i have a word with you in the hallway he intoned hallway i would not be pulled into the hallway like an errant child i turned to trent mr kalamack wont mind he has nothing to hide yes trents face was a mask of professional politeness jonathan stood behind him his narrow face ugly as long as it falls within the parameters of your warrant trent said smoothly i felt a jolt hearing the concern he was trying to hide he was worried i was too i made my steps slow as i crossed the office and handed edden the phone its a finding spell tuned to find unmarked graves nick will tell you all about it captain so you can be sure its legal you remember him dont you edden took the phone the slim pink rectangle looking ridiculous in his thick hands if its so simple why didnt you tell me about it before i gave him a nervous smile it uses ley lines trents face froze his gaze darted to my demonmarked wrist and he leaned back into his chair and jonathans protection i arched my eyebrows though my stomach was in knots if he protested he would look guilty his hands moved with a nervous quickness as he reached for his wirerimmed glasses and tapped them on the desktop please he said as if he had any say in the matter invoke your charm id be interested to see how much an earth witch such as yourself knows about ley line magic me too edden said dryly before he put the phone to his ear and began talking to nick in low intent tones making sure what i was going to do fell within the fib warrant most likely well have to move i said almost to myself i need to find a ley line to stand in ah ms morgan trent said clearly agitated as he sat up straight in his chair the wirerimmed glasses he had put back on made him look less sophisticated giving him a softer almost harmless look i thought he looked a little pale too right i thought snidely as i closed my eyes to make it easier to find a ley line with my second sight like you have a ley line running through your garden i reached out with my thoughts searching for the red smear of everafter my breath hissed in and my eyes flashed open i stared at trent the man had a freaking ley line running right through his freaking office twenty mouth agape i looked across the office to trent his face was tight and drawn as he sat flanked by jonathan neither looked happy my pulse raced trent knew it was there he could use ley lines that meant he was either human or witch vamps couldnt pull on them and humans who could and were subsequently infected with the vamp virus lost the ability i didnt know what frightened me more that trent used ley lines or that he knew i knew god help me i was halfway to knowing trents most precious secret of what the hell he was the door to trents office smashed into the wall adrenaline surged painfully and i fell into a defensive stance quen burst in sasir he barked changing his title sahanu midspeech he jerked to a stop his eyes narrowing as he took in my tense posture in the corner and edden sitting in his chair with my phone at his ear carefully not moving one inch the mans green eyes fixed upon mine my heart pounded our defensive postures eased and i tugged my skirt down where it belonged the door arched closed as jenks darted in hey rache the pixy cried his wings red in excitement someones found a ley line and its got someone in an unholy snit he stopped short taking in the tense room oh its you he said grinning wings clattering he lit upon my shoulder quickly abandoning me for edden and the chance to overhear what nick was saying trent leaned forward to put his elbows on the desk a bead of sweat edged his hairline i tried to swallow finding my mouth dry ms morgan is demonstrating her ley line skills for us trent said im very interested to see ill bet you are i thought wondering how deep in the pile i had stepped ley line magic was used heavily in security and quen had known the moment i found it uneasy i took the opportunity to examine everyones auras with my second sight jenkss was all rainbows as most pixies were eddens was a steady blue tending to yellow about his head quens was a green so dark as to be almost black shot through with vibrant orange streaks about his middle and his handsnot good jonathans was green as well much lighter and almost bland in its uniformity and shade trents i hesitated faltering trents aura was sunshine yellow streaked with a sharply defined red the crimson slashes hinted that he had more than his share of soulmarring tragedy in his past it was unusually close around him rimmed in silver sparkles like ivys was they burst into existence and floated about him when he took a hand and ran it across his head to make his hair lie flat he was looking for somethingthe way the sparkles embedded themselves in his main aura indicating that he had dedicated his life to this search the money the power the drive was all to serve a higher purpose what was he looking for i wondered i couldnt see my aura unless i was standing on a scrying mirrorwhich i would never do again but i was sure trent was looking at it and i didnt like that he could see the demon mark on my wrist pulsating with a nasty black smear or than my aura too had those same ugly red streaks or that apart from his sparkles our auras were almost identical edden looked warily between us knowing something was going on but not what brow pinching he shifted to the edge of his chair and had a terse hushed conversation with nick you have a ley line running through your office i said lightheaded you have one in your backyard trent answered flatly jaw tightening he glanced at edden i could almost see his wish that the fib captain wasnt there his expression was laced with a threatening warning it wasnt publicized that only humans and witches could manipulate ley lines but anyone could figure it out and i knew he wanted me to shut up about them i was more than willing to knowing that having the information was like holding a cobra by the tail my fingers were trembling from adrenaline and i clenched them into fists as i turned to the threefootwide smear of everafter running through trents office it made an east to west swath before his desk more accurate than any compass and i imagined it probably ran through his back office too as soon as i stepped into it i could make an educated guess sweat broke out on the small of my back as i eyed the line id never put myself in one before unless you made the effort to tap into a line you could walk right through it and feel nothing i took a breath willing myself to relax if algaliarept did show up all id have to do was step out of the line it couldnt get out of the everafter as long as the sun was above the horizon with a final wary look at the two men standing protectively behind trent i closed my eyes stealing myself i reached out and touched my will to the line power heady with intent surged into me my pulse leapt and i think i staggered breath fast and shallow i held up a hand to keep edden from touching me i had heard him stand as he shot hushed questions at nick i hung my head and did nothing riding the surges of power rising through me in ever stronger pulses they backwashed at my extremities my head throbbing in hurt as they rebounded and crashed into the continuing inflow i felt a moment of panic as it grew and grew and continued to grow just how strong was this thing i felt like an overinflated balloon and it seemed i was going to burst or go insane this i thought almost panting was why ley line witches have familiars their animal companions filtered the raw energy their simpler minds better able to handle the strain i wouldnt make nick take my risk i had to take it all and i had yet to actually step into the line how much more potent it would be then was anyones guess slowly the demanding influx ebbed becoming almost bearable tingling from the inside i took a breath that sounded suspiciously like a sob the balance of energy finally seemed to have equalized i could feel the wisps of my hair that had escaped my braid tickle my neck as the wind from the everafter lifted past and through me my god i heard edden breathe and i hoped i hadnt just lost his trust i dont think he truly understood how different we were until that moment seeing my hair move in the breeze that only i could feel not much of a witch i heard jonathan say staggering in a power drunk at noon it would be if she were tapping it like most people came quens throaty whisper and i strained to hear him shes not using a familiar sahan shes channeling the entire bloody line by herself jonathans intake of alarm sent a surge of vindication through meuntil he followed it up with an urgent kill her tonight shes not worth the risk anymore my eyes almost flew open but i held them shut so they wouldnt know i had heard my wildly pounding heart sounded loud in my ears adding to the slow swelling of ley line force still trickling in jonathan trent said sounding tired you dont kill something because its stronger than you you find a way to use it use me i thought bitterly over my dead body hoping it wasnt a premonition i lifted my head crossed my fingers for luck prayed i wasnt making a mistake and entered the ley line my knees buckled as the power swelling in me vanished with a painful suddenness it was gone the uncomfortable influx of everafter was gone not believing it i stood realizing i had fallen to one knee i forced my eyes to remain shut lest i lose my second sight slapping away eddens hand gripping my shoulder the strength of the ley line swirled through me making my skin prickle and my hair float but the balance had become perfect it left me shaken but no longer having to fight the strain of its power why had no one ever told me this standing in a line was a hell of a lot easier than maintaining a link to one even if the gritty wind took getting used to eyes still shut i looked at the everafter thinking it was even stranger lit under the demons sun the walls of trents office were gone and only eddens hushed conversation with nick kept me grounded telling my frazzled mind that no i hadnt crossed into the everafter i was standing in a trapdoor seeing a vision of it spreading in all directions was a rolling landscape of scattered groves of trees and wide open tracts to the east and west stretched a hazy ribbon of ley line force i was standing twothirds down its considerable length and i would guess it went to trents back office the sky was a washedout yellow and the sun was intense beating down as if trying to crush the squat stubby trees into the ground i felt as if it was passing right through me bouncing up and warming the undersides of my feet even the coarse grass seemed stunted barely coming to midcalf in the hazy distance to the west were a cluster of sharp lines and angles towering over the landscape eerie and strange the demon city was clearly broken cool i breathed and edden shushed nicks demands for information knowing trent was watching though i couldnt see him i turned my back on him so he couldnt read my lips as i whispered the first half of the incantation fortunately i recalled the short translated phrase since i didnt want to open my eyes to read it off my palm as the words fell from me a slight imbalance of everafter energy stirred in my feet swirling up to settle in my belly my knees grew loose as the grass bent toward me from all sides ley line strength flowed into me carrying a pleasant slurry of tingles with it i wondered how intense the sensation would grow not wanting to admit it felt good my hair lifted in a sudden swirl of power as i began the second half with all but the word of invocation said the energy crested sending a swirl of prickles to push evenly through me it hung within me for a moment then it flashed from me in a flat pulse of yellow to run like ripples over the contours of the land holy crap i said then covered my mouth hoping i hadnt just ruined the charm i hadnt finished it yet shocked i watched with my second sight as the flat sheet of everafter energy sped away the pulse was the color of my aura and i felt uneasy reminding myself that the spell had taken only the hue of my aura not my aura itself the ring continued to expand until it went faint in the distance i didnt know whether to be pleased or alarmed that it seemed to have gone all the way to the halfseen city the outgoing ripple didnt leave the everafter landscape unchanged and my awe shifted to alarm as i realized that in its wake was a smattering of glittering green smears bodies they were everywhere beside me i could see the small ones some no bigger than my pinky nail farther out only the larger ones could be discerned my first guttwisting reaction dulled as i realized the charm was picking up everything that was dead rodents birds bugs everything a huge number of big ones lay to the west in neat and orderly rows and columns i had a moment of panic until i realized they were right where trents stables lay in the real world and were probably the bodies of his past race winners my heart slowed and i tried to remember the last word the one that would sensitize the charm to show only human remains brow furrowed i stood in trents office my feet firmly in a gateway to the everafter trying to remember what it had been oh isnt this a delight came a richly cultured voice from behind me i waited for someone to tell me who had just walked into trents office but no one said a word the hair pricked on the back of my neck anticipating the worst i kept my eyes closed and my second sight open and turned my hand rose to my mouth and i froze it was a demon dressed in a robe and slippers rachel mariana morgan it said then smiled wickedly i swallowed hard okayit was my demon what are you doing in trenton aloysius kalamacks ley line it questioned my breath came faster and i waved a hand behind me trying to find the edge of the line im working i said my hand throbbing as i found it what are you doing here it shrugged its stance lengthening as it molded into the familiar vision of a lanky leatherclad vamp with blond hair and a torn ear slumping into a badboy swagger it licked its pouty lips the chain running from a back pocket to its belt loop jingling my breath went shaky it was getting better at picking kisten out of my mind it had him down perfectly a pair of smoked glasses with round frames appeared in its hand and it snapped the earpieces out with a quick flick of the wrist i felt you love it said its teeth lengthening to that of a vampires as it put the glasses on to hide its red goat eyes i simply haaaad to see if you had come for a visit you dont mind if i be this one do you hes got the balls of a bull god help me i shuddered sticking my hand out of the line despite the stabbing hurt of everafter imbalance i wasnt trying to get your attention i whispered go away i felt a touch on my hand and i jerked away i could smell burnt coffee and i wished edden would quit doing that who the devil is she talking to the fib captain asked softly i dont know jenks said but im not going into that line to see leave the demon said its grin widening no no no dont be silly i want to see how much everafter you can manipulate go on love finish your little charm it encouraged in the background i could hear trent and quen having an intense argument i wasnt willing to open my eyes and risk losing sight of the demon but i thought trent was winning nervous i licked my lips hating myself when the vision of kisten did the same with a mocking slowness i forgot the last word i admitted then stiffened as i remembered favilla i blurted in relief and the demon clapped his hands in delight i jumped as a second wave of everafter jolted through me clutching my arms about myself as if to keep my aura intact i watched the flat pulse of yellow dart away following the path of the first algaliarept moaned staggering as if in pleasure as it passed through it i watched its reaction in near horror the demon obviously liked it but if it could have taken my aura it would have by now i think spun candy it said closing its eyes flay me and slay me spun candy and nectar swell i had to get out of there while algaliarept ran its hand over the grass and licked from its fingers the yellow smear of ley line power my charm had left on it i scanned the surrounding countryside my shoulders tightened in worry every glittering blur marking death was gone algaliarept seemed content seining the grass for remnants of my spell so i snuck a quick look behind me my fast spin jerking to a stop one of the horse graves glowed a bright red it wasnt a horse it was a person trent had killed her i thought my attention darting to a new shape materializing within the ley line it was trent having stepped into it to see what i was seeing his gaze went to the flash of red widening but his shock was nothing compared to when the demon shifted into a mirror copy of me sleek and dangerous in a black silk body stocking trenton aloysius kalamack it said making my voice sexier than i ever could it suggestively licked the last of my spell off its finger and i wondered if the demon was making me look better than i actually did what a dangerous direction your thoughts have taken the demon said you should be more careful whom you invite to play in your ley line it hesitated its hip cocked as it squinted over its glasses and compared our auras such a pretty pair you make like matched horses in my stables and it disappeared in a sensation of tingles leaving me to stare across the everafter landscape at trent twentyone my heels clacked with more authority than i felt as i walked down the long planked porch of trents foaling stable ahead of trent and quen the empty row of box stalls faced the south and the afternoon sun atop them were the vet apartments no one was in them seeing as it was fall though horses could have their foals any time of the year most stables enforced a strict breeding program so the mares all dropped their foals at once getting the dangerous period over with at one time i thought the temporarily abandoned buildings were a perfect place to hide a body god help me i thought with a sudden wash of ill feeling how could i be so cavalier dr anders was dead a faint baying of a beagle lifted over the hazy afternoon my head jerked up and my heart gave a pound farther down the dirt road was a kennel the size of a small apartment complex dogs were standing against their wire runs watching trent brushed past me the breeze of his passage smelling of fallen leaves they never forget their quarry he murmured and i tensed trent and quen had accompanied us out here leaving jonathan behind to supervise the fib officers still coming in from the gardens the two men angled for an alcove tucked dead center between the row of box stalls the woodwalled room was completely open to the wind and sun on one side by the rustic furniture i guessed it was a box stall converted to an outdoor meeting place for the vets to relax during births and such i didnt like that no one was with them but i wasnt about to join them slowing i leaned against a support post deciding i could keep an eye on them from there three fib officers with their cadaver dogs stood by the dog van parked in the shade of a huge oak tree the doors were open and glenns authoritative voice drifted to hang over the sunwarmed pastures edden was with them looking out of place on the fringes it was obvious that glenn was in charge by the way edden kept his hands in his pockets and his mouth shut flitting over them was jenks his wings red in excitement as he got in the way and offered a steady stream of unasked for advice that was ignored the remaining fib officers stood under the ancient oak that shadowed the parking lot as i watched a crime scene van pulled in with an exaggerated slowness captain edden had called it after i found a body i snuck a glance at trent deciding the businessman looked a bit bothered if anything as he stood in the informal room with his hands behind his back personally id be visibly upset if someone was about to find an unexplained body on my property i was sure this was where the unmarked grave had been shining cold i stepped off the covered walkway and into the sun hands gripping my elbows i came to a halt in the sawdust parking lot surreptitiously watching trent from around a wisp of hair that had escaped my braid he had put on a lightweight creamcolored hat against the sun and changed his shoes to boots in deference to our trip out to his stables somehow the mix looked right on him it wasnt fair he should look so calm and relaxed but then he jerked at the sound of a car door slamming he was wound as tight as i was he just hid it better glenn said a few last loud words and the group broke up tails waving the dogs began a methodical search two in the nearby pastures one through the building itself i couldnt help but notice that the handler assigned to the stables was using his skills too instead of relying on the dogs nose alone looking up into rafters and opening latched panels captain edden touched his sons shoulder and headed toward me short arms swinging rachel he said even before he was close and i looked up surprised he had used my first name weve been over this building already if it isnt this building then its near here your men may not have been using my charms properly or not at all i finished silently knowing the prejudice humans felt was often covered up in smiles lies and hypocrisy i knew i shouldnt jump to conclusions though i was fairly sure trent had used a ley line charm to cover up her whereabouts and so my spells would have been less than useful my attention went from the dogs to trent as quen leaned to speak into his ear shouldnt he be under arrest or detained or something i asked edden squinted from the low sun keep your panties on murder cases are won and lost in the collection of evidence morgan you ought to know that im a runner not a detective i said sourly most of the people i tagged were charged before i brought them in he grunted at that i thought that captain eddens adherence to the rules might lead to trent vanishing in a puff of smoke to never be seen again seeing me fidget he pointed at me and then at the ground to tell me to stay where i was before he moseyed down to quen and trent the squat humans hands were in his pockets but not far from his weapon quen hadnt a weapon but looking at him shifting lightly on his feet i didnt think he needed one i felt better when edden subtly moved the two men apart snagging a passing officer and telling him to ask quen to detail their security procedures while he talked to trent about the upcoming fib fundraiser dinner nice i turned away watching the sun shine on the dogs yellow coat the heat soaked into me and the smell of the stables was warm with memory i had enjoyed my three summers at camp the scent of sweaty horse and hay mixing with the hint of aged manure was like a balm my riding lessons had been to help increase my balance improve my muscle tone and up my red blood cell count but i think its largest benefit had been the confidence i gained from being in control of a big beautiful animal that would do anything i asked of it to an elevenyearold that feeling of power was addictive a smile curved over me and i closed my eyes feeling the autumn sun soak deeper my friend and i had snuck out of our camp house one morning to sleep in the stables with the horses the soft sounds of their breathing had been indescribably comforting our cabin mother had been furious but it was the best i had slept the entire time my eyes opened it had probably been the only night id slept uninterrupted jasmin too had slept well at the stables and the pale girl had desperately needed sleep jasmin i thought clutching at the name thats what the darkhaired girls name had been jasmin the sound of radio chatter pulled my gaze from the field leaving me feeling more melancholy than i wouldve expected she had possessed an inoperable brain tumor i didnt think even trents fathers illegal activities could have fixed that my attention went to trent his green eyes were intent on me even as he talked to edden and i tugged my hat straight and tucked a wisp of hair behind an ear refusing to let him rattle me i stared back his gaze flicked behind me and i turned as sara janes red car pulled up with a scattering of sawdust beside the fib vehicles the small woman bolted from her car looking like a different person in her jeans and casual blouse slamming the door she stalked forward you she accused coming to a flustered halt before me and i took a surprised step back this is your doing isnt it she shouted up at me my face went blank uh she put herself in my face and i took another step back i asked for your help in finding my boyfriend she said shrilly eyes flashing not accuse my employer of murder you are an evil witch so evil you couldcould fire god um i stammered glancing at edden for help he and trent were on their way over and i backed up another step holding my bag tight against me i hadnt thought of this sara jane trent soothed even before he was close its all right she spun to him her blond hair catching the highlights of the sun mr kalamack she said her face shifting abruptly to fear and worry eyes pinched she wrung her hands im sorry i came as soon as i heard i didnt ask her to come here ii her eyes welled and making a small noise she dropped her head into her hands and started crying my lips parted in surprise was she worried about her job her boyfriend or trent trent gave me a dark look as if it were my fault she was upset it melted into genuine sympathy as he put a hand upon the small womans shaking shoulders sara jane he soothed ducking his head to try and meet her eyes dont even think that i blame you for this ms morgans accusations have nothing to do with you going to the fib about dan his wonderful voice rose and fell like puddles of silk bbut she thinks you murdered those people she stammered sniffing as she pulled her hands from her face and smeared her mascara into a brown blur under her eye edden shifted uneasily from foot to foot the radio chatter from the fib vehicles rose over the crickets i refused to feel sorry that i had made sara jane cry her boss was dirt and the sooner she realized that the better off she would be trent hadnt killed those people with his hands but he had arranged it making him as guilty as if he had carved them up himself my thoughts went to the picture of the woman on the gunnery and i steeled myself trent pulled sara janes gaze up with a gentle encouragement i wondered at his compassion i wondered how it would feel to have his beautiful voice soothing me telling me that everything was all right then i wondered if there was a chance in hell of sara jane getting away from him with her life intact dont jump to conclusions trent said handing her a linen handkerchief embroidered with his initials no one has been accused of anything and theres no need for you to stay here why dont you go back home this ugly business will be done as soon as we find the stray dog that ms morgans charm has fixed on sara jane shot me a poisonous look yes sir she said her voice harsh stray dog i thought torn between my desire to take her out to lunch for a hearttoheart and my need to slap some sense into the woman edden cleared his throat id ask ms gradenko and yourself to stay here until we know more sir trents professional smile faltered are we being detained no sir he said respectfully merely a request captain a dog handler shouted from the second floor landing my heart pounded at the excitement in the mans voice socks didnt point but we have a locked door adrenaline zinged through me i looked at trent his face showed nothing quen and a small man started forward accompanied by an fib officer the short man was obviously a past jockey now turned manager his face was leathered and wrinkled and he had a wad of keys with him they jingled as he pulled one off and handed it to quen body tense with that unnerving liquid menace quen handed it in turn to edden thank you the fib captain said now go stand with the officers he hesitated smiling if you would please he crooked his finger at a pair of fib officers who had just arrived pointing at quen they jogged over glenn left the crime scene van with its radio and headed in our direction jenks was with him and the pixy circled him three times before zipping ahead give me the key jenks said as he came to a pixydustlaced halt between edden and me ill take it up glenn looked at the pixy in bother as he joined us youre not fib key please an unheard sigh lifted through edden i could tell he wanted to see what was in that room and was making a conscious effort to let his son handle it by rights he had no business being out here i imagine accusing a city council member of murder gave him more justification than he might have otherwise jenkss wings clattered harshly as captain edden handed the key to glenn i could smell glenns sweat over his cologne his eagerness a cluster of people had joined the dog and her handler about the door and gripping my bag tightly i started to the stairs right along with him rachel glenn said coming to a stop and catching my elbow youre staying here i am not i exclaimed jerking out of his grip i glanced at captain edden for support and the squat man shrugged looking put out that he hadnt been invited either glenns face hardened as he saw the direction of my gaze letting go of me he said stay here i want you to watch kalamack read his emotions for me thats a load of crap i said thinking crap or not it was probably a good idea your d i bit my tongue your captain can do that i amended bother pinched his brow all right its crap but youre going to stay here if we find dr anders i want this crime scene tighter than a straight mans butt cheeks in prison jenks offered his tiny shape starting to glow he landed on my shoulder and i let him stay come on glenn i wheedled i wont touch anything and youll need me to tell you if there are any lethal spells jenks can do that he said and he doesnt have to step on the floor to do it frustrated i cocked my hip and fumed i could tell that under his official veneer glenn was worried and excited all at the same time he had only made detective recently and i imagined this was the biggest case hed worked cops spent their entire professional lives on the job and were never assigned a case with this many potential political ramifications all the more reason i should be there but im your inderland consultant i said grasping at straws he put a dark hand on my shoulder and i pushed it off look he said the rims of his ears going red there are procedures to follow i lost my first court case because of a contaminated crime scene and im not going to risk losing kalamack because you were too impatient to wait your turn it needs to be vacuumed photographed dusted analyzed and anything else i can think of you come in right after the psychic got it psychic i questioned and he frowned okay im kidding about the psychic but if you put one manicured nail over that threshold before i say ill throw you out of here faster than stink on snake faster than stink on snake he must have been serious if he was mixing his metaphors you want an acg suit he asked his eyes shifting from mine to the dog van i took a slow breath at the subtle threat anticharm gear the last time i tried to take trent down he had killed the witness right out from under me no i said my subdued tone seemed to satisfy him good he said turning and striding away jenks hovered before me waiting his dragonfly wings were red in excitement and the sun caught the glitter of pixy dust let me know what you find jenks i said glad at least one representative from our sorry little firm would be there you bet rache he said then zipped after glenn edden silently joined me and i felt as if we were the only two people in high school who hadnt been invited to the big pool party standing across the road and watching we waited with an edgy trent an indignant sara jane and a tightlipped quen as glenn knocked at the door to announce his fib presenceas if it wasnt obviousand unlocked it jenks was the first one in he darted out almost immediately his flight somewhat ragged as he landed on the railing glenn leaned in then out of the black rectangular opening get me a mask i heard him mutter clear through the hush my breath came fast he had found something and it wasnt a dog hand over her mouth an fib officer extended a surgical mask to glenn a foul stench came faintly over the comforting aroma of hay and manure my nose wrinkled and i glanced at trent to see his face empty the parking lot went silent an insect shrilled and another answered it by the upstairs door socks whined and pawed at her handlers legs as she looked for reassurance i felt ill how had they missed the smell before id been right it had to have been spelled to keep it contained in the room glenn took a step into the room for a moment his back was bright with sun then he took another to disappear leaving an empty black door frame a uniformed fib officer handed him a flashlight from the threshold a hand over her mouth jenks wouldnt look at me his back was to the door as he stood on the railing his wings bowed and unmoving my heart hammered and i held my breath as the woman in the doorway backed up and glenn came out its a body he said to a second young officer his soft voice carrying clear down to us detain mr kalamack for questioning he took a breath ms gradenko too the officers response was subdued and she headed down the stairs to find trent i triumphantly looked to trent then sobered as i imagined dr anders dead on the floor i superimposed the memory of watching trent kill his leading researcher so quick and clean with a ready alibi waiting to be implemented i had caught him this time having moved too fast for him to cover his butt sara jane clutched at trent fear real and full made her eyes wide and colored her pale cheeks trent didnt seem to notice her grip his face seriously blank as he looked at quen knees weak i watched trent take a slow breath as if steadying himself mr kalamack the young officer said gesturing for trent to accompany him a flicker of emotion flickered over trent as the fib officer said his name i would have said it was fear if i thought anything could shake the man ms morgan trent said in parting to me as he helped sara jane into motion edden and quen went with them the captains round face slack with relief he must have put his reputation further on the line than i had thought sara jane pulled from trent and turned to me you bitch she said fear and hatred in her high childlike voice you have no idea what youve done shocked i said nothing as trent took her elbow with what i thought might be a warning strength my hands started shaking and my stomach clenched glenn was on the stairway there was a disposable wipe in his hands and he was running it over his fingers as he made his way to me he pointed to the crime scene van and then the black rectangle the door made two men lurched into motion with a calm tension they wheeled a black hardwalled suitcase forward i was going to get trent kalamack arrested i thought can i survive that its a body glenn said as he came to a squinting halt before me wiping his hands with yet another wipe you were right he saw my face and i knew i must have looked anxious as he followed my gaze to trent standing with quen and edden hes just a man trent was confident and unruffled the picture of cooperation a sharp contrast to sara janes anger and hysterics is he i breathed its going to be a while before you can go in he said taking a third towel and swabbing the back of his neck he looked a little gray maybe tomorrow even you want a ride home ill stay my stomach felt light it occurred to me that i should probably call ivy and let her know what was going on if shed talk to me is it bad i asked by the door the two men chatted to a third as they unpacked a vacuum from the battered suitcase and put paper sleeves on over their shoes glenn didnt answer his eyes going everywhere but to me and that black doorway if youre staying youll need this he said as he handed me an fib badge with the word temporary on it people were stringing yellow crime scene tape and it looked like they were settling in the radio was thick with short terse requests and everyone but the dogs and i seemed happy i had to get upstairs i had to see what trent had done to dr anders thanks i whispered looping the badges necklace over my head get yourself a coffee he said looking toward one of the vans that had come in with us fib officers with nothing to do were already clustered around it i nodded and glenn headed back to the stairway his long legs taking them two at a time i glanced only once at trent in the open room between the box stalls he was talking to an officer apparently having waived his right to counsel to foster a perception of innocence i wondered or did he think he was too smart to need one numb i joined the fib personnel around the van someone handed me a soda and after i avoided everyones eyes they obligingly ignored me i didnt particularly want to make friends and i wasnt comfortable with the lightness of the conversations jenks though proceeded to charm sips of sugar and caffeine from everyone doing impersonations of captain edden that got everyone laughing eventually i found myself on the outskirts listening to three conversations as the sun moved and a new chill came into the air the vacuum cleaner was faint the onagain offagain sound making me jittery finally it quit and didnt start up no one seemed to have noticed my eyes rose to the upper apartments and i pulled my jacket closer about me glenn had come down just moments before to vanish inside the crime scene van my breath slid in and out of me as easy as the day i was born giving myself a push i found myself moving to the stairway immediately jenks was on my shoulder making me wonder if he had been keeping an eye on me rache he warned dont go in there i have to see i felt unreal the rough banister under my hand still warm from the sun dont he protested his wings clattering glenn is right wait your turn i shook my head the swinging of my braid forcing him off my shoulder i needed to see before the atrocity was lessened with little bags white cards with neatly printed words and the careful collection of data designed to give madness structure so it could be understood get out of my way i said flatly waving at him as he hovered belligerently in front of my face he darted back and i jerked to a stop as i felt a fingertip flick one of his wings id hit him hey he shouted surprise alarm and finally anger washed over him fine he snapped go see im not your daddy still swearing he flew away at head height heads turned in his path as a torrent of foul words spilled nonstop from him my legs felt heavy as i forced myself to rise up the stairs a sharp clattering of feet drew my attention up and i stood sideways as the first of the vacuum guys hustled past me a rank smell of decayed flesh trailed after him and my gore rose forcing it down i continued smiling sickly at the fib officer standing beside the door the smell was worse up there my thoughts flashed to the pictures i had seen in glenns office and i almost lost it dr anders could have only been dead a few hours how could it have gotten so bad so quickly name the man said his face stiff as he tried to look unaffected by the cloying stench i stared for a moment then saw the notebook in his hand there were several names on it the last followed by the word photographer the remaining man on the outside walkway snapped his suitcase shut and dragged it thumping down the stairs by the doorway was a video camera its sophistication somewhere between that of a news crew and the one my dad used before he died to record my and my brothers birthdays oh um rachel morgan i said faintly special inderland consultant youre the witch right he said writing my name down with the time and my temporary badge number you want a mask with your boots and gloves yes thank you my fingers felt weak as i put the mask on first it reeked of wintergreen blocking the stink of decayed flesh thankful i looked in at the wooden floor shining polished and yellow under the last of the sunlight from around the corner and out of sight came the snick snick snick of a camera shutter im not going to bother him am i i asked my words muffled the man shook his head her he said and no you wont bother gwen watch it or shell have you holding tape measures thanks i said resolving to not do anything of the kind my gaze flicked to the parking lot below me as i snapped the paper covers over my shoes the longer i stayed there the more likely it was that glenn would realize i wasnt where he had left me stealing myself i pinched the clip of the mask tighter jerking as the pungent fragrance hit my nose my eyes started to water but i wasnt going to take it off for anything i put my gloved hands in my pockets as if i were in a blackcharm shop and entered who are you a strong feminine voice challenged as my shadow eclipsed the sun my attention jerked to a willowy woman with dark hair tied in a nononsense ponytail she had a camera in hand and was dropping a roll of film into a black bag tied to her hip rachel morgan i said edden brought me in as a my words cut off as my eyes fell onto the torso tied to a hardbacked chair partially hidden behind her my hand rose to my mouth and i forced my throat closed its a mannequin i thought it had to be a mannequin it couldnt be dr anders but i knew it was yellow nylon ropes bound her to the chair and her topheavy upper torso sagged sending her head forward to hide her face stringy hair caked with black hung to further hide her expression and i thanked god for that her legs were missing below both knees the stumps sticking out like a small childs feet at the end of a chair the ends were raw and ugly swollen with decay her arms were gone at the elbows old black blood covered her clothes in a fantastic rivulet pattern so thick the original color couldnt be guessed my eyes flicked to gwen shocked at her blasé expression dont touch anything im not done yet okay she muttered as she went back to her photographing god bless it cant i have even five minutes before everyone comes traipsing in here sorry i breathed surprised i could still talk dr anderss slumped body was covered in blood but there was surprisingly little of it under the chair i felt lightheaded but i couldnt look away her lower cavity had been opened at her belly button a perfectly round patch of skin the size of my fist propped open with a silver knife to show a careful dissection of her insides there were suspicious gaps and the incision was entirely bloodless as if washedor lickedclean where the flesh wasnt covered in blood it was white like wax my gaze went to the pristine walls and floors the body didnt match it had been mutilated elsewhere and moved this one is a real sicko gwen said camera chattering away look at the window she pointed with her chin and i turned it looked like a little cityscape was arranged on the wide shadowed sill squatty buildings were set out in straight lines in no apparent order of size small lumps of gray putty held them upright like glue they were arranged around a thick class ring placed like a monument among the citys streets i looked closer horror tightening my gut i spun to the limbless corpse and back again yup gwen was saying as she clicked away he put them there on display the larger parts he tossed into the closet my gaze shot to the tiny closet then back to the shady windowsill they werent buildings they were fingers and toes he had cut her fingers off knuckle by knuckle arranging them like tinkertoys the putty was bits of her insides the viscera keeping it all together i felt hot then cold my stomach went light and i thought i might pass out i held my breath as i realized i was hyperventilating i was willing to bet shed been alive during it get out gwen said casually framing another shot if you spew in here edden will have a hissy morgan came a faint irate shout from the parking lot is that witch in there the outside officers answer was muffled i couldnt take my eyes off the wreck of a body on the chair the flies crawled among the city streets the mutilated digits made climbing the buildings like monsters in a bmovie gwens clicks were like my heartbeat fast and furious someone grabbed my arm and i gasped rachel glenn said spinning me around to him get your witch ass out of here detective glenn the officer by the door stammered she signed in sign her out he growled and dont let her in again youre hurting me i whispered feeling light and unreal he dragged me to the door i told you to stay out he muttered fiercely youre hurting me i repeated pushing at his fingers encircling my arm as he pulled me out i hit the setting sun it struck me like a goad and i took a huge breath snapping out of my stupor that wasnt dr anders the body was too old and it had been a mans ring it looked like it had the universitys logo on it i thought id just found sara janes boyfriend glenn dragged me to the stairs glenn i said as i stumbled on the first step i would have fallen but for his hold on me another fib vehicle was easing into the lot a mobile morgue this time glenn not taking any chances was bringing everything there slowly my legs lost their watery feeling as i put distance between me and what i had seen upstairs i watched the fib officers joking among themselves not understanding i was clearly not cut out for crime scene work i was a runner not an investigator my father had worked in the arcane division where most of the bodies showed up now i knew why he never said much about his day at the dinner table glenn i tried again as he pulled me into the open room between the stalls trent stood in a corner with sara jane and quen quietly answering questions glenn jerked to a stop as he saw them he looked at his father who shrugged the fib captain sat before a laptop resting on a bail of straw propped up on its end someone had run a line from the crime van and eddens stubby fingers skated over the keyboard as he played subordinate so he could stay irritation pinched glenns face and he gestured to the young fib officer with trent glenn i said as the officer edged his way to us that isnt dr anders up there eddens round face went questioning behind his glasses glenn flicked a glance at me i know he said the body is too old sit down and shut up the fib officer came to a halt beside us and my eyes widened as glenn put an aggressive arm across his shoulders i told you to detain them he said softly what are they still doing here the man went white you meant in one of the cruisers i thought mr kalamack would be more comfortable here glenns lips pressed together and his neck muscles tensed detained for questioning means move them to the fib offices you dont question people at the crime scene when its this important get them out of here but you didnt say the man swallowed yes sir glancing once at edden he headed toward trent and sara jane looking apologetic frightened and very young i didnt have time to spare him any pity still angry glenn went to stand over his fathers shoulder typing in his own password with a stiff finger my stomach gave a lurch and settled i pushed the top of the computer down on his hands glenn clenched his jaw as they both looked up at me i turned to trent and sara jane on their way out waiting until edden and glenn followed my gaze to them before saying i cant say for sure but i think thats dan sara janes face remained blank for a telling moment eyes widening she clutched at trent her mouth opened and closed burying her face in his shoulder she began sobbing trent patted her shoulder gently but his eyes on me were narrowed in anger edden pursed his lips in thought which made his graying mustache stick out as we exchanged shrewd looks sara jane didnt know dan as well as she wanted everyone to think why would trent make sara jane come to the fib with a phony complaint of a missing boyfriend when he knew id find the body on his grounds unless he hadnt known about it how could he not know glenn apparently missed everything as he grabbed my upper arm and yanked me past a hysterical sara jane and out into the shadows of the oak tree damn it rachel he hissed as sara jane was led sobbing to a cruiser i told you to shut up youre leaving now that little stunt of yours might be enough to let kalamack walk even in my heels glenn was taller than me and it ticked me off yeah i shot back you asked me to read trents emotions well i did sara jane doesnt know dan smather from her mailman trent had him killed and that body has been moved glenn reached for me and i stepped out of his reach his face tightened and he took a step back exhaling slowly i know go home he said extending his hand for the temporary fib badge i appreciate your assistance in finding the body but as you said you arent a detective every time you open your mouth youre making it easier for trents attorney to sway a jury just go home ill call you tomorrow anger warmed me the last dregs of adrenaline making me feel weak not strong i found his body you cant make me leave i just did give me the badge glenn i said as i ducked out of the necklace before he snapped it off my neck trent murdered that witch as sure as if he had twisted the knife he held my badge in a tight grip his anger slowing enough to show his frustration i can talk to him even hold him for questioning but i cant arrest him but he did it i protested youve got a body youve got a weapon youve got probable cause i have a body thats been moved he said his voice flat from his repressed emotions my probable cause is conjecture ive got a weapon six hundred employees could have planted there is nothing to link trent to the murder yet if i arrest him now he could walk even if he confesses later ive seen it happen mr kalamack may have done this on purpose planted the body and made sure there was nothing to link him to it if this one doesnt stick it will be twice as hard to pin another corpse to him even if he makes a mistake later youre afraid to take him down i accused trying to goad him into arresting trent listen to me real good rachel he said jolting me into taking a step back i dont give a dingos ass if you think kalamack did it i have to prove it and this is the only chance im going to get turning halfway around he scanned the parking lot someone take ms morgan home he said loudly without a backward glance he stomped to the stables his heavy steps silent on the sawdust i stared not knowing what to do my attention went to trent getting into a fib cruiser his expensive suit making it look wrong he gave me an unfathomable look before the door shut with a metallic thump lights off and slow the two cars pulled out my blood hummed and my head was pounding trent wasnt going to get away with this unscathed eventually i would tie each and every murder back to him having found dans body on his grounds would give captain edden the clout to get whatever warrant i wanted trent was going to fry i could play it slow i was a runner i knew how to stalk prey i turned away disgusted i hated the law even as i relied on it id much rather fight a coven of black witches than a courtroom any day i understood witches mores better than lawyers at least witches used theirs jenks i shouted as captain edden emerged from the stables keys jingling in his hands great now i was going to have to listen to a lecture of wiseoldman crap all the way home it felt good to shout and i took another breath to yell for jenks again when the pixy came to a short stop in front of me he was literally glowing in excitement the dust that had sifted from him drifting into me from his momentum yeah rache hey i heard glenn kicked you out i told you not to go up there but did you listen to me noooooo no one listens to me ive got thirty some kids and the only one who listens to me is my dragonfly my anger hesitated for an instant as i wondered if he really had a pet dragonfly then i shook myself sending my thoughts onto how to salvage something from this jenks i said can you get home from here all right sure ill hitch with glenn or the dogs no problem good i glanced at captain edden as he approached tell me what happens okay gotcha hey for whats its worth im sorry you gotta learn to keep your mouth shut and your fingers to yourself see you later this coming from a pixy i didnt touch anything i said peeved but he had already flitted back to glenns temporary office leaving a headhigh trail of dust to slowly dissipate edden spared me a single glance as he passed me frowning i followed him yanking my door open the car started and i got in and slammed the door shut belt latched i draped my arm on the open window and stared at the empty pasture whats the matter i said nastily glenn kick you out too no edden shifted the car into reverse i need to talk to you sure i said for lack of anything better a frustrated sigh slipped from me catching as my gaze fell upon quen he stood unmoving in the shade of the old oak there was no expression on his face he must had heard my entire conversation with glenn concerning trent a chill went through me and i wondered if i had just put myself on quens special people list green eyes fixed to me with a shocking intensity quen reached up to a low branch and swung himself up with the ease of picking a flower disappearing into the old oak as if he had never existed twentytwo edden swung the car into the churchs tiny weedchoked parking lot he hadnt said much on the way back his white knuckles and red neck telling me what he thought of the freeflow stream of consciousness that i had been spewing forth ever since he confessed the reason why he was playing chauffeur for me shortly after finding the body word had come over the radio that i was to be removed from the fib payroll seems it got out that a witch was helping them and the is called foul i might have been able to swing it if glenn had cared to explain that i was merely a consultant but he hadnt said a word apparently still sulking over me contaminating his precious crime scene that there wouldnt even be a crime scene if it hadnt been for me didnt seem to mean anything slamming the car into park edden stared out the front window and waited for me to get out i had to give him credit its not easy to sit and listen while someone compares your son to squid suckers and bat guano in the same breath shoulders slumping i didnt move if i got out it would mean it was over and i didnt want it to be besides keeping up a tirade for twenty minutes is tiring and i probably owed him an apology if nothing else my arm hung out the cars open window and i could hear a piano playing some elaborate complicated thing that composers made up to show off their dexterity rather than any artistic expression i took a breath if i could just talk to trent no can i at least listen to the tape of his interview no i rubbed my temples an escaped curl tickling my cheek how does anyone expect me to do my job if they wont let me do it its not your job anymore edden said the hint of anger pulled my head up i followed his gaze to the pixy children sliding down the steeple on the tiny squares of wax paper i had cut for them yesterday neck stiff edden shifted in his seat to take his wallet from a back pocket flipping it open he handed me some bills i was told to pay you in cash dont claim it on your taxes he said flatly my lips pressed together and i snatched it counting the money pay me in cash out of the captains pocket someone had fallen deep into cover your ass mode my stomach tightened as i realized it was far less than what we had agreed upon id been almost a week on this and youll get me the rest later right i asked as i shoved it into my bag management wont pay for dr anderss canceled class he said not looking at me stiffed again not looking forward to telling ivy i was short with my rent i opened the door and got out if i didnt know better id say the piano was coming from the church tell you what edden i slammed the door shut dont call me again grow up rachel he said jerking me back around his round face was tight as he leaned across the seat to talk to me through the window if it had been me i would have arrested you and given you to the is to play with he told you to wait and you stepped all over his authority fingers pulling the strap of my bag higher up my shoulder my scowl faltered i hadnt thought about it like that look he said seeing my sudden understanding i dont want to break our working relationship maybe when things cool off we can try this again ill get the rest of the money to you somehow yeah sure i straightened my beliefs in the asinine kneejerk reactions of upper management reinforced but maybe i owed glenn an apology rachel yup i owed glenn an apology i turned to edden a depressed frustrated sigh shifting through me tell glenn im sorry i muttered before he could respond i sent my heels clacking on the cracked sidewalk and up the wide stone steps for a moment there was silence then the cars fan belt whined as edden backed up and drove away the music was coming from inside still upset about my missing rent i yanked open the heavy door and went in ivy must be home my frustration with edden died with the chance to finally talk to her i wanted to tell her that nothing had changed and she was still my friendif shed have me for one turning down the offer to be her scion might be an insurmountable insult in the vamp world i didnt think so though what little i had seen of her showed guilt not anger ivy i called cautiously the piano cut off in midchord rachel ivy responded from the sanctuary there was a worrisome hint of alarm in her voice damn she was going to run then my eyebrows rose that wasnt a recording we had a piano shrugging out of my coat i hung it up and went into the sanctuary blinking at the sudden light we had a piano we had a beautiful black baby grand piano sitting in an amber and green sunbeam coming in through the stainglassed windows its top was propped up to show its insides the wires gleaming and the stops all velvety smooth when did you get the piano i asked seeing her poised and ready to run double damn if she would just slow down enough to listen my shoulders eased as she took up a chamois cloth and started rubbing the gleaming wood she was wearing jeans and a casual top and i felt terribly overdressed in my dress suit today she said as she dusted wood that needed no dusting maybe if i didnt say anything about what had happened we could get back to the way things were ignoring a problem was a perfectly acceptable way to deal with it as long as both people agree to never bring it up again you didnt have to stop because of me i said scrambling to say something before she found a reason to leave she edged around to polish the back as i went to hit middle c ivy straightened her eyes slipping shut and her dust cloth stopping middle c she said as peace slackened her pale oval face i chose another holding the key down to listen to it echo among the rafters it sounded wonderful in the open hardwalled space especially since the exercise mats were gone fsharp she whispered and i hit two at a time c and dsharp she said opening her eyes thats an awful combination i smiled relieved when she met my gaze i didnt know you could play i said hitching my bag up higher on my shoulder my mother made me take lessons nodding absently i dug the money out of my bag my thoughts went to the discrepancy between us as i leaned through the piano and handed it to her ivy was buying a baby grand piano and my dresser was made of pressboard head bent over the money she counted it youre missing two hundred she said taking a breath i went into the kitchen guilt tugged at me as i dropped my bag on ivys antique kitchen table and went to the fridge for the juice edden shorted me i shouted to the sanctuary thinking she probably wouldnt leave if we were talking about money ill get the rest im going to talk to the baseball team again rachel ivy said from the hall and i spun my heart pounding i hadnt heard her footsteps she took in my surprise and a wash of inner pain flickered over her eddens freakin attempt at compensation was in her hand and i hated everything just everything forget it she said making me feel even better i can cover for you this month again i finished silently for her damn it to hell i ought to be able to pay my own bills depressed i took off my hat and hung it on my chair my heels were next and i kicked them off sending them flying out the archway to land thumping somewhere in the living room in my stocking feet i sat slumped at the table and nursed my juice as if it was a beer at closing time there was an open bag of cookies on the table and i pulled them closer chocolate cream would make everything better if i could get enough into me ivy stretched to drop the money into the jar atop the fridge it wasnt the safest place to keep the money we pooled to pay our bills but who was going to steal from a tamwood vampire saying nothing she slipped into her chair across from me the length of the table between us the fan of her computer whirled up to speed as she jiggled the mouse my bad mood eased she hadnt left she was working at her computer i was in the same room with her maybe she felt safe enough that she could at least listen ivy i started no she said flicking me a frightened look i just want to say im sorry i rushed dont go ill drop it how could someone so strong and powerful be so afraid of herself the woman was a conflicting mass of strength and vulnerability that i didnt understand her eyes went everywhere but to mine slowly her wiretight posture relaxed but it wasnt your fault she whispered then why do i feel like crap im sorry ivy i said pulling her eyes to mine for a brief moment they were as brown as chocolate with no hint of black rimming them its just stop she said her gaze going to her hand clutching the table the nails still shiny from the clear polish she had put on to go to piscarys she visibly forced her grip to relax iwont ask you to be my scion again if you dont say anything more the last was hesitant disquieting in her vulnerability it was almost as if she knew what i was going to say and couldnt bear to hear it i would not be her scioni couldnt the tie that would bind us would be too tight and take from me my independence while i knew in the vampire existence that the giving and receiving of blood was not necessarily equated with sex to me they were the same and i didnt want to say can we just be friends it was trite and degrading even if to be her friend was all i wanted shed take the words as the brushoff most people used them for i liked her too much to hurt her that way and i could tell it wasnt a lingering bitterness that prompted her promise she wouldnt ask me to be her scion because she didnt want the pain of being rejected again i didnt understand vampires but thats where ivy and i were she met my eyes with a faltering sureness that strengthened as she saw my silent agreement to ignore what had happened her shoulders eased and she regained a wisp of her usual confidence but as i sat in our kitchen with my feet in the sun i went cold with the knowledge of how badly i was using her she was freely giving me protection against the many vampires that would take advantage of my scarin essence she was ensuring my free willand she was willing to overlook that i wasnt paying for it in the usual vampiric fashion god help me it was enough to make me hate myself she wanted something i couldnt give her and she was content to take my friendship in the hopes that someday i could give more i took a slow breath watching her pretend not to notice my eyes on her as i let the pieces fall into place i couldnt leave it was more than not wanting to lose the only real friend i had had in eight years or my desire to help her win the war she fought against herself it was the fear of being turned into a plaything by the first vampire i ran into in a moment of weakness i was trapped by convenience and the tiger with me was willing to lap cream and purr betting shed find a way to change my mind great id have no problem sleeping tonight ivys eyes met mine her breathing hesitating a bare second as she realized that id finally figured it out wheres jenks she asked turning to her screen as if nothing had happened i exhaled slowly coming to grips with my new outlook i could leave and fight off every lustful vamp i ran into or i could stay under ivys mantle trusting id never have to fight her off instead as my dad was fond of saying a known danger was far better than an unknown one at trents helping glenn i said my fingers trembling as i reached for another cookie id stay we had an understanding or was nick right in that i really did want her to bite me but couldnt accept that my preferences had slid a little surely the former im off the case i found a body and word got out a witch was helping the fib her eyes met mine over the screen between us her thin eyebrows high you found a body at trents compound youre kidding i nodded slumping with my elbows on the table unwilling to delve any deeper into my psyche right now i was too tired im pretty sure its dan smathers but it doesnt matter glenn is more uptight than a pixy in a room full of frogs but trents going to walk my thoughts shifted from what i was going to do about ivy to the memory of dans mutilated body strapped to the chair trent is too smart to leave anything to connect him to the body i said i dont understand why it was on his property to begin with she nodded her attention going back to her screen maybe he put it there a wry grimace crossed me thats what glenn thinks that trent is the murderer but wanted us to find it knowing we couldnt link it to him and therefore making it twice as hard to catch him if he makes a mistake later on it fits with sara janes reaction she doesnt know dan smather better than her ups man but something i hesitated trying to put my feeling into words something isnt right i thought back to the picture shed given me it had been the same photo as the one on his tv i shouldve known then that their courtship was contrived i was starting to doubt my own grudgelaced belief that trent was responsible for the murders and that was disturbing he was capable of murderid seen that firsthandbut the mutilated bloodless body tied to that chair and tortured was far and away from the clean fast death he had inflicted upon his head geneticist last spring thinking i reached for a cookie biting the head off i got up to hunt through the fridge to decide what i was going to fix for dinner and let my subconscious work on it maybe id make something special it had been a while since i had done more than open boxes and stir things on the stove i glanced at ivy feeling guilty and relieved all at the same time no wonder she thought i wanted more than to be her roommate some of this was my fault most maybe so what did trent do when you found the body ivy asked mouse clicking as she checked out her chat rooms any guilt ah no i said pushing my uncomfortable feelings aside even as i took a half pound of lean hamburger out of the freezer and set it clunking into the sink and the surprise he let slip wasnt that i found a body but that it was dans body thats why i dont like the idea that he put it there to cover himself he knows more than hes saying though i gazed out the window at the sunlit garden and the glimmers of pixy wings as jenkss kids fought off a migrating hummingbird from the last of the lobelias it had to be migrating jenks would have killed it before letting competition get a foothold in his garden as the children shouted and called working together to drive the hapless bird away my thoughts returned to the worry trent had let show when i found that ley line running through his office he had been more upset about me finding that line than finding dans body the ley line thats where the real question lurked my fingers tingled as i turned wiping the frost from the hamburger off on a towel instead of my suit dress i glanced at the window wondering if i would draw more attention by shutting it or if i should press my luck and hope jenkss kids were too busy to eavesdrop ivy pulled back from her computer screen as she saw my sudden secrecy jenks had a big mouth and i didnt want him knowing of my suspicions of trents possible ancestry he would blab it around and trent would hire a plane to accidentally drop agent orange on the entire block to stop the rumors splitting the difference i shut the curtains and stood by the window where i could see the shadow of pixy wings should any flit close enough to hear trent has a ley line in his office i said my voice hushed ivy stared at me in the bluetinted sun no kidding what are the chances of that she didnt get it so that means he must use them i prompted and her eyebrows rose in question so who can use ley lines i shot back her jaw dropped in sudden understanding hes human or a witch she breathed she got to her feet in a movement so quick it set me on edge coming to the sink she pushed the curtain aside and shut the window with a thump does trent know you saw it she asked her eyes black in the dimmer light oh id say he does i went to get another cookie to subtly put some space between us seeing as i had to use the line to find the body her lips pressed together and her lanky stance went tight you put your head on the block again you me jenks and his entire family trent will do anything to keep this quiet if he was that worried about it he wouldnt have risked putting his office on the line i protested hoping i was right anyone looking would find it he could still be inderlander or human were safe especially if i dont say anything about the ley line jenks might figure it out she insisted you know how hell blab it hed love the prestige of finding out what trent is i snatched a cookie what am i supposed to do if i tell him to keep his mouth shut about the line hell only try to figure out why her fingers drummed on the counter as i ate the shortbread and cream in an unnerving display of strength she used one hand to lever herself up to sit atop the cabinets her face had come alive her thin eyebrows creased with the chance to solve the longrunning mystery so what do you think he is human or witch returning to the sink i ran hot water over the frozen meat neither it was a flat admission ivy remained silent and i turned the water off hes neither ivy i would stake my life that he isnt a witch and jenks swears hes more than human is this why i stayed i wondered seeing her eyes alight and her mind working with mine her logic and my intuition in spite of the problems we worked well together we always had ivy shook her head her features blurred in the bluecurtained dusk but i could feel her tension rising its the only choices we have you eliminate everything and whatever remains no matter how improbable is the answer it didnt surprise me she was quoting sherlock holmes the anal logic and brusque nature of the fictional detective fit right in with ivys personality well if you want to entertain the improbable i muttered you can lump demons in with the possibilities demons ivys tapping fingers stilled i shook my head in bother trents not a demon i only mentioned it because demons are from the everafter and so can manipulate ley lines too id forgotten that she breathed the soft sound sending a shiver down my spine but she was intent on her thoughts and had no idea how creepy she was getting that youre related i mean witches and demons an affronted snort slipped past me and she shrugged apologetically sorry didnt know it was a sore spot it isnt i said tightly though it was there had been a flurry of controversy about a decade ago when a nosy human in the field of inderland genealogy got hold of the few genetic maps that had survived the turn theorizing that because witches could manipulate ley lines we had originated in the everafter along with demons witches arent related to demons but much to our embarrassment science forced us to admit aloud that we had evolved right along next to them in the everafter finding funding with that unsavory tidbit the woman then went beyond her original theory using the rates of rna mutation to properly place the time of our en masse migration to this side of the ley lines about five thousand years ago witch mythology claimed that a demon uprising had prompted the move leaving the elves to foolishly wage a losing battle since they wouldnt leave their beloved fields and woods to be raped of their natural resources and polluted it sounded like a viable theory and the elves had lost all their history by the time they gave up and followed suit a measly two thousand years ago that humans had developed skill in ley line magic about that time was blamed on the elves practice of using their magic to hybridize with humanity to stave off the extinction the demons started and the turn finished my thoughts turned to nick and i slumped it was just as well witches were so far from humanity that even magic couldnt bridge the gap who knew what an uninformed witchhuman hybrid skilled in ley lines might do that the elves had brought humanity into the leylineusing family was bad enough the elves dexterity with line magic had slipped into the human genome as if it belonged it was enough to make you wonder elves i thought going cold it had been staring me right in the face ohmygod i whispered ivy looked up her swinging legs stilling as she took in my expression hes an elf i whispered the thrill of discovery bubbling up making my pulse race they didnt die out in the turn hes an elf trent is a freaking elf whoa wait a minute ivy warned theyre gone if any were alive jenks would know hed be able to smell it i shook my head pacing to the hallway to look for winged eavesdroppers not if the elves went underground for a pixyfairy generation the turn pretty much did them in and it wouldnt be hard to hide what survived until the last pixy who knew what they smelled like died they only live about twenty years or so pixies i mean my words tumbled over themselves as i rushed to get it out and you saw how trent doesnt like them or fairies its almost a phobia it fits i cant believe it we figured it out rachel ivy cajoled as she shifted atop the counter dont be stupid hes not an elf arms crossed i pressed my lips together in frustration he sleeps at noon and midnight i said and hes most active at dawn and dusk just like elves were he possesses nearly vamplike reflexes he likes his solitude but is damn good at manipulating people my god ivy the man tried to ride me down on horseback like prey under the full moon i tossed my arms as i gestured youve seen his gardens and that artificial forest of his hes an elf and so are quen and jonathan she shook her head they died all of them and what would they have to gain by letting even inderland think they were gone if they werent you know how we throw money at endangered species especially intelligent ones i dont know i said exasperated with her disbelief humanity was never keen on their history of stealing human babies and substituting their own failing infants that would be enough for me to keep my mouth shut and my head down until everyone thought we were dead ivy made a noise of doubt deep in her throat but i could see her belief shifting he works ley lines i insisted you said it yourself eliminate the impossible and whats left no matter how improbable is the truth the man isnt human or witch my eyes closed as i remembered biting both jonathan and trent when i had been a mink struggling to escape he cant be his blood tastes like cinnamon and wine hes an elf ivy said her voice shockingly flat i opened my eyes her face was alive and alight why didnt you tell me he tasted like cinnamon she said as she slipped from the counter her black ankle boots hitting the linoleum without a sound selfpreservation pulled me a step from her before i knew i had moved i thought it might have been from the drugs he had knocked me out with i said not liking that the mention of blood had jerked her into motion the brown of her irises was shrinking behind her widening pupils i was sure it was from discovering trents ancestry and not me standing in her kitchen with my blood pounding and my palms sweating but stilli didnt like it mind whirling i gave her a warning look and put the island counter between us okay so i knew trents history telling him would certainly get me an audience with him but how do you tell a serial killer you know his secret without ending up dead you arent going to tell him you know ivy said giving me an apologetic look before putting her back against the counter in a blatant show of keeping her distance i have to talk to trent hell talk to me if i drop this on his plate and serve it up with gravy ill be okay i have that blackmail on him edden will slap you with a harassment suit if you so much as call him ivy warned my eyes lit upon the bag of sandwich cookies with their little oak tree and clapboard sign moving slowly i slid the bag closer picking out a figure with all his limbs intact ivys eyes dropped to the cellophane then rose to me i could almost see her thoughts aligning themselves to mine she gave me one of her few honest smiles letting slip only the barest glimmer of teeth as a wicked yet almost shy look brought her alive a shiver laced through me pulling my insides tight i think i know how to get his attention i said biting the head clean off the chocolatecovered cookie and wiping the crumbs from my lips but in the back of my head a new question niggled incited by nicks constant worry was the thrill of anticipation i felt rising through me from my coming conversation with trentor that tiny whisper of white teeth twentythree the clamor of the buss diesel engine was obnoxious as it jolted into motion and struggled to find momentum while going uphill i stood on the weededged sidewalk and waited for it to pass before crossing the street the soft whooshes of cars made a comforting background to the birds insects and the occasional quacking of a duck i turned feeling someones eyes on me it was a were with black hair to his shoulders and a trim body that said he ran on two legs as much as he did four his attention went from me to the park and he sank back into the tree he was leaning against adjusting his worn leather coat my pace faltered as i recognized him from the university but he looked away and pulled his hat down over his eyes dismissing me he wanted something but it was obvious he knew i was busy and was willing to wait loners were like that and from his confident setapart look i imagined thats what he was he probably had a run for me and wasnt willing to knock on my door more comfortable with waiting to catch me when i wasnt busy it had happened before weres had a tendency to view anyone who lived on hollowed ground as mysterious and esoteric appreciating his professionalism i started down the sidewalk in the opposite direction of the bus the noon sun warm on my shoulders i liked eden park especially this little used end of it nick worked at the art museum cleaning artifacts just down the road and we occasionally had my lunch and his dinner alfresco at the small overlook above cincinnati but my favorite place was the end that looked the other way over the river and to the hollows my father had brought me here saturday mornings where we would eat doughnuts and feed crumbs to the ducks my mood went somber as i recalled the one occasion when he brought me after one of his few arguments with my mother it had been night and wed watched the lights of the hollows flicker across the river the world seeming to continue around us as we were caught in a drop of time hanging on the lip of the present reluctant to fall and make room for the next sighing i tugged my short leather jacket closer and watched my step yesterday i had sent a bag of cookies to trent by special messenger with a card that simply said i know the cellophane bag and sandwich cookies had been just rife with an insulting mix of elf and magic propaganda that even the enlightened times after the turn hadnt been able to quell sure enough i was awoken that morning by the phone ringing then ringing again when the machine clicked off and ringing again and again and again eight oclock in the morning is an ungodly time for witchesi had only been asleep four hoursbut jenks couldnt answer the phone and waking ivy up wasnt a good idea the long and short of it was that trent invited me to his garden for tea no freaking way i told jonathan id meet trent in eden park at four at twin lakes bridge right after his bosss nappies twin lakes bridge was a rather grand name for the concrete footbridge but i knew the troll that lived under it and felt i could rely on him in a pinch the water chattering over the artificial rapids would distort any listening spell better yet on football sunday the park would be almost deserted giving us enough privacy to talk yet retain enough people to deter any stupid choices trent might be tempted to make like outright killing me i forced my gaze up from the sidewalk as i passed glenns unmarked fib car parked illegally at the curb he had probably been assigned to keep an eye on trent good that meant i wouldnt have to truss up whatever fib officer edden had tailing the man so trent and i could talk uninterrupted i had made a point to bring no spells with me other than my usual pinky ring no cumbersome bag either just my little used drivers license and my bus pass the reason for the lack of personal effects was twofold not only could i run faster if trent tried something but i wouldnt give trent the opportunity to claim id slipped him a charm the strain from my quick pace made my calves ache and i scanned the large park finding it as sparsely populated as id hoped i had ridden past the first stop since i wanted a good looksee before getting off not to mention it was impossible to make a graceful entrance from a bus even the leather pants matching leather jacket and red halter top wouldnt help i slowed taking in the pond water green with copper sulfate and the lush grass the trees were tipped with color not yet hurried on by frost trents red blanket made a vivid splash upon the ground he was alone pretending to read i wondered where glenn was thinking that unless he was in the few large trees or the skinny apartments across the street he was likely lurking in the bathrooms arms swinging i waved across the park to jonathan standing sullen by the gray ghost limo in the sun clearly unhappy he raised his wrist and spoke into his watch my stomach tightened as i imagined quen watching me from the trees i forced my pace to a sedate saunter as i went to the public rest rooms my vampmade boots silent on the walkway for bathrooms they were elegant speaking of a more gracious time with the ivy covered stone and cedar shingles the metal shutters and doors lent themselves to the permanence of the structure as much as the fading perennials smothering it sure enough i found glenn inside the mens room his back to me as he stood on the toilet with a pair of binoculars watching trent through the broken window the bridge was within his view and i felt better knowing he would be watching me glenn i said and he spun almost slipping off the toilet god bless it he swore giving me a dark look before returning his attention out the window what are you doing here and good morning to you too i said politely wanting to smack him a good one and ask why he hadnt stuck up for me yesterday and kept me working the room reeked of chlorine and had no partitions at all the ladies bathroom at least had stalls his neck tensed and i gave him credit for not looking from trent for even a moment rachel he warned go home i dont know how you found out mr kalamack was here but if you go near him ill give you to the is myself look im sorry i said i made a mistake i should have stayed put until you said i could enter that crime scene but trent asked me to meet him here so you can go turn yourself glenn lowered his binoculars his face slack as he looked at me scouts honor i said giving him a sarcastic salute his eyes went distant in thought this isnt your run anymore get out of here before i have you arrested you could have at least gotten me in to trents fib interview yesterday i said taking an aggressive step forward why did you let them shut me out this was my run his hand rested on the twoway on his hip right next to his weapon his brown eyes were angry with a past incident that didnt include me you were ruining the case i was building against him i told you to stay out and you didnt i said i was sorry and there wouldnt even be a case if it wasnt for me i exclaimed frustrated i put my hand on my hip and raised my other in an angry gesture jerking to a halt as someone came in it was a frumpy looking man in a frumpy looking coat he stood in shock for three heartbeats running his eyes over glenn in his expensive black suit standing on the can to me in my leather pants and jacket uh ill come back he said then hastened out i turned back to glenn having to tilt my head at an awkward angle to look up at him i cant work for the fib anymore thanks to you im informing you of my meeting with trent as a courtesy from one professional to another so back off and dont interfere rachel my eyes narrowed dont mess with me glenn trent asked for this meeting the faint worry lines around glenns eyes deepened i could see his thoughts warring among themselves i wouldnt have bothered telling him at all except he probably would have called in everyone from his dad to the bomb squad when he saw me with trent are we clear on this i asked belligerently and he stepped off the toilet if i find out you lied to me yeah yeah yeah i turned to go he reached for me i felt his hand coming and jerked away spinning i shook my head in warning but his eyes were wide at how fast i had moved you just dont get it do you i said i am not human this is inderland business and you are in way over your head and with that thought to keep him awake at night i strode back out into the sunlight trusting he would keep an eye on me and not get in my way my arms swung as i attempted to dispel the last of the adrenaline and my skin seemed to prickle as jonathans eyes fell on me ignoring him i tried to spot where quen had hidden himself as i made my way to the concrete bridge on the other side of the twin ponds was trent upon his blanket he still had that book in his hand but he knew i was here he was going to make me wait which was fine by me i wasnt ready for him yet deep in the shadows of the bridge ran a wide ribbon of fast water connecting the two ponds my foot hit the bridge and the puddle of purple amidst the current shuddered heydehey i said stopping just shy of the bridges apex yeah it was kind of stupid but it was the traditional greeting between trolls if i was in luck sharps would still have possession of this bridge heydeho said the dark puddle of water pulling itself up in a series of ripples until a dripping craggy face showed algae grew on his otherwise bluish skin and his fingernails were white with the mortar he scraped from the bottom of the bridge to supplement his diet sharps i said truly pleased as i recognized him by his one white eye blinded by a past fight hows the water flowing officer morgan he said sounding tired can you wait until sundown i promise ill leave tonight the sun is too bright right now i smiled its just rachel now i quit the is and dont move on account of me you did the puddle of water sank back down until only a mouth and good eye showed thats fine youre a nice girl not like the warlock they have now coming at noon with electric prods and clangy bells i winced in sympathy trolls had extremely sensitive skin that kept them out of direct light most of the time they tended to destroy whatever bridge they were under which was why the is continually chased them out but it was a losing battle as soon as one left another took his place and then there was a fight when the original troll wanted his home back hey sharps i said maybe you could help me anything i can manage a purplehued skinny arm reached up to pick a grain of mortar from the underside of the bridge i glanced at trent seeing he was making motions to head my way has anyone been around your bridge this morning maybe leaving a spell or charm behind the puddle of oily water drifted to the opposite side of the bridge and into a patch of dappled shade where i lost sight of him six kids kicked rocks off the bridge one dog took a leak at the footing three adult humans two strollers a were and five witches before dawn there were two vamps someone got bit i smelled the blood that hit the southwest corner i looked over seeing nothing no one left anything though just the blood he whispered sounding like bubbles against rocks trent had stood and was brushing his pants off my pulse quickened and i pulled the strap to my shirt straight under my jacket thanks sharps ill watch your bridge if you want to take a swim really his voice took on a hopeful incredulous sound youd do that for me officer morgan youre a damn fine woman the smear of purple water hesitated you wont let anyone take my bridge no i may have to leave quick but ill stay as long as i can damn fine woman he said again i leaned to watch a surprisingly long ribbon of purple slip out from under the bridge and flow around the rocks to the deeper pool of water in the lower basin trent and i would have a good measure of privacy but a trolls territorial drive was so strong i knew sharps would keep an eye on me i felt unjustifiably secure with glenn on one side in the mens bathroom and sharps in the water on the other putting my back to the sun and glenns eyes i leaned against the railing of the bridge to watch trent stride over the grass to me behind him on the blanket he left an artfully arranged set of two wineglasses a bottle packed in ice and a bowl of outofseason strawberries looking as if it were june not september his pace was measured and sure on the surface but i could see it was fraught with nervousness beneath giving away how young he really was he had covered his fair hair with a lightweight sun hat to shadow his face it was the first time i had seen him in anything other than a business suit and it would be easy to forget he was a murderer and a drug lord the confidence of the boardroom was still there but his trim waist wide shoulders and smooth face made him look more like an especially fit soccer dad his casual attire accentuated his youth instead of hiding it as his armani suits did a wisp of blond hair peeked from behind the cuffs of his tasteful buttondown shirt and i spared a thought that it was probably as soft and light as the pale hair drifting about his ears his green eyes were pinched as he approached squinting from the reflected sun or from worry i was betting the latter since his hands were behind his back so i wouldnt shake with him trent slowed as he stepped upon the bridge his expressive eyebrows were slanted and i remembered his fear when algaliarept had turned into me there was only one reason the demon would have done that trent was afraid of me either for still falsely thinking i had set algaliarept on him or for having snuck into his office three times in as many weeks or for me knowing what he was none of the above he said his casual shoes scuffing as he came to a halt a wash of cold shocked through me i beg your pardon i stammered pulling myself up and away from the railing im not afraid of you i stared his liquid voice melting itself into the chatter of water surrounding us and i cant read your mind either just your face my breath came in a soft sound and i shut my mouth how had i lost control so fast you took care of the troll i see he said detective glenn too i said as i touched my hair to be sure my curls hadnt escaped my braid he wont bother us unless you do something stupid his eyes tightened at the insult he didnt move keeping that same five feet between us wheres your pixy he asked irritation pulled me straight his name is jenks and hes somewhere else he doesnt know and id just as soon keep it that way as he has a big mouth trent visibly relaxed he went to stand opposite me the narrow width of the bridge between us it had been hard to slip jenks this afternoon and ivy finally stepped in taking him out on a nonexistent run i think she was actually going for doughnuts sharps was playing with the ducks pulling them under to bob to the surface and fly away quacking turning from the sight trent leaned his back against the railing and crossed one ankle against another his position mirroring mine exactly we were two people meeting by chance sharing a few words and the sun riiiiight if it gets out he said his eyes on the distant bathroom behind me ill make the records concerning my fathers little camp public you and every one of those sorry little snots will be tracked down and treated like lepers that is if they dont simply cremate you out of fear something will mutate and start another turn my knees went loose and watery i had been right trents father had done something to me fixed whatever had been wrong and trents threat wasnt idle the bestcase scenario would involve a oneway ticket to the antarctic i moved my tongue around on the inside of my mouth trying to find enough spit to swallow how did you know i asked thinking my secret was more deadly than his eyes fixed to mine he pushed the sleeve of his shirt up to show a nicely muscled arm the hair was bleached from the sun and his skin was welltanned a ragged scar marred its even smoothness my eyes rose to his reading an old anger that was you i stammered that was you i threw into the tree with motions short and abrupt he tugged his sleeve back down hiding the scar ive never forgiven you for making me cry in front of my father a childhood anger flared from coals i had thought long extinct its your own fault i told you to stop teasing her i said not caring that my voice was louder than the surrounding water jasmin was sick she cried herself to sleep for three weeks because of you trent jerked upright you know her name he exclaimed write it down quick i stared at him in disbelief why do you care what her name was she had a hard enough time without you picking on her her name trent said patting his pockets until he found a pen whats her name scowling i tucked a curl behind an ear im not going to tell you i said embarrassed that i had forgotten it again trent pressed his lips together and put the pen away you forgot already didnt you why do you care anyway all you did was pester her he looked cross as he tugged his hat lower over his eyes i was fourteen a very awkward fourteen ms morgan i teased her because i liked her next time you recall her name i would appreciate it if you would write it down and send it to me there were longterm memory blockers in the camps drinking water and i would like to know if his voice cut off and i watched the emotion flicker behind his eyes i was becoming good at reading them you want to know if she survived i finished for him knowing i had guessed right when his gaze went elsewhere why were you there i asked almost afraid hed tell me my father owned the camp where else would i spend my summers the cadence of his voice and the slight tightening of his brow told me it had been more than that a thrill of satisfaction warmed me id found his tell for when he lied now all i needed was the same for when he was speaking the truth and hed never be able to successfully lie to me again you are as filthy as your father i said disgusted blackmailing people by dangling a cure within their reach and making them your puppets your parents fortune was built on the misery of hundreds maybe thousands mr kalamack and youre no different trents chin trembled almost imperceptibly and i thought i saw a shimmer of sparkles about him the memory of his aura playing tricks on me must be an elf thing i will not justify my actions to you he said and you have become very adept in the art of blackmail yourself im not going to waste my time bickering like children over who hurt whose feelings over a decade ago i want to hire your services hire me i said unable to keep my voice lowered as i put my hands on my hips in disbelief you tried to kill me in the rat fights and you think im going to work for you to help clear your name you murdered those witches im going to prove it he laughed his hat shadowing his face as he bowed his head and chuckled whats so funny i demanded feeling foolish you his eyes were bright you were never in any danger in that rat pit i was only using it to knock home your current sordid state but i did make a few astounding contacts while i was there you son of lips pressed tight i clenched my hand into a fist trents mirth vanished and his head tilted in warning as he took a step away i wouldnt he threatened raising a finger i really wouldnt i slowly rocked back my knees shaking in the memory of the pit the guttwisting feeling of helplessness of being trapped and forced to kill or be killed washed through me i had been trents toy him running me down on horseback was nothing compared to that after all i had been thieving from him at the time listen to me really good trent i whispered the thought of quen forcing me to retreat until the concrete pressed cold into the small of my back im not working for you im going to take you down im going to figure out how to tie you to every one of those murders oh please he said and i wondered how we went so quickly from a fortunetwenty businessman and a slick independent runner to two people squabbling over past injustices are you still on that even captain edden realizes dan smathers body was dumped in my stables which is why he sent his son to watch me instead of filing charges and as for having contact with the victims yes i talked to them all trying to employ them not kill them you have a very strong skill set ms morgan but detective is not among them you are far too impatient driven by your intuitive skills which seem to only work forward not backward affronted i put my hands on my hips and made a sound of disbelief who did he think he was lecturing me trent reached into a shirt pocket pulling out a white envelope and handing it to me leaning forward and back i snatched it flipping it open my breath caught as i realized it held twenty crisp hundreddollar bills thats ten percent up front the rest on completion he said and i froze trying to look cavalier twenty thousand dollars i want you to identify who is responsible for the murders ive been trying to hire a ley line witch for the last three months and every one of them ends up dead its growing tiresome all i want is a name you can go to hell kalamack i said dropping the envelope when he didnt take it back i was angry and frustrated i had come here with information so fine i was sure i was going to get a confession what i got was threatened insulted and then bribed looking unperturbed he stooped to pick up the envelope smacking it against his palm several times to get the grit off before tucking it away you do realize that with that little stunt you pulled yesterday you are next on the killers list you fit the profile nicely having shown yourself as proficient in ley line magic and then adding our little tryst today damn id forgotten about that if trent really wasnt the murderer than i had nothing to stop the real one from coming after me suddenly the sun wasnt warm enough i felt breathless sick that i was going to have to find the real killer before he found me now trent said his voice smoother than the water take the money so i can tell you what ive managed to learn stomach twisting i met his mocking gaze i was going to do just what he wanted he had manipulated me into helping him damn damn and double damn crossing to his side of the bridge i put my elbows atop the thick railing with my back to glenn sharps was deep underwater only the lack of ducks to say he was here beside me stood trent did you send sara jane to the fib with the sole intention that edden would involve me i asked bitterly trent shifted putting himself so near i could smell the clean scent of his aftershave i didnt like how close he was but if i moved hed know it bothered me yes he said softly in his voice was the sound of truth i had been waiting for and a trickle of excitement pulled my breath tight there it was now i had it hed never be able to lie to me again looking back over our past conversations in a new light i realized that apart from the reason hed given me for being at his fathers camp he never had ever she doesnt know him does she i asked a few dates to get the picture but no it was a calculated certainty that he would be murdered after he agreed to work for me though i tried to protect him quen is very upset he said lightly his gaze on sharpss ripples that mr smather turned up in my stables means the killer is getting cocky my eyes closed briefly in frustration as i scrambled to realign my thinking trent hadnt killed those witches someone else had i could either take the money and help trent solve his little employment problem or not take the money and hed get it for free id take the money youre a bastard you know that seeing my new understanding trent smiled it was all i could do to not spit in his face his long hands hung out over the edge of the railing the sun turned his tan a warm golden color that almost glowed against his white shirt and his face was shadowed wisps of his hair moved in the breeze almost touching my own wayward strands with a casual movement he reached into his shirt pocket and with our bodies hiding the action from glenn he extended the envelope feeling dirty i took it shoving it out of sight behind my jacket and into my waistband excellent he said warm and sincere im glad we can work together go turn yourself kalamack im reasonably confident that its a master vampire he said easing away from me which one i asked disgusted with myself why was i doing this i dont know he admitted flicking a bit of mortar off the railing to land in the water if i did id have taken care of it already i just bet you would i said sourly why not take them all out get it over with i cant go about staking vampires at random ms morgan he said worrying me because hed taken my question seriously instead of the sarcasm it was thats illegal not to mention it would start a vamp war cincinnati might not survive it and i know my business interests would suffer in the interim i snickered oh we cant let that happen now can we trent sighed using sarcasm to cover your fear makes you look very young and twirling your pencil in your fingers makes you look nervous i shot back it felt good to argue with someone who wouldnt bite me if things got out of control his eye twitched lips bloodless he turned back to the large pond before us id appreciate it if you would keep the fib out of this its an inderland matter not human and im not sure the is can be trusted either i found it interesting how fast he had fallen into the them and us verbiage apparently i wasnt the only one who knew trents background and i didnt like the higher degree of intimacy it put between us im thinking it might be a rising vamp coven trying to gain a foothold by removing me he said it would be a lot less risky than taking out one of the lesser houses it wasnt a boastjust a tasteless factand my lips curled at the thought i was taking money from a man who played the underworld like a chessboard for the first time in my life i was glad my dad was dead and couldnt ask me why the picture of our fathers standing before the camp bus intruded and i reminded myself i couldnt trust trent my father had and it killed him trent sighed the sound both regretful and tired cincinnatis underground is very fluid all of my usual contacts have gone quiet or dead im losing touch with whats happening he flicked a glance at me someone is trying to keep me from increasing my reach and without a ley line witch at my disposal ive reached an impasse poor baby i mocked why not do the magic yourself bloodline too polluted with nasty human genes to manage the heavy magic anymore the knuckles of his fingers whitened as he gripped the rail then relaxed i will have a ley line witch i would much rather hire someone willing than abduct them but if every witch i talk to ends up dead i will steal someone yes i drawled caustically you elves are known for that arent you his jaw clenched be careful im always careful i said knowing i wasnt a good enough witch to have to worry about him stealing me i watched the rims of his ears slowly lose their red tint i squinted wondering if they were a little pointed or if it was my imagination it was hard to tell with the hat he had on can you narrow it down for me i said twenty thousand dollars to sift through cincinnatis underworld to find out who wanted to put a crimp in mr kalamacks day by killing his potential employees yeah that sounded like an easy run i have lots of ideas ms morgan lots of enemies lots of employees and no friends i added snidely watching sharps make serpentlike humps like a miniature loch ness my breath slipped from me in a slow sound as i imagined what ivy was going to say when i came home and told her i was working for trent if i find out youre lying ill come after you myself kalamack and this time the demon wont miss he made a scoffing bark of laughter and i turned to him you can drop the bluff you didnt send that demon after me last spring the slight breeze was cold and i pulled my jacket closed as i turned how did you trent gazed distantly over the lower basin after overhearing your conversation with your boyfriend in my office and seeing your reaction to that demon i knew it had to have been someone else though ill admit seeing you beaten and blue after i freed that demon to go back to kill its summoner nearly had me convinced i didnt like that he had overheard me talking to nick or that he had responded the exact same way as i had after gaining control over algaliarept trents shoes scuffed and a cautious inquiry came into his eyes your demon scar he hesitated and the flicker of haunted emotion strengthened it was an accident he finished i watched the ripples from sharpss disappearing humps it bled me so badly that i stopped my lips pressing together why was i telling him this yeah it was good he said his gaze still upon the pond im glad to hear that ass i thought thinking whoever had sent algaliarept after us had gotten a double whammy of pain that night someone sure didnt like us talking did they i said then froze my face went cold and i held my breath what if the attacks on our lives and the recent violence were connected perhaps i was supposed to have been the witch hunters first victim heart pounding i held myself still thinking every single one of the victims had died in their own personal hell the swimmer drowned the rat caretaker ripped apart and eaten alive two women raped a man working with horses pressed to death algaliarept had been told to kill me in terror taking the time to find out what my strongest fear was damn it was the same person trent tilted his head at my silence what is it he asked nothing i leaned heavily into the railing dropping my head into my cupped hands i willed myself to not pass out glenn would call someone and that would be that trent pushed away from the railing no he said and i pulled my head up ive seen that look on you twice before what is it i swallowed we were supposed to be the first victims of the witch hunter he tried to kill both of us giving up after we showed him we could best a demon and i made it clear i wasnt going to work for you only the witches who agreed to work for you were killed yes they all agreed to work for me he breathed and i stifled a shudder at how the words seemed to flow over my spine i never thought to connect the two you cant accuse a demon of murder because there was no way to contain it if sentenced the courts had long ago determined to treat demons as weapons even if the comparison wasnt quite right free choice was involved but as long as the payment was commensurate with the task a demon wouldnt turn down murder someone though had summoned it did the demon ever tell you who sent it to kill you i asked easiest twenty thousand id ever made god help me anger tinted in fear crossed trent i was trying to stay alive not have a conversation you seem to have a working relationship with it though why dont you ask it my breath come in a jerky sound of disbelief me i already owe it one favor you cant pay me enough to dig myself in deeper ill tell you what though ill call it up for you and you can ask it im sure the two of you can come to some agreement about payment his suntanned face went pale no satisfied i looked over the small pond dont call me a coward unless its something you would do yourself im reckless not stupid but then i hesitated nick would do it a faint smile surprising and genuine came over trent youre doing it again what i said flatly you had another thought you are such fun ms morgan watching you is like watching a fiveyearold insulted i looked out over the water i wondered if nick asking who had sent it to kill me would be considered a small question or a large one necessitating further payment pushing myself away from the railing i decided id walk over to the museum and find out so trent prompted i shook my head ill have your information after sundown i said and he blinked youre going to call it his sudden unguarded surprise caught at me and i kept my face impassive thinking that managing to startle him was an ego boost i badly needed how quickly he hid it made the feeling twice as satisfying you just said youre paying for results not a playbyplay ill let you know when i find something his expression shifted to what might be respect ive misjudged you ms morgan yeah im just full of surprises i muttered reaching up to keep the hair out of my eyes as the wind gusted trents hat threatened to blow off into the water and i stretched to catch it before it left his head my fingers brushed his hat then nothing trent leapt backward i stared blinking at where he had been he was gone i found him a good four feet away entirely off the bridge id seen cats move like that he looked frightened as he straightened then angry that id seen the emotion on him the sun glinted on his wispy hair his hat was in the water turning a sickly green i stiffened as quen dropped out of the nearby tree to land softly before him the man stood with his arms hanging loose looking like a modernday samurai in his black jeans and shirt i didnt move as a whoosh of water came from behind me i could smell copper sulfate and scum i felt more than saw sharps loom behind me cold wet and almost as big as the bridge he lived under having sucked in a huge amount of water to give himself more mass a faint clatter from the nearby bathroom told me glenn was on his way my heart pounded as no one moved i shouldnt have touched him i should not have touched him licking my lips i tugged my jacket straight glad quen had the sense to know i hadnt been trying to hurt trent ill call you when i have a name i said my voice sounding thin giving quen an apologetic look i turned on a heel and strode quickly to the street my heels thumping soundlessly up through my spine and you are afraid of me i thought silently why twentyfour for the third time rachel would you like another piece of bread i looked from the light glinting on the surface of my wine finding nick waiting with a curious amused expression he was holding out the plate with the bread by his wondering expression i guessed hed held it there for a while um no no thank you i said glancing down to find the supper nick had made for me almost untouched giving him an apologetic smile i sent my fork under another bite of pasta and white sauce it was his supper my lunch and both delicious and even more so since i hadnt done anything but make the salad it would likely be the last thing i ate today because ivy had a date with kist that meant id be having dinner with ben and jerry in front of the tv i thought it unusual she would go out with the living vamp seeing as he was worse than a monkey when it came to sex and blood but it was resolutely not my business nicks plate was empty and after setting the bread down he sat back and played with the end of his knife making it lay just so atop his napkin i know its not my food he said whats the matter youve hardly said a word since youahcame over to the museum i covered my smirk with a napkin and wiped the corner of my mouth i had caught him napping sitting with his lanky legs up his feet propped on his cleaning table the eighteenth century tea towel he was supposed to be restoring draped over his eyes if it wasnt a book he really didnt care about it is it that obvious i said taking a bite a familiar lopsided smile came over him its not like you to be this quiet is it about mr kalamack not being arrested after finding er thatbody i pushed the plate away in a flush of guilt i hadnt yet told nick id switched sides in the lets get trent issue i hadnt really and thats what bothered me the man was slime you found a body he said as he leaned across the table and took my hand the rest will follow i cringed worried nick might tell me id sold out my distress must have shown because he squeezed my hand until i looked up what is it rayray his eyes were soft with encouragement their brown depths catching the glint from the ugly light hanging over nicks tiny kitchendining room my attention went over the short chesthigh mantel dividing it from the living room as i tried to decide how to broach the subject i had been harping on him for months about letting sleeping demons lie and here i was wanting to ask him to call algaliarept up for me i was sure the answer was going to cost more than what nicks trial contract would cover and i didnt want to risk him paying it for me anyway nick had a chivalrous streak as wide as the ohio river tell me he asked ducking his head to try and see my eyes i licked my lips and met his gaze its about big al i didnt like chancing that algaliarept would conveniently assume i was calling it every time i said its name so i had begun referring to the demon by the somewhat insulting moniker nick thought it was funny that i was worried about it showing up unsummoned not that i called it al nicks fingers slipped from mine and he pulled away to take up his wineglass dont start he said his eyebrows furrowed in the first signs of anger i know what im doing and im going to do it whether you like it or not actually i hedged i wanted to see if you might ask it something for me nicks long face went slack beg pardon i winced if it wont cost you anything if it does forget it ill find another way he set the glass down and leaned forward you want me to call him see i talked to trent today i said quickly so he couldnt interrupt and we figure that the demon that attacked us last spring is the same one thats doing the murdersthat i was supposed to be the first witch hunter victim but because i turned trents job offer down it let me go if i can find out who sent it to kill us then we have the murderer lips parted nick stared at me i could almost see his thoughts fall in place trent was innocent and i was working for him to find the real murderer and clear his name of suspicion uncomfortable i pushed the fork around on the plate how much is he giving you nick finally asked his voice giving me no clue to his thoughts two thousand up front i said feeling it light in my pocket since i had yet to go home eighteen more when i tell him who the witch hunter is hey id made my rent whoopdedo twenty thousand dollars he said his brown eyes large in the fluorescent light hes giving you twenty thousand dollars for a name you dont have to bring him in or anything i nodded wondering if nick thought i was selling out i felt like i was nick held himself still for three heartbeats then rose his chair scraping the worn linoleum lets find out how much that costs he said halfway out of the room i was left blinking at his wire and plastic chair my heart thumped nick i stood taking a moment to move our plates to the sink doesnt it bother you im working for trent it bothers me did he kill those witches came his voice from the hallway to his room and i followed it through the living room to find him moving everything out of his linen closet and stacking it on his bed with a methodical quickness no i dont think so god help me if i misread his tells he handed me a stack of brand new lusciously green towels so whats the problem the man is a biodrug lord and runs brimstone i said juggling the towels to take the oversize gardener boots he handed me i recognized them as the ones from my belfry and i wondered why he was keeping them trent is trying to take over cincinnatis underworld and im working for him thats whats the matter nick grabbed his spare sheets and edged past me to drop them on his bed you wouldnt be helping him unless you believed he didnt do it he said as he returned and for twenty thousand dollars twenty thousand dollars buys a lot of therapy if youre wrong i grimaced not liking nicks money makes everything right philosophy i suppose growing up watching your mother struggle for every dollar might have a lot to do with it but i sometimes questioned nicks priorities but i had to find out just to save my own skin and id be damned if i cleared trent of suspicion for free i stood sideways in the hallway as nick went into his room with a pile of sweaters the closet was emptythere hadnt been much in it to start withand after dumping everything he took the towels and boots from my arms adding them to the mound on the bed before returning to the closet my eyebrows rose as he pulled a square of carpet up to reveal a circle and pentagram etched in the floor you summon al into a closet i said in disbelief nick looked up from where he was kneeling his long face devious i found the circle when i moved in he said isnt it a nice one its lined in silver i checked it out and its almost the only spot in the apartment where there are no electric or gas lines theres another in the kitchen that you can see with a black light but its bigger and i cant make a circle that large thats strong enough to hold him i watched as he wedged the shelves off their brackets with a stiff underhand thunk stacking them against the wall in the hallway finished he stepped into the closet and held out a hand for me to join him i stared surprised al said the demon was supposed to be in the circle not the summoner i said his hand dropped its part of the trial membership thing im not so much summoning him as asking for an audience he can say no and not show up at all though that hasnt happened since you gave me the idea to put myself in the circle instead of him he shows up just to laugh now nick held out his hand again come on i want to make sure we both fit i looked to the slice of living room i could see not wanting to get in a closet with nick well not under these circumstances anyway lets use the circle in the kitchen i suggested i dont mind closing it you want to risk him thinking you called him nick asked eyebrows high its an it not a him i said but at his exasperated expression i took his hand and stepped into the closet immediately nick dropped my grip and ran his gaze over where our elbows went the closet was goodsized and deep right now it was okay but add a demon trying to get in and it would be claustrophobic maybe this isnt such a good idea i said itll be fine nicks motions were quick and jerky as he stepped out of the closet and reached up to the last shelf still in place above our heads taking down a rattling shoe box he opened it to show a zippy bag of gray ash and about a dozen milky green tapers already burnt my mouth opened as i recognized them as the candles he had lit one night when we were ah utilizing ivys tub to its fullest potential what were they doing in a box with ashes those are my candles i said only now realizing where they had gone setting the box on his bed he took the zippy bag and the longest candle and went into the living room i heard a thump and he soon reappeared dragging the stool that i had put his obligatory housewarming plant on still silent he set the candle where the peace lily had once been buy your own candles for summoning demons i said affronted he frowned as he opened the drawer under the footstool to pull out a box of matches they have to be lit the first time on hallowed ground or they dont work well youve got everything figured out dont you i sourly wondered if the entire night had been an excuse to get those candles how long had he been calling this demon anyway lips pursed i watched him light the candle and shake the match out but it wasnt until he took a handful of gray dust from the zippy bag that i started getting nervous what is that i asked worried you dont want to know his voice carried a surprising amount of warning my face warmed as i recalled that i use to bring his kind in for grave robbing yes i do he looked up his brow pinched in irritation its a focus object so algaliarept materializes outside the circle instead of in it with us and the candle is to make sure he doesnt focus on anything but the ash on the table i bought it okay muttering a quick sorry i backed off somehow i seemed to have found the only nerve nick had and stomped on it i wasnt up on my demon summoning obviously he was i thought all you had to do was make a circle and call them i said feeling nauseated someone had sold their grandmothers ashes so nick could call a demon with her remains nick dusted his hands together and resealed the bag you might be able to get away with that but i cant the guy at the store kept trying to sell me this outrageously expensive amulet to make a proper binding circle not believing a human could close one of his own he gave me ten percent off everything after i put him in a circle he couldnt break i guess he thought i knew enough to survive to come back and buy something more his irritation had vanished the moment i quit barking at him i realized that this was the first timewell the secondhe had the chance to show me his skills something he was obviously very proud of humans had to work hard to manipulate ley lines as well as witches which is why humans were known to align themselves with demons so they could keep up of course they didnt last long after that eventually making a mistake and being pulled into the everafter this was so unsafe and here i was encouraging him seeing my face he came to me and put his hands atop my shoulders i could feel the ash gritty between his hands and my skin its okay he soothed his narrow face smiling ive done this before thats what im afraid of i said stepping back to make room for him as nick tossed the zippy bag of ash to land next to the shoe box i tried to wipe the ash off my shoulders nick got in the closet with me and then with a grunt of remembrance wedged a piece of wood into the crack of the hinges he shut the door on me once he said shrugging this is not good i thought again as the small of my back started to sweat ready i glanced at the lit candle and its little mound of ash no my fingertips tingled as nick closed his eyes and opened his second sight an eerie feeling of my insides being rearranged started in my belly swirling up into my throat my eyes widened whoa whoa whoa i cried as the sensation wrenched into an uncomfortable pull what is that nick opened his eyes they were glazed and i could tell he was seeing everything in that confusing mix of reality and everafter sight thats what ive been telling you about he said his voice hollow its from the binding spell nice isnt it i shifted from foot to foot making sure i stayed in the circle its awful i admitted im sorry why didnt you tell me it was that bad he shrugged closing his eyes the pull through me strengthened and i struggled to find a way to deal with it i could feel the everafter energy slowly building in him paralleling what i experienced when i tapped into a ley line the power swelled and though it was a fraction of what i had channeled in trents office it urged me to react with an excruciating slowness the levels built to a usable level my palms started to sweat and my stomach clenched i wished hed hurry up and close the circle the eddies of power went deep through me the need to do something growing can i help i finally asked gripping my hands together so they wouldnt spasm no the tingling in my palms rose to become an itch im sorry i said i didnt know you could feel all this is this why you havent been sleeping have i been waking you up no dont worry about it my heel started tapping the jolts going up my calves feeling like fire we have to break the charm i said jittery how can you stand this shut up rachel im trying to concentrate sorry his breath slipped from him in a slow sound and i wasnt surprised when he jumped mirroring the sudden cutoff of everafter energy i could feel running through him through us circles up he said breathlessly and i resisted the urge to look at it i didnt want to insult him and having felt its construction i knew it was good im not sure but i think because im carrying some of your aura you can break the circle too ill be careful i said suddenly a lot more nervous so what happens now i questioned looking at the candle on the footstool now i invite him over i stifled a shudder as latin flowed from nick my lips curved down at the alienness of it as he spoke nick seemed to take on a different cast shadows under his eyes growing to make him look ill even his voice changed more resonant and somehow echoing in my head again there was a slow buildup of everafter energy rising until it was almost intolerable i was antsy and nervous almost relieved when nick said algaliarepts name with a drawnout careful precision nick sagged taking a clean breath i could smell his sweat over his deodorant in the close confines his fingers slipped into my hand giving me a quick squeeze before dropping it the clock ticked from the living room and the sound of the traffic past the window was hushed nothing happened is something supposed to happen i asked starting to feel silly standing in nicks closet it might take a while like i said its a trial membership not the real thing i took three slow breaths listening how long since ive been putting myself in the circle instead of him five ten minutes nicks mood was easing and i could feel the heat from our shoulders almost touching an ambulance sounded faint in the distance disappearing i eyed the burning candle what if it doesnt show i asked how long do we have to wait before we can get out of the closet nick gave me a noncommittal strangerintheelevator smile uh i wouldnt step out of the circle until sunup until he appears and we can banish him properly back to the everafter he can show up anytime between now and then you mean if it doesnt show were stuck in this closet until morning he nodded his eyes jerking away as the smell of burnt amber came to me oh good hes here nick whispered standing straighter oh good hes here i repeated sarcastically in my head god help me my life was so screwed up the pile of ash at the end of the hallway was hazed with a smear of everafter it grew with the speed of flowing water up and out to take a rough animal shape i forced myself to breathe as eyes appeared red and orange and slit sideways like a goats my stomach clenched as a savage muzzle formed saliva dripping to the rug even before it finished coalescing into the ponysize dog i remembered from the basement vault of the university library nicks personal fear of dogs brought to life harsh panting rasped the sound pulling an instinctive fear from the depths of my soul that i hadnt even known i had paws tipped with nails and powerful hindquarters appeared as it shook itself the last of the mist forming a thick mane of yellow hair beside me nick shuddered you okay i asked and he nodded his face pale nicholas gregory sparagmos the dog drawled sitting on its haunches and giving us a savage doggy smile already little wizard i was just here gregory i thought as nick shot an unrepentant grimace at me nicks middle name was gregory and what had nick gotten in return for telling it that or did you call me to impress rachel mariana morgan it finished a long red tongue lolling out as it turned its doggy smile to me ive a few questions nick said his voice bolder than his body language nicks breath caught as the dog rose and padded into the hallway its shoulders almost brushing the walls i stared horrified as it licked the floor beside the circle testing it the film of everafter reality hissed as it sent its tongue over the unseen barrier smoke smelling like burnt amber rose and i watched as if through a pane of glass as algaliarepts tongue began to char and burn nick stiffened and i thought i heard a whispered oath or prayer making an annoyed growl the demons outline went hazy my heart hammered as the dog lengthened and rose into its usual vision of a british gentleman rachel mariana morgan it said hitting every accent with an elegant precession i must congratulate you love on finding that corpse it was the sharpest bit of ley line magic ive seen in twelve years it leaned close and i smelled lavender you made quite a stir you know it whispered i was invited to all the parties my witchs spell went to the citys square to chime the bells everyone got a taste though not as much as i did eyes closing the demon shuddered its outlines wavering as its concentration lapsed i swallowed hard im not your witch i said nicks fingers on my elbow tightened stay in that form nick said his voice firm and stop bothering rachel i have questions and i want to know the cost before i ask them your mistrust will kill you if your cheek doesnt algaliarept spun in a quick motion of furling coattails to return to the living room from where i stood i could see it open the glassdoor cabinet to nicks books its whitegloved fingers stretched and reached pulling one out oh i wondered where this one had gotten to it said its back to us how splendid that you have it we will read from this next time nick glanced at me thats what we do usually he whispered he deciphers the latin for me letting all sorts of things slip and you trust him i frowned nervous ask it algaliarept had replaced the tome and taken out another its mood lightening as it cooed and fussed as if having found an old friend algaliarept nick said mouthing the word slowly and the demon turned the new book in its hand id like to know if you were the demon that attacked trent kalamack last spring it didnt look up from the open book cradled in his hands i felt queasy as i realized it had lengthened its fingers to better support it that comes under our arrangement it said its voice preoccupied seeing as rachel mariana morgan has already guessed the answer it looked up its eyes over the smoked glasses orange and red oh yes i tasted trenton aloysius kalamack that night as well as you i ought to have killed him directly but the novelty of him was so fine i tarried until he managed to circle me is that why i survived i asked you made a mistake is that a question coming from you i licked my lips no algaliarept closed the book your blood is common rachel mariana morgan tasty with subtle flavors i dont understand but common i didnt play with you i tried to kill you had i known you could ring the tower bells i might have handled things differently a smile came over it and i felt its gaze spill over me like oil maybe not i should have known you would be as your father he rang the bells too once before he died do hope its not a premonition for you my stomach clenched and nick grabbed my arm before i could touch his circle you said you didnt know him i said anger making my voice harsh it simpered at me another question heart pounding i shook my head hoping it would tell me more it put a finger to its nose then nicholas gregory sparagmos better ask another question before im called away by someone who is willing to pay for my services youre nothing but a squealing informant you know that i said shaking algaliarepts gaze resting on my neck pulled a memory of me on the basement floor with my life spilling from me only on my bad days nick straightened i want to know who summoned you to kill rachel and if he or she is now summoning you to kill ley line witches moving almost out of my line of sight algaliarept murmured that is a very expensive set of questions the two together far more than our agreement it dropped its attention back to the book in its hands and turned a page worry crashed over me as nick took a breath no i said it isnt worth it what do you want for the answers nick asked ignoring me your soul it said lightly nick shook his head come up with something reasonable or ill send you back right now and you wont be able to talk to rachel anymore it beamed youre getting cocky little wizard youre halfway mine it closed the book in its hand with a sharp snap give me leave to take my book back across the line and ill tell you who sent me to kill rachel mariana morgan if they are the same person who is summoning me to kill trenton aloysius kalamacks witches that stays with me your soul isnt enough for that rachel mariana morgans perhaps pity when a young mans tastes are too expensive for his means isnt it i frowned even as i realized it had admitted it was killing the witches it must have been luck that kept trent and me alive when every other witch had died under it no not luck it had been quen and nick and why do you even want that book i asked it i wrote it it said its hard voice seeming to wedge the words into the folds of my mind not good not good not good not good dont give it to him nick he turned in the tight confines bumping me its just a book its your book i agreed and my question ill find out some other way algaliarept laughed a gloved finger shifting the curtain so he could see the street before im sent again to kill you youre quite the topic of conversation both sides of the ley lines youd best ask quick if im called away suddenly you may want to settle your affairs nicks eyes went round rachel youre next no i protested wanting to smack algaliarept its just saying that so youll give him the book you used ley lines to find dans body nick said shortly and now youre working for trent youre on the list rachel take your book al who sent you to kill rachel al the demon brightened oh i like that al yes you can call me al who sent you to kill rachel nick demanded algaliarept beamed ptah ammon fineas horton madison parker piscary my knees threatened to give way and i gripped nicks arm piscary i whispered ivys uncle was the witch hunter and the man had seven names just how old was he algaliarept leave to not bother us again this night nick said suddenly the demons smile sent shivers through me no promises it leered then vanished the book in its hand hit the carpet followed by an unseen sliding thump from the bookshelves i listened to my heart beat shaken what was i going to tell ivy how could i protect myself from piscary id hid in a church before i didnt like it wait nick said pulling me back before i could touch the circle i followed his gaze to the pile of ash hes not gone yet i heard algaliarept swear then the ash vanished nick sighed then edged his toe past the circle to break it now you can leave maybe nick was better at this than i thought hunched and worried looking he went to blow the candle out and sit on the edge of his couch with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands piscary he said to the flat carpet why cant i have a normal girlfriend who only has to hide from her old prom date youre the one calling up demons i said my knees shaking the night was suddenly a lot more threatening the closet seemed bigger now that nick wasnt in it and i didnt want to get out i should go back to my church i said thinking i was going to set my old cot up in the sanctuary and sleep on the abandoned altar tonight right after i called trent he said hed take care of it take care of it i hoped that meant staking piscary piscary didnt care about the law why should i i searched my conscience not finding even a twinge i reached for my jacket and went to the door i wanted to be in my church i wanted to wrap myself in the acg blanket id stolen from edden and sit in the middle of my godblessed church i need to make a call i said numbly stopping short in the middle of his living room trent he asked needlessly handing me his cordless phone i made a fist to hid my shaking fingers after i punched in the number i got jonathan sounding irate and nasty i gave him a hard time until he agreed to let me talk to trent directly finally i heard the click of an extension and trents riversmooth voice came on to give me a professional good evening ms morgan its piscary i said by way of greeting there was silence for five heartbeats and i wondered if he had hung up it told you piscary is sending it to kill my witches trent asked the sound of his fingers snapping intruding there followed the distinctive scratch of him writing something and i wondered if quen was with him the weariness trent had put in his voice to cover his worry didnt work i asked it if it was sent to kill you last spring and who summoned it for the task i said my stomach roiling as i paced i suggest you stay on hallowed ground after sunset you can walk on hallowed ground cant you i asked not sure how elves handled that sort of thing dont be crass he said i have a soul as much as you do and thank you as soon as you confirm the information ill send a courier with the rest of your compensation i jerked my eyes meeting nicks confirmed i said what do you mean confirmed i couldnt stop my hands from shaking what you gave me was advice trent was saying i only pay my stockbroker for that get me proof and jonathan will cut you a check i just gave you proof i stood up heart pounding i just talked to that damned demon and it said its killing your witches how much more proof do you need more than one person can summon a demon ms morgan if you didnt ask it if piscary summoned it to murder those witches you have only speculation my breath caught and i turned my back to nick that was too expensive i said lowering my voice and running a hand over my braid but it attacked us both under piscarys binding and it admitted to killing the witches not good enough i need proof before i go about staking a master vampire i suggest you get it quickly youre going to stiff me i shouted spinning to the curtained window as my fear shifted to frustration why not i cried sarcastically the howlers are the fib is why should you be any different im not stiffing you he said anger making the gray of his voice turn from silk to cold iron but i wont pay for shoddy work as you said im paying you for results not a playbyplayor speculation sounds to me you arent paying me anything im telling you it was piscary and a lousy twenty thousand isnt enough to get me to waltz into a fourhundredyearoldplus vampires lair and ask him if he has been sending his demon to kill citizens of cincinnati if you dont want the job then i expect you to return my retaining fee i hung up on him the phone was hot in my grip and i set it gently on the mantel between nicks kitchen and living room before i threw it at something get me home please i asked tightly nick was staring at his bookshelf running his fingers over the titles nick i said louder angry and frustrated i really want to get home just a minute he mumbled intent on his books nick i exclaimed gripping my elbows you can pick out your bedtime story later i really want to get home he turned a sick look on his long face he took it took what i thought he was talking about the book in his hand but he took the one that you used to make me your familiar my lip curled al wrote the book on how to make humans into familiars he can have it no he said his expression drawn and pale if hes got it how are we going to break the spell my face went slack oh i hadnt thought of that twentyfive the low lublublublub of a bike pulled my eyes up from my book recognizing the cadence of kists motorbike i pulled my knees to my chin tugged my covers farther up and clicked off my bedside lamp the sliver of black beyond my proppedopen stainedglass window showed a lighter gray ivy was home if kist came in i was going to pretend to be asleep until he left but his bike hardly paused before it idled back up the street my eyes went to the glowing green numbers of my clock four in the morning she was early closing the book upon my finger to mark the page i listened for her footsteps on the walk the cold predawn september air had pooled in my room if i were smart id get up and close my window ivy would probably turn the heat on when she came in i thanked all that was holy that my bedroom was part of the original church and fell under the sacredground clause guaranteed to keep out undead vamps demons and mothersinlaw i was safe in my bed until the sun came up i still had to worry about kist but he wouldnt touch me while ivy breathed he wouldnt touch me if she were dead either a stirring of unease pulled my finger out of the book and i set it on the clothcovered box i was using as a table ivy hadnt come in yet it had been kists bike i heard driving away i listened to my heartbeat waiting for ivys soft steps or the closing of the churchs door but what met me was the sound of someone retching faint through the coldsilenced night ivy i whispered throwing off my covers chilled i lurched from my bed snatched my robe jammed my feet into my fuzzy pink slippers and went into the hall skittering to a halt i retraced my steps standing before my pressboard chest of drawers i sent my fingers over the shadowed bumps of my perfumes choosing the new one i had found among the rest just yesterday i impatiently dumped a splash on me citrus blossomed clean and sharp and i set the bottle down knocking over half of what remained with a harsh clatter feeling unreal and disoriented i almost ran through the empty church tugging my robe on as i went i hoped this one worked better than the last a sharp clattering of wings was my only warning as jenks dropped from the ceiling i jerked to a stop as he hovered before me he was glowing black i blinked in shock he was freaking glowing black dont go out there he said fear thick in his high voice go out the back get on a bus go to nicks my gaze shot past him to the door as i heard ivy vomiting again the ugly sounding gags mixing with heavy sobs what happened i asked frightened ivy fell off the wagon i stood there not understanding what she fell off the wagon he repeated shes sipping the bjuice shes sampling the wine shes practicing again rachel and shes off her rocker go my family is waiting for you by the far wall get them to nicks for me ill stay here and keep an eye on her to make sure she he glanced at the door ill make sure she isnt going to come after you the sound of ivy vomiting stopped i stood in my nightgown and robe in the middle of the sanctuary listening fear soaked in with the stillness settling in my gut i heard a small noise that grew into a steady soft crying excuse me i whispered moving around jenks my heart was pounding and my knees were weak as i pushed open one side of the heavy door the glow from the streetlight was enough to see deep in the shadows cast by the oaks ivy was sprawled in her biker leather half laying across the churchs two lowest steps dumped and left to fend for herself a gelatinous dark vomit spread over the steps dripping to the sidewalk in ugly syrupy clumps the cloying smell of blood was thick overpowering my citrus scent gathering the hem of my robe i went down the steps with a calm born in fear rachel jenks shouted his wings a harsh clatter you cant help her leave i faltered as i stood over ivy her long legs askew and her hair sticking to the black vomit her sobs had turned silent shaking her shoulders god help me through this breath held i reached from behind gripping under her arms to try to get her to her feet she flinched at my touch coherency flickered over her focus wavering she angled her feet under her to help i told him no she said her voice cracking i said no my stomach clenched at the sound of her voice bewildered and confused the acidic smell of vomit caught in my throat under it was a rich scent of wellturned earth mixing with her burnt ash smell jenks flitted around us as i got her to her feet pixy dust sifted from him to make a glowing cloud careful he whispered first on my left side then my right be careful i cant stop her if she attacks you shes not going to attack me i said anger joining my fear to make a nauseating mix she didnt fall off the wagon listen to her someone pushed her ivy shuddered as we reached the top step her hand touched the door for support and she jerked as if burned like an animal she clawed her way from me gasping i fell back wideeyed her crucifix was gone she stood before me on the churchs landing tension pulling her tall her gaze took me in and i went cold there was nothing in ivys black eyes then they flashed into a ravenous hunger and she lunged i had not a chance ivy grabbed me by my neck pinning me to the door of the church adrenaline surged flashed through me in a pained assault her hand was like warm stone under my chin my last breath made an ugly sound toes brushing the stone landing i hung terrified i tried to kick out but she pressed into me heat going through my robe eyes bulging i pried at her fingers about my throat struggling to breathe i watched her eyes they were utterly black in the streetlight fear despair hunger all mixed nothing there was her nothing at all he told me to do it she said her featherlight voice a shocking contrast to her twisted face terrifying in its absolute hunger i told him i wouldnt ivy i rasped managing a breath put me down again i made that ugly noise as her grip tightened not this way jenks shrilled ivy its not what you want the fingers on my neck clenched my lungs struggled a fire burning as they tried to fill the black of ivys eyes grew as my body started to shut down panicking i stretched for my ley line the disorientation of connection flashed through the chaos almost unnoticed reeling from the lack of oxygen i let the surge of power explode from me uncontrolled ivy was flung back i fell to my knees drawn forward even as her grip around my neck pulled away my breath came in a ragged gasp pain went all the way to my skull as my knees hit the stone landing i coughed feeling my throat i took a breath then another jenks was a blur of green and black the black spots dancing before me shrank and vanished i looked up to find ivy curled in a fetal position against the closed doors her arms over her head as if she had been beaten rocking herself i said no i said no i said no jenks i rasped watching her around the strands of my hair go get nick the pixy hovered before me as i staggered to my feet im not leaving i felt my neck as i swallowed go get him if hes not already on his way here he must have felt me pull on that line jenkss face was set you should run run while you can shaking my head i watched ivy her confident selfassurance shattered into nothing as she rocked herself and cried i couldnt go i couldnt walk away because it would be safer she needed help and i was the only one who stood a chance of surviving her damn it all to hell jenks shouted shes going to kill you well be okay i said as i lurched to her go get nick please i need him to get through this the pitch of his wings rose and fell in tandem with his visible indecision finally he nodded and left the silence his absence made reminded me of the quiet left in a cruddy little hospital room when two faltered to one swallowing i tightened my robe tie ivy i whispered come on ivy im going to get you inside stealing myself i reached out and put a shaking hand on her shoulder jerking away as she shuddered run away she whispered as she stopped rocking falling into a wiretight stillness my heart pounded as she looked up at me her eyes empty and her hair wild run away she repeated if you run ill know what to do trembling i forced myself to remain still not wanting to trigger her instincts her face went slack and with a sudden creasing of her brow a ring of brown showed in her eyes oh god help me rachel she whimpered it scared the crap of me my legs trembled i wanted to run i wanted to leave her on the steps of the church and go no one would say anything if i did but instead i reached out and put my hands under her shoulders and lifted come on i whispered as i pulled her to her feet all my instincts screamed to drop her as her hot skin touched mine lets get you inside she hung slack in my grip i said no she said her words starting to slur i said no ivy was taller than i but my shoulder fit nicely under hers and supporting most of her weight i wedged the door open he didnt listen ivy said all but incoherent as i dragged her inside and shut the door behind us shutting out the vomit and blood on the steps outside the black of the foyer was smothering i staggered into motion the light brightening as we entered the sanctuary ivy doubled over panting around a moan there was a dark smear of new blood on my robe and i looked closer ivy i said youre bleeding i went cold as her new mantra of he said it was all right turned into a giggle it was a deep skin crawling giggle and my mouth went dry yes she said the word sliding from her with a sultry heat im bleeding want a taste horror settled into me as her giggle slipped into a sobbing moan everyone should have a taste she whimpered it doesnt matter anymore my jaw clenched and i tightened my grip on her shoulders anger mixed with my fear someone had used her someone had forced her to take blood against her will she was out of her mind an addict coming off a high rachel she quavered her steps slowing i think im going to be sick were almost there i said grimly hold on just hold on we barely made it and i held ivys vomitstrewn hair out of the way as she gagged and retched into her black porcelain toilet i looked once in the glow of the seashell nightlight then closed my eyes as she vomited thick black blood over and over sobs shook her shoulders and when she finished i flushed the toilet wanting to get rid of what ugliness i could i stretched to flick the light on and a rosy glow filled her bathroom ivy sat on the floor with her forehead on the toilet crying her leather pants were shiny with blood down to her knees under her jacket her silk blouse was torn it clung to her sticky with blood coming from her neck ignoring the warning coursing through me i carefully gathered her hair to see my stomach knotted ivys perfect neck had been ravaged one long low tear marking the austere whiteness of her skin it was still bleeding and i tried not to breathe on it lest the lingering vamp saliva might set it into play frightened i let her hair fall and backed away in vampire terms she had been raped i told him no she said her sobs slowing as she realized i wasnt standing over her anymore i told him no the image of me in the mirror looked white and scared i took a breath to steady myself i wanted it to go away i wanted it all to just go away but i had to get the blood off her i had to get her in bed with a pillow to cry on i had to get her a cup of cocoa and a really good shrink did they have shrinks for abused vampires i wondered as i put a hand on her shoulder ivy i coaxed its time to get cleaned up i looked at her bathtub where that stupid fish still swam she needed a shower not a bath where she would be sitting in the filth she had to get off her lets go ivy i encouraged a quick shower in my bathroom ill get your nightgown come on no she protested eyes not focused and unable to help as i lugged her upright i couldnt stop i told him no why didnt he stop i dont know i murmured my anger growing i supported her across the hall and into my bathroom hitting the light switch with my elbow i left her slumped upright against the washer and dryer and went to start the shower the sound of the water seemed to revive her i smell she whispered vacantly looking down at herself she wouldnt look at me can you take your shower by yourself i asked hoping to spark some motion face empty and slack she looked down at herself seeing she was covered in coagulated vomited blood my stomach clenched as she touched the shiny blood with a careful finger and licked it tension tightened my shoulders until they hurt ivy started to cry three years she said in a soft exhalation tears running down her oval face until she ran the back of her hand under her chin to leave a smear of blood three years head bowed she reached for the side zipper on her pants and i lurched to the door ill make you a cup of cocoa i said feeling entirely inadequate i hesitated will you be all right for a few minutes yeah she breathed and i shut the door softly behind me feeling weightless and unreal i went into the kitchen i flicked on the light gripping my arms around myself hearing the emptiness of the room her makeshift desk with its silver technology smelling faintly of ozone looked oddly right beside my shiny copper pots ceramic spoons and herbs hanging from a sweater rack the kitchen was full of us carefully separated by space but contained by the same walls i wanted to call someone to rage to rant to ask for help but everyone would tell me to leave her and get out my fingers shook as i methodically got the milk and cocoa out and started to make ivy a drink hot cocoa i thought bitterly someone had raped ivy and all i could do was make her a damned cup of cocoa it had to be piscary only piscary was strong or bold enough to rape her and it had been rape she told him to stop he took her against her will it had been rape the timer on the microwave dinged and i tightened the tie on my robe my face went cold as i saw the blood on it and my slippers some of it black and coagulated some fresh and red from her neck the former was smoldering it was undead vampire blood no wonder ivy was retching it must be burning inside her ignoring the rank smell of cauterized blood i resolutely finished making ivys cocoa taking it to her room as the shower was still running the light from her bedside table filled the pink and white room with a soft glow ivys bedroom was as far from a vampires lair as her bathroom was the leather curtains to keep out the morning light were hidden behind white curtains gunmetalframed pictures of her her mother father sister and their lives took up an entire wall looking like a shrine there were grainy photos taken before christmas trees with robes smiles and uncombed hair vacations in front of roller coasters with sunburned noses and widebrimmed hats a sunrise on the beach her fathers arms about ivy and her sister protecting them from the cold the newer pictures were in focus and in vibrant color but i thought them less beautiful the smiles had become mechanical her father looked tired a new distance existed between ivy and her mother the most recent photos didnt have her mother in them at all turning away i pulled ivys soft coverlet down to expose the black satin smelling of wood ash the book on the nightstand concerned deep meditation and the practice of reaching altered states of consciousness my anger swelled she had been trying so hard and now she was back to square one why what had it all been for leaving the cocoa beside the book i went across the hall to get rid of my bloodied robe motions quick with spent adrenaline i brushed through my hair and threw on a pair of jeans and my black halter top the warmest clean thing i had since i hadnt gotten my winter stuff out of storage yet leaving my robe and smoldering slippers in an ugly pile on the floor i padded barefoot through the church getting her nightgown from the back of her bathroom door ivy i called knocking hesitantly on my bathroom door hearing only the water running there was no answer and so knocking again i pushed the door open a heavy mist blurred everything filling my lungs and making them seem heavy ivy i called again worry striking through me ivy are you all right i found her on the floor of the shower stall crumpled in a huddle of long legs and arms the water flowed over her bowed head blood making a thin rivulet to the drain from her neck a shimmer of lighter red colored the bottom of the stall coming from her legs i stared unable to look away her inner thighs were marred with deep scratches maybe it had been rape in the traditional sense as well i thought i was going to be sick ivys hair was plastered to her her skin was white and her arms and legs were askew the black of the twin ankle bracelets showed dark against the white of her skin looking like shackles she was shivering though the water was scalding her eyes closed and her face twisted in a memory that would haunt her the rest of her life and into her death who said vampirism was glamorous it was a lie an illusion to cover the ugly reality i took a breath ivy her eyes flashed open and i jerked back i dont want to think anymore she said softly unblinking though the water flowed over her face if i kill you i wont have to i tried to swallow should i leave i whispered but i knew she could hear me her eyes closed and her face scrunched up drawing her knees to her chin to cover herself she wrapped her arms around her legs and started to cry again yes shaking inside i stretched over her and turned off the water the cotton towel was rough on my fingertips as i grabbed it and hesitated ivy i said frightened i dont want to touch you please get up tears silently mixing with the water she rose and took the towel after she promised she would get herself dried off and dressed i took her bloodsoaked clothes along with my slippers and robe through the church to drop them on the back porch the smell of burning blood turned my stomach like bad incense id bury them in the cemetery later i found her huddled in her bed when i came back her damp hair soaking her pillow and her untouched cocoa on the nightstand her face was to the wall and she wasnt moving i pulled the afghan from the foot of the bed over her and she trembled ivy i said then hesitated not knowing what to do i told him no she said her voice a whisper torn gray silk drifting to rest atop snow i sat down on the clothdraped trunk against the wall piscary but i wouldnt say his name for fear of triggering something kist took me to him she said her words having the cadence of repeated memory she had crossed her arms over her chest only her fingers showing as they clutched her shoulders i blanched as i saw what must be flesh under her nails and i tugged the afghan up to hide it kisten took me to see him she repeated her words slow and deliberate he was angry he said you were causing trouble i told him you werent going to hurt him but he was angry he was so angry with me i leaned closer not liking this he said ivy whispered her voice almost unheard that if i couldnt curb you that he would i told him id make you my scion that you would behave and he wouldnt have to kill you but i couldnt do it her voice got higher almost frantic you didnt want it and its supposed to be a gift im sorry im so sorry i tried to tell you she said to the wall i tried to keep you alive but he wants to see you now he wants to talk to you unlessher trembling ceased rachel yesterday when you said you were sorry was it because you thought youd pushed me too far or that you said no i took a breath to answer shocked when my words got stuck in my throat do you want to be my scion she breathed softer than a guilty prayer no i whispered frightened out of my mind she started shaking and i realized she was crying again i said no too she said around her gulps for air i said no but he did anyway i think im dead rachel am i dead she questioned her tears cutting off in her sudden fear my mouth was dry and i clutched my arms around myself what happened her breath came in a quick sound and she held it for a moment he was angry he said i had failed him but he said it was all right that i was the child of his heart and that he loved me that he forgave me he told me he understood about pets that he once kept them himself but that they always turned on him and he had to kill them it hurt him when they betrayed him time and again he said if i couldnt bring myself to make you safe that hed do it for me i said id do it but he knew i was lying a frightening moan came from her he knew i was lying i was a pet i was a dangerous pet to be tamed thats what piscary thought i was he said he understood my want for a friend instead of a pet but that it wasnt safe to let you stay as you were he said i had lost control and people were talking i started to cry then because he was so kind and i had disappointed him her words came in short bursts as she struggled to get the words out and he made me sit beside him holding me as he whispered how proud he was of me and that he loved my greatgrandmother almost as much as he loved me that was all i ever wanted she said him to be proud of me she made a short gasp of pained laugher he said he understood about wanting a friend she said to the wall her face hidden behind her hair he told me he had been looking for centuries for someone strong enough to survive with him that my mother grandmother and greatgrandmother were all too weak but that i had the will to survive i told him i didnt want to live forever and he shushed me telling me i was his chosen that i would stay with him forever her shoulders shook under the coverlet he held me soothing my fears of the future he said he loved me and was proud of me and then he took my finger and drew blood from himself stomach acid bubbled up and i swallowed it down her voice had gone wispy her hunger and need a hidden ribbon of steel oh god rachel hes so old it was like liquid electricity welling up from him i tried to leave i wanted it and i tried to leave but he wouldnt let me i said no and then i ran but he caught me i tried to fight but it didnt matter then i begged him no but he held me and forced me to taste him her voice was husky and her body shook i moved to sit on the edge of the bed horrified ivy went still and i waited unable to see her face afraid to and then i didnt have to think anymore she said the flat sound of her voice shocking i think i passed out for a moment i wanted it the power the passion hes so old i pulled him to the floor and straddled him i took everything he had as he clutched me to him urging me to go deeper to draw more and i took it rachel i took more than i should have he should have stopped me but he let me take it all i couldnt move riveted by the terror of it kist tried to stop us he tried to get between us to stop piscary from letting me take too much but with every swallow i lost more of myself i think ihurt kist i think i broke him all i know is he went away and piscary a soft pleasurefilled sound escaped her as she said his name again piscary drew me back she moved languorously beneath the black sheets suggestively he gentled my head against him and pressed me closer until i was sure he wanted me and i found he had more to give a harsh breath shook her and she clenched into a huddled knot the sated lover flashing into a beaten child i took everything he let me take everything i knew why he let me and i did it anyway she was silent but i knew she wasnt done yet i didnt want to hear anymore but she had to say it or she would drive herself slowly insane with every pull i could feel his hunger growing she said whispering with my every swallow his need swelled i knew what would happen if i didnt stop but he said it was all right and it had been so long she almost moaned i didnt want to stop i knew what would happen and i didnt want to stop it was my fault my fault i recognized the phrase from rape victims it wasnt your fault i said resting my hand upon her covered shoulder it was she said and i pulled away as her voice became low and sultry i knew what would happen and when i had everything he was he asked for his blood backlike i knew he would and i gave it to him i wanted to and i did and it was fantastic i forced myself to breathe god help me she whispered i was alive i hadnt been alive for three years i was a goddess i could give life i could take it away i saw him for what he was and i wanted to be like him and with his blood burning in me as if it was mine his strength wholly mine and his power wholly mine burning into me the ugly beautiful truth of his existence he asked me to be his scion he asked me to take kistens place that he had been waiting for me to understand what it meant before he offered it to me and that when i died i would be his equal i kept my hand moving over her head in a soothing motion as her eyes closed and her shaking stopped she was getting drowsy her face going slack as her mind unwound her nightmare finding a way to deal with it i wondered if it had anything to do with the sky past her curtains brightening with the coming dawn i went to him rachel she whispered color starting to come back into her lips i went to him and he tore into me like a beast i welcomed the pain his teeth were gods truth cutting clean into my soul he savaged me out of control from the joy of getting his power back after giving it to me so freely and i gloried in it even as he bruised my arms and tore my neck open i forced my hand to keep moving it hurt she whispered sounding like a child as her eyelids fluttered no one has enough vamp saliva in them to transmute that much pain and he lapped up my misery and anguish along with my blood i wanted to give him more prove my loyalty to him prove that though i failed by not taming you that i would be his scion blood tastes better during sex she said faintly the hormones make it sweet so i opened myself to him he said no even as he moaned for it that he might kill me by mistake but i worked him until he couldnt stop himself i wanted it i wanted it even as he hurt me he took it all bringing us to climax even as he killed me she shuddered her eyes closed oh god rachel i think he killed me you arent dead i whispered frightened because i wasnt sure she couldnt be in a church if she was dead yes unless she was still in transition the space of time when the chemistry shifted over had no hard and fast rules what the hell was i doing i think he killed me she said again her voice starting to slur as she fell asleep i think i killed myself her voice grew childlike her eyelids fluttered am i dead rachel will you watch over me make sure the sun doesnt burn me while i sleep will you keep me safe shhhh i whispered scared go to sleep ivy i dont want to be dead she mumbled i made a mistake i dont want to be piscarys scion i want to stay here with you can i stay here with you will you watch over me hush i murmured running a hand over her hair go to sleep you smell goodlike oranges she whispered setting my pulse pounding but at least i didnt smell like her i kept my hand moving until her breathing slowed and grew deep i wondered if when she fell asleep it would stop i wasnt sure ivy was alive anymore my gaze went to the stainedglass window the hint of dawn leaking around the edges the sun would be up soon and i didnt know anything about vampires crossing over except they had to be six feet under or in a lighttight room that and that they woke hungry the next sunset oh god what if ivy was dead i looked at the jewelry box on her mahogany dresser that held her in case of death bracelet that she refused to wear ivy had good insurance if i called the number engraved on the silver band an ambulance would be there in a guaranteed five minutes whisking her away to a nice dark hole in the ground to emerge when darkness fell as a beautiful reborn undead my stomach churned and i rose to go to my room for my tiny cross if she was dead there would be some reaction even if she was in transition passing out in a church is one thing having a consecrated cross touch your skin is another nauseated i returned charms jingling i held my breath and dangled my bracelet over ivy there was no response i brought the cross close to her neck behind her ear breathing easier when again there was no reaction silently asking for her forgiveness if i was wrong i touched the cross to her skin she didnt move her pulse at her neck staying slow and sedate her skin when i pulled the cross away was white and unblemished i straightened saying a silent prayer i didnt think she was dead slowly i crept from ivys room shutting the door behind me piscary had raped ivy for one reason he knew i had figured it out ivy said he wanted to talk to me if i stayed in my church he would go for my mother next then nick and then probably track down my brother my thoughts returned to ivy huddled under her covers in a shockinduced sleep my mother would be next and she would die not even knowing why she was being tortured shaking inside i went into the living room for the phone my fingers were trembling so badly i had to dial it twice it took a precious three minutes of arguing to get to rose im sorry ms morgan the woman said her voice so politically correct i could freeze an egg on it captain edden is not available and detective glenn left word that he is not to be disturbed not to be i stammered listen i know who murdered them we have to go out there now before he sends someone after my mother im sorry ms morgan the woman said politely you are no longer a consultant if you have a complaint or death threat please hold and ill transfer you back to the front desk no wait i pleaded you dont understand just let me talk to glenn no morgan roses calm reasonable voice was suddenly thick with an unexpected anger you dont understand no one here wants to talk to you but i know who the witch hunter is i exclaimed and the connection clicked off you sorryassed idiots i shouted throwing the phone across the room it hit the wall the back coming off and the batteries rolling over the floor frustrated i stomped into the kitchen spilling ivys pens over the table as i reached for one heart pounding i scratched a note to thumbtack to the door of the church nick was coming glenn would talk to nick he could convince them i was right tell them where id gone theyd have to come out if only to arrest me for interfering i would have told him to call the is but piscary probably owned them and though humans had as much chance of besting a master vampire as i did perhaps just the interruption might be enough to save my butt spinning i reached for the cupboard pulling amulets from hooks and jamming them into my bag i yanked open a bottom drawer and grabbed three wooden stakes i added the big butcher cleaver from the knife block my splat gun was next loaded with the strongest spell a white witch would have sleepytime charms from the island counter i took a bottle of holy water thinking for a moment i pulled up the valve top took a swallow recapped it then shoved it in with the rest holy water wasnt much good unless it was all youd been drinking for the last three days but id take all the deterrent i could scrape together not slowing i strode into the hall for my boots i slipped them on and headed for the front door laces flapping jerking to a halt in the hallway i spun returning to the kitchen grabbing a handful of change for the bus i left piscary wanted to talk to me good i wanted to talk to him twentysix the bus was crowded at five in the morning living vamps mostly and vamp wannabes on their way home to take stock of their sorry existence they gave me a wide birth it could have been that i stank of holy water it could have been that i looked like hell warmed over in my ugly heavy winter coat with the fake fur around the collar that i had worn so the driver wouldnt recognize me and pick me up but i was betting it was the stakes face tight i got off the bus at piscarys restaurant i stood where my feet hit the pavement and waited while the door shut and the bus drove away slowly the noise faltered until it melted into the background hum of swelling morning traffic my eyes pinched as i looked straight up at the brightening sky the mist from my breath obscured the fragilelooking pale blue i wondered if it was going to be the last sky id ever see it would be dawn soon if i were smart i would wait until the sun was up before i went in i pushed myself into motion piscarys was two stories tall and all the windows were dark the yacht was still tied to the quay and the water lapped softly there were only a few cars in the lot at the outskirts employees probably as i walked i swung my bag around pulling out the stakes i flung them away their harsh clatters on the asphalt shocked my ears bringing them had been stupid like i could stake an undead vampire the splat gun at the small of my back was probably a futile gesture too since i was sure i would be searched before they took me to piscary the master vampire said he wanted to talk but id be a fool to think it would stop there if i wanted to meet him with all my spells and charms id have to fight my way to him if i let them take away everything i had id get to him unscathed but pretty much helpless i opened the bottle of holy water and chugged it spilling the last drops into my hands and patting my neck the empty bottle clattered after the stakes i strode forward in my soundless boots my fear for my mother and my anger at what he had done to ivy keeping my feet moving if there were too many of them id go in charmless nick and the fib were my ace in the hole my stomach knotted as i pushed open the heavy door the faint hope that there might be no one died as half a dozen people looked up from their scattered work all of them living vamps the human staff was gone id be willing to bet that the pretty scarred adoring humans had gone home with favorite customers the lights were up high while the wait staff cleaned and where the large room with it logcabin walls had looked mysterious and exciting now it looked dirty and tired kind of like me the shoulderhigh wall of stained glass that divided the room was broken a petite woman with hair to her waist was sweeping the shards of green and gold toward the wall she stopped to lean on the broom as i came in there was an odd smell at the back of my throat rich and cloying my feet faltered as i realized the vamp pheromones were so thick i could taste them at least ivy had put up a fight i thought realizing most of the vamps were sporting a bandage or bruise and all of them with the exception of the vamp sitting at the bar were in a bad mood one had been bit his neck torn and his uniform ripped at the collar in the bright light of morning their glamour and sexual tension had been wiped away to leave only a tired ugliness my lip curled in distaste seeing them like this they were repellant and yet my scar on my neck started to tingle well look who showed the vamp sitting at the bar drawled his uniform was more elaborate than the rest and he took his name tag off as he saw my eyes on it it read samuel the vampire that had let tarra upstairs the night we were there samuel got up leaning to flick a switch behind the counter the open sign behind me in the window went out youre rachel morgan he asked his vampconfident voice slow and patronizing clutching my bag i boldly walked past the wait here for host sign yeah i was a bad girl thats me i said wishing there were fewer tables my feet slowed as caution finally worked its way past my anger i had broken rule number one going in mad i would have been okay if i hadnt also broken the more important rule number two confronting an undead vamp on his own turf the wait staff was watching and my pulse quickened as samuel went to the door and locked it turning he casually threw the wad of keys clear across the room a figure by the unused fireplace raised his arm and i recognized kisten unseen in the shadows until he moved the keys hit kists palm with a jingle and disappeared i didnt know if i should be angry with him or not he had dumped ivy and driven off but he had tried to stop them too this is what piscary is worried about samuel said his beautiful face sneering skinny little thing not much on top he leered or bottom i thought youd be taller he reached for me jerking into motion i stiffarmed him feeling my fist pop into his open palm i twisted my wrist grabbing his i yanked him forward into my upraised foot his breath whooshed out as it hit his stomach knocking him backward i followed him down giving him a jab at his crotch before i got to my feet and i thought youd be smarter i said backing away as he writhed on the floor gasping it probably hadnt been the smartest thing to do dropping their rags and broom the wait staff converged on me with an unnerving unhurried pace my breath came fast and i shimmied out of my coat shoving one of the tables away with my foot to make room to move seven spells in my gun nine vamps id never get them all my face went cold and i shivered in the draft on my bare shoulders no kist said from his corner and they hesitated i said no he shouted as he got to his feet and started over his fast pace jerking into a slower one to hide a new limp their faces twisting to an ugly promise they stopped making a ring about me a good eight feet back eight feet i thought feeling ill as i remembered my and ivys workouts that was a living vamps reach crotchboy got to his feet his shoulders hunched and his face pained kist pushed through the circle to stand opposite him hands on his hips and feet spread wide his dark silk shirt and dress pants gave him more sophistication than his usual leather a bruise spread upward across his lightly stubbled cheek to just miss his eye by the way he held himself i guessed his ribs were hurting but i thought the real damage was to his pride he had lost his scion status to ivy he said bring her down not rough her up kist said his lips going bloodless as my gaze lingered on the fingernail gouge behind his bangs though samuel was bigger kists demand for obedience was unmistakable a hard bad temper had replaced his usual mien of casual flirtation giving him a rough edge that id always found attractive in men like every manager kist had problems with his employees and somehow the fact that he had to deal with crap just like everyone else made him more appealing my gaze roved over him my thoughts following my eyes damn vamp pheromones still panting the larger vamp darted his eyes to me and back to kist she needs to be searched he licked his lips looking at me to make my pulse race ill do it i stiffened my thoughts going to my splat gun there were too many of them im doing it kist said his blue eyes starting to vanish behind a swelling circle of black swell samuel sullenly backed off and kist held out his hand for my bag i hesitated then seeing him arch his eyebrow as if to say just give me a reason i extended it he took it roughly setting it on a nearby table give me what you have on you he said softly eyes on his i slowly reached behind me and handed him my splat gun there wasnt a sound from the surrounding vampires perhaps some respect for my little red paintball gun they didnt know what it was loaded with i had known the moment i tucked it behind my waistband id never get to use it and i frowned at lost chances that never really existed the cross he asked and i worked the clasp of my charm bracelet dropping it into his waiting hand saying nothing he set it and my gun on the table behind him stepping forward he put his arms out wide i obediently mimicked him and he came close to pat me down jaw gritted i felt his hands run over me where he touched a warm tingling started working its way to my middle not the scar not the scar i thought desperately knowing what would happen if he touched it the vamp pheromones were almost thick enough to see and just the breeze from the fan was making a pleasant sensation run from my neck to my groin i shook in relief when his hands fell away the charm on your pinky he demanded and i took it off slapping it in his palm he dropped it beside my gun a tight look came into his eye as he stood before me if you move you die he said i stared at him not understanding kist eased close and my breath hissed i could smell his tension his wiretight reactions balancing on the possibility of my next move he sent his breath against my collarbone and my thoughts jerked back to his lips brushing my ear four days ago head tilted he looked down at me hesitating an empty look in his blue eyes his hunger wellhidden reaching up he ran a finger from my ear across my neck and the bumps of my scar my knees buckled sucking in air i pulled myself upright and with waves of need demanding to be met i backhanded him he caught my wrist before it landed yanking me into him twisting i swung my foot up he caught it kist jerked me off my feet and let go i fell on my can the wooden floor bruising i stared up at him as the vamps laughed kists face though was empty no anger no speculation nothing you smell like ivy he said as i got to my feet my heart hammering you arent bound to her though a sliver of satisfaction marred his stoic expression she couldnt do it what are you talking about i snarled embarrassed and angry as i brushed myself off his eyes narrowed it felt good didnt it me touching your scar once a vamp binds you by blood only they can elicit that kind of a response who bit you and didnt bother to claim you his face went thoughtful and i thought i saw a glimmer of lust or did you kill your attacker afterward to prevent being bound youre a bad little girl i said nothing letting him believe what he wanted and he shrugged since you arent tied to anyone any vamp can entice that kind of reaction his eyebrows rose any vamp he repeated and a chill went through me at the thought of piscary waiting for me you should have an interesting morning he added vision clearing he reached behind him and dragged my bag from the table the vamps had begun to talk among themselves making casual unnerving speculations as to how long i would last kist pulled out the butcher knife first and hooting laughter rippled over them my gaze went over the destruction of piscarys as kist set a handful of charms clattering on the table did ivy do this i asked trying to find a sliver of my confidence the longer i kept them talking the better the chance that nick would get the fib out there in time the vamp i had crotchpunched sneered in a manner of speaking he looked at kist and i thought i saw the blond vamps jaw clench your roommates a good lay samuel said going smug as kists breath quickened and his fingers digging through my bag became rough yeah samuel continued in a goodoldboys drawl she and piscary got the entire restaurant hoppedup on vamp pheromones ended up with three fights a couple of bites he leaned against a table crossed his arms and smirked someone died and got carted off to the citys temporary vaults see he got his picture on the wall and a coupon for a free dinner we were damned lucky we figured out what was going on and got everyone not a vamp outta here before all hell broke loose god help us if piscary lost his mpl and had to reapply took him almost a year last time samuel took a peanut from a bowl and threw it into the air catching it with his mouth and grinning as he chewed kists face was red with anger shut up he said pulling the ties to my bag closed whatsa matter samuel mocked just cause you never got piscary that worked up doesnt mean hes gonna make her his scion kist stiffened he hadnt told anyone that piscary already did my eyes darted to him his anger keeping my mouth shut i said shut up kist warned the heat from him almost visible the surrounding vamps were casually shifting back samuel laughed clearly wanting to push kist as far as he could kist is jealous he said to me with the sole intent to irritate him the most that ever happened when he and piscary were going at it was a bar fight his full lips split into a nasty grin and he glanced cockily at the surrounding vamps dont worry old man he directed to kist piscary will get tired of her as soon as she dies and youll be back on topor bottomor somewhere in between if youre lucky maybe theyll let you sit in and ivy can teach you a thing or two kists fingers trembled in the space between one heartbeat and the next he moved too fast to follow he crossed the circle grabbed samuel by the shirtfront and shoved him up against a thick support post the timber groaned and i heard something snap in samuels chest the bigger mans face showed a surprised shock his eyes wide and his mouth open in pain he hadnt had time to feel shut up kist said softly his jaw clenched and his eye twitched dropping him kist gave samuel a shove twisting his arm at an unnatural angle as the larger man fell to his knees my breath caught at the audible pop of his shoulder dislocating samuels eyes bulged mouth open in a silent scream he knelt his arm still bent behind him since kist had never let go of his wrist kist dropped it and samuel gasped for air i stoodunable to movefrightened at how fast it had been kist was suddenly before to me and i jerked heres your bag he said handing it to me i snatched it and kist gestured that i should go before him an opening parted in the circle the surrounding vamps looked properly cowed no one had gone to help samuel and his ragged pants for air as he lay unmoving struck me to my core dont touch me i said as i passed kist and none of you had better mess with my things while im gone i added shaking inside my pace faltered as i took a last look at my charms and realized only about half of what i had brought was on the table kist took my elbow and pulled me into motion let me go i said the memory of him dislocating samuels arm keeping me from pulling away shut up he said the tension in his voice giving me pause mind whirling i followed his notsosubtle direction weaving through the tables to pass through a set of swinging doors and into the kitchen behind us the wait staff went back to their work the speculations flying as they ignored samuel i couldnt help notice that though smaller my kitchen was nicer than piscarys kist led me to a metal institutionallooking fire door he opened it and flicked on a light to show a small white room floored in oak the silver doors of an elevator were tucked out of the way a widemouthed spiral stairway leading downward took up much of one wall the stairway was elegant the modest chandelier above it clinking faintly in the upwelling draft a wooden clock the size of a table hung on the wall opposite the stairway ticking loudly down i said trying to keep from looking scared if nick didnt find my note there was no chance id be coming back up those stairs the fire door snicked shut behind him and i felt the air pressure change the draft smelled like nothing almost a void in itself lets take the elevator kist said his voice unexpectedly soft his entire posture changed as he focused on an unknown thought he had left me some of my charms the elevator doors opened immediately when he pushed the button and i got in kist was tight behind me and we faced the doors as they closed with a soft pull at my stomach the elevator started down immediately i swung my bag around and opened it idiot kist hissed a tiny shriek escaped me as he slid pinning me into a corner the room shifted under me and i froze poised to act his teeth were inches from me my demon scar pulsed and i held my breath the pheromones were less in here but it didnt seem to matter if there was elevator music i was going to scream dont be stupid you dont think hes got cameras in here my breath came in a soft pant get away from me dont think so love he whispered his breath sending tingling jolts from my neck and making my blood pound im going to see just how far that scar on your neck can take youand when im done youre going to find a vial in your purse i stiffened as he pressed closer the scent of leather and silk was a pleasing assault i couldnt breathe as he nuzzled my hair out of the way its egyptian embalming fluid he said and i tensed as his lips shifted against my neck with his words i didnt dare move and if i was honest id admit that i didnt want to as tingling ribbons of promise flowed from my scar get it in his eyes and it will knock him unconscious i couldnt help it my body demanded i do something shoulders easing i closed my eyes and ran my hands up the smooth expanse of his back he paused in surprise then his hands slid down my sides to grasp my waist the muscles under his silk shirt bunched beneath my fingers reaching upward my nails played with the hair at the nape of his neck the soft strands had a uniform color that you can only find in a box and i realized he dyed his hair why are you helping me i breathed fingering the black chain about his neck the bodywarm links were the same pattern as the bracelets about ivys ankle i felt his muscles shift tightening with pain instead of desire he said i was his scion he said as he hid his face in my hair to hide his moving lips from the unseen cameraat least thats what i told myself he said i would be with him forever and he betrayed me for ivy she doesnt deserve him hurt stained his voice she doesnt even love him my eyes closed i would never understand vampires not knowing why i did i sent my fingers gently through his hair soothing him as his breath caressed my demon scar into mounting surges demanding to be met common sense told me to stop but he was hurt and id been betrayed like that too kists breath faltered as i sent the hint of my fingernails under his ear making a low guttural sound he pressed closer his heat obvious through the thin material of my shirt his tension became deeper more dangerous my god he whispered his voice a husky thread ivy was right leaving you unbound and free of compulsion would be like fucking a tiger watch your mouth i said breathily his hair tickling my face i dont like that kind of language i was already dead why not enjoy my last few moments yes maam he said obediently his voice shocking in its submissiveness even as he forced his lips to mine my head hit the back of the elevator with the force of his kiss i pushed back unafraid dont call me that i mumbled around his mouth remembering what ivy had said about him playing the subordinate maybe i could survive a submissive vampire his weight pressing harder into me he pulled his lips from mine i met his eyeshis faultless blue eyesstudying them with the breathless understanding that i didnt know what was going to happen next but praying that whatever it was it would happen let me do this he said his rumbling voice just shy of a growl his hands were free and he took my chin and held my head unmoving i caught a glint of tooth then he was too close to see anything not a shimmer of fear struck me as he kissed me again pushed out by a sudden realization he wasnt after blood ivy wanted blood kist wanted sex and the risk that his desire might turn to blood catapulted me past my sensibilities and into a reckless daring his lips were soft with a moist warmth his blond stubble was a striking contrast adding to my fervor heart pounding i hooked a foot behind his leg and pulled him closer feeling it his breath came and went in a pant a soft sound of real bliss escaped me my tongue found the smoothness of his teeth and his muscles under my hands tensed i pulled my tongue away teasing our mouths parted heat was in his eyes black and full of a fervent unashamed desire and still there was no fear give this to me he breathed i wont break your skinif he took a breath you give this to me shut up kisten i whispered closing my eyes to block what i could of the confusing swirl of rising tensions yes ms morgan it was the softest whisper i wasnt even sure i had heard it the need in me swelled compelling beyond sanity i knew i shouldnt but heart quickening i ran my nails down his neck to leave red pressure trails kisten shuddered his hands falling to find the small of my back firm and questing liquid fire raced from my neck as he angled his head and found my scar his breath came in strong surges sending wave after delicious wave through me from his lips alone i will noti will not he panted and i realized he was balanced on the brink of something more a tremor passed through me as he traced a path across my neck with his gentle teeth a whisper of words unrecognized pattered through my thoughts pinging my sensibilities say yes he urged a wisp of urgent promise in his low coaxing voice say it love pleasegive me this too my knees trembled as the coolness of his teeth grazed over my skin again testing luring his hands on my shoulders held me firm did i want this eyes warming with unshed tears i admitted i didnt know anymore where ivy couldnt move me kisten did i prayed kisten didnt feel it in my fingers gripping his arms as if he was the only thing keeping me sane at this brink of time you need to hear me say yes i breathed recognizing the passion in my voice i would rather die here with kisten then in fear with piscary the ding of the elevator intruded and the doors opened a flush of cool air drifted about my ankles reality flashed back in a painful rush it was too late i had tarried too long do i have the vial i questioned breathless as my fingers twined among the short hair at the nape of his neck his weight was heavy against me and the scent of leather and silk would forever mean kisten to me i didnt want to move i didnt want to get out of this elevator i felt kists heartbeat and heard him swallow its in your purse he breathed good my jaw clenched and my grip in his hair tightened yanking his head back i brought my knee up kist flung himself away from me the elevator shook as he hit the opposite wall id missed him damn breathless and disheveled he pulled himself straight and felt his ribs you have to move faster than that witch flipping the hair from his eyes he gestured for me to go out before him knees watery and loose i gathered myself and walked out of the elevator twentyseven piscarys daytime quarters were not what i had expected i walked out of the elevator my head swinging from side to side taking it all in the ceilings were highi guessed ten feetand were painted white where they werent covered with warm primarycolored sheets of fabric draped into soothing folds large archways hinted at equally spacious rooms farther in it had the soft comfort of a playboy mansion mixed with the air of a museum i spared a moment to try to find a ley line not surprised to find i was too deep underground my boots trod upon a plush offwhite carpet the furniture was tasteful and there was occasional artwork under spotlights floortoceiling curtains at regular intervals gave the illusion of windows behind them bookshelves behind glass were between them every tome looking older than the turn nick would have loved it and i spared a thought desperately hoping he had found my note the first hints of possible success made me walk with more confidence than i deserved between kistens vial and nicks note maybe i could escape with my life the doors to the elevator shut i turned noticing there was no button to push to make them open up again the stairway too was missing it must come out somewhere else my heart gave a pound and settled escape with my life maybe take off your boots kist said i cocked my head in disbelief excuse me theyre dirty his attention was on my feet he was still flushed take them off i looked at the expanse of white carpet he wanted me to kill piscary and he was worried about my boots on the carpet grimacing i slipped them off and left them askew by the elevator i did not believe this i was going to die in my bare feet but the carpet felt nice on my arches as i followed kisten forcing myself to not feel the outside of my bag for the vial he had promised was there he was tense again his jaw tight and his manner sullen far from the domineering vampire that had driven me to the brink of capitulation he looked jealous and wronged just what i would expect from a betrayed lover give me this echoed in my memory pulling an unstoppable shudder through me i wondered if he begged piscary like that knowing that he had been asking for blood and i wondered if to kisten the taking of blood was a casual commitment or something more the sound of muted traffic drew my attention from the picture of what looked like piscary and lindburgh sharing a pint in a british pub steps slow to hid his limp kisten led me into a sunken living room at the end of it was a tiled breakfast nook before what looked like for all the world a window overlooking the river from the second story piscary was lounging at a small metalweave table dead center of the circular tiled space surrounded by carpet i knew i was underground and that it was only a live video feed but it sure looked like a window to me the sky was brightening with the coming dawn giving the gray river a soft sheen cincinnatis taller buildings were dark silhouettes against the lighter sky smoke came from the paddleboats as they stoked their boilers readying themselves for the first wave of tourists sunday traffic was light and the individual whooshes of cars were lost behind the thousands of clatters clanks and unseen calls that make up the background of a city i watched the water ripple under the breeze and my hair lifted in a gust in time with a soft hush of wind taken aback at the detail i searched the ceiling and floor until i found a vent a horn blew in the distance enjoy yourself kist piscary said pulling my attention away from the jogger and his dog running the footpath beside the river kists neck went red and he ducked his head i wanted to know what ivy was talking about he mumbled looking like a child caught kissing the neighbor girl piscary smiled exciting isnt it leaving her unbound like that is loads of fun until she tries to kill you but then thats where the thrill comes from yes my tension flowed back piscary looked relaxed sitting at one of the tables two wireweave chairs in a lightweight midnightblue silk robe the morning paper sat folded by his hand the deep color of his robe went nicely with his amber skin his bare feet were visible through the table they were long and skinny the same honey hue as his bare scalp my anxiety strengthened at his bedroomcasual appearance great this is just what i needed nice window i said thinking it was better than trents the toad he could have taken care of all of this had he acted when i told him piscary was the murderer men were all alike take what they can get without paying for it lie about the rest piscary shifted in his chair and his robe parted to show his knee i quickly looked away thank you he said i hated sunrises when i was alive now its my favorite part of the day i sneered and he gestured to the table would you like a cup of coffee coffee i said i would have thought it was against the gangster code to have coffee with someone before killing them his thin black eyebrows rose i realized he must want something from me otherwise he would have just sent algaliarept to kill me on the bus black i said no sugar piscary gave kisten a directive nod and he slipped soundlessly away i pulled out the second chair across from piscary flopping down with my bag on my lap i glanced out the fake window in the silence i like your lair i said sarcastically piscary raised one eyebrow i wished i could do that too late to learn how now it was originally part of the underground railroad he said a foul hole in the ground under someones shipping dock ironic isnt it i said nothing and he added this used to be the gateway to the free world it still is occasionally theres nothing like death to free a person a small sigh slipped from me and i turned to the window wondering how much wiseoldmancrap he was going to make me listen to before killing me piscary cleared his throat and i looked back a wisp of black hair showed behind the v of his robe and his calves visible through the wire mesh of the table were hard with muscle i recalled my lust rising hot and fast in the elevator with kisten knowing it had mostly been vamp pheromones liar that piscary could to that to me and more with nothing more than a sound turned my stomach unable to stop myself i sent my hand over my neck as if to brush my hair from my eyes i wanted to hide my scar though piscary was probably more aware of it than the nose on my face you didnt have to rape her to get me to come see you i said deciding to be angry instead of afraid a dead horse head in my bed would have done it i wanted to he said his low voice carrying the strength of the wind much as youd like to think otherwise this isnt all about you rachel some of it but not all my name is ms morgan he acknowledged this with a threesecond mocking silence i have been spoiling ivy people are beginning to talk it was time to bring her back into the fold and it was a pleasurefor both of us a smile of remembrance came over him a glint of fang and a soft almost subliminal guttural sigh she surprised me going far past my intended purpose i havent lost control like that for at least three hundred years my stomach quivered as a surge of his vampinduced desire flashed through me and was gone its potency took my breath away and i found myself reaching out to catch it bastard i said wideeyed as my blood pounded in me flatterer he said back his eyebrows high she changed her mind i said as the last of his need died in me she doesnt want to be your scion leave her alone its too late and she does want it i put no compulsion on her when she made her decision i didnt need to she had been bred and raised for the position and when she dies she will have the complexity to be a suitable companion varied and sophisticated enough in her thoughts so that i dont become bored with her and she with me you see rachel its not honest to say that the lack of blood is what causes a vampire to go insane and walk out into the sun its the boredom that brings upon a lack of appetite that leads to insanity working to bring ivy about has helped me stave that off now that she is poised upon her potential shes going to keep me from going insane he inclined his head graciously and ill do the same for her his attention went over my shoulder and the hair on the back of my neck pricked it was kisten the whisper of his passage brushed against me and i stifled a shudder the bruised and beaten vamp silently set a cup of coffee on a saucer before me and left he never met my eyes his manner holding a subdued pain the steam from the porcelain rose three inches before the artificial wind caught it and blew it away i didnt reach for the cup fatigue pulled at me and adrenaline made me feel ill i thought of the charms in my bag why was piscary waiting kist the undead vampire said softly and kisten turned give it to me piscary held out his hand and kisten dropped a crumpled paper in his palm my face went slack in panic it was my note to nick did she call anyone piscary asked kist and the young vampire ducked his head she called the fib they hung up on her shocked i looked at kisten he had watched the entire thing he had hidden in the shadows while i held ivys hair as she vomited watched as i made her cocoa and listened as i sat beside ivy while she relived her nightmare while i had been taking forever on the bus kisten had ripped my salvation from the door no one was coming no one at all not meeting my eyes he walked away there was the distant sound of a door closing my gaze flicked to piscarys and my breath froze his eyes were entirely black shit the unblinking obsidian orbs made my palms sweat with the coiled tension of a predator he reclined before me in his midnightblue robe with that fake wind moving the wisps of hair on his bare arms tan and healthy looking the hem of his robe shifted with his subtle movements his chest moved as he breathed in an effort to ease my subconscious and as i sat before him the enormity of what was going to happen fell on me my breath came and went and i held it seeing me recognize my death he blinked slowly and smiled with a knowing glint not yet but soon when he could wait no longer its amusing you care for her so deeply he said the power seeping from his voice to clench about my heart she betrayed you so utterly my beautiful dangerous filiola custos i sent her to watch you four years ago and she joined the is i bought a church and told her to move into it she did i asked her to put in a witchs kitchen and stock it with appropriate books she went beyond to arrange for a garden that would be irresistible my face was cold and my legs trembled her friendship had been a lie a sham to keep tabs on me i couldnt believe it remembering the lost sound of her voice as she asked me to keep the sun from killing her i couldnt believe her friendship had been a lie i told her to follow you when you quit piscary said the blackness in his eyes taking on the tension of a remembered passion it was our first argument and i thought that i had found the point where i could make her my scion where she would show her strength and prove she could hold her own against me but she capitulated for a time i thought i might have made a mistake and she lacked the strength of will to survive infinity with me and id have to wait yet another generation and try with a daughter born of her and kisten i was so disappointed imagine my delight when i realized she had her own agenda and was using me he smiled the slip of teeth a little bigger showing a little longer she had fastened upon you as her way out of the future i saw for her she thought you could find a way to keep her from losing her soul when she dies he shook his head in a controlled motion the light glinting across his smooth scalp cant be done but she wont believe i swallowed making fists as my feelings of betrayal faltered she had been using him not following his direction does she know you murdered those witches i whispered sick at heart that she might have known and never told me no piscary said im sure she suspects but my interest in you stems from an older reason having nothing to do with kalamacks current holy grail of a ley line witch i kept my eyes from my hands gripped tightly in my lap above the opening of my bag i couldnt reach for the vial if it wasnt for that why did piscary want me dead it must have cost her pride dearly to come to me begging for clemency when you survived your demon attack she was so upset its hard to be young i understood more than she knows what it is to want an equal and i was inclined to spoil her more once i realized she had used me without my knowing so i let you live provided she break her fast and take you completely you being her shadow had an ironic twist i liked she promised she would but i knew she was lying even so i didnt mind as long as she kept you and kalamack apart but im not a ley line witch i said keeping my voice soft so it wouldnt shake i could have breathed the words and he would have heard why he hadnt taken a breath since he stopped talking the balls of his feet were pressed to the floor his calves were tense almost i thought moving my fingers to the opening of my bag he was almost ready what was he waiting for you are your fathers daughter he said the skin around his eyes tightening trent is his fathers son apart you are annoying together you have the potential to be a problem my gaze went distant then sharpened as i met his eyes knowing my face had taken on a horrified expression the picture of my father and trents outside a yellow camp bus piscary had killed them it had been piscary hard and strong my blood pounded in my temples my body demanded i do something but i sat knowing if i moved he would move he shrugged a calculated motion that pulled my eyes to a flash of amber skin beneath his robe they were getting too close to solving the elven riddle he said watching my reaction i kept my face impassive as he said trents most precious secret telling him i too knew apparently it was the right thing to do im not going to let you two pick up where they left off he added prodding i said nothing stomach roiling piscary had killed them trents father and my dad had been friends they had been working together they had been working together against piscary piscary went very still has he sent you into the everafter yet my gaze shot to his fear in my gut there it was the question he wanted answered the one he hid among others so i wouldnt know as soon as i answered it id be dead im not in the habit of breaking my client confidentiality i said my mouth dry his cool dispassion cracked as he took a breath it was subtle but there it was he has did you find one he asked catching himself before he could lean forward over the table was it sound enough to read one read what i said nothing desperately wanting to hide my pulse pounding in my neck but though his eyes were black he wasnt interested in my blood that was almost too frightening to believe i didnt know how to answer would yes save my life or damn it frowning he studied me a long moment while i listened to my heart pound and sweat broke out on my arms i cant interpret your silence he said seeming irritated i took a breath piscary moved the adrenaline hurt i pushed myself from the table in a blind panic my chair tipped over backward with me still in it piscary flung the table out of the way it crashed aside my untouched coffee making a fantastic pattern on the white carpet i scrabbled backward my bare feet squeaking against the circle of tile my fingers found the carpet and i clutched at it rolling over and pulling myself forward a shriek escaped me as he yanked me up by my wrist i clawed at him in panic he took it all face dispassionate he drew a fingernail across my right arm follow the blue of a vein fire traced his nail as he opened my skin then bliss silently savagely i fought to get free as he held me by my wrist unmoving as a tree my blood welled and i felt the bubble of insanity swell in me not again i couldnt be ravaged by a vampire again he looked at my blood then my eyes taking his free hand he swiped it across my arm no i screamed he let go of my wrist and i fell to the carpet breath a harsh pant i scrabbled backward i found my feet adrenaline pounding through me as i headed for the elevator piscary jerked me back you son of a bitch i screamed leave me alone he gave my head a smack to make me see stars i crumpled panting i lay at his feet as he stood above me an amulet in his hand he smeared my blood across it and it glowed red his hand was enveloped in a red haze as he nudged my fallen chair farther onto the surrounding carpet i pulled my head up seeing past my hair that the pattern on the tiled floor before us made a perfect circle the circle of blue tile around the white stone was one piece of marble it was a summoning circle god help me i whispered knowing what was going to happen when piscary tossed the amulet to land dead center of the circle i watched the ball of everafter energy expand to form a protective bubble my skin hummed with the power from another witch kindled to life with my blood as piscary prepared to call his demon twentyeight piscary brought his hand to his mouth to lick away my remaining blood recoiling holy water he said his dispassionate face showing a glimmer of distaste taking his robe hem he wiped my blood from him leaving his palm showing only a mild redness you need more than that to do more than annoy me and dont flatter yourself i wasnt going to bite you i dont even like you but youd enjoy it instead you will be dying slowly and in pain bring it on i panted slumped at his feet as my eyes remembered how to focus he moved that hated eight feet away staying between the elevator and me carefully pronounced latin came from him i recognized some of the words from nicks summoning my pulse quickened and i looked frantically over the plush spacious white room for anything i was too far underground to tap into a ley line algaliarept was coming piscary was going to give me to it i froze as piscary said its name the taste of burnt amber coated my tongue and a haze of everafter red melted into existence within the summoning circle oh look a demon i whispered dragging myself to the fallen table and pulling myself up this just keeps getting better and better swaying i watched as it swelled to grow into a sixfoothigh figure the everafter red soaked inward coalescing as an athletic amberskinned body dressed in a loincloth decorated with stones and colored ribbons algaliarept had bare muscular legs an impossibly thin waist and a magnificently sculptured chest that would make schwarzenegger weep and atop it was a jackal head alive with pointing ears and a long savage muzzle my mouth dropped open and i looked from the vision of the egyptian god of death to piscary seeing the vampires features with new meaning piscary was egyptian piscary stiffened i told you not to appear before me like that he said tightly the death mask grinned fascinating in that it was alive and part of him i forgot it drawled in an incredibly deep voice that seemed to set my insides resonating a thin red tongue slipped past the jackal teeth to caress its muzzle there was the clopping sound of teeth and lips my heart pounded and as if hearing it algaliarept slowly turned to me rachel mariana morgan it said its ears pricked you are the little gadabout shut up piscary said and algaliarepts eyes narrowed to slits what do you want for making her tell me what she knows about kalamacks progress six seconds with you outside your circle the sheer desire to kill piscary in its voice was like ice down my back piscary shook his head his cool compassion unshaken ill give you her i dont care what you do with her as long as she doesnt walk this side of the ley lines ever again in return you will make her tell me how far trent kalamack is in his research before you take her agreed not the everafter not with algaliarept algaliarepts canine grin was pleased rachel mariana morgan as payment mmmm i agree the egyptian god clenched its hands and took a step forward halting at the edge of the circle its jackal ears pricked and its doggy eyebrows rose you cant do that i protested heart pounding i looked at piscary you cant do that i dont agree i turned to algaliarept he doesnt own my soul he cant give it to you the demon spared me a glance he has your body control the body control the soul thats not fair i shouted ignored piscary came close to the circle he put his hands upon his hips taking an aggressive stance you will he intoned not attempt to kill or touch me in any fashion and when i say you will leave and return directly to the everafter agreed the jackal head said a drop of saliva fell from a fang hissing as it flowed down the everafter between them never dropping the demons gaze piscary rubbed his big toe over the circle to break it algaliarept lunged out of the circle gasping i backpedaled a powerful hand reached out and grasped my throat stop piscary shouted my breath choked and i pried at the golden fingers it had three rings with blue stones all pinching my skin i swung to kick it and algaliarept shifted me higher to avoid my strike a wet sound escaped me drop her piscary demanded you cant have her until i get what i want ill get your information some other way the jackal said the rumble of its words joining the rushing sound of my blood my head felt as if it was going to explode i called you to get information from her piscary said if you kill her now you violate your summoning i want it now not next week or next year the fingers around my throat dissolved i dropped to the carpet gasping its sandals were made of leather and thick ribbons slowly i pulled my head up feeling my throat a reprieve only rachel mariana morgan the jackal head said its tongue moving in fantastic patterns as it spoke you will be warming my bed tonight i knelt before it sucking in air as i tried not to figure out how i could be warming its bed if i was dead you know i wheezed im really getting tired of this heart pounding i got to my feet it had agreed to a task it was susceptible to being summoned again algaliarept i said clearly i call you you dogfaced murdering son of a bitch piscarys face went slack in surprise and i swear algaliarept winked at me oh let me be the one in leather the jackal head said be afraid of him i like being him sure whatever i said knees shaking black leather driving gloves slit into existence over the amberskinned hands and the jackalheaded egyptian gods stance melted from a ramrod stiffness into a confidant slouch kisten took shape wearing headtotoe leather and thickheeled black boots there was a jingle of chain and a whiff of gasoline this is good the demon said showing a glint of fang as it slicked its blond hair back its passing hand leaving it showerwet and smelling of shampoo i thought it looked good too unfortunately exhaling slowly the image of kist bit its lower lip to make it redden a tongue slipping out to leave it with a wet shine a shudder went through me as i recalled how soft kists lips were as if reading my mind the demon sighed strong fingers reaching down its leather pants to draw my eyes to it a scratch melted into existence over its eye mirroring kists new wound damn vamp pheromones i whispered pushing the memory of the elevator away not this time algaliarept said smirking piscary was staring in confusion i summoned you you do what i say the image of kisten turned to piscary belligerently flipping him off and rachel mariana morgan summoned me too the witch and i have a preexisting debt to settle and if she has enough guile to win a circleless summoning from me then i will hold to it piscarys teeth ground together he lunged at us i gasped lurching back there was a wrenching sensation and i stared as piscary slammed into a wall of everafter falling in a shocked tangle of arms and legs i went cold as i realized algaliarept had put us in a circle of its own construction the thick haze of red pulsed and hummed pressing down against my skin though i was two feet away as piscary got to his feet and adjusted his robe i extended a finger and touched the barrier a sliver of ice shivered through me as the surface rippled it was the strongest thickest sheet of everafter id ever witnessed feeling algaliarepts eyes on me i pulled my hand back and wiped it on my jeans i didnt know you could do that i said and it chuckled in hindsight it made sense it was a demon it existed in the everafter of course it would know how and im willing to teach you how to survive manipulating as much everafter too rachel mariana morgan it said as if reading my mind for a price i shook my head later perhaps with a cry of frustrated rage piscary took a wireweave chair and slammed it against the barrier i jumped my mouth going dry algaliarept gave the incensed vampire a sideways glance as piscary ripped the leg off the chair and tried to pierce the barrier like a sword the demon took a belligerent stance at the edge of the circle showing me its tight butt in leather pants bugger off old man it mocked in kists fake accent infuriating piscary all the more the sun will be up soon youll have another chance at her in about three minutes my head came up three minutes was the sun that close to rising furious piscary threw the bar which skittered and rolled across the carpet his eyes black pits he began to make slow sedate circles about us in anticipation but for the moment i was safe in algaliarepts circle whats wrong with this picture forcing my arms down from the tight grip around myself i glanced at piscarys fake window seeing the glint of sun on the highest buildings three minutes i pushed my fingertips into my forehead if i ask you to kill piscary will you call us even i asked as i looked up it struck a sideways pose no even though killing ptah ammon fineas horton madison parker piscary is on my todo list it is still a request and would cost you not absolve your debt besides if you send me after him he will likely summon me again as you did and youd be right back where you started the only reason he cant summon me now is because we havent agreed on anything and were in summoning limbo so to speak it grinned and i looked away piscary stood and listened clearly thinking can you get me out of here i asked thinking of escape through a ley line yes but this time it will cost you your soul it licked its lips and then youre mine happy happy choices can you give me something to protect myself from him i pleaded getting desperate just as expensive it tugged its gloves tighter to its fingers and you already have what you need ticktock rachel mariana morgan anything that will save your life will require your soul piscary was grinning and my stomach turned as he came to a standstill eight feet away my eyes darted to my bag with the vial kist had given me it was out of reach on the wrong side of the barrier what should i ask for i cried desperately if i answer that you wont have enough left to pay for it love it breathed bending close and sending my curls drifting i jerked back as i smelled brimstone and youre a resourceful witch it added anyone who can ring the citys bells can survive a vampire even one as old as ptah ammon fineas horton madison parker piscary but im three stories down i protested i cant reach a ley line through that leather creaked as it circled me hands laced behind its back what will you do i swore under my breath past our circle piscary waited even if i managed to escape piscary would walk it wasnt as if i could ask algaliarept to testify eyes widening i looked up time i asked the vision of kist looked at its wrist and a watch twin to the one i had smashed with my meat tenderizer appeared about it one minute thirty my face went cold what do you want for you to testify in an is or fib courtroom that piscary is the witch serial killer algaliarept grinned i like the way you think rachel mariana morgan how much i shouted looking at the sun creeping down the side of the buildings my price hasnt changed i need a new familiar and its taking too long to get nicholas gregory sparagmoss soul my soul i couldnt do it even if it would satisfy algaliarept and ultimately save nick from losing his soul and being pulled into the everafter to be the demons familiar my face went slack and i stared at algaliarept so intently that it blinked in surprise i had an idea it was foolish and risky but maybe it was crazy enough to work ill voluntarily be your familiar i whispered not knowing if i could survive the energy it might pull through me or force me to hold for it ill freely be your familiar but i get to keep my soul maybe if i retained my soul it couldnt pull me into the everafter i could stay on this side of the ley lines it could use me only when the sun was down maybe the question was would algaliarept take the time to think it through and i want you to testify before my end of the agreement becomes enforceable i added in case i managed to survive voluntarily it said its form blurring at the edges even piscary looked shocked thats not how it works no one has ever willingly been a familiar before i dont know what that means it means im your damn familiar i shouted knowing that if it thought about it it would realize it was only getting half of me you say yes now or in thirty seconds either i or piscary is going to be dead and you will have nothing nothing do we have a deal or not the vision of kist leaned forward and i shirked away it looked at its watch voluntarily its eyes were wide in wonder and avarice in a wash of panic i nodded id worry about it later if i had a later done it said so quickly i thought for sure id made a mistake relief filled me then reality hit with a soulshaking slap god help me i was going to be a demons familiar i jerked back as it reached for my wrist we agreed it said snatching my arm with a vamp quickness i kicked it square in the stomach it did nothing rocking back with the transfer of momentum but otherwise unmoved a gasp slipped from me as it scratched a line across my demon mark blood flowed i jerked back and making shushing noises the demon bent its head over my wrist and blew on it i tried to pull away but it was stronger than me i was sick of the blood of everything it let me go and i fell back sliding down the arch of its barrier feeling my back tingle immediately i looked at my wrist there were two lines where one had once been the new one looked as old as the first it didnt hurt this time i said too strungout to be shocked it wouldnt have hurt the first time had you not tried to stitch it up what you felt was the fiber burning away im a demon not a sadist algaliarept piscary shouted as our agreement was sealed too late the grinning demon said and disappeared i fell backward as its barrier vanished from behind me shrieking as piscary lunged bracing myself against the floor i brought my legs up into him flipping him over me i scrambled for my bag and the vial my hand dove into my bag and piscary jerked me back witch he hissed gripping my shoulder ill have what i want and then youll die go to hell piscary i snarled thumbing the vial open with a soft pop and throwing it into his face crying out piscary violently pushed away from me from the floor i watched him lurch away wiping at his face with frantic motions heart in my throat i waited for him to fall waited for him to pass out he did neither my gut tightened in fear as piscary wiped his face bringing his fingers to his nose kisten he said his disgust melting into a weary disappointment oh kisten not you i swallowed hard its harmless isnt it he met my eyes you dont think i survived this long by telling my children what can really kill me do you i had nothing left for three heartbeats i stared his lips curved into an eager smile i jerked into motion piscary casually reached out and grabbed my ankle as i tried to rise i fell kicking out managing to hit his face twice before he pulled me to him and immobilized me under his weight the scar on my neck gave a pulse and fear surged through it making a nauseating mix no piscary said softly pinning me to the carpet you will be in pain for this his fangs were bared saliva dripped from them i struggled for air trying to get out from under him he shifted holding my left arm over my head my right arm was free teeth gritted i went for his eyes piscary jerked back with a vamp strength he grasped my right arm and snapped it my scream echoed against the high ceilings my back arched and i gasped for air piscarys eyes flashed black tell me if kalamack has a viable sample he demanded lungs heaving i tried to breathe the wave of misery thrummed from my arm and echoed in my head go to hell i rasped still pinning me to the carpet he squeezed my broken arm i writhed as agony sang through me every nerve ending pulsed into a burn a guttural sound escaped me pain and determination i wouldnt tell him i didnt even know the answer he leaned his weight onto my arm and i screamed again so i wouldnt go insane fear made my skull hurt as piscarys eyes flashed into hunger his instinctive need had risen high triggered by my struggles the black of his eyes swelled i heard my sounds of pain as if outside my head silver sparkles from shock started between me and piscarys eyes and my cries turned to relief i was going to pass out thank you god piscary saw it too no he whispered his tongue making a quick pass over his teeth to catch the saliva before it fell im better than that he took his weight from my arm a groan came from me as the agony dulled to a throb he leaned to put his face inches from mine watching my pupils with a cool detachment as the sparkles disappeared and my focus returned under his impassivity was a growing excitement if he hadnt already sated his hunger with ivy he wouldnt have been able to keep from draining me he knew the instant my will returned smiling in anticipation taking a breath i spit in his face tears mixing with my saliva piscary closed his eyes his expression showing a tired irritation he let go of my left wrist to wipe his face i swung the heel of my hand up to smash it into his nose he caught my wrist before it hit fangs glinting he held my arm my eyes traveled down the scratch he had cut in me to invoke the amulet my heart gave a hard pound a ribbon of blood trailed slowly to my elbow a drop of red swelled quivered and fell to land upon my chest warm and soft my breath was shaking i stared waiting his tension rose his muscles tightening as he lay atop me his gaze was fixed to my wrist another drop fell feeling heavy against me no i shrieked as a carnal groan slipped from him i see now he said his voice terrifyingly soft harnessed need pulsing under it no wonder algaliarept took so long finding out what frightens you pinning my arm to the floor he leaned closer until our noses lay side by side i couldnt move i couldnt breathe youre afraid of desire he whispered tell me little witch what i want to know or i will slice you open filling your veins with me making you my plaything but i will let you remember your freedommine forever go to hell i said terrified he eased back to see my face it was hot where his robe had shifted and his skin touched mine i will start here he said pulling my dripping arm to where i could see it no i protested my voice was soft and frightened i couldnt help it i tried to bring my arm closer but piscary had it tight he pulled my arm in a slow controlled motion as i fought to keep it unmoving my broken arm sent surges of nausea through me as i tried to use it pushing at him with the strength of a kitten god no god no i screamed redoubling my struggles as he tilted his head and sent his tongue across my elbow moaning as he cleaned it his tongue moving slowly to where the blood flowed freely if his saliva reached my veins i would be his forever i wiggled i thrashed the warm wetness of his tongue was replaced with the cool sharpness of teeth grazing but not piercing tell me he whispered tilting his head so he could see my eyes and ill kill you now instead of in a hundred years nausea bubbled up mixing with the darkness of insanity i bucked under him the fingers of my broken arm found his ear i tore at them reaching for his eyes i fought like an animal instinct a hazy mist between me and madness piscarys breath came in a harsh pant as my struggles and pain whipped him into a frenzy of restraint id seen in ivy far too often oh the hell with it he said his flowing voice cutting through me im going to drain you i can find out some other way i may be dead but im still a man no i shrieked but it was too late piscarys lips pulled back forcing my bleeding arm to the floor his head tilted to reach my neck the haze of pain swelled into ecstasy as he ground his fingers into my broken arm i screamed into his moan of anticipation a distant boom of sound struck through me and the floor trembled i spasmed the warm rapture of my arm shocking into a breathless feeling of pain the sound of men shouting filtered in through the haze of nausea they wont reach us in time piscary murmured theyre too late for you not like this i thought out of my mind in fear and cursing the stupidity of it all i didnt want to die like this he bent to me his face savage with hunger i took a last breath it exploded from me as a green ball of everafter smashed into piscary i wiggled in the minuscule shifting of weight still on me piscary snarled and looked up my arm was free and i wedged my knees between us tears blurred my vision as i fought with renewed desperation someone was there someone was there to help me another blast of green smashed into piscary he rocked back i got a leg under me and levered us up flipping piscary off me scrabbling to my feet i grabbed a chair and swung it hit him the shock echoing up my arm piscary turned his face savage he tensed gathering himself to leap at me i backpedaled my broken arm clutched tight to me a third blast of green everafter hissed past me hitting piscary and sending him flying backward into a wall i spun to the distant elevator quen the man stood beside a huge hole in the wall beside the elevator in a cloud of dust a growing ball of everafter in his hand still red but taking on the tinges of his aura he must have had the energy stored in his chi since we were too deep underground to reach a line a black satchel sat beside his feet several wooden swordlike stakes extending out from the open zipper beyond the hole was the stairway its about time you got here i panted staggering i got caught behind a train he said his hands moving in ley line magic bringing the fib into this was a mistake i wouldnt have had to if your boss wasnt such a prick i shouted then took a shallow breath trying not to cough at the dust kisten had taken my note how did the fib get there if quen didnt bring them piscary had regained his feet he took us in showing his fangs in a wide smile and now elf blood i havent fed this well since the turn with a vamps speed he raced across the large room to quen backhanding me in passing i was flung backward my back hit the wall and i slumped to the floor dazed and hovering on the edge of unconsciousness i watched quen evade piscary looking like a shadow in his black bodysuit he had a wooden stake the length of my arm in one hand a growing ball of everafter in the other the latin spilled from him the words of the black charm burning themselves into my mind the back of my head throbbed nausea flooded me as i touched a spot of agony but i found no blood the black spots before me cleared as i got to my feet dazed i looked for my bag of charms through the haze of walldust a masculine cry of agony jerked my attention to quen my heart seemed to stop piscary had caught him holding him like a lover piscary was fastened to his neck supporting both their weights quen went slack and the wooden sword fell to the floor his shriek of pain swelled into a moan of ecstasy using the wall for support i got to my feet piscary i shouted and he turned his mouth red with quens blood wait your turn he snarled showing me his redsmeared teeth i was here first i said angry he dropped quen if he had been hungry nothing would have moved him from downed prey quens arm lifted weakly he didnt get up i knew why it felt too good you dont know when to leave well enough alone piscary said coming at me latin fell from me burned into my mind from quens attack my hands moved etching black magic my tongue swelled at the taste of tinfoil i stretched for a ley line not finding it piscary slammed into me i gasped unable to breathe he was on me again reaching in the fear something broke a flood of everafter flowed into me i heard my scream at the shock of the unexpected influx of power gold laced with black and red burst from my hands piscary lifted from me he crashed into a wall shaking the lights i pulled myself up as he slumped on the floor realizing where the energy had come from nick i cried in fear oh god nick im sorry i had pulled on a line through him i had pulled the energy through him as if he had been a familiar it had raced through him as it had me i had pulled more than he could handle what had i done piscary was slumped where the wall met the floor his foot shifted and he swung his head up his eyes werent focused but they were black with hatred i couldnt let him get up racked in pain i grabbed the leg of the chair piscary had torn free and staggered across the room he lurched to his feet supporting himself with a hand against the wall his robe was almost undone his eyes suddenly focused i gripped the metal rod in one hand like a bat pulling it back even as i ran this is for trying to kill me i said swinging the bar of metal hit him behind the ear with a sodden smack piscary staggered but didnt go down my breath came in an angry sound this is for raping ivy i shouted my anger at him for hurting something so strong and vulnerable giving me strength i swung grunting in effort the metal rod met the back of his skull with the sound of a melon i stumbled catching my balance piscary fell to his knees blood seeped from his scalp and this i said feeling my eyes grow hot and my vision blur from tears is for killing my dad i whispered with a cry of anguish i swung a third time it smacked into piscarys head spinning from the momentum i fell to my knees my hands stung and the rod slipped from my senseless grip piscarys eyes rolled up and he dropped breath sounding like sobs i looked at him and wiped the back of my hand across my cheek he wasnt moving i looked past my hair at the fake window the sun was up shining on the buildings he would probably stay down until nightfall probably kill him quen croaked i pulled my head up id forgotten he was there quen had risen a hand against his neck the blood seeping through his fingers made an ugly pattern on the white carpet he threw a second wooden sword at me kill him now i caught it as if i had been catching swords my entire life trembling i turned its point into the carpet and used it to get up shouts and calls were coming from the hole in the wall the fib had arrived late as usual im a runner i said my throat sore and my words rough i dont kill my marks i bring them in alive then youre a fool i lurched to an overstuffed chair before i fell down dropping the sword i put my head between my knees and stared at the carpet you kill him then i whispered knowing he could hear me quen moved unsteadily to his satchel by the ragged hole in the wall i cant im not here the puff of air that escaped me hurt i looked up as he crossed the room to me his steps slow and careful he took the sword from the floor jamming it into in his duffle bag with a bloody hand i thought i saw a gray square of explosive in there too telling me how he had blown a hole in the wall he looked tired his lanky stature hunched in pain his neck didnt look bad but id rather be in traction for six months than have one salivalaced bite from piscary quen was an inderlander and so couldnt be turned vampire but by the look of fear edging his veneer of confidence he knew he might be tied to piscary with a vampire that old the bond might last a lifetime time would tell how much binding saliva if any piscary had laced the bite with sahan is wrong about you he said wearily if you cant survive a vampire without help your value is questionable and your unpredictability makes you unreliable and therefore unsafe quen gave me a nod before he turned and headed for the stairway i watched him go my mouth hanging open sahan is wrong about me i thought sarcastically well goodie for trent my hands hurt the palms red with what looked like firstdegree burns eddens voice in the stairway was loud the fib could take care of piscary i could go home home to ivy i thought closing my eyes briefly how did my life get this ugly tired beyond belief i got to my feet as edden and a string of fib officers exploded out of the hole quen had made its me i croaked putting my good hand in the air since there was a frightening clatter of safeties going off dont shoot me morgan edden peered through the sifting dust and lowered his weapon only half the fib officers did the same it was a better than average number youre alive he sounded surprised bent in pain i looked down at myself my broken arm clutched close yeah i think so i started shivering cold someone snickered and the remaining weapons were lowered edden made a motion and the officers fanned out piscary is over there i said looking that way hes down until sunset i think coming closer edden eyed piscary his robe fallen open to show a good portion of muscular thigh what was he trying to do seduce you no i whispered so my throat wouldnt hurt so much he was trying to kill me i met his eyes and added there is a living vamp named kisten around somewhere hes blond and angry please dont shoot him other than him and quen i havent seen anyone but the eight living vamps upstairs you can shoot them if you want mr kalamacks security officer eddens gaze roved over me cataloging my hurts he came with you he put a hand on my shoulder to steady me it looks like your arm is broken it is i said jerking back as he reached for it why do people do that and yeah he came out here why didnt you suddenly angry i poked him in the chest you ever refuse to take my call again and i swear ill have jenks pix you every night for a month arrogance crossed eddens face and he flicked a glance at the fib officers warily circling piscary someone called for an is ambulance i didnt refuse your call i was asleep being woken up by a frantic pixy and a panicking boyfriend telling me you went out to stake one of cincinnatis master vampires is not my favorite way to wake up and who gave you my unlisted number oh god nick the remembered burst of ley line energy id pulled through him made my face go cold nick i stammered i have to call nick but as i looked over the room for my bag and the phone in it i hesitated quens blood was gone all of it i guess quen was serious about not wanting any evidence that he was here how had he done that a little elven magic perhaps mr sparagmos is in the parking lot edden said peering at me and my cold face he snagged a passing officer get me a blanket shes going shocky numb i let him help me across the room and the hole in the wall poor guy passed out he was so worried about you i wouldnt let him or jenks out of the car eyes alight in a sudden thought he reached for the radio on his belt tell mr sparagmos and jenks that we found her and shes all right he said into it getting a garbled answer back taking my elbow he muttered please tell me you didnt really leave a note on your door saying you were going to stake piscary my eyes were fixed upon my bag with its pain amulet clear across the room but my head snapped up at his words no i protested as my vision swam at the quick movement i said i was going to talk to him and that he was the witch hunter kisten must have done that because my note is here somewhere i saw it kisten had replaced my note i stumbled in confusion as edden pulled me forward kisten had replaced my note giving nick the only number that would bring the fib out here why had it been to help me or simply to cover his betrayal of piscary kisten edden questioned thats the living vamp you dont want me to shoot right he took the blue fib blanket someone held out and draped it over my shoulders come on i want to get you upstairs we can figure this out later leaning heavily on him i tugged the blanket closer wincing as the rough wool hurt my hands i wouldnt look at them thinking they were nothing compared to the smut on my soul for having invoked that black charm quen had taught me i took a slow breath what did it matter if i knew black charms i was going to be a demons familiar my god morgan edden said as he put the twoway back on his belt did you have to blow a hole in his wall i didnt i said focusing on the carpet three feet in front of me it was quen more officers clattered down the stairs and into the room a hoard of official presences suddenly making me feel like an alien rachel quen isnt here yeah i said shivering violently as i looked over my shoulder at the pristine carpet i probably imagined it all the adrenaline was gone and fatigue and nausea pulled at me people were moving quickly around us making me dizzy my arm was a solid ache i wanted my bag and the pain amulet in it but we were moving in the wrong direction and it looked as if someone had dropped an evidence card by it swell my mood darkened even further when a woman in an fib uniform stopped us short by dangling my gun in front of edden it was in an evidence bag and i couldnt stop my hand from reaching out hey my splat gun i said and edden sighed not sounding at all happy tag it he said his voice laced with guilt put ms morgan as a positive id the woman looked almost frightened as she nodded and turned away hey i protested again and edden kept me from following her sorry rachel its evidence he ran a quick look over the surrounding officers before whispering but thanks for leaving it where we could find it glenn couldnt have downed those living vamps without it but i stammered seeing the woman disappear upstairs with my splat gun the dust was worse here and i swallowed hard so i wouldnt cough and make myself pass out lets go edden said sounding tired as he tried to pull me forward i hate to do this but i should get a statement from you before piscary wakes up and presses charges presses charges for what i jerked out of his grip refusing to move what in hell was going on i had just tagged the witch hunter and i was the one being arrested the nearby officers were carefully listening and eddens round face went even more guilty for assault and battery slander trespassing illegal entry malicious destruction of private property and whatever else his preturn lawyer can come up with what did you think you were doing coming down here and trying to kill him i struggled to speak affronted i didnt kill him though he by god deserves it he raped ivy to get me to come here so he could kill me because i found out he was the witch hunter i reached up with my good hand as if it could sooth the raw ache of my throat from the outside and i have a witness willing to testify that piscary contracted it to kill the victims is that enough for you eddens brow rose it he turned to look at piscary surrounded by nervous fib officers until the is ambulance got there which it would that be you dont want to know i closed my eyes i was going to be a demons familiar but i was alive i hadnt lost my soul focus on the positive can i go i asked as i saw the first of the stairs past the hole in the wall i had no idea how i was going to make it up all of them maybe if i let edden arrest me they would carry me up not waiting for his permission i pulled away and held my arm close as i limped to the ragged hole in the wall i had just tagged cincinnatis most powerful vampire as a serial murderer and all i wanted to do was throw up edden took a step to catch up still not having answered me can i at least have my boots i asked as i saw gwen taking pictures of them carefully making her way through the room her video camera recording everything the fib captain started looking down at my feet you always tag master vampires in your bare feet only when theyre in their pjs i clutched the blanket around myself miserably want to keep it sporting you know eddens round face broke into a grin hey gwen knock it off he said loudly as he took my elbow and helped me wobble to the stairs this isnt a crime scene its an arrest twentynine hey here i shouted sitting straighter on the hard ballpark seat and waving to get the attention of the wandering vendor it was almost a good forty minutes before the game was scheduled to start and though the stands were starting to fill the vendors werent very attentive i squinted and held up four fingers as he turned and he held up eight in return i winced eight bucks for four hot dogs i thought passing my money down oh well it wasnt as if i had bought the tickets thanks rachel glenn said from beside me as the paperwrapped package hit his hand thrown by the vendor he set it on his lap and caught the rest since my arm was in a sling and obviously not working he handed one to his dad and jenks on his left the next he gave to me and i passed it to nick on my other side nick flashed me a thin smile immediately looking down to where the howlers were warming up my shoulders slumped and glenn leaned closer under the excuse of unwrapping my hot dog and handing it to me give him some time i said nothing my gaze riveted to the highly manicured ballpark though nick wouldnt admit it a new ribbon of fear had slid between us wed had a painful discussion last week where i had apologized profusely for having pulled such a massive amount of ley line energy through him and told him it had been an accident he insisted that it was all right that he understood that he was glad i had done it since it saved my life his words were earnest and heartfelt and i knew to the depths of my soul he believed them but he would only rarely meet my eyes anymore and he worked hard to keep from touching me as if to prove nothing had changed he had insisted on our usual weekend sleepover last night it had been a mistake the dinner conversation was stilted at best how was your day dear fine thank you how was yours we followed that with several hours of tv where i sat on the couch and he sat on the chair across the room i had hoped for some improvement after retiring at an ungodly early one oclock in the morning but he pretended to fall asleep right away setting me almost to tears when he moved away from the touch of my foot the night was brilliantly capped off at four in the morning when he woke from a sound sleep in a nightmare he all but panicked when he found me in bed with him i had quietly excused myself and took the bus home saying that as long as i was up i should make sure ivy got home all right and that id see him later he hadnt stopped me he sat on the edge of his bed with his head in his hands and hadnt stopped me i squinted into the bright afternoon sun sniffing back any hint of tears it was the sun thats all i took a bite of hot dog it seemed to take a lot of effort to chew and it sat heavy in my middle when i finally swallowed below the howlers called and threw the ball about setting the hot dog down on the paper wrapping across my lap i took up a baseball in my injured hand my lips moved in unvoiced latin as i quietly sketched a complex figure with my good left hand the fingers about the ball tingled as i said the last word of the charm a melancholy satisfaction stirred me as the pitchers throw went wild the catcher stood to reach it hesitating in question before he returned to his crouch jenks rubbed his wings together to get my attention giving me a merry thumbsup for the bit of ley line magic i returned his grin with a weak smile the pixy was sitting on captain eddens shoulder so he could see better the two had mended their fences over a conversation about country western singers and a night out at a karaoke bar i didnt want to know really edden followed jenkss attention to me his eyes behind his roundframed glasses suddenly suspicious jenks distracted him by loudly extolling the features of a trio of women headed up the concrete steps the squat mans face reddened but the smile remained grateful i turned to glenn finding he had already finished his hot dog i should have gotten him two hows piscarys court case shaping up i asked the tall man shifted in his seat with a bound excitement as he wiped his fingers off on his jeans out of his suit and tie he looked like another person the sweatshirt emblazoned with the howlers logo making him appear comfortable and safe with your demons testimony i think its reasonably secure he said ive been waiting for a surge in violent crimes but theyve dropped he glanced at his dad im thinking the lesser houses are waiting until piscary is officially incarcerated before they start vying for his territory they wont my fingers and words sent another ball clean out of the park with a boost of everafter energy it was harder to gather the power from the nearby line the parks safeguards were kicking in kisten is handling piscarys affairs i said sourly its business as usual kisten he leaned closer hes not a master vamp wont that cause problems nodding i sent a pop fly to bounce wrong the players became slow with tension as it hit the wall and rolled in an odd direction glenn had no idea how much trouble it was going to be ivy was piscarys scion by unwritten vamp law she was in charge whether she wanted to be or not it put the retired is runner in a huge moral dilemma caught between her vampire responsibilities and her need to be true to herself she was ignoring piscarys summons to his jail cell along with a lot of other things that were quietly building hiding behind the excuse that everyone thought kist was still piscarys scion she did nothing claiming that kisten had the clout if not the physical presence to hold everything together it didnt look good but i wasnt about to advise her to start handling piscarys affairs not only had she devoted her life to bringing in those who broke the law but shed snap while trying to best the pull of blood and domination such a position would magnify seeing no more comments forthcoming glenn crumbled his paper and dropped it into a coat pocket so rachel he said glancing at the empty seat beside nick how is your roommate better i took another bite shes handling it i said around my full mouth she would have come today but the sun really bothers herlately lots of things bothered her since having glutted herself on piscarys blood the sun too much noise not enough noise the lack of speed of her computer the pulp in her orange juice the fish in her bathtub until jenks took it out back and had a fish fry to boost his kids protein levels before fall hibernation she had been violently ill after returning from midnight church services this morning but she wouldnt stop going she told me it would help keep space between her and piscary mental space apparently time and distance were enough to break the bond a lesser vamp could put on another with a bite but piscary was a master vampire the bond would last until piscary wanted it ended slowly ivy and i were finding a new balance when the sun was high and bright she was ivy my friend and partner cheerful with her dry sarcastic humor as we thought up practical jokes to play on jenks or discussed possible improvements to the church to make it more livable after sunset she left so i wouldnt see what the night did to her now she was strong in the sunlight a cruel goddess after sunset balanced on the edge of helplessness in the battle she fought against herself uncomfortable with my thoughts i pulled on the ley line and sent a pitched ball wild to smack into the wall behind the catcher rachel captain edden said his eyes behind his glasses taking on a hard look as he leaned past his son to see me let me know if she wants to talk to piscary id be glad to look the other way if she wants to smack him around he eased back as i gave him a wan smile piscary had been extradited to is custody safe and sound in a vamp jail cell the preliminary hearing had gone well the sensationalism of the situation prompting an unexpected opening in the court docket algaliarept showed up to prove he was a reliable witness the demon made all the papers morphing into all sorts of figures to scare the pants off everyone in the courtroom what disturbed me most was that the judge was afraid of a little towheaded girl with a lisp and a limp i think the demon enjoyed it i adjusted my red howlers hat against the sun as a batter came to the mound to pop a few into the infield hot dog in my lap i shifted my fingers and mouthed the incantation the parks safeguards had risen higher and i had to punch a hole through them to reach the line a sudden influx of everafter coursed through me and nick stiffened excusing himself he slid past me muttering about the bathroom his lanky form hastened down the steps and vanished unhappy i sent the everafter energy into the pitchers throw there was a sharp crack as the bat broke the batter dropped the shattered ash swearing loud enough that i could hear him he turned to look at the stands in accusation the pitcher put his mitt on his hip the catcher stood my eyes narrowed in satisfaction as the coach whistled pulling everyone in nice one rache jenks said and captain edden started giving me a questioning look that you he asked and i shrugged youre going to get yourself banned maybe they should have paid me i was being careful no one was getting hurt i could make their runners twist their ankles and the wild throws hit players if i wanted i wasnt i was just messing with their warmup i poked about in the napkin the hot dog had been wrapped in where was my ketchup packet this hot dog was utterly tasteless the fib captain moved uneasily ah about your compensation morgan forget it i offered quickly i figure i still owe you for paying off my is contract no he said we had an agreement its not your fault the class was canceled glenn can i have your ketchup i said brusquely cutting edden off i dont know how you people can eat hot dogs without it why the turn didnt that guy give me any ketchup edden leaned back a heavy sigh slipping from him glenn obediently shuffled about his wad of paper until he came up with a white plastic packet face drawn he looked at my broken arm and hesitated illuhopen it for you he offered thanks i muttered not liking being helpless trying not to scowl i watched the detective carefully tear open the packet he handed it to me and with the hot dog balanced on my lap i awkwardly squeezed the ketchup out so intent was i on getting it on the right spot i almost missed glenn raising his hand and surreptitiously licking a red smear off his fingers glenn i thought my face went slack as i remembered our missing ketchup and the pieces fell into place you i sputtered glenn had stolen our ketchup the mans face went panicked and he reached out almost covering my mouth before he drew back no he pleaded leaning close dont say anything you took our ketchup i breathed shocked beyond glenn i could see jenks rocking in mirth on eddens shoulder able to hear our whispers and keep up a running conversation to distract the fib captain at the same time glenn shot a guilty look at his dad ill pay you for it he begged anything you want just dont tell my dad oh god rachel it would kill him for a moment i could only stare he had taken our ketchup right off our table i want your handcuffs i said suddenly i cant find anything real without fake purple fur glued to it his panicked look eased and he shifted back monday soon enough for me my words were calm but inside i was singing i was going to get my cuffs back it was going to be a good day he darted a guilty look toward his dad will youget me a bottle of spicy my eyes jerked to his maybe some barbecue sauce i closed my mouth before a bug flew into it sure i did not believe this i was pimping ketchup to the son of the fibs captain i looked up to see a park official wearing a red polyester vest loping up the stairs toward us scanning the faces a smile curved over me as he met my eyes he worked his way down the relatively empty aisle in front of us as i wrapped up what was left of my hot dog and set it on nicks seat then dropped the baseball into my bag out of sight it had been fun while it lasted i wasnt going to interfere with the game but they didnt know that jenks flitted from captain edden to me he was wearing all red and white in honor of the team the brightness hurting my eyes oooooh he mocked youre in trouble now edden gave me one last warning look before putting his attention on the field clearly trying to divorce himself from me lest they kick him out too ms rachel morgan the young man in the red vest questioned as he reached us i stood with my bag yes im matt ingle park ley line security could you come with me please glenn got to his feet standing with his feet spread wide and his hands on his hips is there a problem he asked turning the angryyoungblackman mien on high i was too thrown by him liking ketchup to get angry at him wanting to protect me matt shook his head not cowed at all no sir the howlers owner heard about ms morgans efforts to retrieve their mascot and would like to speak with her id be happy to talk to her i said as jenks chortled his wings turning a bright red despite captain edden keeping my name out of the paper the entirety of cincinnati and the hollows knew who had solved the witch hunter murders made the tag and summoned the demon into the courtroom my phone was ringing off the hook with requests for help overnight i had gone from struggling entrepreneur to badass runner what did i have to fear from the owner of the howlers im coming with you glenn said i can handle this i said mildly affronted i know but i want to talk to you and i think theyre going to kick you out of the park edden chuckled shifting his squat bulk deeper into the hard seat taking a key chain from his front pocket he handed it to glenn you think i said waving bye to jenks and telling him with a finger motion and a nod that id see him back at the church the pixy nodded settling himself back on captain eddens shoulder hooting and hollering having too much fun to leave glenn and i followed the ley line security guy to a waiting golf cart and he drove us deeper into the stadium it grew cool and quiet the thrum of the unseen thousands around us a low almost subliminal thunder far into the authorized personnel areas and amid black suits and champagne matt stopped the cart glenn helped me out and i took my cap off handing it to him as i fluffed my hair i was dressed nice in jeans and white sweater but everyone id seen in the last two minutes was wearing a tie or diamond earrings some had both matt looked nervous as he took us up an elevator and left us in a long plush room that overlooked the field it was comfortably full of talk and nicely dressed people the faint smell of musk tickled my nose glenn tried to give me my hat back and i motioned for him to keep it ms morgan a small woman said excusing herself from a group of men i am so glad to meet you im mrs sarong she said as she approached her hands extended she was shorter than me and clearly a were her dark hair was graying in wispy streaks that looked good on her and her hands were small and powerful she moved with a predatory grace that drew attention her eyes seeing everything were men had to work hard to hide their rough edges were women got more dangerouslooking im pleased to meet you i said as she briefly touched my shoulder in greeting since my right arm was in a sling this is detective glenn of the fib maam he said shortly and the small woman smiled to show flat even teeth delighted she said pleasantly if you would excuse us detective ms morgan and i have a need to chat before the game begins glenn bobbed his head yes maam ill get you both a drink if i might that would be lovely i rolled my eyes at the political niceties relieved when mrs sarong put a light hand on my shoulder and led me away she smelled like ferns and moss every man watched us as we moved together to stand by a window with an excellent view of the field it was a long way down making me slightly queasy ms morgan she said her eyes not at all apologetic it has just come to my attention that you were contracted to retrieve our mascot a mascot that was never missing yes maam i said surprised how the title of respect just seemed to flow out of me when i was told my time and energies were given no consideration she exhaled slowly i detest digging out prey have you been magicking the field pleased at her frankness i decided to be the same i spent three days planning how to break into mr rays office when i could have been working on other cases i said and while i admit that isnt your fault someone should have called me perhaps but it remains that the fish was not missing i am not in the habit of paying out blackmail you will stop and im not in the habit of offering it i said having no trouble keeping my temper as her pack surrounded me but id be remiss if i didnt make you aware of my feelings in the matter i give my word i wont interfere with the game i dont need to until i get paid every time a ball goes foul or a bat cracks your players will wonder if its me i smiled without showing my teeth five hundred dollars is a small price for your players peace of mind lousy five hundred dollars it should have been tentimes that why rays henchmen wasted bullets on me for a lousy stinking fish was still beyond me her lips parted and i swear i heard a small growl in her sigh athletes were notorious for being superstitious shed pay its not the money mrs sarong i said though at first it had been but if i let one pack treat me like a cur then thats what ill be and im not a cur she brought her gaze up from the field not a cur she agreed you are a lone wolf with a graceful motion she motioned to a nearby were one that looked oddly familiar in fact he hastened forward with a leatherbound checkbook the size of a bible which took two hands to handle its the lone wolf that is the most dangerous she said as she wrote they also have extremely short life spans get yourself a pack ms morgan the rip of the check was loud i wasnt sure if she was giving me advice or a threat thank you i have one i said not looking at the amount as i tucked it in my bag the smooth shape of the baseball touched my knuckles and i pulled it out i set it into her waiting hand ill leave before the game starts i said knowing there was no way they would let me back in the stands how long am i banned for life she said smiling like the devil herself i too am not a cur i smiled back genuinely liking the older woman glenn drifted closer i took the champagne he handed me and set it on the windowsill goodbye mrs sarong she inclined her head as way of dismissal the second flute of champagne glenn had brought resting easy in her grip three young men lurked behind her sulky and wellgroomed i was glad i didnt have her job though it looked as if the perks were great glenns shoes sounded loud on the concrete as we made our way back to the front gate without the help of matt and his golf cart youll tell everyone goodbye for me i asked meaning nick sure his eyes were on the huge signs with their letters and arrows pointing to the exits the sun was warm when we found it and i relaxed as i went to stand at the bus stop glenn came to a halt beside me and handed me my hat about your fee he started glenn i said as i put it on like i told your dad dont worry about it im grateful for them paying off my is contract and with the two thousand trent gave me ive enough to see me through until my arm heals would you shut up he said digging in his pocket we worked something out i turned my gaze dropping to the key in his hands and then rising to his eyes we couldnt get approval to reimburse you for the canceled class but there was this car in impound the insurance agency salvaged the title so we couldnt put it up for auction a car edden was going to give me a car glenns brown eyes were bright we got the clutch and the transmission repaired there was something wrong with the electrical system too but the fib garage guys fixed it no charge we would have gotten it to you sooner he said but the dmv office didnt understand what i was trying to do so it took three trips down there to get it transferred to your name you guys bought me a car i said excitement bubbling up into my voice glenn grinned and handed me a zebrastriped key on a purple rabbits foot key chain the money the fib put into it just about equals what we owed you ill drive you home its a stick and i dont think you can handle shifting gears yet with your arm heart suddenly pounding i fell into step beside him scanning the lot which one glenn pointed and the sound of my heels on the pavement faltered as i saw the red convertible recognizing it thats franciss car i said not sure what i was feeling thats okay isnt it glenn asked suddenly concerned it was going to be scrapped you arent superstitious are you um i stammered drawn forward by the shiny red paint i touched it feeling the clean smoothness the top was down and i turned smiling glenns worried frown eased into relief thank you i whispered not believing it was really mine it was mine steps light i walked to the front then the back it had a new vanity plate runnin it was perfect its mine i said heart racing go on get in glenn said his face transformed by his pleased enthusiasm its wonderful i said refusing to cry no more expired bus passes no more standing in the cold no more disguise charms just so they would pick me up i opened the door the leather seat was warm from the afternoon sun and as smooth as chocolate milk the cheerful dinging of the door being opened was heaven i put in the key checked that it was in neutral pushed in the clutch and started it up the thrum of the engine was freedom itself i shut the door and beamed at glenn really i asked voice cracking he nodded beaming i was delighted with my broken arm i couldnt safely manage the gearshift but i could try all the buttons i turned on the radio thinking it must be an omen when madonna thundered out i turned material girl down and opened the glove box just to see my name on the registration a thick yellow businesssize envelope slid out and i picked it up off the floor i didnt put that there glenn said his voice carrying a new concern i brought it to my nose my face going slack as i recognized the clean scent of pine its from trent glenn straightened get out of the car he said in a hard staccato every syllable laced with authority dont be stupid i said if he wanted me dead he wouldnt have had quen bail me out jaw tight glenn opened the door my car started chiming get out ill have it looked at and bring it over tomorrow glenn i cajoled as i opened the envelope and my protests wavered um i stammered hes not trying to kill me hes paying me glenn leaned to see and i tilted the envelope to him a muttered oath came from him how much is that you think he asked as i closed it and shoved it in my bag im guessing eighteen thousand i tried to be cavalier ruining it with my trembling fingers it was what he offered me to clear his name brushing the hair from my eyes i looked up my breath caught visible in the rearview mirror was trents gray ghost limo sitting in the fire lane it hadnt been there a moment ago at least i hadnt seen it trent and jonathan were standing beside it glenn saw where my attention was and turned oh he said then a concerned wariness tightened the corners of his eyes rachel im going to go over to the ticket booth right over there he pointed and talk to the lady about possibly buying a block of seats for the fibs company picnic next year he hesitated shutting my door with a solid thump his dark fingers stood out against the bright red paint you going to be all right yeah i pulled my eyes from trent thanks glenn if he kills me tell your dad i loved the car a trace of a smile crossed him and he turned away my eyes were fixed to my rearview mirror as his steps grew faint behind me came a roar of fans as the game began i watched trent have an intent conversation with jonathan he left the angry tall man and ambled slowly to me his hands were in his pockets and he looked good better than good really dressed in casual slacks comfortable shoes and a cableknit sweater against the slight chill in the air the collar of a silk shirt the color of midnight showed behind it contrasting wonderfully with his tan a tweed cap shaded his green eyes and kept his fine hair under control he came to a slow halt beside me his eyes never leaving mine to touch upon the car even once feet scuffing he half turned to look at jonathan it stuck in my craw that i had helped clear his name he had murdered at least two people in less than six monthsone of them francis and here i was sitting in the dead witchs car i said nothing gripping the wheel with my one good hand my broken arm sitting in my lap reminding myself that trent was afraid of me from the radio a fasttalking announcer took over and i turned the radio almost off i found the money i said as way of greeting he squinted at me then shifted to stand by the side mirror to put his face in shadow youre welcome i peered up at him i never said thank you youre welcome anyway my lips pressed together ass trents eyes dropped to my arm how long until it heals surprised i blinked not long it was a clean break i touched the pain amulet about my neck there was some muscle damage though which is why i cant use it well yet but they say i dont need any therapy ill be back on the streets in six weeks good thats good it had been a quick commentand it was followed by a long silence i sat in my car wondering what he wanted there was a jittery cast to him his eyebrows a shade too high he wasnt afraid and he wasnt worried i couldnt tell what he wanted piscary said our fathers worked together i said was he lying the sun glinted on trents white hair as he shook his head no a sliver of ice dropped down my spine i licked my lips and brushed a spot of dust from the steering wheel doing what i asked casually come work for me and ill tell you my eyes went to his you are a thief a cheat a murderer and a notniceman i said calmly i dont like you he shrugged the motion making him look utterly harmless im not a thief he said and i dont mind manipulating you into working for me when i need it he smiled showing me perfect teeth i enjoy it actually i felt my face warm you are so full of yourself trent i said wishing i could shift the car into reverse and drive over his foot his smile widened what i demanded you called me by my first name i like that i opened my mouth then closed it so throw a party and invite the pope my dad may have worked for your dad but you are scum and the only reason im not throwing your money back in your face is a i earned it and b i need something to live on while i recover from injuries gained from keeping your ass out of prison his eyes were glinting in amusement and it made me furious thank you for clearing my name he said he went to touch my car stopping as i made an ugly noise in warning he turned the motion into seeing if jonathan had moved he hadnt glenn too was watching us just forget it okay i said i went after piscary to save my moms life not yours thank you anyway if it means anything im sorry now for putting you in that rat pit i tilted my head to see him holding the hair out of my face as the wind gusted and you think that means anything to me i said tightly then i squinted he was almost jiggling where he stood what was up with him scoot over he finally said looking at the empty seat beside me i stared at him what he looked past me to jonathan and back i want to drive your car scoot over jon never lets me drive he says its beneath me he looked over at glenn skulking beside a pillar unless you would rather have an fib detective drive you home at the posted speed limit surprise kept the anger out of my voice you can drive a stick better than you i looked at glenn then back to trent i slowly sank back into the seat tell you what i said my eyebrows rising you can drive me home if we keep to one topic on the way your father he guessed and i nodded i was getting used to this dealwithademon business trent put his hands back in his pockets and rocked back and forth once on his heels in thought bringing his attention from the blue sky he nodded i do not believe im doing this i muttered as i threw my bag in the back and awkwardly shifted over the gear stick to the other seat taking my red howlers cap off i wound my hair up into a bun and jammed the hat back on against the coming wind glenn had started forward slowing as i waved goodbye to him shaking his head as if in disbelief he turned and went back inside the ballpark i buckled my belt as trent opened the door and slid into the front he adjusted the mirrors then revved the engine twice before pushing in the clutch and shifting it into first i braced myself against the dash but he eased forward as smoothly as if he parked cars for a living while jonathan hurriedly got into the limo i snuck a glance at trent my eyes narrowed as he took it upon himself to fiddle with the radio while at a stoplight not moving even when it turned green i was ready to smack him for messing with my radio when he found a station playing takata and turned it up peeved i hit the set button the traffic signal changed from green to yellow and he sent the car leaping through the intersection slipping ahead of oncoming traffic amid squealing tires and horns teeth gritted i swore if he wrecked my car before i had a chance to id sue his ass i wont work for you again i said as he gave the irate drivers behind him a friendly wave and merged onto expressway traffic my anger hesitated as i realized he had intentionally sat through the green light so that jonathan would be forced to wait until it changed again i looked at trent in disbelief seeing my understanding he floored it a shiver of excitement struck me as he shot me a quick smile the wind pulling his short hair to hide the green of his eyes if that helps you sleep ms morgan please continue to believe so the wind tugged at me and i closed my eyes against the sun feeling the pavement hum all the way to my bones tomorrow id start thinking about how i was going to get

moving living vampires are either highbloodvampires conceived within a living vampire and therefore having an inactive vampire virus fixed into their fetal genome to modify their development or lowbloodhumans bitten by an undead and existing in a tenuous halfwayturned status only an undead vampire has the active form of the virus that can infect a human the virus happily settles itself within cells of the bloodproducing bone marrow of its new host and immediately goes dormant very little of the vampires abilities or liabilities are imparted to the hapless human bitten humans halfturned are at the bottom of the vampiric rung constantly currying the favor of their undead sires for a chance to ingest more of his or her blood in the hopes of achieving a higher level of vampire characteristics with their human teeth human frailties and lacking any blood lust but in their imaginations theyre little more than a willing source of blood to the undead and an object of hidden ridicule to the rest of inderland lowblood vampires rightly live in fear that the undead who feed on them will become careless and accidentally kill them conveniently forgetting to finish the job and bring them back as an undead and whereas a highblood vampire is born with status that he or she carries into vampiric death lowblood vampires must fight for theirs they can be very dangerous if they start to overcompensate becoming ruthless to measure up to their sires expectations just punch them in the gut and theyll fall like any other human the other extreme of the vampiric existence are the true undead these are the soulless alluring vampires who exist only to satisfy their carnal urges and its their incredible strength coupled with their utter disregard for life that makes them such a threat they experience no compassion or empathy yet retain all their memories they remember ties of love but they dont remember why they love its a dead emotion and in my limited experience it brings untold grief to the living they interact with and once cared for the liabilities of the undead are few and while they have lost their souls many dont consider that a drawback but a blessing if sanctified crosses can inflict real damage on undead tissue but its a charm that causes the hurt not a religious belief bringing out a cross will most likely only irritate a vampire not get him or her to back down so have something more potent to follow it up with in theory the charm to burn undead flesh can be put into any bit of redwood or silver but the magic is older than agriculture and those that craft the spellbe they human or witchinsist the charm wont stick to anything but a cross personally i wouldnt trust anything but a sanctified cross to distract a vampire in a tight situation ive found that unblessed artifacts of any religion are little more than a bother ticking off the undead with the reminder that because their soul has already moved on there will be nothing to carry their awareness to a higher plane when their body fails again undead vampires are intimately aware that if their body dies not only will their spark of life cease but that it will be as if it had never existed a thought intolerable to the immortalityseeking vampires its with the undead that light becomes a liability the virus that allows vampires to continue his or her existence after the loss of their soul is rendered inactive by light and they will undergo a sadly undramatic death however if the bigbadugly falls to the ground in anything less than full sunlight shoot em before you go see if he or she is really down theyll move if theyre still conscious trust me on thisdamn the paperwork and just shoot them twice only the undead are capable of bespelling an unwilling person luring them into a state of bliss by way of sophisticated pheromones this is perhaps the most dangerous aspect of the undead and should be treated with the utmost caution dont bother averting your eyes it wont help and only pushes a hungry vampires buttons fear is a blood aphrodisiac try not to make things worse fortunately unless you have pissed the undead off or are quivering in terror they will likely ignore you as a source of blood the undead are fastidious in choosing their blood partners and will generally target living vampires to avoid legal battles with humans a word of caution luring and betraying humans to their ruin with false promises gives the undead a feeling of lustful domination that stirs them almost as much as the blood try not to get involved the newly undead can be very cruel to those they dont fear or once loved but with time they regain a veneer of morality most attaining elegant social skills to beguile and charm its all the better to eat you with my dear so be careful a good rule of thumb is the nicer a vampire is the more depraved he or she can be as their sophistication grows an undead vampires lust for domination mixes equally with their desire for blood making the blood of the betrayed far sweeter than the blood of the merely stupid the older the vampire the longer and more emotionally devastating the hunt can be on the hunted the long hunt is a skill that even living vampires unconsciously practice caught between the living and the undead are the highblood living vampires existing in a state of grace most other vampires envy they embody the best of both worlds and are the cherished living children of the undead both protected and plagued loved and abused warped manipulated and coddled by the undead who hunt and feed upon them highblood living vampires are not bitten but born with the vampire virus already having molded them into a state of inbetween as a result highblood living vampires possess an increased strength and reflexes better hearing and an incredible sense of smell all of which fall between normal human and an undead vampire even more telling is that they can bespell the willing becoming deadly if their lust for blood overrides their other emotions fortunately the blood lust in a living highblood vampire doesnt kick in until puberty and even though they dont need blood to remain sane as the undead do the dormant virus does impart a craving for it you can spot living vampires by their magnetic personality and their sharp canines but dont rely on the teeth as they can be capped because the virus is fixed into their dna living highblood vampires are guaranteed to become an undead even if they die with every last drop of blood in them if you accidentally kill a living vampire be responsible and call an ambulance before the sun comes up they have the right to settle their affairs even if they might want to take you out later chances are good that if you apologize they may thank you for ending their first life living vampires possess rank based on bloodlines both living and dead sometimes stretching back generations this gives many of the more affluent living vampires a prince in waiting status honored by all wise vampires and should be honored by you a blood sire often charts the path of his living children with the careful study of breeding thoroughbreds so if you insult a living vampire you may hear about it from their master whether you agree with their lifestyle or not you should respect someone who was around at the signing of the declaration of independence through the generations living and undead vampires have evolved many ways to capture and keep a ready supply of companionship and blood most of which hinge on pheromones both consciously and unconsciously emitted supporting the pheromones is a veritable cocktail of neurotransmitters and endorphininducing compounds in the saliva of a vampire with any bite the compounds settle into the tissue surrounding the wound and when stimulated even years later may cause pain to be recognized as pleasure dont be fooled its a trap with experience a vampire can sensitize the bite so that they are the only vampire able to stimulate the scar effectively preventing easy poaching from another vampires stable the person is mentally bound to the vampire and is called a shadow a shadow belonging to a living vampire is generally cared for though theres a significant loss of will if bitten and left unbound theres no dependency upon any particular vampire and life can soon return to normal however if enough vampire saliva has been introduced into the wound the victim is left in a dangerous state where they are highly susceptible to vampire pheromones without the usual loss of will these unbound shadows are almost irresistible to a vampires blood lust and if not under a strong vampires protection theyre taken as fair game for any vampire unclaimed shadows have a very short life expectancy passed from vampire to vampire until they lose first their individuality and then their vitality dying alone and unmourned for better or worse vampires are here living among us but forever apart when on the streets knowledge is the ultimate weapon and its up to you to protect yourself from the dangers engendered by contact with vampires they will always be ready to play upon our desire for perfect love and the dangers that seeking out that perfect love in ignorance can lead to your death or worse i hope that i have frightened you enough to be careful and given you enough knowledge to realize that vampires are the ultimate predator of mind and body the danger lies in that theyre more human than human and for that they deserve our respect and understanding kim harrison ebook extras pixies and fairies yes there is a difference published in conjunction with cincinnatis fib inderland department fib inderlander handbook issue by rachel morga pixies and fairies have lived among humans for longer than any other inderland group but less is known about them than any of their larger kin for ages artists and poets have tried to capture the distinctions between them gained in glimpses ultimately falling short as both branches worked to preserve the truth of their existences now that they live among us openly its time to recognize the differences in these two highly inventive groups of citizens so that we may treat them with the respect they deserve to the uninformed pixies and fairies might be considered the same species with minor changes in size and wings nothing could be further from the truth and the easiest way to incur the anger of either of these resilient peoples is to say so pixies especially have an incredible culture and understanding this will lead to a greater appreciation of what motivates them pixies have dragonflylike wings and are slightly smaller than their fairy kin coming in at about four inches their faster metabolism and hard wings make them wickedly fast necessitating a diet of mainly nectar and pollen supplementing it with the odd bit of meat before hibernation a sustained temperature below fortyfive degrees fahrenheit will drop them into a torpid state that is unwise to break until spring they invariably marry for love and are said to die of heartache when their spouse passes on their life span is fifteen to twenty years largely hinging upon their living conditions children are born in twos or threes gestation being about six months depending on the season and the availability of food big families are indicative of a good provider and a nurturing mother giving the entire pixy clan status since it takes a large plot of land to support many children its not uncommon for the first year or two of children to be lost because of bad conditions and the inability to defend against encroaching fairies death during hibernation is another constant threat to the very young and very old but a pixy can expect a healthy life once they make it past the first few years tradition dictates that children are named after their father the eldest having short names the youngest given longer more elaborate titles children leave to start their own gardens when about nine shortly after puberty though if a parent is ailing an older child may assume responsibility of a successful garden when lured into paying jobs pixies use their natural talents to excel in surveillance camera maintenance and general sneaking around they will not work as gardeners for anyone but themselves though loyal and honest to a fault with those they respect will lie like the devil to those they dont and friendships mean more to them than life itself silver will burn pixies skin acting like a poison should it get into their blood system whereupon the survival rate drops to almost nil pixy dust is still much of an enigma but shedding dust is a sign of high emotions and can act as an irritant on human and inderland skin much like poison ivy a lesserknown aspect of pixy dust is its ability to clot blood an adaptation necessary for swordtoting gardeners who can afford little blood loss before going comatose most pixies live in the country since gardens sophisticated enough to support a growing clan are understandably scarce within city limits but once established an elaborate city garden is safer than one in the country and vigorously defended its the rare pixy who is attracted to the danger and excitement of living among people a hundred times larger than they are but the safety found within the city is often lure enough to risk starvation even cityliving pixies avoid people generally existing on the fringes as citizens without rights or responsibilities to the point where theyre actually considered an expense not an employee when working for the is they cannot hold property and have no legal rights its a situation that pixies promote preferring to swallow the indignities heaped upon them by their fellow inderlanders and humans so they can remain free to settle their much more pressing differences with fairies using a sword rather than in the humaninderlandrun courts pixies are in constant conflict for territory with the larger more aggressive fairies if you see a pixy wearing red theyre out of their territory and not looking for trouble its a sign of truce dont ask them to violate it youll likely get pixed and spend the rest of the day with a bad case of hives despite their small size and funloving peaceful appearance pixies will not hesitate to kill fairies in defense of people they care for or to defend their territory and theyre good at it their natural skills of subterfuge quickness and their mindset of putting their own beliefs above the law could lend itself to a life of crime but a pixy is at his or her best in the garden they could rule the world through fear if they wished but all a pixy desires is a small plot of land and the right to defend it ive never heard of a pixy harming a person other than making their life miserable in retaliation for a slight or insult in their minds were simply below notice not worth the risk of attracting a human or inderland court and changing the status quo fairies also keep to themselves but theyre far more likely to hire out for questionable jobs for large pay their small size and inwarddirected morals make them very effective assassins so dont mistake small with harmless they have butterflylike wings and a slower metabolism but their ability to float high unseen for long periods seems to be a good tradeoff for the faster but more calorically expensive flying that pixies are capable of fairies tend to shun cities as well but adolescents of both sexes will brave the streets to set up packs in parks or green spaces looking for adventure and a chance to prove themselves and earn the right to start a family might makes right is their mentality compared to the individual morals guiding pixies decisions being insectivores fairies often vie for the same space as pixies bringing the two species into conflict they could exist peacefully on the same territory but for a fairys tendency to ruin an area in search of food the balance of power is fairly equal with fairies being largercoming in at about six inchesbut slower fairies share pixies allergic reaction to silver and they migrate to mexico with monarch butterflies for the winter instead of hibernating not much is known about their home life as usually all but young males shun contact with anyone larger than they despite their small size pixies and fairies are potentially dangerous and can cause untold grief when insulted or slighted treat them with respect and these deservedly proud intelligent members of inderland will respond with professionalism and grace kim harrison ebook extras music as my inspiration okay a little explanation might be in order my muse exists in music logic maps the story but music gives it its soul and sends my characters in directions that surprise even me what im left with is an eclectic handful of songs thatin my thoughtsrelate to certain scenes or more typically relationships between characters some authors cast their books with popular actors or actresses which i do have some ideas about by the way but id rather cast the music as it connects more directly to my creative process below are a few of the songs i think suit the hollows rachel the songs ive found that i feel relate to rachel cover a wonderfully wide span most recently i found save yourself from stabbing westward passive off a perfect circles emotion is a good one too though im torn yet as to whom else it relates to a reader named dash suggested magic carpet ride by steppenwolf and though he didnt mention rachel i think it fits her pretty well id be willing to make it her theme song for a while grin as her story progresses nine inch nails down in it has a special meaning as does kinda i want to and sin suicide note by johnette napolitano on the underworld soundtrack has begun to cast shadows on ivy and rachels everevolving complex relationship and thinking of you by a perfect circle has whispers of rachel in it but as to whom she is surrendering she hasnt told me yet there are so many choices that woman has to make so many paths she could walk as she finds herself pulled deeper into the hollows underworld fields of innocence by evanescence seems to fit more and more ivy ivys character is one of the most complex ive ever tried to sketch with my pen and shes claimed a correspondingly large portion of music i understand her motivations but she remains a mystery to even me at times a confusing mix of human vulnerabilities and vampiric drives most recently mooncat introduced me to a wonderful band stabbing westward and their track what do i have to do is scrumptious at nailing ivys inner dilemma faint by linkin park silhouettes by smile empty soul and everybodys fool were all suggested by readers and now that ive had a chance to get a good listen i wholeheartedly agree recently a reader named jane introduced me to kip wingers music and though almost the entire disc songs from the ocean floor has shadows of the hollows in it faster has ivy all over it nins terrible lie sanctified and something i can never have are good matches to the plot lines too gravity by a perfect circle is a good fit too but its a bit too collected its not quite confused enough and though it wont make much sense until you read the second book evanescences away from me gave me chills at how close it fit ivys predicament dash suggested mary janes last dance by tom petty and the heartbreakers as bringing to mind ivy a relation i agree with ivys eventual fall from grace i first heard in duran durans save a prayer okay now youre laughing at me or sitting there with a puzzled look wondering who duran duran is i told you it was an eclectic stack of music and i saw who pushed her into falling after hearing evanescences going under jenks track ten on the oceans eleven soundtrack planting the seed fits jenks flitting about as a gardener thanks to tim from tennessee i found peter gunn done by henry mancini it fits fantastically think the blues brothers jenkss son jax gets into trouble thanks to redtape from agent provocateur which is also on the underworld soundtrack though we wont see that for ages and please dont write to tell me the song isnt really about little thieves inspiration is where you find it kisten thinking of you by a perfect circle seems to fit kisten whether this means he will end up with rachel or whether she is going to remain one of kistens unresolved conquests i honestly dont know yet also from a perfect circle is weak and powerless right now the song is simply simmering in the back of my head but im sure its going to fit somewhere with kisten sigh im starting to like the guy despite my better judgment but the best fit for him ive found so far is never say never from queens of the stone age off the punisher soundtrack the depth of that piece is hidden by the egotestical attitude of the refrainjust like kistens depth is shrouded under a carefully constructed front to disarm and beguile nins the only time fits a plot line that kisten is wiggling his way into trent thanks to a reader who simply identified himself as a fan from the southeast i have found a piece of music off the queen of the damned soundtrack that i think fits trent kalamack fairly well especially the lyrics that stephanie mckay sings try track excess by tricky if trent believes in anything its people guilty by gravity kills is good too i think dash brought that one to my attention the american way by the crystal method fits well thanks beyari for suggesting i listen to that one piscary a fellow music aficionado suggested sympathy for the devil by the rolling stones and after playing it to death i realized it cast wonderful shadows on piscary one of cincinnatis master vampires pet and lullaby by a perfect circle strike close to home with piscary as well piscarys restaurant after kisten assumes management we wont see this for some time but it happensbrings to mind rob zombies living dead girl think linedancing vampires yes linedancing vampires i only hope rob will forgive me nick it took a while but im finally nailing down a few pieces of music that i can relate to nick from kip winger comes sure was a wildflower and crash the wall thats what i get from nin works really well too seduction as the plotlines progress im finding myself collecting a few pieces of music of seduction and in the spirit of avoiding spoilers im not saying yet to whom they relate dipping waaaay back i found stings i burn for you which has a hidden thread of evil in it and a crystalline purity that makes it a delicious threat kip winger has one here too with two lovers stand as does evanescence with even in death which is terribly tragic but i have yet to find a more seductive piece of music than new years prayer by jeff buckley off his sketches for my sweetheart drunk you may have heard it before as its used as the beginning music for the dead zone but the real thing is ohsomuch more languorous stretch seductive also from jeff buckley is you and i and lilac wine which has all the markings of an old jazz song the everafter i found thanks to theguyintheleatherjacket a piece of music that just about blew me away with how close it sounds to my idea of the everafter a perfect circles remake of lennons imagine think of a redsmeared sky and a broken city skyline and just try not to shiver final notes i recently ran into an entire album that just about blew me away in how many tracks related to story lines i was developing it also made me a nin fan something i really didnt expect the entire album pretty hate machine has found a place in the hollows for me and every song but the last easily relates to a developing or crumbling relationship from my books almost the entire soundtrack for underworld seems to have found a place in the hollows rcv by puscifer speaks to me of kistens longago relationship with ivy before she met rachel and went on the wagon so to speak when they are pulling the last job at the end of dead witch walking brings to mind rehumanize yourself from sting and since im tripping down the paths of good s music whenever i hear phil collinss long long way to go all i see is rachel driving across the bridge into cincinnati the sun going down with the sky all pink and blue the wind in her hair and the concern for an entire city in her eyes on a last note my immortal by evanescence is figuring into the grand scheme of things even i cant see yet how all my characters relationships will be built before they can fall apart from tragic stupidity and pride but the power and depth of that piece of music has left a mark on me and wont let go
