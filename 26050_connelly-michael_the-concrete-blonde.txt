michael connelly the concrete blonde the third book in the harry bosch series this is for susan paul and jamie bob and marlen ellen jane and damian the house in silverlake was dark its windows as empty as a dead mans eyes it was an old california craftsman with a full front porch and two dormer windows set on the long slope of the roof but no light shone behind the glass not even from above the doorway instead the house cast a foreboding darkness about it that not even the glow from the streetlight could penetrate a man could be standing there on the porch and bosch knew he probably wouldnt be able to see him you sure this is it he asked her not the house she said behind it the garage pull up so you can see down the drive bosch tapped the gas pedal and the caprice moved forward and crossed the entrance to the driveway there she said bosch stopped the car there was a garage behind the house with an apartment above it wooden staircase up the side light over the door two windows lights on inside okay bosch said they stared at the garage for several moments bosch didnt know what he expected to see maybe nothing the whores perfume was filling the car and he rolled his window down he didnt know whether to trust her claim or not the one thing he knew he couldnt do was call for backup he hadnt brought a rover with him and the car was not equipped with a phone what are you going tothere he goes she said urgently bosch had seen it the shadow of a figure crossing behind the smaller window the bathroom he guessed hes in the bathroom she said thats where i saw all the stuff bosch looked away from the window and at her what stuff i uh checked the cabinet you know when i was in there just looking to see what he had a girl has to be careful and i saw all the stuff makeup shit you know mascara lipsticks compacts and stuff thats how i figured it was him he used all that stuff to paint em when he was done you know killing them why didnt you tell me that on the phone you didnt ask he saw the figure pass behind the curtains of the other window boschs mind was racing now his heart jacking up into its overdrive mode how long ago was this that you ran out of there shit i dont know i hadda walk down to franklin just to find a fucking ride over to the boulevard i was with the ride bout ten minutes so i dont know guess its important i dont know its been more than an hour shit bosch thought she stopped to turn a trick before she called the task force number showed a lot of genuine concern there now there could be a replacement up there and im sitting out here watching he gunned the car up the street and found a space in front of a hydrant he turned off the engine but left the keys in the ignition after he jumped out he stuck his head back in through the open window listen im going up there you stay here if you hear shots or if im not back here in ten minutes you start knocking on doors and get some cops out here tell them an officer needs assistance theres a clock on the dash ten minutes ten minutes baby you go be the hero now but im getting that reward bosch pulled his gun as he hurried down the driveway the stairs up the side of the garage were old and warped he took them three at a time as quietly as he could but still it felt as if he were shouting his arrival to the world at the top he raised the gun and broke the bare bulb that was in place over the door then he leaned back into the darkness against the outside railing he raised his left leg and put all his weight and momentum into his heel he struck the door above the knob the door swung open with a loud crack in a crouch bosch moved through the threshold in the standard combat stance right away he saw the man across the room standing on the other side of a bed the man was naked and not only bald but completely hairless his vision locked on the mans eyes and he saw the look of terror quickly fill them bosch yelled his voice high and taut cops dont fucking move the man froze but only for a beat and then began bending down his right arm reaching for the pillow he hesitated once and then continued the movement bosch couldnt believe it what the fuck was he doing time went into suspension the adrenaline pounding through his body gave his vision a slowmotion clarity bosch knew the man was either reaching for the pillow for something to cover himself with or he was the hand swept under the pillow dont do it the hand was closing on something beneath the pillow the man had never taken his eyes off bosch then bosch realized it wasnt terror in his eyes it was something else anger hate the hand was coming out from beneath the pillow now no bosch fired one shot his gun kicking up in his twohanded grasp the naked man jerked upright and backward he hit the woodpaneled wall behind him then bounced forward and fell across the bed thrashing and gagging bosch quickly moved into the room and to the bed the mans left hand was reaching again for the pillow bosch brought his left leg up and knelt on his back pinning him to the bed he pulled the cuffs off his belt and grabbed the groping left hand and cuffed it then the right behind the back the naked man was gagging and moaning i canti cant he said but his statement was lost in a bloody coughing fit you cant do what i told you bosch said i told you not to move just die man bosch thought but didnt say it will be easier for all of us he moved around the bed to the pillow he lifted it stared at what was beneath it for a few moments and then dropped it he closed his eyes for a moment goddammit he called at the back of the naked mans head what were you doing i had a fucking gun and you you reachi told you not to move bosch came around the bed so he could see the mans face blood was emptying from his mouth onto the dingy white sheet bosch knew his bullet had hit the lungs the naked man was the dying man now you didnt have to die bosch said to him then the man was dead bosch looked around the room there was no one else no replacement for the whore who had run he had been wrong on that guess he went into the bathroom and opened the cabinet beneath the sink the makeup was there as the whore had said bosch recognized some of the brand names max factor lor√©al cover girl revlon it all seemed to fit he looked back through the bathroom door at the corpse on the bed there was still the smell of gunpowder in the air he lit a cigarette and it was so quiet in the place that he could hear the crisp tobacco burn as he dragged the soothing smoke into his lungs there was no phone in the apartment bosch sat on a chair in the kitchenette and waited staring across the room at the body he realized that his heart was still pounding rapidly and that he felt lightheaded he also realized that he felt nothingnot sympathy or guilt or sorrowfor the man on the bed nothing at all instead he tried to concentrate on the sound of the siren that was now sounding in the distance and coming closer after a while he was able to discern that it was more than one siren it was many there are no benches in the hallways of the us district courthouse in downtown los angeles no place to sit anybody who slides down the wall to sit on the cold marble floor will get rousted by the first deputy marshal who walks by and the marshals are always out in the halls walking by the lack of hospitality exists because the federal government does not want its courthouse to give even the appearance that justice may be slow or nonexistent it does not want people lining the halls on benches or on the floor waiting with weary eyes for the courtroom doors to open and their cases or the cases of their jailed loved ones to be called there is enough of that going on across spring street in the county criminal courts building every day the benches in the hallways of every floor are clogged with those who wait mostly they are women and children their husbands or fathers or lovers held in lockup mostly they are black or brown mostly the benches look like crowded life raftswomen and children firstwith people pressed together and cast adrift waiting always waiting to be found boat people the courthouse smartasses call them harry bosch thought about these differences as he smoked a cigarette and stood on the front steps of the federal courthouse that was another thing no smoking in the hallways inside so he had to take the escalator down and come outside during the trials breaks outside there was a sandfilled ash can behind the concrete base of the statue of the blindfolded woman holding up the scales of justice bosch looked up at the statue he could never remember her name the lady of justice something greek he thought but wasnt sure he went back to the folded newspaper in his hands and reread the story lately in the mornings he would read only the sports section concentrating his full attention on the pages in the back where box scores and statistics were carefully charted and updated each day he somehow found the columns of numbers and percentages comforting they were clear and concise an absolute order in a disordered world having knowledge of who had hit the most home runs for the dodgers made him feel that he was still connected in some way to the city and to his life but today he had left the sports section folded and tucked into his briefcase which was under his chair in the courtroom thelos angeles times s metro section was in his hands now he had carefully folded the section into quarters the way he had seen drivers on the freeway do it so they could read while they drove and the story on the trial was on the bottom corner of the sections front page he once again read the story and once again felt his face grow hot as he read about himself trial on police toupee shooting to begin by joel bremmer times staff writer as an unusual civil rights trial gets underway today a los angeles police detective stands accused of having used excessive force four years ago when he shot and killed a purported serial killer he believed was reaching for a gun the alleged killer was actually reaching for his toupee los angeles police detective harry bosch is being sued in us district court by the widow of norman church an aerospace worker bosch shot to death at the climax of the investigation into the socalled dollmaker killings for nearly a year before the shooting police had sought a serial killer so named by the media because he used makeup to paint the faces of his victims the highly publicized manhunt was marked by the killers sending of poems and notes to bosch and thetimes after church was killed police announced they had unequivocal evidence proving that the mechanical engineer was the killer bosch was suspended and later transferred from the homicide special unit of the lapd robberyhomicide division to the hollywood division homicide squad in making the demotion police stressed that bosch was disciplined for procedural errors such as his failure to call for a backup to the silverlake apartment where the fatal shooting took place police administrators maintained that the church killing was a good shootingdepartment terminology meaning not improper since churchs death precluded a trial much of the evidence gathered by police has never been provided publicly under oath that will likely change with the federal trial a weeklong jury selection process is expected to be completed today with the opening statements of the attorneys to follow bosch had to refold the paper to continue reading the story on an inside page he was momentarily distracted by seeing his own picture which was on the inside page it was an old photo and looked not unlike a mug shot it was the same one that was on his department id card bosch was more annoyed by the photo than the story it was an invasion of his privacy to put his picture out like that he tried to concentrate on the story bosch is being defended by the city attorneys office because he was acting in the line of duty when the shooting occurred if any judgment is won by the plaintiff the city taxpayers not bosch will pay churchs wife deborah is being represented by civil rights attorney honey chandler who specializes in police abuse cases in an interview last week chandler said she will seek to prove to the jury that bosch acted in such a reckless manner that a fatal shooting of church was inevitable detective bosch was cowboying and a man ended up dead chandler said i dont know if he was merely reckless or if there is something more sinister here but we will find out in the trial that was the line that bosch had read and reread at least six times since getting the paper during the first break sinister what did she mean by that he had tried not to let it bother him knowing that chandler would not be above using a newspaper interview for a psychops outing but still it felt like a warning shot it let him know more was to come chandler said she also plans to question the police evidence that church was the dollmaker she said church the father of two daughters was not the serial killer police sought and that they labeled him as such to cover up boschs misdeed detective bosch killed an innocent man in cold blood chandler said what we are doing with this civil rights suit is what the police department and the district attorneys office refused to do bring forward the truth and provide justice for norman churchs family bosch and asst city atty rodney belk who is defending him declined comment for this story along with bosch those expected to testify in the one to twoweek case include spare change pal bosch looked up from the paper into the grimy but familiar face of the homeless man who had staked out the front of the courthouse as his turf bosch had seen him out here every day during the week of jury selection making his changeandcigarette rounds the man wore a threadbare tweed jacket over two sweaters and corduroy pants he carried a plastic bag of belongings and a big gulp cup to shake in front of people when he asked for change he also always carried with him a yellow legal pad with scribbling all over it bosch instinctively patted his pockets and shrugged he had no change id take a dollar you know dont have a spare dollar the homeless man dismissed him and looked into the ash can yellowed cigarette butts grew from the sand like a crop of cancer he put his yellow pad under his arm and began to pick through the offerings taking those that still had a quarter inch or more of tobacco to smoke every now and then he would find a nearly whole cigarette and make a clicking sound with his mouth to show his approval he put the harvest from the ash can in the big gulp cup happy with his findings the man stepped back from the ash can and looked up at the statue he looked back at bosch and winked then began to rock his hips in a lewd mimicry of a sexual act how bout my girl here he said the man then kissed his hand and reached up and patted the statue before bosch could think of something to say the pager on his belt began to chirp the homeless man stepped back another two steps and raised his free hand as if to ward off some unknown evil bosch saw the look of deranged panic spread on his face it was the look of a man whose brain synapses were spread too far apart the connections dulled the man turned and scurried away out toward spring street with his cup of used cigarettes bosch watched him until he was gone and then pulled the pager off his belt he recognized the number on the display it was lieutenant harvey ninetyeight poundss direct line at the hollywood station he put what was left of his cigarette into the sand and went back into the courthouse there was a bank of pay phones at the top of the escalator near the secondfloor courtrooms harry whats happening there pounds asked the usual just waiting around we got a jury so now the lawyers are in with the judge talking about openers belk said i didnt have to sit in on that so im just hanging around he looked at his watch it was ten to twelve theyll be breaking for lunch soon he added good i need you bosch didnt reply pounds had promised he would be off the case rotation until the trial was over a week more maybe two at the most it was a promise pounds had no choice but to make he knew that bosch couldnt handle catching a homicide investigation while in federal court four days a week whats going on i thought i was off the list you are but we may have a problem it concerns you bosch hesitated again dealing with pounds was like that harry would trust a street snitch before hed trust pounds there was always the spoken motive and the hidden motive it seemed that this time the lieutenant was doing one of his routine dances speaking in elliptical phrases trying to get bosch to bite on the hook a problem bosch finally asked a good noncommittal reply well i take it you saw the paper todaythetimes story about your case yeah i was just reading it well we got another note a note what are you talking about im talking about somebody dropping a note at the front desk addressed to you and damn if it doesnt sound like those notes you got from the dollmaker back when all of that was going on bosch could tell pounds was enjoying this the stretching it out if it was addressed to me how do you know about it it wasnt mailed no envelope it was just one page folded over had your name on the fold somebody left it at the front desk somebody there read it you can figure it from there what does it say well youre not going to like this harry the timing is godawful but the note says it says basically that you got the wrong guy that the dollmaker is still out there the writer says hes the real dollmaker and that the body count continues says you killed the wrong guy its bullshit the dollmakers letters were carried in the paper in bremmers book on the case anybody could pick up the style and write a note you you take me for a moron bosch i know anybody couldve written this but so did the writer know that so to prove his point he included a little treasure map id guess youd call it directions to another victims body a long silence filled the line while bosch thought and pounds waited and so bosch finally said and so i sent edgar out to the location this morning you remember bings on western bings yeah south of the boulevard bings a pool hall didnt that place go down in the riots last year right pounds said complete burnout they looted and torched the place just the slab and three walls left standing theres a city demolition order against it but the owner hasnt acted yet anyway thats the spot according to this note we got note says she was buried under the floor slab edgar went out there with a city crew jackhammers the works pounds was dragging it out what a petty asshole bosch thought this time he would wait longer and when the silence grew nervously long pounds finally spoke he found a body just like the note said he would beneath the concrete he found a body thats how old is it dont know yet but its old thats why im calling i need you to go out there during the lunch break and see what you can make of this you know is it legit as a dollmaker victim or is some other wacko jerking us off youre the expert you could go out there when the judge breaks for lunch ill meet you there and youll be back in time for openers bosch felt numb he already needed another cigarette he tried to place all of what pounds had just said into some semblance of order the dollmakernorman churchhad been dead four years now there had been no mistake bosch knew that night he still knew it in his guts today church was the dollmaker so this note just appeared at the desk desk sergeant found it on the front counter about four hours ago nobody saw anybody leave it you know a lot of people come through the front in the mornings plus we had change of shift i had meehan go up and talk to the desk uniforms nobody remembers jack shit about it until they found it shit read it to me cant sid has it doubt there will be any lifts but we have to go through the motions ill get a copy and have it with me at the scene okay bosch didnt answer i know what youre thinking pounds said but lets hold our horses till we see what is out there no reason to worry yet might be some stunt cooked up by that lawyer chandler wouldnt put it past her shes the type shed do anything to nail another lapd scalp to the wall likes seeing her name in the paper what about the media they heard about this yet weve gotten a few calls about a body being found they mustve gotten it off the coroners dispatch freek weve been staying off the air anyway nobody knows about the note or the dollmaker tiein they just know theres a body the idea of it being found under the floor of one of the riot burnouts is sexy i guess anyway we have to keep the dollmaker part under our hat for the time being unless of course whoever wrote it also sent copies out to the media if he did that well hear about it by the end of the day how could he bury her under the slab of a pool hall the whole building wasnt a pool hall there were storage rooms in the back before it was bings it was a studio prop house after bings took the front they rented out sections in the back for storage this is all from edgar he got the owner out there the killer mustve had one of the rooms broke through the existing slab and put this girls body in there anyway it all got burned down in the riots but the fire didnt hurt the slab this poor girls body has been down in there through all of that edgar said it looks like a mummy or something bosch saw the door to courtroom open and members of the church family came out followed by their lawyer they were breaking for lunch deborah church and her two teenaged daughters did not look at him but honey chandler known by most cops and others in the federal courts building as money chandler stared at him with killer eyes as she passed they were as dark as burnt mahogany and set against a tanned face with a strong jawline she was an attractive woman with smooth gold hair her figure was hidden in the stiff lines of her blue suit bosch could feel the animosity from the group wash over him like a wave bosch you still there pounds asked yeah it looks like we just broke for lunch good then head over there and ill meet you i cant believe im actually saying this but i hope its just another wacko for your sake it might be best right as bosch was hanging up he heard poundss voice and brought the phone back to his ear one more thing if the media shows up out there leave them to me however this turns out you shouldnt be formally involved in this new case because of the litigation stemming from the old we are just having you out there as an expert witness so to speak right see you there bosch took wilshire out of downtown and cut up to third after he made it through what was left of macarthur park turning north on western he could see up on the left the grouping of patrol cars detective cars and the crimescene and coroners vans in the distance the hollywood sign hung over the northern view its letters barely legible in the smog bings was three blackened walls cradling a pile of charred debris no roof but the uniforms had hung a blue plastic tarp over the top of the rear wall and strung it to the chainlink fence that ran along the front of the property bosch knew it hadnt been done because the investigators wanted shade where they worked he leaned forward and looked up through the windshield he saw them up there circling the citys carrion birds the media helicopters as bosch pulled to a stop at the curb he saw a couple of city workers standing next to an equipment truck they had sick looks on their faces and dragged hard and deep on cigarettes their jackhammers were on the ground near the back of the truck they were waitinghopingthat their work here was done on the other side of their truck pounds was standing next to the coroners blue van it looked as though he was composing himself and bosch saw that he shared the same sick expression with the civilians though pounds was commander of hollywood detectives including the homicide table he had never actually worked homicide himself like many of the departments administrators his climb up the ladder was based on test scores and brownnosing not experience it always pleased bosch to see someone like pounds get a dose of what real cops dealt with every day bosch looked at his watch before getting out of his caprice he had one hour before he had to be back in court for openers harry pounds said as he walked up glad you made it always glad to check out another body lieutenant bosch slipped off his suit coat and put it inside his car on the seat then he moved to the trunk and got out a baggy blue jumpsuit and put it on over his clothes it would be hot but he didnt want to come back into court covered with dirt and dust good idea pounds said wish i had brought my stuff but bosch knew he didnt have any stuff pounds ventured to a crime scene only when there was a good chance tv would show up and he could give a sound bite and it was only tv he was interested in not print media you had to make sense for more than two sentences in a row with a newspaper reporter and then your words became attached to a piece of paper and were there all the next day and possibly forever to haunt you it wasnt good department politics to talk to the print media tv was a more fleeting and less dangerous thrill bosch headed toward the blue tarp beneath it he saw the usual gathering of investigators they stood next to a pile of broken concrete and along the edge of a trench dug into the concrete pad that had been the buildings foundation bosch looked up as one of the tv helicopters made a low flyover they wouldnt get much usable video with the tarp hiding the scene they were probably dispatching ground crews now there was still a lot of debris in the buildings shell charred ceiling beams and timber broken concrete block and other rubble pounds caught up with bosch and they began carefully stepping through to the gathering beneath the tarp theyll bulldoze this and make another parking lot pounds said thats all the riots gave the city about a thousand new parking lots you want to park in south central these days no problem you want a bottle of soda or to put gas in your car then you got a problem they burned every place down you drive through the south side before christmas they got christmas tree lots every block all the open space down there i still dont understand why those people burned their own neighborhoods bosch knew that the fact people like pounds didnt understand why those people did what they did was one reason they did it and would have to do it again someday bosch looked at it as a cycle every twentyfive years or so the city had its soul torched by the fires of reality but then it drove on quickly without looking back like a hitandrun suddenly pounds went down after slipping on the loose rubble he stopped his fall with his hands and jumped up quickly embarrassed damn it he cried out and then though bosch hadnt asked he added im okay im okay he quickly used his hand to carefully smooth back the strands of hair that had slipped off his balding cranium he didnt realize that he was smearing black char from his hand across his forehead as he did this and bosch didnt tell him they finally picked their way to the gathering bosch walked toward his former partner jerry edgar who stood with a couple of investigators harry knew and two women he didnt the women wore green jumpsuits the uniform of the coroners body movers minimumwage earners who were dispatched from death scene to death scene in the blue van picking up the bodies and taking them to the ice box whereyat harry edgar said right here edgar had just been to new orleans for the blues festival and had somehow come back with the greeting he said it so often it had become annoying edgar was the only one in the detective bureau who didnt realize this edgar was the standout amidst the group he was not wearing a jumpsuit like boschin fact he never did because they wrinkled his nordstrom suitsand somehow had managed to make his way into the crime scene area without getting so much as a trace of dust on the pants cuffs of his gray doublebreasted suit the real estate marketedgars onetime lucrative outside gighad been in the shithouse for three years but edgar still managed to be the sharpest dresser in the division bosch looked at edgars pale blue silk tie knotted tightly at the black detectives throat and guessed that it might have cost more than his own shirt and tie combined bosch looked away and nodded to art donovan the sid crime scene tech but said nothing else to the others he was following protocol as at any murder scene a carefully orchestrated and incestuous caste system was in effect the detectives did most of the talking amongst themselves or to the sid tech the uniforms didnt speak unless spoken to the body movers the lowest on the totem pole spoke to no one except the coroners tech the coroners tech said little to the cops he despised them because in his view they were whinersalways needing this or that the autopsy done the tox tests done all of it done by yesterday bosch looked into the trench they stood above the jackhammer crew had broken through the slab and dug a hole about eight feet long and four feet deep they had then excavated sideways into a large formation of concrete that extended three feet below the surface of the slab there was a hollow in the stone bosch dropped to a crouch so he could look closer and saw that the concrete hollow was the outline of a womans body it was as if it were a mold into which plaster could be poured to make a cast maybe to manufacture a mannikin but it was empty inside wheres the body bosch asked they took what was left out already edgar said its in the bag in the truck were trying to figure out how to get this piece of the slab outta here in one piece bosch looked silently into the hollow for a few moments before standing back up and making his way back out from beneath the tarp larry sakai the coroners investigator followed him to the coroners van and unlocked and opened the back door inside the van it was sweltering and the smell of sakais breath was stronger than the odor of industrial disinfectant i figured theyd call you out here sakai said oh yeah whys that cause it looks like the fuckin dollmaker man bosch said nothing so as not to give sakai any indication of confirmation sakai had worked some of the dollmaker cases four years earlier bosch suspected he was responsible for the name the media attached to the serial killer someone had leaked details of the killers repeated use of makeup on the bodies to one of the anchors at channel the anchor christened the killer the dollmaker after that the killer was called that by everybody even the cops but bosch always hated that name it said something about the victims as well as the killer it depersonalized them made it easier for the dollmaker stories that were broadcast to be entertaining instead of horrifying bosch looked around the van there were two gurneys and two bodies one filled the black bag completely the unseen corpse having been heavy in life or bloated in death he turned to the other bag the remains inside barely filling it he knew this was the body taken from the concrete yeah this one sakai said this others a stabbing up on lankershim north hollywoods working it we were coming in when we got the dispatch on this one that explained how the media caught on so quickly bosch knew the coroners dispatch frequency played in every newsroom in the city he studied the smaller body bag a moment and without waiting for sakai to do it he yanked open the zipper on the heavy black plastic it unleashed a sharp musty smell that was not as bad as it could have been had they found the body sooner sakai pulled the bag open and bosch looked at the remains of a human body the skin was dark and like leather stretched taut over the bones bosch was not repulsed because he was used to it and had the ability to become detached from such scenes he sometimes believed that looking at bodies was his lifes work he had idd his mothers body for the cops when he wasnt yet twelve years old he had seen countless dead in vietnam and in nearly twenty years with the cops the bodies had become too many to put a number to it had left him most times as detached from what he saw as a camera as detached he knew as a psychopath the woman in the bag had been small bosch could tell but the deterioration of tissue and shrinkage made the body seem even smaller than it had certainly been in life what was left of the hair was shoulder length and looked as if it had been bleached blonde bosch could see the powdery remains of makeup on the skin of the face his eyes were drawn to the breasts because they were shockingly large in comparison to the rest of the shrunken corpse they were full and rounded and the skin was stretched taut across them it somehow seemed to be the most grotesque feature of the corpse because it was not as it should have been implants sakai said they dont decompose could probably take em out and resell them to the next stupid chick that wants em we could start a recycling program bosch didnt say anything he was suddenly depressed at the thought of the womanwhoever she wasdoing that to her body to somehow make herself more appealing and then to end up this way had she only succeeded he wondered in making herself appealing to her killer sakai interrupted his thoughts if the dollmaker did this that means shes been in the concrete at least four years right so if thats the case decomp isnt that bad for that length of time still got the hair eyes some internal tissues well be able to work with it last week i picked up a piece of work a hiker they found out in soledad canyon they figure it was a guy went missing last summer now he was nothing but bones course out in the open like that you got the animals you know they come in through the ass its the softest entry and the animals i know sakai lets stay on this one anyway with this woman the concrete apparently slowed things down for us sure didnt stop it but slowed it down it mustve been like an airtight tomb in there you people going to be able to establish just how long shes been dead probably not from the body we get her idd then you people might find out when she went missing thatll be the way bosch looked at the fingers they were dark sticks almost as thin as pencils what about prints well get em but not from those bosch looked over and saw sakai smiling what she left them in the concrete sakais glee was smashed like a fly bosch had ruined his surprise yeah thats right she left an impression you could say were going to get prints maybe even a mold of her face if we can get whats left of that slab out of there whoever mixed this concrete used too much water made it very fine thats a break for us well get the prints bosch leaned over the gurney to study the knotted strip of leather that was wrapped around the corpses neck it was thin black leather and he could see the manufacturers seam along the edges it was a strap cut away from a purse like all the others he bent closer and the cadavers smell filled his nose and mouth the circumference of the leather strap around the neck was small maybe about the size of a wine bottle small enough to be fatal he could see where it had cut into the now darkened skin and choked away life he looked at the knot a slipknot pulled tight on the right side with the left hand like all the others church had been lefthanded there was one more thing to check the signature as they had called it no clothes shoes nothing like the others remember open it all the way i want to see the rest sakai pulled the zipper on the black bag down all the way to the feet bosch was unsure if sakai knew of the signature but was not going to bring it up he leaned over the corpse and looked down acting as if he was studying everything when he was only interested in the toenails the toes were shriveled black and cracked the nails were cracked too and completely missing from a few toes but bosch saw the paint on the toes that were intact hot pink dulled by decomposition fluids dust and age and on the large toe on the right foot he saw the signature what was still left of it to be seen a tiny white cross had been carefully painted on the nail the dollmakers sign it had been there on all the bodies bosch could feel his heart pounding loudly he looked around the vans interior and began to feel claustrophobic the first sense of paranoia was poking into his brain his mind began churning through the possibilities if this body matched every known specification of a dollmaker kill then church was the killer if church was this womans killer and is now dead himself then who left the note at the hollywood station front desk he straightened up and took in the body as a whole for the first time naked and shrunken forgotten he wondered if there were others out there in the concrete waiting to be discovered close it he said to sakai its him isnt it the dollmaker bosch didnt answer he climbed out of the van pulled the zipper on his jumpsuit down a bit to let in some air hey bosch sakai called from inside the van im just curious howd you guys find this if the dollmaker is dead who told you where to look bosch didnt answer that one either he walked slowly back underneath the tarp it looked like the others still hadnt figured out what to do about removing the concrete the body had been found in edgar was standing around trying not to get dirty bosch signaled to him and pounds and they gathered together at a spot to the left of the trench where they could talk without being overheard well pounds asked whatve we got it looks like churchs work bosch said shit edgar said how can you be sure pounds asked from what i can see it matches every detail followed by the dollmaker including the signature its there the signature edgar asked the white cross on the toe we held that back during the investigation cut deals with all the reporters not to put it out what about a copycat edgar offered hopefully could be the white cross was never made public until after we closed the case after that bremmer over at thetimes wrote that book about the case it was mentioned so we have a copycat pounds pronounced it all depends on when she died bosch said his book came out a year after church was dead if she got killed after that you probably got a copycat if she got put in that concrete before then i dont know shit said edgar bosch thought a moment before speaking again we could be dealing with one of a lot of different things theres the copycat or maybe church had a partner and we never saw it or maybe i popped the wrong guy maybe whoever wrote this note we got is telling the truth that hung out there in the momentary silence like dogshit on the sidewalk everybody walks carefully around it without looking too closely at it wheres the note bosch finally said to pounds in my car ill get it what do you mean he may have had a partner i mean say church did do this then whered the note come from since he is dead it would obviously have to be someone who knew he did it and where he had hidden the body if thats the case who is this second person a partner did church have a killing partner we never knew about remember the hillside strangler edgar asked turned out it was stranglers plural two cousins with the same taste for killing young women pounds took a step back and shook his head as if to ward off a potentially careerthreatening case what about chandler the lawyer pounds said say churchs wife knows where he buried bodies literally she tells chandler and chandler hatches this scheme she writes a note like the dollmaker and drops it off at the station its guaranteed to fuck up your case bosch replayed that one in his mind it seemed to work then he saw the fault lines he saw that they ran through all the scenarios but why would church bury some bodies and not others the shrink who advised the task force back then said there was a purpose to his displaying of the victims he was an exhibitionist toward the end after the seventh victim he started dropping the notes to us and the newspaper it doesnt make sense that hed leave some of the bodies to be found and some buried in concrete true pounds said i like the copycat edgar said but why copy someones whole profile right down to the signature and then bury the body bosch asked he wasnt really asking them it was a question hed have to answer himself they stood there in silence for a long moment each man beginning to see that the most plausible possibility might be that the dollmaker was still alive whoever did it why the note pounds said he seemed very agitated why would he drop us the note hed gotten away because he wants attention bosch said like the dollmaker got like this trial is going to get the silence came back then for a long moment the key bosch finally said is iding her finding out how long shes been in the concrete well know then what weve got so what do we do edgar said ill tell you what we do pounds said we dont say a damned thing about this to anyone not yet not until we are absolutely sure of what weve got we wait on the autopsy and the id we find out how long this girls been dead and what she was doing when she disappeared well makeill make a call on which way we go after that meantime say nothing if this is misconstrued it could be very damaging to the department i see some of the media is already here so ill handle them no one else is to talk we clear bosch and edgar nodded and pounds went off slowly moving through the debris toward a knot of reporters and cameramen who stood behind the yellow tape the uniforms had put up bosch and edgar stood silent for a few moments watching him go i hope he knows what the hell he is saying edgar said does inspire a lot of confidence doesnt he bosch replied oh yeah bosch walked back over to the trench and edgar followed what are you going to do about the impression she left in the concrete the jackhammers dont think its movable they said whoever mixed the concrete she was put in didnt follow the directions too well used too much water and smallgrain sand its like plaster of paris we try to lift the whole thing out in one piece it will crumble under its own weight so donovans mixing plaster hes going to make a mold of the face on the handwe only got the left the right side crumbled when we dug in donovans going to try using rubber silicone he says its the best chance of pulling out a mold with prints bosch nodded for a few moments he watched pounds talking to the reporters and saw the first thing worth smiling about all day pounds was on camera but apparently none of the reporters had told him about the dirt smeared across his forehead he lit a cigarette and turned his attention back to edgar so this area here was all storage rooms for rent he asked thats right the owner of the property was here a little while ago said that all this area back in here was partitioned storage individual rooms the dollmakerer the killer whoever the fuck it wascouldve had one of the rooms and had his privacy to do what he wanted the only problem would be the noise he made breaking up the original flooring but it couldve been night work owner said most people didnt come back into the storage area at night people who rented the rooms got a key to an exterior door off the alley the perp couldve come in and done the whole job in one night the next question was obvious so edgar answered before bosch asked the owner cant give us the name of the renter not for sure at least the records went up in the fire his insurance company made settlements with most people that filed claims and well get those names but he said there were a few who never made a claim after the riots he just never heard from them again he cant remember all the names but if one was our guy then it was probably an alias anyway leastwise if i was going to rent a room and dig through the floor to bury a body you wouldnt find me giving no real name bosch nodded and looked at his watch he had to get going soon he realized that he was hungry but probably wouldnt get the chance to eat bosch looked down at the excavation and noticed the delineation of color between the old and newer concrete the old slab was almost white the concrete the woman had been encased in was a dark gray he noticed a small piece of red paper protruding from a gray chunk at the bottom of the trench he dropped down into the excavation and picked the chunk up it was about the size of a softball he pounded it on the old slab until it broke apart in his hand the paper was part of a crumpled and empty marlboro cigarette package edgar pulled a plastic evidence bag from his suit pocket and held it open for bosch to drop the discovery in its got tove been put in with the body he said good catch bosch climbed out of the trench and looked at his watch again it was time to go let me know if you get the id he said to edgar he dumped his jumpsuit back in the trunk and lit a fresh cigarette he stood next to his caprice and watched pounds who was wrapping up his skillfully planned impromptu press conference harry could tell by the cameras and the expensive clothes that most of the reporters were from tv he saw bremmer thetimes guy standing at the edge of the pack bosch hadnt seen him in a while and noticed he had put on weight and a beard bosch knew that bremmer was standing on the periphery of the circle waiting for the tv questions to end so he could hit pounds with something solid that would take some thought to answer bosch smoked and waited for five minutes before pounds was done he was risking being late for court but he wanted to see the note when pounds was finally done with the reporters he signaled bosch to follow him to his car bosch got in the passenger side and pounds handed him a photocopy harry studied the note for a long time it was written in the recognizable printed scrawl the analyst in suspicious documents had called the printing philadelphia block style and had concluded that its righttoleft slant was the result of its being the work of an untrained hand possibly a lefthanded person printing with his right hand newspaper says the trials just begun a verdict to return on the dollmakers run a bullet from bosch fired straight and true but the dolls should know me works not through on western is the spot where my heart doth sings when i think o the dolly laid beneath at bings too bad good bosch a bullet of bad aim years gone past and im still in the game bosch knew style could be copied but something about the poem ground into him it was like the others the same bad schoolboy rhymes the same semiliterate attempt at highflown language he felt confusion and a tugging in his chest its him he thought its him ladies and gentlemen us district judge alva keyes intoned as he eyed the jury we begin the trial with what we call opening statements by the attorneys mind you these are not to be construed by you as evidence these are more or less blueprintsroad maps if you will of the route each attorney wants to take with his or her case you do not consider them evidence they may make some highfalutin allegations but just because they say it doesnt make it true after all theyre lawyers this brought a polite titter of laughter from the jury and the rest of courtroom with his southern accent it sounded as if the judge had said lieyers which added to the glee even money chandler smiled bosch looked around from his seat at the defense table and saw that the public seats in the huge woodpaneled courtroom with twentyfoot ceilings were about half full in the front row on the plaintiffs side were eight people who were norman churchs family members and friends not counting his widow who sat up at the plaintiffs table with chandler there were also about a half dozen courthouse hangerson old men with nothing better to do but watch the drama in other peoples lives plus an assortment of law clerks and students who probably wanted to watch the great honey chandler do her thing and a group of reporters with their pens poised over their pads openers always made a storybecause as the judge had said the lawyers could say anything they wanted after today bosch knew the reporters would drop in from time to time but there probably wouldnt be many other stories until closing statements and a verdict unless something unusual happened bosch looked directly behind him there was nobody in the benches back there he knew sylvia moore would not be there they had agreed on that before he didnt want her seeing this he had told her it was just a formality part of the cops burden to be sued for doing his job he knew the real reason he didnt want her here was because he had no control over this situation he had to sit there at the defense table and let people take their best shots anything could come up and probably would he didnt want her watching that he wondered now if the jury would see the empty seats behind him in the spectators gallery and think that maybe he was guilty because no one had come to show support when the murmur of laughter died down he looked back at the judge judge keyes was impressive up there on the bench he was a big man who wore the black robe well his thick forearms and big hands folded in front of his barrel chest giving a sense of reserved power his balding and sunreddened head was large and seemed perfectly round trimmed around the edges with gray hair and suggesting the organized storage of a massive amount of legal knowledge and perspective he was a transplanted southerner who had specialized in civil rights cases as a lawyer and had made a name for himself by suing the lapd for its disproportionate number of cases in which black citizens died after being put in chokeholds by officers he had been appointed to the federal bench by president jimmy carter right before he was sent back to georgia judge keyes had been ruling the roost in courtroom ever since boschs lawyer deputy city attorney rod belk had fought like hell during pretrial stages to have the judge disqualified on procedural ground and to get another judge assigned to the case preferably a judge without a background as a guardian of civil rights but he had failed however bosch was not as upset by this as belk he realized that judge keyes was cut from the same legal cloth as plaintiffs attorney honey chandlersuspicious of police even hateful at timesbut bosch sensed that beyond that he was ultimately a fair man and thats all bosch thought he needed to come out okay a fair shot at the system after all he knew in his heart his actions at the apartment in silverlake were correct he had done the right thing it will be up to you the judge was saying to the jury to decide if what the lawyers say is proven during trial remember that now ms chandler you go first honey chandler nodded at him and stood up she moved to the lectern that stood between the plaintiffs and the defense tables judge keyes had set the strict guidelines earlier in his courtroom there was no moving about no approaching the witness stand or jury box by lawyers anything said out loud by a lawyer was said from the lectern between the tables knowing the judges strict demand for compliance to his guidelines chandler even asked his permission before turning the heavy mahogany altar at an angle so she would face the jury while speaking the judge sternly nodded his approval good afternoon she began the judge is quite right when he tells you that this statement is nothing more than a road map good strategy bosch thought from the cellar of cynicism from which he viewed this whole case pander to the judge with your first sentence he watched chandler as she referred to the yellow legal pad she had put down on the lectern bosch noticed that over the top button of her blouse was a large pin with a round black onyx stone set in it it was flat and as dead as a sharks eye she had her hair pulled severely back and braided in a nononsense style behind her head but one tress of hair had come loose and it helped affect the image of a woman not preoccupied with her looks but totally focused on the law on the case on the heinous miscarriage of justice perpetrated by the defendant bosch believed she probably pulled the hair loose on purpose as he watched her start bosch remembered the thud he had felt in his chest when he heard she was the lawyer for churchs wife to him it was far more disturbing than learning judge keyes had been assigned the trial she was that good that was why they called her money i would like to take you down the road a piece chandler said and bosch wondered if she was even developing a southern accent now i just want to highlight what our case is about and what we believe the evidence will prove it is a civil rights case it involves the fatal shooting of a man named norman church at the hands of the police she paused here not to look at her yellow pad but for effect to gather all attention to what she would say next bosch looked over at the jury five women and seven men three blacks three latinos one asian and five whites they were looking at chandler with rapt attention this case chandler said is about a police officer who wasnt satisfied with his job and the vast powers it gave him this officer also wanted your job and he wanted judge keyess job and he wanted the states job of administering the verdicts and sentences set down by judges and juries he wanted it all this case is about detective harry bosch who you see sitting at the defendants table she pointed at bosch while drawing out the word deefendant belk immediately stood up and objected miss chandler does not need to point my client out to the jury or make sarcastic vocalizations yes we are at the defense table thats because this is a civil case and in this country anybody can sue anybody even the family of a objection your honor chandler shouted he is using his objection to further try to destroy the reputation of mr church who was never convicted of anything because enough judge keyes thundered objection sustained ms chandler we dont need to point we all know who we are we also do not need inflammatory accent being placed on any words words are beautiful and ugly all on their own let them stand for themselves as for mr belk i find it acutely annoying when opposing counsel interrupts opening statements or closing arguments you will have your turn sir i would suggest that you not object during ms chandlers statement unless an egregious trespass on your client has occurred i do not consider pointing at him worth the objection thank you your honor belk and chandler said in unison proceed ms chandler as i said in chambers this morning i want opening statements done by the end of the day and i have another matter at four thank you your honor she said again then turning back to the jury she said ladies and gentlemen we all need our police we all look up to our police most of themthe vast majority of themdo a thankless job and do it well the police department is an indispensable part of our society what would we do if we could not count on police officers to serve and protect us but that is not what this trial is about i want you to remember that as the trial progresses this is about what we would do if one member of that police force broke away from the rules and regulations the policies that govern that police force what we are talking about is called a rogue cop and the evidence will show that harry bosch is a rogue cop a man who one night four years ago decided to be judge jury and executioner he shot a man that he thought was a killer a heinous serial killer yes but at the moment the defendant chose to pull out his gun and fire on mr norman church there was no legal evidence of that now you are going to hear from the defense all manner of supposed evidence that police said they found that connected mr church to these killings but remember during the trial where this evidence came fromthe police themselvesand when it was foundafter mr church had been executed i think we will show that this supposed evidence is questionable at best tainted at best and in effect you will have to decide if mr church a married man with two young children and a wellpaying job at an aircraft factory was indeed this killer the socalled dollmaker or simply was made the fall guy the scapegoat by a police department covering up the sin of one of its own the brutal unwarranted and unnecessary execution of an unarmed man she continued on speaking at length about the code of silence known to exist in the department the forces long history of brutality the rodney king beating and the riots somehow according to honey chandler these were all black flowers on a plant grown from a seed that was harry boschs killing of norman church bosch heard her go on but wasnt really listening anymore he kept his eyes open and occasionally made eye contact with a juror but he was off on his own this was his own defense the lawyers the jurors and the judge were going to take a week maybe longer to dissect what he had thought and done in less than five seconds to be able to sit in the courtroom for this he was going to have to be able to go off on his own in his private reverie he thought of churchs face at the end in the apartment over the garage on hyperion street they had locked eyes the eyes bosch had seen were killers eyes as dark as the stone at chandlers throat even if he was reaching for a gun would that matter chandler was saying a man had kicked the door open a man with a gun who could blame someone for reaching according to police for a weapon for protection the fact that he was reaching for something seemingly as laughable as a hairpiece makes this episode all the more repugnant he was killed in cold blood our society cannot accept that bosch tuned her out again and thought of the new victim entombed for what was likely years in a concrete floor he wondered if a missingperson report was ever taken if there was a mother or father or husband or child wondering all this time about her after returning from the scene he had started to tell belk about the discovery he asked the lawyer to ask judge keyes for a continuance to delay the trial until the new death could be sorted out but belk had cut him off telling him that the less he knew the better belk seemed so frightened of the implications of the new discovery that he determined that the best tack was to do the opposite of what bosch suggested he wanted to hurry the trial through before news of the discovery and its possible connection to the dollmaker became public chandler was now near the end of the onehour allotment for her opener she had gone on at length about the police departments shooting policy and bosch thought she might have lost the grip she had on the jury in the beginning for a while she had even lost belk who sat next to bosch paging through his own yellow pad and rehearsing his opener in his head belk was a large manalmost eighty pounds overweight bosch guessedand prone to sweating even in the overly cooled courtroom bosch had often wondered during the jury selection if the sweating was belks response to the burden of weight he carried or the burden of trying a case against chandler and before judge keyes belk couldnt be over thirty bosch guessed maybe five years max out of a middlerange law school and in over his head going up against chandler the word justice brought boschs attention back he knew that chandler had turned it up a notch and was coming down the backstretch when she started using the word in almost every sentence in civil court justice and money were interchangeable because they meant the same thing justice for norman church was fleeting it lasted all of a few seconds justice was the time it took detective bosch to kick open the door point his satinfinished mm smith amp wesson and pull the trigger justice was one shot the bullet detective bosch chose to execute mr church with was called an xtp that is short for extreme terminal performance its a bullet that expands to times its width on impact and takes out huge portions of tissue and organ in its path it took out mr churchs heart that was justice bosch noticed that many of the jurors were not looking at chandler but at the plaintiffs table by leaning forward slightly he could see past the lectern and saw that the widow deborah church was dabbing tears on her cheeks with a tissue she was a bellshaped woman with short dark hair and small pale blue eyes she had been the epitome of the suburban housewife and mother until the morning bosch killed her husband and the cops showed up at her house with their search warrant and the reporters showed up with their questions bosch had actually felt sorry for her even counted her as a victim until she hired money chandler and started calling him a murderer the evidence will show ladies and gentlemen that detective bosch is a product of his department chandler said a callous arrogant machine that dispensed justice as he saw it on his own you will be asked if this is what you want from your police department you will be asked to right a wrong to provide justice for a family whose father and husband was taken in closing i would like to quote to you from a german philosopher named friedrich nietzsche who wrote something a century ago that i think is germane to what we are doing today he said whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster and when you look into the abyss the abyss also looks into you ladies and gentlemen that is what this case is about detective harry bosch has not only looked into the abyss but on the night norman church was murdered it looked into him the darkness engulfed him and detective bosch fell he became that which he served to fight a monster i think you will find that the evidence will lead you to no other conclusion thank you chandler sat down and patted her hand in a there there gesture on deborah churchs arm bosch of course knew this was done for the jurys sake not the widows the judge looked up at the brass hands of the clock built into the mahogany paneling above the courtroom door and declared a fifteenminute recess before belk would take the lectern as he stood for the jury bosch noticed one of churchs daughters staring at him from the front row of the spectators section he guessed she was about thirteen the older one nancy he quickly looked away and then felt guilty he wondered if anyone in the jury saw this belk said he needed the break time alone to go over his statement to the jury bosch felt like going up to the snack bar on the sixth floor because he still had not eaten but it was likely a few of the jurors would go there or worse yet members of churchs family instead he took the escalator down to the lobby and went out to the ash can in front of the building he lit a cigarette and leaned back against the base of the statue he realized that he was clammy with sweat beneath his suit chandlers hourlong opener had seemed like an eternityan eternity with the eyes of the world on him he knew the suit wouldnt last the week and he would have to make sure his other one was clean thinking about such minor details finally helped relax him he had already put one butt out in the sand and was on his second smoke when the steelandglass door to the courthouse opened honey chandler had used her back to push open the heavy door and therefore hadnt seen him she turned as she came through the door her head bent down as she lit a cigarette with a gold lighter as she straightened and exhaled she saw him she walked toward the ash can ready to bury the fresh cigarette its okay bosch said its the only one around as far as i know it is but i dont think it does either of us good to have to face each other outside of court he shrugged and didnt say anything it was her move she could leave if she wanted to she took another drag on the cigarette just a half i have to get back in anyway he nodded and looked out toward spring street in front of the county courthouse he saw a line of people waiting to go in through the metal detectors more boat people he thought he saw the homeless man coming up the pavement to make his afternoon check of the ash can the man suddenly turned around and walked back out to spring and away he looked back once uneasily over his shoulder as he went he knows me bosch looked back at chandler he knows you he used to be a lawyer i knew him then tom somethingorother i cant remember at thefaraday thats it i guess he didnt want me to see him that way but everybody around here knows about him hes the reminder of what can happen when things go terribly wrong what happened its a long story maybe your lawyer will tell you can i ask you something bosch didnt answer why didnt the city settle this case rodney king the riots its the worst time in the world to take a police case to trial i dont think bulkthats what i call him because i know he calls me money i dont think hes got a hold on this one and youll be the one hung out to dry bosch thought a moment before answering its off the record detective bosch she said im just making conversation i told him not to settle i told him if he wanted to settle id go out and pay for my own lawyer that sure of yourself huh she paused to inhale on her cigarette well well see i guess i guess you know its nothing personal he knew she would get around to saying that the biggest lie in the game maybe not for you oh it is for you you shoot an unarmed man and then you take it personally when his wife objects when she sues you your clients husband used to cut the strap off the purses of his victims tie it in a slipknot around their neck and then slowly but steadily strangle them while he was raping them he preferred leather straps he didnt seem to care about what women he did this to just the leather she didnt even flinch he hadnt expected her to thatslate husband my clients late husband and the only thing that is for sure in this case that is provable is that you killed him yeah and id do it again i know detective bosch thats why were here she pursed her lips in a frozen kiss which sharply set the line of her jaw her hair caught the glint of the afternoon sun she angrily stubbed her cigarette out in the sand and then went back inside she swung the door open as if it were made of balsa wood bosch pulled into the rear parking lot of the hollywood station on wilcox shortly before four belk had used only ten minutes of his allotted hour for his opening statement and judge keyes had recessed early saying he wanted to start testimony on a separate day from openers so the jury would not confuse evidentiary testimony with the lawyers words bosch had felt uneasy with belks short discourse in front of the jurors but belk had told him there was nothing to worry about he walked in through the back door near the tank and took the rear hallway to the detective bureau by four the bureau is usually deserted it was that way when bosch walked in except for jerry edgar who was parked in front of one of the ibms typing on a form bosch recognized as a an investigating officers chronological record he looked up and saw bosch approaching whereyat harry right here got done early i see dont tell me directed verdict the judge threw money chandler out on her ass i wish yeah i know what do you have so far edgar said there was nothing so far no identification yet bosch sat down at his desk and loosened his tie poundss office was dark so it was safe to light a cigarette his mind trailed off into thinking about the trial and money chandler she had captured the jury for most of her argument she had in effect called bosch a murderer hitting with a gutlevel emotional charge belk had responded with a dissertation on the law and a police officers right to use deadly force when danger was near even if it turned out there was no danger no gun beneath the pillow belk said churchs own actions created the climate of danger that allowed bosch to act as he did finally belk had countered chandlers nietzsche by quotingthe art of war by sun tzu belk said bosch had entered the dying ground when he kicked churchs apartment door open at that point he had to fight or perish shoot or be shot secondguessing his actions afterward was unjust sitting across from edgar now bosch acknowledged to himself that it hadnt worked belk had been boring while chandler had been interesting and convincing they were starting in the hole he noticed edgar had stopped talking and harry had not registered anything he had said what about prints he asked harry you listening to me i just said we finished with the rubber silicone about an hour ago donovan got prints off the hand he said they look good came up in the rubber pretty well hell start the doj run tonight and probably by morning well have the similars it will probably take him the rest of the morning to go through them but at least theyre not letting this one drown in the backup pounds gave it a priority status good let me know what comes out ill be in and out all week i guess harry dont worry ill let you know what weve got but try to stay cool look you got the right guy you got any doubt about that not before today then dont worry might is right money chandler can blow the judge and the whole jury its not going to change that right is might what nothing bosch thought about what edgar had said about chandler it was interesting how often a threat from a woman even a professional woman was reduced by cops to a sexual threat he believed that most cops might be like edgar thinking there was something about chandlers sexuality that gave her an edge they would not admit that she was damn good at her job whereas the fat city attorney defending bosch wasnt bosch stood up and went back to the file cabinets he unlocked one of his drawers and dug into the back to pull out two of the blue binders that were called murder books both were heavy about three inches thick on the spine of the first it saidbios the other was labeleddocs they were from the dollmaker case whos testifying tomorrow edgar called from across the squad room i dont know the order the judge wouldnt make her say but shes got me subpoenaed also lloyd and irving shes got amado the me coordinator and even bremmer they all gotta show up and then shell say which ones shell put on tomorrow and which ones later thetimes isnt going to let bremmer testify they always fight that shit yeah but he isnt subpoenaed as atimes reporter he wrote that book about the case so she served paper on him as the author judge keyes already ruled he doesnt have the same reportersshield rightstimes lawyers may show up to argue but the judge already made the ruling bremmer testifies see what i mean shes probably already been back in chambers with that old guy anyway its no matter bremmer cant hurt you that book made you out like the hero who saved the day i guess harry come here and take a look at this edgar got up from his typing station and went over to the file cabinets he gingerly slid a cardboard box off the top and put it down on the homicide table it was about the size of a hatbox gotta be careful donovan says it should set overnight he lifted off the top of the box and there was a womans face set in white plaster the face was turned slightly so that its right side was fully sculpted in the plaster most of the lower left side the jawline was missing the eyes were closed the mouth slightly open and irregular the hairline was almost unnoticeable the face seemed swollen by the right eye it was like a classical frieze bosch had seen in a cemetery or a museum somewhere but it wasnt beautiful it was a death mask looks like the guy popped her on the eye it swelled up bosch nodded but didnt speak there was something unnerving about looking at the face in the box more so than looking at an actual dead body he didnt know why edgar finally put the top back on the box and carefully put it back on top of the file cabinet what are you going to do with it not sure if we dont get anything from the prints it might be our only way of getting an id theres an anthropologist at cal state northridge that contracts with the coroner to make facial recreations usually hes working from a skeleton a skull ill take this to him and see if he can maybe finish the face put a blonde wig on it or something he can paint the plaster too give it a skin color i dont know its probably just pissing in the wind but i figure its worth a try edgar returned to the typewriter and bosch sat down in front of the murder books he opened the binder markedbios but then sat there and watched edgar for a few moments he did not know whether he should admire edgars hustle on the case or not they had been partners once and bosch had essentially spent a year training him to be a homicide investigator but he was never sure how much of it took edgar was always going off to look at real estate taking twohour lunches to go to closings he never seemed to understand that the homicide squad wasnt a job it was a mission as surely as murder was an art for some who committed it homicide investigation was an art for those on the mission and it chose you you didnt choose it with that in mind it was hard for bosch to accept that edgar was busting ass on the case for the right reasons whatre you looking at edgar asked without looking up from the ibm or stopping his typing nothing i was just thinking about stuff harry dont worry its going to work out bosch dumped his cigarette butt in a styrofoam cup of dead coffee and lit another did the priority pounds put on the case open up the ot absolutely edgar said smiling youre looking at a man who has his head fully in the overtime trough at least he was honest about it bosch thought content that his original take on edgar was still intact bosch went back to the murder book and ran his fingers along the edge of the thick sheaf of reports on its three rings there were eleven divider tabs each marked with a name of one of the dollmakers victims he began leafing from section to section looking at the crime scene photographs from each killing and the biographical data of each victim the women had all come from similar backgrounds street prostitutes the higherclass escort outfits strippers porno actresses who did outcall work on the side the dollmaker had moved comfortably along the underside of the city he had found his victims with the same ease that they had gone into the darkness with him there was a pattern in that bosch remembered the task forces psychologist had said but looking at the frozen faces of death in the photographs bosch remembered that the task force had never gotten a fix on common physical aspects of the victims there were blondes and brunettes heavyset women and frail drug addicts there were six white women two latinas two asians and a black woman no pattern the dollmaker had been indiscriminate in that respect his only identifiable pattern being that he sought only women on the edgethat place where choices are limited and they go easily with a stranger the psychologist had said each of the women was like an injured fish sending off an invisible signal that inevitably drew the shark she was white right he asked edgar edgar stopped typing yeah thats what the coroner said they already did the cut who no the autopsys tomorrow or the next day but coraz√≥n took a look when we brought it in she guessed that the stiff had been white why nothing blonde yeah at least when she died bleached if youre going to ask if i checked missing persons on a white blonde chick who went into the wind four years ago fuck you harry i can use the ot but that description wouldnt narrow it down to but three four hundred i aint going to wade into that when ill probably pull a name on the prints tomorrow waste of time yeah i know i just wish you just wish you had some answers we all do but things take time sometimes my man edgar started typing again and harry looked down into the binder but he couldnt help but think about the face in the box no name no occupation they knew nothing about her but something about the plaster cast told him she had somehow fit into the dollmakers pattern there was a hardness there that had nothing to do with the plaster she had come from the edge anything else found in the concrete after i left edgar stopped typing exhaled loudly and shook his head how do you mean like the cigarette package with the other ones the dollmaker left their purses hed cut the straps off to strangle them but when he dumped the bodies we always found the purses and clothes nearby only thing missing was their makeup he always kept their makeup not this timeat least in the concrete pounds left a uniform on the site while they finished tearing it up nothing else was found that stuff mightve been stashed in the storage room and got burned up or looted harry whatre you thinking copycat i guess yeah me too bosch nodded and told edgar he was sorry he kept interrupting he went back to studying the reports after a few minutes edgar rolled the form out of the typewriter and brought it back to the homicide table he snapped it into a new binder with the thin stack of paperwork from the days case and put it into a file cabinet behind his chair he then went through his daily ritual of calling his wife while straightening up the blotter the message spike and the message pad at his place he told her he had to make a quick stop on his way home listening to the conversation made bosch think of sylvia moore and some of the domestic rituals that had become ingrained for them im outta here harry edgar said after hanging up bosch nodded so how come youre hanging around i dont know im just reading through this stuff so ill know what im saying when i testify that was a lie he didnt need the murder books to refresh his memory of the dollmaker i hope you tear money chandler up shell probably rip me shes good well i gotta hit it ill see you hey remember if you get a name tomorrow give me a beep or something after edgar was gone bosch looked at his watchit was fiveand turned on the tv that sat on top of the file cabinet next to the box with the face in it while he was waiting for the story on the body he picked up his phone and dialed sylvias house im not going to make it out there tonight harry whats wrong how did the opening statements go its not the trial its another case a body was found today looks a lot like the dollmaker did it we got a note at the station basically said i killed the wrong guy that the dollmaker the real one is still out there can it be true i dont know there had been no doubt before today how could wait a minute the storys on the news channel ill put it on they watched on separate tvs but connected by phone as the story was reported on the early news show the anchor reported nothing about the dollmaker there was an aerial shot of the scene and then a sound bite of pounds saying that little was known that an anonymous tip had led police to the body harry and sylvia both laughed when they saw poundss charsmeared forehead it felt good to bosch to laugh after the report sylvia turned serious so he didnt tell the media well we have to make sure we have to figure out whats going on first it was either him or a copycat or maybe he had a partner we didnt know about when will you know which direction to go it was a nice way of asking when hed know if he had killed an innocent man i dont know probably tomorrow autopsy will tell us some things but the id will tell us when she died harry it wasnt the dollmaker dont you worry thanks sylvia her unequivocal loyalty was beautiful he thought he then immediately felt guilty because he had never been totally open with her about all the things that concerned them he had been the one who held back you still havent said how it went in court today or why you arent coming out here like you said you would its this new case they found today i am involved and i want to do some thinking on it you can think anywhere harry you know what i mean yes i do and court it went fine i guess we only had openers testimony starts tomorrow but this new case its sort of hanging over everything he switched the channels as he spoke but he had missed reports on the new body discovery on the other channels well whats your lawyer say about it nothing he doesnt want to know about it what a shit he just wants to get through the case quickly hope that if the dollmaker or a partner is still running around out there that we dont confirm it until the trial is over but harry that is unethical even if it is evidence in the plaintiffs favor doesnt he have to bring it forward yes if he knows about it thats just it he doesnt want to know about it that makes him safe when will it be your turn to testify i want to be there i can take a personal day and be there no dont worry its all a formality i dont want you to know any more about this story than you do already why its your story no its not its his he hung up after telling her hed call her the next day afterward he looked at the phone on the table in front of him for a long time he and sylvia moore had been spending three or four nights a week together for nearly a year though sylvia had been the one who spoke of changing the arrangement and even had her house for sale bosch had never wanted to touch the question for fear that it might disturb the fragile balance and comfort he felt with her he wondered now if he was doing just that disturbing the balance he had lied to her he was involved in the new case to some degree but he was done for the day and was going home he had lied because he felt the need to be alone with his thoughts with the dollmaker he flipped through the second binder to the back where there were clear plastic ziploc pouches for holding documentary evidence in these were copies of the dollmakers previous letters there were three of them the killer had begun sending them after the media firestorm started and he had been christened with the name dollmaker one had gone to bosch prior to the eleventh killingthe last the other two had gone to bremmer at thetimes after the seventh and eleventh killings harry now studied the photocopy of the envelope that was addressed to him in a printed script of block letters then he looked at the poem on the folded page it also had been printed in the same oddly slanted block script he read the words he already knew by heart i feel compelled to forewarn and forsake tnight im out for a snackmy lust partake another doll for the shelf as it weret she breathes her lastjust as i squirt a little late mommy and daddy weeple a fine young miss neath my steeple as i tight the purse strings fore preparing the wash i hear the last gaspa sound like boschhhhh bosch closed the binders and put them in his briefcase he turned off the tv and headed out to the back parking lot he held the station door for two uniform cops who were wrestling with a handcuffed drunk the drunk threw a kick out at him but harry stepped outside of its reach he pointed the caprice north and took outpost road up to mulholland which he then took to woodrow wilson after pulling into the carport he sat with his hands on the wheel for a long time he thought about the letters and the signature the dollmaker had left on each victims body the cross painted on the toenail after church was dead they figured out what it had meant the cross had been the steeple the steeple of a church in the morning bosch sat on the rear deck of his house and watched the sun come up over the cahuenga pass it burned away the morning fog and bathed the wildflowers on the hillside that had burned the winter before he watched and smoked and drank coffee until the sound of traffic on the hollywood freeway became one uninterrupted hiss from the pass below he dressed in his dark blue suit with a white shirt that had a buttondown collar as he put on a maroon tie dotted with gold gladiator helmets in front of the bedroom mirror he wondered about how he must appear to the jurors he had noticed the day before that when he made eye contact with any of the twelve they were always the first to look away what did that mean he would have liked to ask belk what it meant but he did not like belk and knew he would feel uncomfortable asking his opinion on anything using the same hole poked through it before he secured the tie in place with his silver tie tack that said the california penal code for murder he used a plastic comb to put his brownandgray hair still wet from the shower in place and then combed his mustache he put visine drops in his eyes and then leaned close to the glass to study them redrimmed from little sleep the irises as dark as ice on asphalt why do they look away from me he wondered again he thought about how chandler had described him the day before and he knew why he was heading to the door briefcase in hand when it opened before he got there sylvia stepped in while pulling her key out of the lock hi she said when she saw him i hoped id catch you she smiled she was wearing khaki pants and a pink shirt with a buttondown collar he knew she did not wear dresses on tuesday and thursday because those were her assigned days as a schoolyard rover sometimes she had to run after students sometimes she had to break up fights the sun coming through the porch door turned her dark blonde hair gold catch me at what she came to him smiling still and they kissed i know im making you late im late too but i just wanted to come and say good luck today not that you need it he held on to her smelling her hair it had been nearly a year since they met but bosch still held to her sometimes with the fear that she might abruptly turn and leave declare her attraction to him a mistake perhaps he was still a substitute for the husband shed lost a cop like harry a narcotics detective whose apparent suicide bosch had investigated their relationship had progressed to a point of complete comfortableness but in recent weeks he had felt a sense of inertia begin to set in she had too and had even talked about it she said the problem was he could not drop his guard completely and he knew this was true bosch had spent a lifetime alone but not necessarily lonely he had secrets many of them buried too deep to give up to her not so soon thanks for coming by he said pulling back and looking down into her face to see the light still there she had gotten a fleck of lipstick on one of her front teeth you be careful in the yard today huh yes then she frowned i know what you said but i want to come and watch courtat least one day i want to be there for you harry you dont have to be there to be there know what i mean she nodded but he knew his answer didnt satisfy her they dropped it and smalltalked for a few minutes more making plans to get together that night for dinner bosch said he would come to her place in bouquet canyon they kissed again and headed out he to court and she to the high school both places fraught with danger there was always an adrenaline rush at the start of each day as the courtroom fell silent and they waited for the judge to open his door and step up to the bench it was and still no sign of the judge which was unusual because he had been a stickler for promptness during the week of jury selection bosch looked around and saw several reporters maybe more than the day before he found this curious since opening arguments were always such a draw belk leaned toward bosch and whispered keyes is probably in there reading thetimes story did you see it running late because of sylvia bosch had had no time to read the paper hed left it on the mat at the front door whatd it say the paneled door opened and the judge came out before belk could answer hold the jury miss rivera the judge said to his clerk he dropped his girth into his padded chair surveyed the courtroom and said counsel any matters for discussion before we bring the jury in ms chandler yes your honor chandler said as she walked to the lectern today she had on the gray suit she had been alternating among three suits since jury selection began belk had told bosch that this was because she didnt want to give the jurors the idea that she was wealthy he said women lawyers could lose women jurors over something like that your honor the plaintiff asks for sanctions against detective bosch and mr belk she held up the folded metro section of thetimes bosch could see the story had caught the bottom right corner same as the story the day before the headline said concrete blonde tied to dollmaker belk stood but did not say anything for once observing the judges strict decorum of noninterruption sanctions for what ms chandler the judge asked your honor the discovery of this body yesterday has a tremendous evidentiary impact on this case as an officer of the court it was incumbent upon mr belk to bring this information forward under rule of discovery defendants attorney must your honor belk interrupted i was not informed of this development until last night my intention was to bring the matter forward this morning she is hold it right there mr belk one at a time in my courtroom seems you need a daily reminder of that ms chandler i read that story you are referring to and though detective bosch was mentioned because of this case he was not quoted and mr belk has rather rudely pointed out that he knew nothing about this until after court yesterday frankly i dont see a sanctionable offense here unless youve got a card you havent played she did your honor detective bosch was well aware of this development whether quoted or not he was at the scene during yesterdays lunch break your honor belk tried timidly judge keyes turned but looked at bosch not belk that right detective bosch what she says bosch looked at belk for a moment and then up at the judge fucking belk he thought his lie had left bosch holding the bag i was there your honor when i got back here for the afternoon session there was no time to tell mr belk about the discovery i told him after court last night i didnt see the paper yet this morning and i dont know what it says but nothing has been confirmed about this body in regard to the dollmaker or anyone else there isnt even an id yet your honor chandler said detective bosch has conveniently forgotten that we had a fifteenminute break during the afternoon session i should think that was ample time for the detective to fill in his attorney on such important information the judge looked at bosch i wanted to tell him during the break but mr belk said he needed the time to prepare his opening statement the judge eyed him closely for several seconds without saying anything bosch could tell the judge knew he was pushing the edge of the envelope of truth judge keyes seemed to be making some kind of decision well ms chandler he finally said i dont rightly see the conspiracy that you do here im going to let this go with a warning to all parties withholding evidence is the most heinous crime you can commit in my courtroom if you do it and i catch ya youre gonna wish you never took the lsat now do we want to talk about this new development your honor belk said quickly he moved to the lectern in light of this discovery less than twentyfour hours ago i move for a continuance so that this situation can be thoroughly investigated so that it can be determined exactly what it means to this case now he finally asks bosch thought he knew there was no way hed get a delay now uh huh judge keyes said what do you think about that ms chandler no delay your honor this family has waited four years for this trial i think any further delay would be perpetuating the crime besides who does mr belk propose investigate this matter detective bosch i am sure the defense counselor would be satisfied with the lapd handling the investigation the judge said but i wouldnt i know you wouldnt ms chandler but thats not your concern you said yourself yesterday that the wide majority of police in this city are good competent people youll just have to live by your own words but i am going to deny the request for a continuation weve started a trial and were not going to stop the police can and should investigate this matter and keep the court informed but im not going to stand by this case will continue until such time that these events need to be addressed again anything else ive got a jury waiting what about the story in the newspaper belk asked what about it your honor id like the jury to be polled to see if anyone read it also they should be warned again not to read the papers or watch the tv news tonight all of the channels will likely follow thetimes i instructed jurors yesterday not to read the paper or watch the news but i plan to poll them anyway about this very story lets see what they say and then depending on what we hear we can clear em out again if you want to talk about a mistrial i dont want a mistrial chandler said thats what the defendant wants thatll just delay this another two months this family has already waited four years for justice they well lets just see what the jury says sorry to interrupt ms chandler your honor may i be heard on sanctions belk said i dont think you need to be mr belk i denied her motion for sanctions what mores to be said i know that your honor i would like to ask for sanctions against miss chandler she has defamed me by alleging this coverup of the evidence and i mr belk sit down ill tell you both right now quit with the extracurricular sparring because it doesnt get you anywhere with me no sanctions either way one last time any other matters yes your honor chandler said she had one more card from beneath her legal pad she pulled out a document and walked it up to the clerk who handed it to the judge chandler then returned to the lectern your honor that is a subpoena i have prepared for the police department that i would like reflected in the record i am asking that a copy of the note referred to in thetimes article the note written by the dollmaker and received yesterday be released to me as part of discovery belk jumped to his feet hold on mr belk the judge admonished let her finish your honor it is evidence in this case it should be turned over immediately judge keyes gave belk the nod and the deputy city attorney lumbered to the lectern chandler having to back up to give him room your honor this note is in no way evidence in this case it has not been verified as having come from anybody however it is evidence in a murder case unattached to this proceeding and it is not the lapds practice to parade its evidence out in an open court while there is a suspect still at large i ask that you deny her request judge keyes clasped his hands together and thought a moment tell you what mr belk you get a copy of the note and bring it in here ill take a look and then decide if it will be entered in evidence thats all ms rivera call in the jury please were losing the morning after the jury was in the box and everybody in court sat down judge keyes asked who had seen any news stories relating to the case no one in the box raised a hand bosch knew that if any one of them had seen the story they wouldnt admit to it anyway to do so would be to invite certain dismissal from the jurya ticket straight back to the jury assembly room where the minutes tick by like hours very well the judge said call your first witness ms chandler terry lloyd took the witness stand like a man who was as familiar with it as the recliner chair he got drunk in every night in front of the tv set he even adjusted the microphone in front of him without any help from the clerk lloyd had a drinkers badge of a nose and unusually dark brown hair for a man of his age which was pushing sixty that was because it was obvious to everyone who looked at him except maybe himself that he wore a rug chandler went through some preliminary questions establishing that he was a lieutenant in the la pd s elite robberyhomicide division during a period beginning four and a half years ago were you placed in charge of a task force of detectives attempting to identify a serial killer yes i was can you tell the jury how that came about and functioned it was put together after the same killer was identified as the perpetrator in five killings we were unofficially known in the department as the westside strangler task force after the media got wind of it the killer became known as the dollmakerbecause he used the victims own makeup to paint their faces like dolls i had eighteen detectives assigned to the task force we broke them up into two squads a and b squad a worked a day shift b took the nights we investigated the killings as they occurred and followed the callin leads after it hit the media we were getting maybe a hundred calls a weekpeople saying this guy or that guy was the dollmaker we had to check them all out the task force no matter what it was called was not successful is that correct no maam that is wrong we were successful we got the killer and who was that norman church was the killer was he identified as such before or after he was killed after he was good for all of them and good for the department too i dont follow it was good for the department that you were able to connect him to the murders otherwise youd ask questions ms chandler the judge interrupted sorry your honor lieutenant lloyd the man you say was the killer norman church was not killed himself until there were at least six more murders following the establishment of the task force is that correct correct allowing at least six more women to be strangled how is that considered successful by the department we didnt allow anything we did the best we could to track down this perpetrator we eventually did that made us successful very successful in my book in your book tell me lieutenant lloyd had the name norman church come up at any time in the investigation before the night he was shot to death while unarmed by detective bosch any reference at all no it hadnt but we connected just answer the question i ask lieutenant thank you chandler referred to her yellow pad on the lectern bosch noticed that belk was alternately taking notes on one pad in front of him and writing down questions on another okay lieutenant chandler said your task force did not catch up with a supposed perpetrator as you call it until six deaths after you started would it be fair to say you and your detectives were under severe pressure to catch him to close this case we were under pressure yes from who who was pressuring you lieutenant lloyd well we had the papers tv the department was on me how so the department i mean did you have meetings with your supervisors i had daily meetings with the rhd captain and weekliesevery mondaywith the police chief what did they tell you about solving the case they said get the thing solved people were dying i didnt need to be told that but they did anyway and did you communicate that to the task force detectives of course but they didnt need to be told it either these guys were looking at the bodies every time one showed up it was hard they wanted this guy bad they didnt need to read it in the papers or hear it from the chief or even me for that matter lloyd seemed to be getting off on his copasalonelyhunter tangent bosch could see that he didnt realize he had walked into chandlers trap she was going to argue at the end of the trial that bosch and the cops were under such pressure to find a killer that bosch killed church and then they fabricated his ties to the killings the fallguy theory harry wished he could call time out and tell lloyd to shut the hell up so everyone on the task force knew there was pressure to find a killer not a killerthe killer yes there was pressure its part of the job what was detective boschs role on the task force he was my b squad supervisor he worked the night shift he was a detective third grade so he kind of ran things when i wasnt there which was often primarily i was a floater but i usually worked the day shift with squad a do you recall saying to detective bosch weve gotta get this guy words to that effect not specifically but i said words to that effect at squad meetings he was there but that was our goal nothing wrong with that we had to get this guy same situation id say it again bosch began to feel that lloyd was paying him back for having stolen the show closing the case without him his answers no longer appeared to be grounded in congenial stupidity but in malice bosch bent close to belk and whispered hes fucking me because he didnt get to shoot church himself belk put his finger to his lips signaling harry to be quiet he then went back to writing on one of his two pads have you ever heard of the fbis behavioral science division chandler asked yes i have what do they do they study serial killers among other things come up with psychological profiles victim profiles give advice things like that you had eleven murders what advice did the fbis behavioral science division give you none why was that were they stumped no we didnt call on them ah and why didnt you call them well maam we believed we had a handle on it we had worked up profiles ourselves and we didnt think the fbi could help us much the forensic psychologist helping us dr locke from usc had once been an adviser to the fbi on sex crimes we had his experience and the departments staff psychiatrist helping out we believed we were in good shape in that department did the fbi offer their help lloyd hesitated here it seemed he was finally understanding where she was headed uh yes somebody called after the case was making a lot of press they wanted to get in on it i told them we were fine that no help was needed do you regret that decision now no i dont think the fbi couldve done any better than us they usually come in on cases being handled by smaller departments or cases making a big media splash and you dont think thats fair correct what bigfooting i think its called you didnt want the fbi coming in and taking over right no it was like i said we were okay without them isnt it true that the lapd and the fbi have a longstanding history of jealousies and competitiveness that has resulted in the two agencies rarely communicating or working together no i dont buy that it didnt matter if he bought it bosch knew she was making her points with the jury whetherthey bought it was the only thing that mattered your task force came up with a suspect profile correct yes i believe i just mentioned that she asked judge keyes if she could approach the witness with a document she said was plaintiffs exhibit a she handed it to the clerk who handed it to lloyd what is that lieutenant this is a composite drawing and the psychological profile we came up with after i think the seventh killing how did you come up with the drawing of the suspect between the seventh and eighth victims we had an intended victim who managed to survive she was able to get away from the man and call the police working with this survivor we came up with the drawing okay are you familiar with the facial appearance of norman church not to a great extent i saw him after he was dead chandler asked to approach again and submitted plaintiffs a a collage of several photographs of church taped to a piece of cardboard she gave lloyd a few moments to study them do you see any resemblance between the composite drawing and the photographs of mr church lloyd hesitated and then said our killer was known to wear disguises and our witnessthe victim who got awaywas a drug user she was a porno actress she wasnt reliable your honor can you instruct the witness to answer the questions that are asked the judge did so no lloyd said his head bowed after being chastised no resemblance okay chandler said going back to the profile you have there where did that come from primarily from dr locke at usc and dr shafer an lapd staff psychiatrist i think they consulted with some others before writing it up can you read that first paragraph yes it says subject is believed to be a white male twentyfive to thirtyfive years old with minimal college education he is a physically strong man though may not be large in appearance he lives alone alienated from family and friends he is reacting to a deeprooted hatred of women suggesting an abusive mother or female guardian his painting of the faces of his victims with makeup is his attempt to remake women into an image that pleases him that smiles at him they become dolls not threats do you want me to read the part that outlines the repetitive traits of the killings no that is not necessary you were involved in the investigation of mr church after he was killed by bosch correct correct list for the jury all of the traits in the suspect profile that your task force found that matched mr church lloyd looked down at the paper in his hands for a long time without speaking ill help you get started lieutenant chandler said he was a white male correct yes what else is similar did he live alone no he actually had a wife and two daughters correct yes was he between twentyfive and thirtyfive years old no actually he was thirtynine years old correct yes did he have a minimal education no actually he had a masters degree in mechanical engineering didnt he then what was he doing there in that room lloyd said angrily why was the makeup from the victims there why answer the question asked of you lieutenant judge keyes interjected dont go asking questions that isnt your job here sorry your honor lloyd said yes he had a masters degree im not sure exactly what it was for you mentioned the makeup in your nonresponsive answer a moment ago chandler said what did you mean in the garage apartment where church was killed makeup that belonged to nine of the victims was found in a cabinet in the bathroom it tied him directly to those cases nine of elevenit was convincing who found the makeup in there harry bosch did when he went there alone and killed him is that a question no lieutenant i withdraw it she paused to let the jury think about that while she flipped through her yellow pages lieutenant lloyd tell us about that night what happened lloyd told the story as it had been described dozens of times before on tv in newspapers in bremmers book it was midnight squad b was going off shift when the task force hot line rang and bosch took the call the last of the night a street prostitute named dixie mcqueen said she had just escaped from the dollmaker bosch went alone because the others on squad b had gone home and he figured it might be another dead end he picked the woman up at hollywood and western and followed her directions into silverlake on hyperion she convinced bosch she had escaped from the dollmaker and pointed to the lighted windows of an apartment over a garage bosch went up alone a few moments later norman church was dead he kicked open the door chandler asked yes there was the thought that maybe he had gone and gotten somebody to take the prostitutes place did he shout that he was police yes how do you know he said so any witnesses hear it no what about miss mcqueen the prostitute no bosch had kept her in the car parked on the street in case there was trouble so what youre saying is we have detective boschs word that he feared there might be another victim that he identified himself and that mr church made a threatening move toward the pillow yes lloyd said reluctantly i notice lieutenant lloyd that you wear a toupee yourself there was some muffled laughter from the back bosch turned and saw that the media contingent was steadily growing he saw bremmer sitting in the gallery now yes lloyd said his face had turned red to match his nose have you ever put your toupee under your pillow is that the proper care for it no nothing further your honor judge keyes looked at the clock at the wall and then at belk what do you think mr belk break for lunch now so you wont be interrupted i only have one question oh then by all means ask it belk took his pad to the lectern and leaned to the microphone lieutenant lloyd from all of your knowledge about this case do you have any doubt whatsoever that norman church was the dollmaker none at all none at all after the jury filed out bosch leaned to belks ear and urgently whispered what was that she tore him up and you asked only one question what about all the other things that tied church to the case belk held up his hand to calm bosch and then spoke calmly because you are going to testify about all of that this case is about you harry we either win it or lose it with you the code seven had closed its dining room during the recession and somebody put a salad and pizza bar in the space to serve the office workers from the civic center the sevens barroom was still open but the dining room had been the last place within walking distance of parker center that bosch had liked to eat at so during the lunch break he got his car out of the lot at parker and drove over to the garment district to eat at gorkys the russian restaurant served breakfast all day and he ordered the eggs bacon and potatoes special and took it to a table where someone had left behind a copy of thetimes the concrete blonde story had bremmers byline on it it combined quotes from the opening arguments in the trial with the discovery of the body and its possible connection to the case the story also reported that police sources revealed that detective harry bosch had received a note from someone claiming to be the real dollmaker there was obviously a leak in hollywood division but bosch knew it would be impossible to trace the person down the note had been found at the front desk and any number of uniform officers could have known about it and leaked the word to bremmer after all bremmer was a good friend to have bosch had even leaked information to him in the past and on occasion found bremmer to be quite useful citing the unnamed sources the story said police investigators had not concluded whether the note was legitimate or if the discovery of the body was connected to the dollmaker case which ended four years earlier the only other point of interest in the story for bosch was the short history on the bings billiards building it had been burned on the second night of the riots no arrests ever made arson investigators said the separations between the storage units were not bearing walls meaning trying to stop the flames was like trying to hold water in a cup made of toilet paper from ignition to full involvement of flames was only eighteen minutes most of the storage units were rented by movie industry people and some valuable studio props were either looted or lost in the fire the building was a total loss the investigators traced the origin to the billiard hall a pool table had been set on fire and it went from there bosch put the paper down and began thinking about lloyds testimony he remembered what belk had said that the case rode on himself chandler must know this as well she would be waiting for him ready to make lloyds outing seem like a joy ride in comparison he grudgingly had to admit to himself that he respected her skill her toughness it made him remember something and he got up to use the pay phone out front he was surprised to find edgar was at the homicide table and not out eating lunch any luck on the id bosch asked no man the prints didnt check no matches at all she didnt have a record were still trying other sources adult entertainment licenses stuff like that shit well we got something else cooking remember that csun anthropology professor i was telling you about well hes been here all morning with a student painting the plaster face and getting it ready i got the press coming in at three to show it off rojas went out to buy a blonde wig well stick on it if we get good play on the tube we might crack loose an id sounds like a plan yeah hows court the shit hit the fan in thetimes today that guy bremmer has some sources courts fine let me ask you something after you left the scene yesterday and went back to the station where was pounds pounds he waswe got back at the same time why when did he leave a little while later right before you got here was he on the phone in his office i think he made a few calls i wasnt really watching whats going on you think hes bremmers source one last question did he close the door when he was on the phone bosch knew pounds was paranoid he always kept the door to his office open and the blinds on the glass partitions up so he could see and hear what was happening in the squad room if he ever closed either or both the troops outside knew something was up well now that you mention it i think he did have the door closed a little while what is it bremmer im not worried about but somebody was talking to money chandler in court this morning she knew i had been called out to the scene yesterday that wasnt in thetimes somebody told her edgar was silent a moment before replying yeah but why would pounds talk to her i dont know maybe bremmer he could have told her even though it wasnt in his story the story says she couldnt be reached for comment its got to be somebody else a leak probably the same person talked to bremmer and chandler somebody who wants to fuck me up edgar didnt say anything and bosch let it go for now i better head back to court hey howd lloyd do i heard on kfwb he was the first wit he did about as expected shit whos next i dont know she has irving and locke the shrink on subpoena my guess is it will be irving hell pick up where lloyd left off well good luck by the way if youre looking for something to do this press gig im holding will hit the tv news tonight ill be here waiting by the phones if you want to answer a few i could use the help bosch thought briefly about his plan for dinner with sylvia shed understand yeah ill be there the afternoon testimony was largely uneventful chandlers strategy it seemed to bosch was to build a twopart question into the jurys eventual deliberation giving her clients two shots at the prize one would be the wrongman theory which held that bosch had flatout killed an innocent man the second question would be the use of force even if the jury determined that norman church family man was the dollmaker serial killer they would have to decide whether boschs actions were appropriate chandler called her client deborah church to the witness stand right after lunch she gave a tearful account of a wonderful life with a wonderful husband who fawned over everybody his daughters his wife his mother and motherinlaw no misogynistic aberrations here no sign of childhood abuse the widow held a box of kleenex in her hand as she testified going to a new tissue every other question she wore the traditional black dress of a widow bosch remembered how appealing sylvia had been when he saw her at her husbands funeral dressed in black deborah church looked downright scary it was as if she reveled in her role here the widow of the fallen innocent the real victim chandler had coached her well it was a good show but it was too good to be true and chandler knew it rather than leave the bad things to be drawn out on crossexamination she finally got around to asking deborah church how her marriage being so wonderful her husband was in that garage apartmentwhich was rented under an aliaswhen bosch kicked the door open we had been having some difficulty she stopped to dab an eye with a tissue norman was going through a lot of stresshe had a lot of responsibility in the aircraft design department he needed to expend it and so he took the apartment he said it was to be alone to think i didnt know about this woman he brought there i think it was probably his first time doing something like that he was a naive man i think she saw this she took his money and then set him up by calling the police on him and giving the crazy story that he was the dollmaker there was a reward you know bosch wrote a note on a pad he kept in front of him and slid it over to belk who read it and then jotted something down on his own pad what about all of the makeup found there mrs church chandler asked can you explain that all i know is that i would have known if my husband was that monster i would have known if there was makeup found there it was put there by somebody else maybe after he was already dead bosch believed he could feel the eyes of the courtroom burning into him as the widow accused him of planting evidence after murdering her husband after that chandler moved her questioning on to safer topics like norman churchs relationship with his daughters and then ended her direct examination with a weeper did he love his daughters very much so mrs church said as a new production of tears rolled down her cheeks this time she did not wipe them away with a tissue she let the jury watch them roll down her face into the folds of her double chin after giving her a few moments to compose herself belk got up and took his place at the lectern again your honor i will be brief mrs church i want to make this very clear to the jury did you say in your testimony that you knew about your husbands apartment but didnt know about any women he may or may not have brought there yes that is correct belk looked at his pad did you not tell detectives on the night of the shooting that you had never heard of any apartment didnt you emphatically deny that your husband even had such an apartment deborah church didnt answer i can arrange to have a tape of your first interview played in court if it will help refresh your yes i said that i lied you lied why would you lie to the police because a policeman had just killed my husband i didnti couldnt deal with them the truth is you told the truth that night correct mrs church you never knew about any apartment no thats not true i knew about it had you and your husband talked about it yes we discussed it you approved of it yes reluctantly it was my hope he would stay at home and we could work this stress out together okay mrs church then if you knew of the apartment had discussed it and given your approval reluctantly or not why then did your husband rent it under a false name she didnt answer belk had nailed her bosch thought he saw the widow glance in chandlers direction he looked at the lawyer but she made no move no change in facial expression to help her client i guess the widow finally said that was one of the questions you could have asked him if mr bosch had not murdered him in cold blood without belks prompting judge keyes said the jury will disregard that last characterization mrs church you know better than that im sorry your honor nothing further belk said as he left the lectern the judge called a tenminute recess during the break bosch went out to the ash can money chandler didnt come out but the homeless man made a pass bosch offered him a whole cigarette which he took and put in his shirt pocket he was unshaven again and the slight look of dementia was still in his eyes your name is faraday bosch said as if speaking to a child yeah what about it lieutenant bosch smiled he had been made by a bum all except for the rank nothing about it i just heard thats what it was i also heard you were a lawyer once i still am im just not practicing he turned and watched a jail bus go by on spring heading to the courthouse it was full of angry faces looking out through the black wire windows somebody by one of the back windows made bosch as a cop too and stuck his middle index finger up through the wire bosch smiled back at him my name was thomas faraday but now i prefer tommy faraway what happened to make you stop practicing law tommy looked back at him with milky eyes justice is what happened thanks for the smoke he walked away then cup in hand and headed toward city hall maybe that was his turf too after the break chandler called a lab analyst from the coroners office named victor amado he was a very small and bookishlooking man with eyes that shifted from the judge to the jury as he walked to the witness chair he was balding badly though he seemed to be no more than twentyeight bosch remembered that four years earlier he had all his hair and members of the task force referred to him as the kid he knew belk was going to call amado as a witness if chandler didnt belk leaned over and whispered that chandler was following a good guybad guy pattern by alternating police witnesses with her sympathetic witnesses shell probably put one of the daughters up there after amado he said as a strategy it is completely unoriginal bosch didnt mention that belks trustuswerethecops defense had been around as long as the civil suit amado testified in painstaking detail about how he had been given all of the bottles and compacts containing makeup that were found in churchs hyperion apartment and had then traced them to specific victims of the dollmaker he said he had come up with nine separate lots or groupings of makeupmascara blush eyeliner lipstick etc each lot was connected through chemical analysis to samples taken from the faces of the victims this was further corroborated by detectives who interviewed relatives and friends to determine what brands the victims were known to use it all matched up amado said and in one instance he added an eyelash found on a mascara brush in churchs bathroom cabinet was identified as having come from the second victim what about the two victims no matching makeup was found for chandler asked that was a mystery we never found their makeup in fact with the exception of the eyelash that was allegedly found and matched to victim number two you cant be one hundred percent sure that the makeup police did supposedly find in the apartment came from the victims correct this stuff is mass produced and sold around the world so there is a lot of it out there but i would guess that the chances of nine different exact combinations of makeup being found like that by mere coincidence are astronomical i didnt ask you to guess mr amado please answer the question i asked after flinching at being dressed down amado said the answer is we cant be one hundred percent sure that is correct okay now tell the jury about the dna testing you did that connected norman church to the eleven killings there wasnt any done there just answer the question mr amado what about serology tests connecting mr church to the crimes there were none then it was the makeup comparison that was the clincherthe linchpin in the determination that mr church was the dollmaker well it was for me i dont know about the detectives my report said im sure for the detectives it was the bullet that killed him that was the clincher objection belk yelled angrily as he stood your honor she cant ms chandler judge keyes boomed i have warned you both about exactly this sort of thing why would you go and say something you know full well is prejudicial and out of order i apologize your honor well its a little late for apologies well discuss this matter after the jury goes home for the day the judge then instructed the jurors to disregard her comment but bosch knew it had been a carefully thought out gambit by chandler the jurors would now see her even more as the underdog even the judge was against herwhich he really wasnt and they might be distracted thinking about what just happened when belk stepped up to repair amados testimony nothing further your honor chandler said mr belk the judge said dont say just a few questions again bosch thought as his lawyer moved to the lectern just a few questions mr amado belk said plaintiffs counsel mentioned dna and serology tests and you said they had not been done why is that well because there was nothing to test no semen was ever recovered from any of the bodies the killer had used a condom without samples to attempt to match to mr churchs dna or blood there was not much point in running tests we would have the victims but nothing to compare it to belk drew a line with his pen through a question written on his pad if there was no recovery of semen or sperm how do you know these women were raped or even had engaged in consensual sexual activity the autopsies of all eleven of the victims showed vaginal bruising much more than is considered usual or even possible from consensual sex on two of the victims there was even tearing in the vaginal wall the victims were brutally raped in my estimation but these women came from walks of life where sexual activity was common and frequent even rough sex if you will two of them performed in pornographic videos how can you be sure they were sexually assaulted against their will the bruising was such that it would have been very painful especially for the two with vaginal tears hemorrhaging was considered perimortem meaning at the time of death the deputy coroners who performed these autopsies unanimously concluded these women were raped belk drew another line on his pad flipped the page and came up with a new question he was doing well with amado bosch thought better than money had it may have been a mistake for her to have called him as a witness how do you know that the killer used a condom belk asked couldnt these women have been raped with an object and that account for the lack of semen that could have happened and it could account for some of the damage but there was clear evidence in five of the cases that they had had sex with a man wearing a condom and what was that we did rape kits there was hold it a second mr amado what is a rape kit its a protocol for collecting evidence from bodies of people that may have been the victims of rape in the case of a woman we take vaginal and anal swabs we comb the pubic area looking for foreign pubic hair procedures such as that we also take samples of blood and hair from the victim in case there is a call for comparison to evidence found on a suspect its collected together in an evidence kit okay before i interrupted there you were going to tell us about the evidence found in five of the victims that was indicative of sex with a man who wore a condom yes we did the rape kits each time we got a dollmaker victim and there was a foreign substance found in vaginal samplings in five of the victims it was the same material in each of the women what was it mr amado it was identified as a condom lubricant was this material something that could be identified to a specific brand and style of condom looking at belk bosch could see the heavy man was chomping at the bit amado was answering each question slowly and each time bosch could see that belk could barely wait for the answer before plowing ahead with a new question belk was on a roll yes amado said we identified the product it was from a trojanenz lubricated condom with special receptacle end looking at the court reporter amado said thats spelled enz and that was the same for all five samples received from the five bodies belk asked yes it was i am going to ask you a hypothetical question assuming that the attacker of eleven women used the same brand of lubricated condom how could you account for lubrication being found in the vaginal sampling of only five victims i believe that a number of factors could be involved such as the intensity of the victims struggle but essentially it would be just a matter of how much of the lubricant came off the condom and stayed in the vagina when police officers brought you the various containers of makeup from the hyperion apartment rented by norman church for analysis did they bring anything else yes they did what was that a box of trojanenz lubricated condoms with special receptacle ends how many condoms did the box hold twelve separately packaged condoms how many were still in the box when the police delivered it to you there were three left nothing further belk returned to the defense table with a triumphant spring in his walk a moment your honor chandler said bosch watched her open a fat file full of police documents she leafed through the pages and took out a short stack of documents held together with a paper clip she read the top one quickly and then held it up to leaf through the rest bosch could see the top one was the protocol list from a rape kit she was reading the protocols from all eleven victims belk leaned over to him and whispered shes about to step into some deep shit i was going to bring this up later during your testimony ms chandler the judge intoned she jumped up yes your honor im ready i have a quick redirect of mr amado she brought the stack of protocols with her to the lectern read the last two and then looked at the coroners analyst mr amado you mentioned that part of the rape kit consisted of combing for foreign pubic hairs do i have that right yes can you explain that procedure a little more well basically the comb is passed through the pubic hair of the victim and it collects unattached hairs oftentimes this unattached hair is from the victims attacker or possibly other sexual partners hows it get there amados face flushed to a crimson hue well uh ituh during sex there is i guess what you call friction between the bodies i am asking the questions mr amado you are answering there was quiet tittering from the gallery seats bosch felt embarrassed for amado and thought that his own face might be turning red yes well there is friction amado said and this causes some transference loose pubic hair from one person can be transferred to that of the other i see chandler said now you as coordinator of the dollmaker evidence from the coroners office were familiar with the rape kits of all eleven victims correct yes with how many of the victims did the findings include foreign pubic hair bosch understood what was happening now and realized that belk was right chandler was walking into the buzz saw all of them amado answered bosch saw deborah church raise her head and look sharply at chandler at the lectern then she looked over at bosch and their eyes met she quickly looked away but bosch knew she too knew what was about to happen because she too knew her late husband the way bosch had on that last night she knew what he looked like naked ah all of them chandler said now can you tell the jury how many of these pubic hairs found on these women were analyzed and identified as having been from the body of norman church none of them were from norman church thank you belk was up and moving to the lectern before chandler had time to remove her pad and the rape kit protocols bosch watched her sit down and saw the widow church lean to her and desperately begin whispering bosch saw chandlers eyes go dead she held up her hand to tell the widow she had said enough and then leaned back and exhaled now lets clear something up first belk said mr amado you said you found pubic hairs on all of the eleven victims were these hairs all from the same man no we found a multitude of samples in most cases what looked like hair from possibly two or three men on each victim what did you attribute this to their lifestyle we knew these were women with multiple sexual partners did you analyze these samples to determine if there were common hairs in other words whether hair from one man was found on each of the victims no we did not there was a huge amount of evidence collected in these cases and manpower dictated that we focus on evidence that would help identify a killer because we had so many different samples it was determined that this was evidence that would be held and then used to link or clear a suspect once that suspect was in custody i see well then once norman church had been killed and was identified as the dollmaker did you then match any of the hairs from the victims to him we did not and why is that because mr church had shaved his body hair there was no pubic hair to match why would he have done that chandler objected on the grounds that amado could not answer for church and the judge sustained it but bosch knew it didnt matter everybody in the courtroom knew why church had shaved himselfso he wouldnt leave pubic hairs behind as evidence bosch looked at the jury and he saw two of the women writing in the notebooks the marshals had given them to help them keep track of important testimony he wanted to buy belkand amadoa beer it looked like a cake in a box one of those novelty things custommade to look like marilyn monroe or something the anthropologist had painted on a beige skin tone and red lipstick to go with blue eyes it looked like frosting to bosch a wavy blonde wig was added he stood in the squad room looking down at the plaster image wondering if it really looked like anybody at all five minutes till show time edgar said he was sitting in his chair which was turned toward the tv on the file cabinets he was holding the channel changer his blue suit coat was hung neatly on a hanger which was hooked on the coatrack at the end of the table bosch took his jacket off and hung it on one of the coatrack pegs he checked his slot in the message box and sat down at his spot at the homicide table there had been a call from sylvia nothing else important he dialed her number as the channel news began he knew enough about the news priorities in this town to know the report on the concrete blonde wouldnt be a lead story harry were gonna need that line clear once they show it edgar said ill only be a minute they wont show it for a while if they show it at all theyll show it i made secret deals with all of them they all think theyll be getting the exclusive if we get an id they all want to get a boohoo story with the parents youre playing with fire man you make a promise like that and then they find out you fucked them around sylvia picked up the phone hey its me hi where are you the office we have to watch the phones a while theyre putting the face of the victim from yesterdays case on tv tonight how was court its the plaintiffs case at the moment but i think we scored a couple punches i read thetimes today at lunch yeah well they got about half of it right are you coming out like you said well eventually not right now ive got to help answer phones on this and then its depending on what we get if were skunked ill be out early he noticed he had lowered his voice so edgar wouldnt hear his conversation and if you get something good well see an indrawn breath then silence harry waited youve been saying well see too much harry weve talked about this sometimes i know that i think that you just want to be left alone stay in your little house on the hill and keep the whole world out including me not you you know that sometimes i dont i dont feel like i know it right now you push me away just at the time when you need mesomebodyto be close he had no answer he thought of her there on the other end she was probably sitting on the stool in the kitchen she had probably already begun making a dinner for both of them or maybe she was getting used to his ways and had waited for the call look im sorry he said you know how it is what are you doing about dinner nothing and im not going to do anything either edgar made a low quick whistle harry looked up at the tv and saw it was showing the painted face of the victim the tv was on channel now the camera showed a long closeup of the face it looked all right on the tube at least it didnt look much like a cake the screen flashed the detective bureaus two public numbers theyre showing it now bosch said to sylvia i need to keep this line clear let me call you back later when i know something sure she said coldly and hung up edgar had the tv on now and they were showing the face he then flipped to and caught the last few seconds of their report on it they had even interviewed the anthropologist slow news day bosch said shit edgar replied were banging on all cylinders now all we the phone rang and he grabbed it up no it just went out he said after listening for a few moments yeah yeah i will okay he hung up and shook his head pounds bosch asked yeah thinks were going to have her name ten seconds after the broadcast went out christ whadda nitwit the next three calls were pranks all testifying to the glaring lack of originality and the mental health of the tv viewing audience all three callers said your mother or words to that effect and hung up laughing about twenty minutes later edgar got a call and started taking notes the phone rang again and bosch took it this is detective bosch who am i speaking with is this being taped no its not who is this never mind just thought youd like to know the girls name is maggie maggie something or other its latin i seen her on videos what videos mtv no sherlock adult videos she fucked on film she was good she could put a rubber on a prick with her mouth the line went dead bosch wrote a couple of notes down on the pad he had in front of him latin he didnt think the way the face had been painted gave any indication that the victim was a latina edgar hung up then and said his caller had said her name was becky that she had lived in studio city a few years back whatd you get i got a maggie no last name possibly a latin last name he said she was in porno that would fit except she dont look mexican to me i know the phone rang again edgar picked up and listened a few moments and then hung up another one that recognizes my mom bosch took the next one i just wanted to tell you that the girl they were showing on tv was in porno the voice said how do you know she was in porno i can tell by that thing they showed on tv i rented a tape only once she was in it only once bosch thought but he remembered yeah sure you know her name the other phone rang and edgar picked it up i dont know names man boschs caller said they all use fake ones anyway what was the name of the tape cant remember i was uh intoxicated when i saw it like i said it was the only time look im not taking your confession you got anything else no smartass i dont who is this i dont have to say look were trying to find a killer here what was the name of the place you rented it im not telling you you might be able to get my name from them doesnt matter they have those tapes all over every adult place how would you know if you only rented one once the caller hung up bosch stayed another hour by the end they had five calls saying the painted face belonged to a porno starlet only one of the callers said her name was maggie the other four men saying they didnt pay much attention to names there was one call naming her becky of studio city and one saying she was a stripper who had worked for a while at the booby trap on la brea one man who called said the face belonged to his missing wife but bosch learned through further questioning that she had been missing only two months the concrete blonde had been dead too long the hope and desperation in the callers voice seemed genuine to bosch and he didnt know whether he was telling the man good news by explaining that it could not be his wife or bad news because he was left in the void again there were three callers who gave vague descriptions of a woman they thought might be the concrete blonde but after a few questions into each conversation bosch and edgar identified the callers as cop geeks people who got a thrill from talking to the police the most unusual call was from a beverly hills psychic who mentioned that she had placed her hand on the tv screen while it showed the face and felt the dead womans spirit cry out to her what did it cry bosch asked patiently praise praise for what jesus our savior i would assume but i dont know that was all i received i might receive more if i could touch the actual plaster cast of the well did this spirit that was giving praise identify itself see thats what were doing here were more interested in a name than cries of praise someday you will believe but by then you will be lost she hung up on him at seventhirty bosch told edgar he was splitting how bout you you going to hang out for the eleven oclock news yeah ill be here but i can handle it if i get a lot of calls ill pull one of the dipshits off the desk stock that ot bosch thought whats next he asked i dont know what do you think well aside from all the calls saying its your mother this porno thing seems to be the way to go leave my blessed mother out of it how you think i can check the porno administrative vice guy over there a detectivethree name of ray mora he works porno hes the best he also was on the dollmaker task force call him and see if he can come take a look at the face he mightve known her tell him we had one call saying her name was maggie will do it fits with the dollmaker doesnt it the porno i mean yeah it fits he thought about this a moment then added two of the other victims were in the business the one that got away from him was too the lucky oneshe still in it last i heard but she might be dead now for all i know still doesnt mean anything harry what the porno still doesnt mean it was the dollmaker the real one i mean bosch just nodded he had an idea about something to do on his way home he went out to his caprice and got the polaroid camera out of the trunk in the squad room he took two shots of the face in the box and put them in his coat pocket after they developed edgar watched this and asked whatre you going to do might stop at that adult supermarket in the valley on my way up to sylvias dont get caught in one of those little rooms with your dick out thanks for the tip let me know what mora says bosch worked his way on surface streets up to the hollywood freeway he went north and then exited on lankershim which took him into north hollywood in the san fernando valley he had all four windows down and the air was cool as it buffeted him from all directions he smoked a cigarette flicking the ashes into the wind there was some technofunk jazz on kajz so he turned the radio off and just drove the valley was the citys bedroom community in more ways than the obvious it was also home to the nations pornography industry the commercialindustrial districts of van nuys canoga park northridge and chatsworth housed hundreds of porno production outfits distributors and warehouses modeling agencies in sherman oaks provided ninety percent of the women and men who performed in front of the cameras and consequently the valley was also one of the largest retail outlets for the material it was made here it was sold herethrough video mailorder businesses also nestled in the warehouses with the production outfits and places like x marks the spot on lankershim boulevard bosch pulled into the lot in front of the huge store and appraised it for a few moments it had formerly been a pic n pay supermarket but the front plateglass windows had been walled up under the red neon x marks the spot sign the front wall was whitewashed and painted with black figures of naked and overly buxom female figures like the metallic silhouettes bosch saw all the time on the mudflaps of trucks on the freeway the men who put those on their trucks were probably the same guys this place catered to bosch figured x marks the spot was owned by a man named harold barnes who was a front for the chicago outfit it grossed more than a million dollars a yearon the books probably another one under the counter bosch knew all of this from mora of advice whom he had partnered with on some nights while they both were on the task force four years earlier bosch watched a man of about twentyfive get out of his toyota walk quickly to the solid wood front door and slip in like a secret agent he followed the front half of the former supermarket was dedicated to retailthe sale and rental of videos magazines and other assorted adultoriented and mostly rubber products the rear was split between private encounter rooms and private video booths the entry to this area was through a curtained doorway bosch could hear heavymetal rock music coming from back there mixed with the cannedsounding cries of phony passion coming from the video booths to his left was a glass counter with two men behind it one was a big man there to keep the peace the other was smaller older there to take the money bosch knew by the way they looked at him and the skin stretched tight around their eyes that they had made him as soon as he had come in he walked over and put one of the polaroids on the counter i am trying to id her heard she worked in video do you recognize her the small guy leaned forward and looked while the other guy didnt move looks like a fucking cake man the small guy said i dont know any cakes i eat cakes he looked back at the big guy and they exchanged clever smiles so you dont recognize her what about you i say what he says the big guy said i eat cakes too this time they laughed out loud and probably had to restrain themselves from exchanging a high five the small guys eyes sparkled behind rosetinted glasses okay bosch said then ill just look around thanks the big guy stepped forward and said just keep your gun covered man we dont want to excite the patrons the big guys eyes were dull and he set out a fivefoot zone of body odor a duster bosch thought he wondered why the small guy didnt fire his ass no more excited than they are bosch said he turned from the counter to the two walls of shelves that were lined with hundreds of video boxes for sale or rent there were a dozen men including the secret agent looking appraising the scene and the number of video boxes bosch somehow was reminded of how he once had read all the names on the vietnam war memorial wall while on a case it had taken several hours the video wall proved to be less time consuming skipping the gay and black performer videos he scanned each box for a face like the concrete blondes or the name maggie the videos were in alphabetical order and it took him nearly an hour to get to the ts a face on the box of a video calledtails from the crypt caught his eye there was a nude woman lying in a coffin on the front she was blonde and had an upturned nose like the plaster face in the box he turned the box over and there was another photo of the actress on her hands and knees with a man pressed up behind her her mouth was slightly open and her face was turned back toward her sex partner it was her bosch knew he looked at the credits and saw that the name fit he took the empty video box to the counter bout time said the small guy we dont allow loitering here the cops give us a hard time on that i want to rent this cant its already rented see the box is empty she in anything else you know of the small guy took the box and looked at the photographs magna cum loudly yeah i dont know she was just getting started and then dropped out probably married a rich guy lots of them do the big guy stepped over to look at the box and bosch stepped back out of his odor zone im sure they do he said what else was she in well the small guy said she had just made her way out of the loops and then pfffft shes gonetails was her first top billing she did a fabulous twoway inwhore of the roses and thats what got her started before that it was just the loops bosch went back to the ws and found the box forwhore of the roses it also was empty and there were no photos of magna cum loudly on it her name was last billing on the credits he went back to the small guy and pointed to thetails from the crypt box what about the box then ill buy it we cant sell you just the box because then how do we display the video when it comes back we dont sell many boxes here guys want stills they buy magazines whats the price of the whole video ill buy it when the renter brings it back you can hold it for me and ill come pick it up how much welltails is popular were going with a price tag but for you officer ill give our law enforcement discount fifty bucks bosch said nothing to that he had the cash and paid it i want a receipt after the purchase was completed the small guy put the video box in a brown paper bag you know he said maggie cum loudly is still on a couple of our loops in the back you might want to check it out he smiled and pointed to a sign on the wall behind him we have a noexchange policy by the way bosch smiled back ill check it out hey by the way what name you want us to hold this video under when it comes back in carlo pinzi it was the name of the outfits la capo very fucking funny mr pinzi well do that bosch went through the curtain into the back rooms and was almost immediately met by a woman wearing high heels a black gstring and an icecream mans coin changer on a belt nothing else her large siliconeperfected breasts were dotted by unusually small nipples her dyed blonde hair was short and she had too much makeup around her glassy brown eyes she looked like she was either nineteen or thirtyfive do you want a private encounter or change for the video booths she asked bosch took out his now thin fold of cash and gave her two dollars for quarters can i keep a dollar for myself i dont get paid nothin just tips bosch gave her another dollar and took his eight quarters to one of the small curtained booths where the occupied light wasnt on let me know if you need anything in there the woman in the gstring called after him she was either too stoned or too stupid or both not to have made him as a cop bosch waved her away and pulled the curtain shut behind him the space he had was about the size of a phone booth there was a glass viewing window through which he could see a video screen displayed on the screen was a directory of twelve different videos he could select from it was all video now though they were still called loops after the mm film loops that ran over and over again in the first peep machines there was no chair but there was a small shelf with an ashtray and a kleenex box on it used tissues were littered on the floor and the booth smelled like the industrial disinfectant they used in the coroners vans he put all eight quarters in the coin slot and the video picture came on it was two women on a bed kissing and massaging each other it took bosch only a few seconds to eliminate them as possibly being the girl on the video box he began pushing the channel button and the picture jumped from coupling to couplingheterosexual homosexual bisexualhis eyes lingering only long enough to determine whether the woman he was looking for was there she was on the ninth loop he recognized her from the video box he had bought seeing her in motion also helped convince him that the woman who used the name magna cum loudly was the concrete blonde in the video she lay on a couch on her back biting one of her fingers while a man knelt between her legs on the floor and rhythmically ground his hips into hers knowing this woman was dead had died violently and standing there watching her submit to another kind of violence affected him in a way he was unsure he even understood guilt and sorrow welled up as he watched like most cops he had spent a stint in vice he had also seen some of the films of the two other adult film actresses who were killed by the dollmaker but this was the first time this uneasiness had hit him on the video the actress took the finger out of her mouth and began to moan loudly living up to her billing bosch fumbled with the sound knob and turned it down but he could still hear her her moans turned into shouts from videos in other booths other men were watching the same show it made bosch feel creepy knowing the video had drawn the interest of different men for different reasons the curtain behind him rustled and he heard someone move behind him into the booth at the same moment he felt a hand move up his thigh to his crotch he reached into his jacket for his gun as he turned but then saw it was the coin changer what can i do for you darling she cooed he pushed her arm away from him you can start by getting out of here cmon lover why look at it on tv when you can be doing it twenty bucks i cant go lower i have to split it with the management she was pressed against him now and bosch couldnt tell if it was his breath or hers that was lousy with cigarettes her breasts were hard and she was pushing them against his chest then suddenly she froze she had felt the gun their eyes held each other for a moment thats right bosch said if you dont want to go for a ride to the cage get out of here no problem officer she said she parted the curtain and was gone just then the screen went back to the directory boschs two dollars were up as he walked out he heard magna cum loudly yelling in false joy from the other booths on the ride on the freeway to the next valley he tried to imagine that life he wondered what hope she might still have had and still nurtured and protected like a candle in the rain even as she lay there on her back with distant eyes turned toward the stranger inside her hope must have been the only thing she had left bosch knew that hope was the lifeblood of the heart without it there was nothing only darkness he wondered how the two liveskillers and victimshad crossed maybe the seed of lust and murderous desire had been planted by the same loop bosch had just seen maybe the killer had rented the video bosch had just paid fifty dollars for could it have been church or was there another out there the box bosch thought and pulled off at the next exit van nuys boulevard in pacoima he pulled to the curb and took the video box out of the brown paper bag the small guy had provided he turned the light on in the car and studied every surface of the box reading every word but there was no copyright date that would have told him when the tape was made whether it had been made before or after churchs death he got back on the golden state which took him north into the santa clarita valley after exiting on bouquet canyon road he wound his way through a series of residential streets past a seemingly endless line of california custom homes on del prado he pulled to the curb in front of the house with the ritenbaugh realty sign out front sylvia had been trying to sell the house for more than a year without luck when he thought about it bosch was relieved it kept him from facing a decision about what he and sylvia would do next sylvia opened the door before he reached it hey hey what do you have oh its something from work ive gotta make a couple calls in a while did you eat he bent down and kissed her and moved inside she had on the gray tshirt dress she liked to wear around the house after work her hair was loose and down to her shoulders the blonde highlights catching the light from the living room had a salad you not yet ill fix a sandwich or something im sorry about this with the trial and now this new case its well you know its okay i just miss you im sorry about how i acted on the phone she kissed him and held him he felt at home with her that was the best thing that feeling he had never had it before and he would forget it at times when he was away from her but as soon as he was back with her it was there she took him by the hand into the kitchen and told him to sit down while she made him a sandwich he watched her put a pan on the stove and turn on the gas then she put four strips of bacon in the pan while they cooked she sliced a tomato and an avocado and laid out a bed of lettuce he got up took a beer from the fridge and kissed her on the back of the neck he stepped back annoyed that the memory of the woman grabbing him in the booth intruded on the moment why had that happened whats the matter nothing she put two slices of sunflower bread into the toaster and took the bacon out of the pan a few minutes later she put the sandwich in front of him at the table and sat down who do you have to call jerry edgar maybe a guy at advice advice she was porno this new victim sylvia had once been married to a cop and she made leaps of thought like a cop bosch liked that about her think so i have a line on her but ive got court so i want to give it to them she nodded he never had to tell her not to ask too much she always knew just when to stop how was school today fine eat your sandwich i want you to hurry up and make your calls because i want us to forget about court and school and your investigation i want us to open some wine light some candles and get in bed he smiled at her they had fallen into such a relaxed life together the candles were always her signal her way of initiating their lovemaking sitting there bosch realized he had no signals she initiated it almost every time he wondered what that meant about him he worried that maybe theirs was a relationship solely founded on secrets and hidden faces he hoped not are you sure nothings wrong she asked youre really spaced im fine this is good thank you penny called tonight shes got two people interested so shes going to have an open house on sunday he nodded still eating maybe we could go somewhere for the day i dont want to be here when she brings them through we could even leave saturday and go overnight somewhere you could get away from all of this maybe lone pine would be good that sounds good but lets see what happens after she left the kitchen for the bedroom bosch called the bureau and edgar picked up bosch deepened his voice and said yeah you know that thing you showed on tv the one that gots no name yes can you help us sure can bosch covered his mouth with his hand to hold back the laughter he realized he hadnt thought of a good punch line his mind raced as he tried to decide what it should be well who is it sir edgar said impatiently ititsits its who its harve pounds in drag bosch burst out laughing and edgar easily guessed who it was it was stupid not even funny but they both laughed bosch what do you want it took him some time to stop laughing he finally said just checking in did you call ray mora nah i called over to advice and they said he wasnt working tonight i was going to talk to him tomorrow howd you do i think ive got a name ill give mora a call at home so he can pull what they have on her first thing he told edgar the name and heard the other detective laugh well at least its original howwhat makes you think its her bosch answered in a low voice in case his voice was carrying to the bedroom i saw a loop and i have a box from a video with her picture on it it looks like the plaster face you got a little off on the wig but i think its her ill drop the box off on your desk on my way into court tomorrow cool maybe mora can get an early start on getting her real name and prints over to you she probably had an adult entertainment license all right if i call him thats cool you know him they hung up bosch didnt have a home number for mora he called detective services and gave his name and badge number and asked to be put through it took about five minutes and then mora answered after three rings he seemed out of breath its bosch you gotta minute bosch yeah bosch whats up man hows business still sucks he laughed at what bosch guessed was an insiders joke actually it goes further down all the timeno pun intended video ruined it bosch made it too big the industry got big the quality got small nobody cares about quality anymore mora was talking more like a supporter of the porno industry than a watchdog i miss the days when it was in those smoky theaters on cahuenga and highland we had a better handle on things then at least i did so hows court i hear you guys caught another one that looks like the dollmaker whats going on with that how could thats why im calling ive got a namei think she was from your side of the tracks the victim give it to me magna cum loudly maybe known as maggie too yeah ive heard that one she was around a while ago and then youre right she disappeared or dropped out bosch waited for more he thought he heard a voice in the backgroundin person or on tv and mora told him to hold on a minute he couldnt make out what had been said or whether it was a man or a woman it made him wonder what mora had been doing when he called there were rumors floating around the department about mora having gotten too close to the subject he was expert in it was a common cop malady still he knew mora had successfully fended off any attempts to transfer him in the early years of his assignment now he had so much expertise it would be ridiculous to move him it would be like taking orel hershiser off the dodgers pitching staff and putting him in the outfield he was good at what he did he had to be left there um harry i dont know i think she was around a couple years ago what im saying is if its her then it couldnt have been church you know what im saying i dont know how that plays with what youve got working on this dont worry about it ray if church didnt do her somebody else did we still gotta get him right so ill get on it by the way howd you make her bosch told him about his visit to x marks the spot yeah i know them guys the big one thats carlo pinzi the capos nephew jimmie pinzi they call him jimmie pins he may act big and dumb but hes really the little guy pinkies boss watches over the place for his uncle the little ones called pinkie on account of those glasses he wears pinkie and pins its all an act anyway they charged you about forty beans too many for that video thats what i guessed oh and i was going to ask you theres no copyright on the video box would that be on the video or is there any way i can figure out when this was made usually they dont put the copyright on the box customers want fresh meat so the players figure the customer sees a copyright on the box thats a couple years old then theyll buy something else its a fast business perishable goods so no dates sometimes theyre not even on the video cartridge anyway ive got catalogs at the office going back twelve years i can find a date no problem thanks ray i might not make it by a guy from the homicide table jerry edgar might come by to see you i got court thats fine harry bosch had nothing else to ask and was about to say goodbye when mora spoke in the silence you know i think about it a lot what the task force i wish i hadnt taken off early that night and i was there with you who knows maybe wed have gotten this guy alive yeah be no trial theni mean for you bosch was silent as he looked at the picture on the back of video box the womans face turned to the side just like the plaster face it was her he felt sure of it ray with only this namemagna cum loudlycan you still get a real name get prints sure can no matter what anybody thinks of the product there is legit stuff and illegit stuff out there this girl maggie looks like she had graduated to the legit world she was out of loops and that shit and was in mainstream adult video that means she probably had an agent had an adult entertainment license they gotta get em to prove theyre eighteen so her license will have her real name on it i can go through them and find herthey got their pictures on them might take me a couple hours but i can find her okay good will you do that in the morning and if edgar doesnt come by get the prints to him at hollywood homicide jerry edgar ill do it neither spoke for a few moments as they thought about what they were doing hey harry yeah the paper said that there was a new note that true yeah is it legit did we fuck up i dont know yet ray but i appreciate you saying we a lot of people just want to point at me yeah listen i ought to tell you i got subpoenaed today by that money bitch it didnt surprise bosch since mora had been on the dollmaker task force dont worry about it shes probably papered everybody who was on the task force okay but try to keep this new stuff under your hat if you can as long as i can shes got to know what to ask before she can ask it im just looking for some time to work with this see what it means no problem man you and i both know the right guy went down no doubt about that harry but saying it out loud like that put a doubt to it bosch knew mora was wondering the same things bosch was you need me to drop this video box off tomorrow so you know what she looks like before flipping through the files no like i said weve got all sorts of catalogs ill just look uptails from the crypt and get it from there if that dont work ill go through the agency books they hung up and bosch lit a cigarette though sylvia didnt like him doing it in the house it wasnt that she had a problem with his smoking but she thought potential buyers might be turned off if they thought it had been a smokers house he sat there alone for several minutes peeling the label off the empty beer bottle and thinking about how quickly things could change believe something for four years and then find out you might be wrong he brought a bottle of buehler zinfandel and two glasses into the bedroom sylvia was in bed with the covers pulled up to her naked shoulders she had a lamp on and was reading a book callednever let them see you cry bosch walked to her side of the bed and sat down next to her he poured out two glasses they tapped them together and sipped to victory in court she said sounds good to me they kissed were you smoking out there again sorry was it bad news the calls no just bullshit you want to talk not now he went into the bathroom with his glass and took a quick shower the wine which had been beautiful tasted terrible after he brushed his teeth when he came out the reading light was out and the book put away there were candles burning on both night tables and the bureau they were in silver votive candle holders with crescent moons and stars cut out on the sides the flickering flames threw blurry moving patterns on the walls and curtains and in the mirror like a silent cacophony she lay propped on three pillows the covers off he stood naked at the foot of the bed for a few moments and they smiled at each other she was beautiful to him her body tan and almost girlish she was thin with small breasts and a small flat stomach her chest was freckled from too many summer days at the beach while growing up he was eight years older and knew he looked it but he was not ashamed of his physical appearance at fortythree he still had a flat stomach and his body was still ropey with musclesmuscles not created on machines but by lifting the daytoday weight of his life his mission his body hair was curiously going to gray at a much faster pace than the hair on his head sylvia often would kid him about this accusing him of having dyed his hair of having a vanity they both knew he did not have when he climbed onto the bed next to her she ran her fingers over his vietnam tattoo and the scars a bullet had left on his right shoulder a few years earlier she traced the surgery zipper the way she did every time they were together here i love you harry she said he rolled onto her and kissed her deeply letting her taste of red wine and the feel of her warm skin take him away from worry and the images of violent ends he was in the temple of home he thought but did not say i love you he thought but did not say for everything that had gone well for bosch on tuesday the following morning provided a fresh undoing the first disaster occurred in judge keyess chambers where he convened lawyers and clients after studying the note from the alleged dollmaker in private for a half hour his private reading had come after belk had argued for an hour against the inclusion of the note in the trial i have read the note and considered the arguments he said i cannot see how this letter note poem whatever can possibly be withheld from this jury it is so on point to the thrust of ms chandlers case that it is the point im not making any judgment on whether its for real or from some crackpot that will be for the jury to figure out if they can but because the investigation is still underway is no reason to withhold this i am granting the subpoena and ms chandler you can introduce this at the appropriate time provided youve put down the proper foundation no pun intended mr belk your exception to this ruling will be noted for the record your honor belk tried no well have no more argument on it lets move on out to court your honor we dont know who wrote this how can you allow it into evidence when we dont have the slightest idea where it came from or who sent it i know the ruling is a disappointment so im allowing you some leeway as far as not coming down on you for that showing of your apparent disrespect for the wishes of this court i said no more argument mr belk so ill go over this only one time the fact that this note of unknown origin led directly to the discovery of a body bearing all the similarities of a dollmaker victim is in itself a verification of some authenticity this is no prank mr belk no joke there is something here and the jury is going to see it lets go everybody out court had no sooner been called into session than the next debacle occurred belk perhaps dazed by his defeat in chambers waltzed into a trap chandler had deftly set for him her first witness of the day was a man named wieczorek who testified that he knew norman church quite well and was sure he had not committed the eleven murders attributed to him wieczorek and church had worked together for twelve years in the design lab he said wieczorek was in his fifties with white hair trimmed so short his pink scalp showed through what makes you so confident in your belief that norman was not a killer chandler asked well for one thing i know for a fact he didnt kill one of those girls the eleventh because he was with me the whole time she was getting whatever he was with me then the police kill him and pin eleven murders on him well i figure if i know he didnt kill one of those girls then they are probably lying about the rest the whole thing is a coverup for them killing thank you mr wieczorek chandler said just saying what i think belk stood and objected anyway going to the lectern and whining that the entire answer was speculation the judge agreed but the damage was done belk strode back to his chair and bosch watched him leaf through a thick transcript of a deposition taken of wieczorek a few months earlier chandler asked a few more questions about where the witness and church were on the night the eleventh victim was murdered and wieczorek answered that they were at his own apartment with seven other men holding a bachelor party for a fellow employee from the lab how long was norman church at your apartment the whole time of the party id say from nine oclock on we finished up after two in the morning the police said that girl the eleventh one went to some hotel at one and got herself killed norman was with me at one oclock in the morning could he have slipped away for an hour or so without you realizing it no way youre in a room with eight guys and you know if one mysteriously disappears for a half hour chandler thanked him and sat down belk leaned to bosch and whispered i wonder what hes going to do with the new asshole im going to tear him he got up armed with the deposition transcript and lumbered to the lectern as if he were lugging an elephant rifle wieczorek who wore thick glasses that magnified his eyes watched him suspiciously mr wieczorek do you remember me remember the deposition i took of you a few months back belk held the transcript up as a reminder i remember you wieczorek said ninetyfive pages mr wieczorek nowhere in this transcript is there any mention of any bachelor party why is that i guess because you didnt ask but you didnt bring it up did you the police are saying your best buddy murdered eleven women you supposedly know thats a lie but you dont say a thing is that right yeah thats right care to tell us why far as i was concerned you were part of it i only answered what i was asked i wasnt volunteering shiuh nothing let me ask you did you ever tell the police this back then back when church was killed and all the headlines said he killed eleven women ever pick up the phone one time and tell them they got the wrong guy no at the time i didnt know it was only when i read a book that came out on the case a couple years ago and there were details in there about when that last girl got killed then i knew he was with me during that whole time i called the police and asked for the task force and they said it was disbanded long ago i left a message for that fellow the book said was in charge lloyd i think it was and he never called me belk exhaled into the lecterns microphone creating a loud sigh that indicated his weariness in dealing with this moron so if i can recap you are telling this jury that two years after the murders when this book came out you read it and immediately realized you had an ironclad alibi for your dead friend am i missing anything mr wieczorek uh just the part about suddenly realizing it wasnt sudden then what was it well when i read the dateseptember it set me to thinking and i just remembered that the bachelor party was on september that year and norman was there at my house all that time so then i verified it and called normans wife to tell her he wasnt what they said he was you verified it with the others at the party no didnt have to then how mr wieczorek belk asked in an exasperated tone i looked at the video i had of that night it had the date and time down in the corner of the frame bosch saw belks face turn a lighter shade of pale the lawyer looked at the judge then down at his pad then back up at the judge bosch felt his heart sink belk had broken the same cardinal rule chandler had broken the day before he had asked a question for which he didnt already know the answer it didnt take a lawyer to know that since it was belk who had drawn out mention of the videotape chandler was now free to explore it to move to introduce the videotape as evidence it had been a clever trap because it was new evidence from wieczorek not contained in his deposition chandler would have had to inform belk earlier if she planned to draw it out on direct examination instead she had skillfully allowed belk to blunder in and draw it out he now stood there defenseless hearing it for the first time along with the jurors nothing further belk said and returned to his seat with his head down he immediately pulled one of the law books on the table onto his lap and began paging through it chandler went to the lectern for redirect mr wieczorek this tape you mentioned to mr belk do you still have it sure brought it with me chandler then moved to have the tape shown to the jury judge keyes looked at belk who lumbered slowly to the lectern your honor belk managed to say can defense have a tenminute recess to research case law the judge glanced at the clock its a little early isnt it mr belk we just started your honor chandler said the plaintiff has no objection ill need time to set up the video equipment very well the judge said ten minutes for counsel the jury can take a fifteenminute break and then report back to the assembly room while they stood for the jury belk was flipping pages in the heavy law book and when it was time to sit down bosch pulled his chair close to his lawyers not now belk said ive got ten minutes you fucked up no we fucked up we are a team remember that bosch left his teammate there while he went out to smoke a cigarette when he got to the statue chandler was already there he lit a smoke anyway and kept his distance she looked at him and smirked bosch spoke you tricked him didnt you tricked him with the truth is it oh yeah she put a halfsmoked cigarette in the sand of the ash can and said i better get back in there and get the equipment set up she smirked again bosch wondered if she was that good or it was belk who was that bad belk lost his halfhour argument to keep the tape from being introduced he said that since it was not brought up during deposition it was new evidence which the plaintiff could not submit at so late a date judge keyes denied his claim pointing out what everyone knew that it had been belk who had brought the tape to light after the jury was brought back in chandler asked wieczorek several questions about the tape and where it had been for the last four years after judge keyes dismissed one more objection from belk she rolled a tvvcr combination to a position in front of the jury box and put in the tape which wieczorek had retrieved from a friend sitting in the gallery bosch and belk had to stand up and move into the gallery seats to get a view of the tv screen as he made the move harry saw bremmer from thetimes sitting in one of the back rows he gave a small nod to bosch harry wondered if he was there to cover the trial or because he was subpoenaed the tape was long and boring but was not continuous it was stopped and started during the evening of the bachelor party but the digital readout in the lower right corner kept the time and date if it was correct it was true that church had an alibi for the last killing attributed to him it was dizzying for bosch to watch there was church no toupee bald as a baby drinking beer and laughing with his friends the man bosch had killed toasting a friends marriage looking like the all american nerd that bosch knew he had not been the tape lasted ninety minutes climaxing with a visit from a telegram stripper who sang a song to the groomtobe dropping lingerie on his head as she removed each piece in the video church seemed embarrassed to be seeing this his eye more on the groom than on the woman bosch pulled his eyes from the screen to watch the jury and he could see the tape was devastating to his defense he looked away after the tape was finished chandler had a few more questions for wieczorek they were questions belk would have asked but she was beating him to the punch how is the date and time set on the video frame well when you buy it you set it then the battery keeps it going never had to fiddle with it after i bought it but if you wanted to you could put in any date you wanted anytime you wanted correct i spose so say you were going to take a video of a friend to be used later as an alibi could you set the date back say a year and then take the video sure could you put a date on an already existing video no you cant superimpose a date over an existing video doesnt work that way so in this case how could you do it how could you make a phony alibi for norman church belk stood up and objected on the grounds that wieczoreks answer would be speculation but judge keyes overruled him saying the witness had expertise with his own camera well you couldnt do that now cause normans dead wieczorek said so what you are saying is that in order to make a phony tape you would have to have conspired with mr church to make it before he was killed by mr bosch correct yes wed have to have known that somewhere down the line hed need this tape and hed have tove told me what date to set it on and so on and so forth its all pretty farfetched especially because you can pull the newspapers from that year and find the wedding announcement that says my friend got married september thirtieth thatll show you that his bachelor party had to have been the twentyeighth or thereabouts its not a phony judge keyes agreed with belks objection to the last sentence as being nonresponsive to the question and told the jury to disregard it bosch knew they didnt need to have heard it they all knew the tape wasnt a phony he did too he felt clammy and sick something had gone wrong but he didnt know what he wanted to get up and walk out but he knew that to do so would be an admission of guilt so loud the walls would shake as if during an earthquake one last question chandler said her face had become flushed as she rode this one to victory did you ever know norman church to wear a hairpiece of any kind never i knew him a lot of years and i never saw or heard of such a thing judge keyes turned the witness back over to belk who lumbered to the lectern without his yellow pad he was apparently too flustered by this turnabout to remember to say just a few questions instead he got right to his meager damagecontrol effort you say you read a book about the dollmaker case and then discovered this tapes date matched one of the killings is that right thats right did you look into finding alibis for the other ten murders no i didnt so mr wieczorek you have nothing to offer in terms of defending your longtime friend against these other cases a task force of numerous officers connected to him the tape put the lie to all of em your task youre not answering the question yes i am you show the lie on one of the cases it puts a lie to the whole shooting match you ask me were not asking you mr wieczorek now uh you said you never saw norman church wear a hairpiece correct thats what i said yes did you know he kept that apartment using a false name no i did not there was a lot you didnt know about your friend wasnt there i suppose do you suppose it is possible that just as he had that apartment without you knowing that he occasionally wore a hairpiece without you knowing i suppose now if mr church was the killer police claim him to be and used disguises as police said the killer did wouldnt it be objection chandler said expected that there would be something such objection as a toupee in the apartment judge keyes sustained chandlers objection to belks question as seeking a speculative answer and chastised belk for continuing the question after the objection was lodged belk took the berating and said he had no further questions he sat down sweat lines gliding out of his hairline and running down his temples best you could do bosch whispered belk ignored it took out a handkerchief and wiped his face after accepting the videotape as evidence the judge broke for lunch after the jury was out of the courtroom a handful of reporters quickly moved up to chandler bosch watched this and knew it was the final arbiter of how things were going the media always gravitated to the winners the perceived winners the eventual winners its always easier to ask them questions better start thinking of something bosch belk said we could have settled this six months ago for fifty grand way things are going that would have been nothing bosch turned and looked at him they were at the railing behind the defense table you believe it dont you the whole thing i killed him then we planted everything that connected him to it doesnt matter what i believe bosch fuck you belk like i said you better start thinking of something he pushed his wide girth through the gate and headed out of the courtroom bremmer and another reporter approached him but he waved them away bosch followed him out a few moments later and also brushed the reporters off but bremmer kept stride with him as he took the hallway to the escalator listen man my ass is on the line here too i wrote a book about the guy and if it was the wrong guy i want to know bosch stopped and bremmer almost bumped into him he looked closely at the reporter he was about thirtyfive overweight with brown thinning hair like many men he made up for this by growing a thick beard which only served to make him look older bosch noticed that the reporters sweat had stained the underarms of his shirt but body odor wasnt his problem cigarette breath was look you think its the wrong guy then write another book and get another hundred thousand advance what do you care if its the wrong guy or not i have a reputation in this town harry so did i what are you going to write tomorrow i have to write whats going down in there and youre also testifying is that ethical bremmer im not testifying she released me from the subpoena yesterday i just had to sign a stipulation to what that said that to the best of my knowledge the book i wrote contained true and accurate information the source of that information was almost wholly from police sources and police and other public records speaking of sources who told you about the note for yesterdays story harry i cant reveal that look at how many times ive kept you confidential as a source you know i can never reveal sources yeah i know that i also know somebody is setting me up bosch stepped onto the escalator and went down administrative vice is located on the third floor of the central division station in downtown bosch got there in ten minutes and found ray mora behind his desk in the squad room with the telephone held to his ear open on his desk was a magazine with color photographs of a couple engaged in sex the girl in the photos looked very young mora was glancing at the photos and turning the pages while listening to the caller he nodded to bosch and pointed to a seat in front of his desk well that was all i was checking mora said into the phone just trying to put a line in the water ask around and let me know what you come up with then there was more listening bosch looked at the vice cop he was about harrys size with deep bronze skin and brown eyes his straight brown hair was trimmed short and he had no facial hair like most vice cops he affected a casual appearance blue jeans and black polo shirt open at the neck if bosch could see under the desk he knew hed find cowboy boots bosch could see a gold medallion hanging high on his chest imprinted on it was a dove its wings open the symbol of the holy spirit you think you can get me the shoot location silence mora finished with the magazine wrote something on the front cover and picked up another and began paging through it bosch noticed the adult film performers guild calendar taped to the side of a vertical file on his desk there was a photo of a porn star named delta bush lounging nude above the days of the week she had become well known in recent years because she was linked romantically in the gossip tabs to a mainline movie star on the desk below the calendar was a religious statue bosch identified as the infant of prague he knew this because one of his foster mothers had given him a similar statue when he was a boy and was being sent back to mcclaren he hadnt been what the fosters had in mind giving him the statue and saying goodbye the woman had explained to him that the infant was known as the little king the saint who took special care to hear the prayers of children bosch wondered if mora knew that story or if the statue was there as some kind of joke all im saying is try mora said into the phone get me the shoot then youll be in line for the snitch fund yeah yeah later he hung up hey harry whereyat edgars been here huh just left a little while ago he talk to you no mora noticed bosch looking at the spread on the page he had the magazine open to it was two women kneeling in front of a man he put a yellow postit on the page and closed it lord i gotta look through all this shit got a tip that this publisher is using underage models you know how i check bosch shook his head its not the face or the tits its ankles harry ankles yeah ankles something about them they are just smoother on younger chicks i can usually tell over or under eighteen by the ankles then of course i go out and confirm with birth certificates dls etc its crazy but it works good for you what did you tell edgar the phone rang mora picked up said his name and listened a few moments i cant talk now i have to get back to you whereyat he hung up after making a note sorry i gave edgar the id maggie cum loudly i had prints photos the whole thing i got some stills of her in action if you want to see he pushed his chair back toward a file cabinet but bosch told him never mind with the stills whatever anyway edgar has it all took prints to the coroners i think to confirm the id chicks name was rebecca kaminski becky kaminski be twentythree if she were alive today formerly of chicago before she came on out to sin city for fame and fortune what a waste huh she was a fine young piece god bless her bosch felt uncomfortable with mora but this was not new when they had worked the task force together harry had never had the feeling that the killings meant much to the vice detective didnt make much of a dent mora was just putting in his time lending his help where it was needed he definitely was good in his area of expertise but it didnt seem to matter to him whether the dollmaker was stopped or not mora had a strange way of mingling gutter talk and jesus talk at first bosch had thought he was simply playing the bornagain line that was popular in the department a few years earlier but he was never sure he once saw mora cross himself and say a silent prayer at one of the dollmaker murder scenes because of the uneasiness bosch felt he had had little contact with mora since the norman church shooting and the breakup of the task force mora went back to advice and bosch was shipped to hollywood occasionally the two would see each other in the courthouse or at the seven or the red wind but even at the bars they were usually with different groups and sat apart taking turns sending beers back and forth harry she was definitely among the living until at least two years ago that flick you came acrosstails from the crypt it was made two years ago means church definitely didnt do her probably whoever sent the note did i dont know if that is good or bad news for you i dont either church had a rocksolid alibi for the kaminski killing he was dead with that added to the apparent alibi wieczoreks videotape provided church for the eleventh killing boschs sense of paranoia was turning to panic for four years there had been no doubt for him about what he had done so hows the trial going anyway mora asked dont ask can i use your phone bosch dialed edgars pager number and then punched in moras phone number after he hung up to wait for the call back he didnt know what else to say the trials a trial you still supposed to testify i guess im on for tomorrow i dont know what she wants from me i wasnt even there the night you took that bastard down well you were on the task force with me thats good enough to drag you into it well well the phone rang and mora picked it up he then passed it to bosch whereyat harry im here with mora he filled me in anything on the prints not yet i missed my man at sid musta gone to lunch so i left the prints there should have a confirmation later today but im not waiting on it where are you now missing persons trying to see if this girl ever got reported missing now that i have a name to go with the body you gonna be there a while just started were looking through hard copies they only went to computer eighteen months ago ill be over you got your trial man i have some time bosch felt that he had to keep moving to keep thinking it was the only way to keep from examining the horror building in his mind the possibility he had taken down the wrong man he drove back to parker center and took the stairs down to the first subterranean level missing persons was a small office inside the fugitives section edgar was sitting on a desk looking through a stack of white forms bosch recognized these as cases that were not even investigated after the reports had been made they would have been in files if there had been any followup nothing so far harry edgar said he then introduced bosch to detective morgan randolph who was sitting at a nearby desk randolph gave bosch a stack of reports and he spent the next fifteen minutes looking through the pages each one an individual story of someones pain that had fallen on the deaf ears of the department harry on the description look for a tattoo above the ass edgar said how do you know mora had some photos of magna cum loudly in action as mora says and theres a tattooits yosemite sam you know the cartoonto the left of the dimple over the left side of her ass well did you find that on the body didnt notice it cause of the severe skin discoloration but i didnt really look at the backside either whats going on with that i thought you said the cut was going to be done yesterday yeah thats what they said but i called over and theyre still backed up from the weekend they havent even prepped it yet i called sakai a little while ago and hes going to take a look in the freezer after lunch check on the tattoo bosch looked back at his stack the recurrent theme was the young ages of the missing people la was a drain which drew a steady stream of the nations runaways but there were many who disappeared from here as well bosch finished his stack without seeing the name rebecca kaminski her alias or anyone that matched her description he looked at his watch and knew he had to get back to court he took another stack off randolphs desk anyway and began to wade through it as he searched he listened to the banter between edgar and randolph it was clear that they had known each other before this days meeting edgar called him morg bosch figured they mightve known each other from the black peace officers association he found nothing in the second stack i gotta go im gonna be late okay man ill let you know what we find and the prints too okay you got it court was already in session when bosch got to courtroom he quietly opened the gate went through and took his seat next to belk the judge eyed him disdainfully but said nothing bosch looked up to see assistant chief irvin irving in the witness seat money chandler was at the lectern good going belk whispered to him late for your own trial bosch ignored him and watched as chandler began asking irving general questions about his background and years on the force they were preliminary questions bosch knew he couldnt have missed much look belk whispered next if you dont care about this at least pretend you do for the jurys sake i know we are only talking about taxpayers money here but act like its going to be your own money they will be deciding to give i got tied up it wont happen again you know im trying to figure out this case maybe that doesnt matter to you since youve already decided he leaned back in his chair to get away from belk he was reminded that he had not eaten lunch by a sharp signal of resentment from his stomach he tried to concentrate on the testimony as assistant chief what does your command include chandler asked irving i am presently the commanding officer of all detective services at the time of the dollmaker investigation you were one rank below a deputy chief correct yes as such you were in charge of the internal affairs division correct yes iad and operations bureau which basically means i was in charge of managing and allocating the departments personnel what is the mission of the iad as it is known to police the police we investigate all citizen complaints all interior complaints of misconduct do you investigate police shootings not per se there is an officer involved shooting team that handles the initial investigation after that if there is an allegation of misconduct or any impropriety it is forwarded to iad for followup yes and what do you recall of the iad investigation of the shooting of norman church by detective harry bosch i recall all of it why was it referred to iad the shooting team determined that detective bosch had not followed procedures the shooting itself was within departmental policy but some of his actions prior to the gunfire were not can you be more specific yes basically he went there alone he went to this mans apartment without backup placing himself in danger it ended in the shooting its called cowboying it isnt it ive heard the phrase i dont use it but does it fit i wouldnt know you wouldnt know chief would you know if mr church would be alive today if detective bosch had not created this situation by playing cow objection belk shrieked but before he could walk to the lectern to argue judge keyes sustained the objection and told chandler to avoid speculative questions yes your honor she said pleasantly chief basically what you have testified to is that detective bosch set in motion a series of events that ultimately ended with an unarmed man being killed am i right that is incorrect the investigation found no substantive indication or evidence that detective bosch deliberately set this scenario in motion it was spur of the moment he was checking out a lead when it looked good he should have called for backup but he didnt he went in he identified himself and mr church made the furtive move and here we are that is not to say that the outcome would have been different had there been a backup i mean anybody who would disobey an order from a police officer holding a gun would probably do it with two officers holding guns chandler successfully had the last sentence of the answer struck from the record to come to the conclusion that detective bosch did not intentionally set the situation into motion did your investigators study all facets of the shooting yes indeed how about detective bosch was he studied unquestionably he was rigorously questioned about his actions and about his motives his motives chief did you or any of your investigators know that detective boschs mother was slain in hollywood about thirty years ago by a killer who was never arrested that prior to that she had a record for multiple arrests for loitering bosch felt his skin go hot as if klieg lights had been turned on him and that everyone in the courtroom was staring at him he was sure they were but he looked only at irving who stared silently ahead a palsied look on his face the capillaries on either side of his nose flaring when irving didnt answer chandler prompted him did you know chief it is referenced in detective boschs personnel file when he applied to the force he had to say if he had ever been the victim of a crime he lost his mother he wrote finally irving said no i did not know i believe that loitering was a euphemism for prostitution in the s when los angeles was engaged in a denial of crime problems such as rampant prostitution on hollywood boulevard is that correct i dont recall that chandler asked to approach the witness and handed irving a thin stack of papers she gave him nearly a minute to read through them he furrowed his brow as he read and bosch could not see his eyes the muscles of his cheeks bunched together below his temples what is that chief irving chandler asked it is what we call a due diligence report detailing the investigation of a homicide it is dated november what is a due diligence report every unsolved case is looked at annuallywe call it due diligenceuntil such time that we feel the prognosis for bringing the case to a successful conclusion is hopeless what is the victims name and circumstances of her death marjorie phillips lowe she was raped and strangled october her body was found in an alley behind hollywood boulevard between vista and gower what is the investigators conclusion chief irving it says that at this time which was a year after the crime there are no workable leads and prognosis for successful conclusion of the case is deemed hopeless thank you now one more thing is there a box on the cover form listing next of kin yes it identifies the next of kin as hieronymus bosch next to that in brackets it says harry a box marked son has been checked off chandler referred to her yellow pad for a few moments to let this information soak into the jury it was so quiet bosch could actually hear chandlers pen scratching on the pad as she made a notation now she said chief irving would knowing about detective boschs mother have caused you to take a closer look at this shooting after a long moment of silence he said i cant say he shot a man suspected of doing almost the exact same thing that had happened to his motherhis mothers slaying being unsolved are you saying you dont know if that would have been germane to your investigation i yes i dont know at this time bosch wanted to put his head down on the table he had noticed that even belk had stopped scribbling notes and was just watching the interchange between irving and chandler bosch tried to shake off the anger he felt and concentrate on how chandler had obtained the information he realized she had probably gotten the pfile in a discovery motion but the details of the crime and his mothers background would not be in it she had most likely procured the due diligence report from the archives warehouse on a freedom of information petition he realized he had missed several questions to irving he began watching and listening again he wished he had a lawyer like money chandler chief did you or any iad detectives go to the scene of the shooting no we did not so your information about what happened came from members of the shooting team who in turn got their information from the shooter detective bosch correct essentially yes you have no personal knowledge of the evidentiary layout the toupee under the pillow the cosmetics beneath the sink in the bathroom correct i was not there do you believe all of that was there as i just stated yes i do why it was all there in the reportsreports from several different officers but all originating with the information from detective bosch correct to a degree there were investigators swarming that place bosch didnt tell them what to write before as you say they swarmed the place how long was bosch there alone i dont know is that piece of information on any report that you know of im not sure isnt it true chief that you wanted to fire bosch and refer this shooting to the district attorneys office for the filing of criminal charges against him no that is wrong the da looked at it and passed its routine they said it was within policy too well score one for me bosch thought it was the first misstep he had seen her take with irving what happened to the woman who gave bosch this tip her name was mcqueen i believe she was a prostitute she died about a year later hepatitis at the time of her death was she part of an ongoing investigation of detective bosch and this shooting not that i am aware of and i was in charge of iad at the time what about the two iad detectives who investigated the shooting lewis and clarke i believe their names were didnt they continue their investigation of bosch long after the shooting had been determined officially to be within policy irving took a while to answer he was probably leery of being led to slaughter again if they conducted such an ongoing investigation it was without my knowledge or approval where are those detectives now they are also dead both killed in the line of duty a couple years ago as the commander of iad wasnt it your practice to initiate covert investigations of problem officers that you had marked for dismissal wasnt detective bosch one of those officers the answer to both questions is no unequivocally no and what happened to detective bosch for his violation of procedures during the shooting of the unarmed norman church he was suspended for one deployment period and transferred within detective services to hollywood division in english that means he was suspended for a month and demoted from the elite robberyhomicide squad to the hollywood division correct you could say it that way chandler flipped a page up on her pad chief if there were no cosmetics in the bathroom and no evidence that norman church was anything other than a lonely man who had taken a prostitute to his apartment would harry bosch still be on the force would he have been prosecuted for killing this man im not sure i understand the question im asking sir did the alleged evidence tying mr church to the killings that was allegedly found in his apartment save detective bosch did it not only save his job but save him from criminal prosecution belk stood up and objected then walked to the lectern she is asking him to speculate again your honor he cant tell what would have happened given an elaborate set of circumstances that didnt exist judge keyes clasped his hands together in front of him and leaned back thinking then he abruptly leaned forward to the microphone ms chandler is laying the groundwork to make a case that the evidence in the apartment was fabricated im not saying whether she has adequately done this or not but since that is her mission i think the question is answerable im going to allow it after some thought irving finally said i cant answer that i dont know what would have happened bosch was able to smoke two cigarettes during the tenminute recess that followed the end of irvings testimony on redirect belk had asked only a few questions trying to rebuild a fallen house with a hammer but no nails the damage was done chandler had so far used the day to skillfully plant the seeds of doubt about both church and bosch the alibi for the eleventh killing opened the door to churchs possible innocence and now she had subscribed a motive to boschs action revenge for a murder more than thirty years old by the end of the trial the seeds would be in full bloom he thought about what chandler had said about his mother could she have been right bosch had never consciously considered it it was always therethe idea of revengeflickering in some part of his mind with the distant memories of his mother but he had never taken it out and examined it why had he gone out there alone that night why hadnt he called one of the others back inmora or any of the investigators in his command bosch had always told himself and others it was because he doubted the whores story but now he knew it was his own story he was beginning to doubt bosch was so deep in these thoughts that he did not notice chandler had come through the door until the flare of her lighter caught his eye he turned and stared at her i wont stay long she said just a half i dont care he was almost done with the second cigarette whos next locke the usc psychologist bosch nodded though he immediately saw this as a break from her good guybad guy pattern unless she counted locke as a good guy well youre doing good bosch said but i guess you dont need me to tell you that no i dont you may even winyou probably will win but ultimately youre wrong about me am i do you even know yeah i know i know i have to go she stubbed the cigarette out it was less than half smoked it would be a prize for tommy faraway dr john locke was a graybearded bald and bespectacled man who looked as though he could have used a pipe to complete the picture of university professor and researcher of sexual behavior he testified that he had offered his expertise to the dollmaker task force after reading about the killings in the newspapers he helped an lapd psychiatrist draw up the first profiles of the suspect tell the jury about your expertise chandler asked well i am the director of the psychohormonal research laboratory at usc i am founder of that unit as well i have conducted wideranging studies of sexual practice paraphilia and psychosexual dynamics what is a paraphilia doctor in language we will all understand please well in laymans terms paraphilia are what are commonly referred to by the general public as sexual perversionssexual behavior generally considered unacceptable by society such as strangling your sex partner yes that would be one of them big time there was a polite murmur of humor in the courtroom and locke smiled he seemed very at ease on the witness stand bosch thought have you written scholarly articles or books about these subjects you mentioned yes i have contributed numerous articles to research publications ive written seven books on various subjects sexual development of children prepubescent paraphilia studies of sadomasochismthe whole bondage thing pornography prostitution my last book was on childhood development histories of deviant murderers so youve been around the block only as a researcher locke smiled again and bosch could see the jury warming to him all twentyfour eyes were on the sex doctor your last book the one on the murderers what was it called black hearts cracking the erotic mold of murder chandler took a moment to look at her notes what do you mean by erotic mold well ms chandler if i could digress a moment i think i should fill in some background she nodded her goahead there are generally two fields or two schools of thought when it comes to the study of sexual paraphilia i am what you call a psychoanalyst and psychoanalysts believe that the root of paraphilia in an individual comes from hostilities nurtured in childhood in other words sexual perversionsin fact even normal erotic interestsare formed in early childhood and then manifest in expressions as the individual becomes an adult on the other hand behaviorists view paraphilia as learned behaviors an example being molestation in the home of a child may trigger similar behavior by him as an adult the two schools for lack of a better word are not that divergent they are actually quite closer than psychoanalysts and behaviorists usually like to admit he nodded and folded his hands together seeming to have forgotten the original question you were going to tell us about erotic molds chandler prompted oh yes im sorry i lost the train there uh the erotic mold is the description i use to cover the whole shebang of psychosexual desires that go into an individuals ideal erotic scene you see everybody has an ideal erotic scene this could include the ideal physical attributes of a lover the location the type of sex act the smell taste touch music whatever everything all the ingredients that go into this individual achieving the ultimate erotic scene a leading authority on this out of johns hopkins university calls it a lovemap it is sort of a guide to the ultimate scene okay now in your book you applied it to sexual murderers yes with five subjectsall convicted of murder involving a sexual motivation or practicei attempted to trace each mans erotic mold to crack it open and trace the parts back to development in childhood these men had damaged molds so to speak i wanted to find where the damage took place how did you pick your subjects belk stood up and made an objection and moved to the lectern your honor as fascinating as all of this is i dont believe it is on point to this case i will stipulate dr lockes expertise in this field i dont think we have to go through the history of five other murderers we are here in trial on a case about a murderer who is not even mentioned in dr lockes book i am familiar with the book norman church is not in it ms chandler judge keyes said your honor mr belk is correct about the book its about sadistic sex killers norman church is not in it but its significance to this case will be clear in the next set of questions i think mr belk realizes this and that is the reason for his objection well mr belk i think the time for an objection was probably about ten minutes ago we are well into this line of questioning and i think we need to see it through now besides you are correct about it being rather fascinating go on ms chandler the objection is overruled belk dropped back into his chair and whispered to bosch hes gotta be banging her it was said just loud enough that chandler might have heard him but not the judge if she did she showed nothing thank you your honor she said dr locke mr belk and i were correct when we said that norman church was not one of the subjects of your study were we not yes that is correct when did the book come out just last year that would be three years after the end of the dollmaker case yes well having been part of the dollmaker task force and obviously becoming familiar with the crimes why didnt you include norman church in your study it would seem to be an obvious choice it would seem that way but it wasnt first of all norman church was dead i wanted subjects that were alive and cooperative but incarcerated of course i wanted people that i could interview but of the five subjects you wrote about only four are alive what about the fifth a man named alan karps who was executed in texas before you even began your book why not norman church because ms chandler karps had spent much of his adult life in institutions there were voluminous public records on his treatment and psychiatric study with church there was nothing he had never been in trouble before he was an anomaly chandler looked down at her yellow pad and flipped a page letting the point she just scored hang in the quiet courtroom like a cloud of cigarette smoke but you did at least make preliminary inquiries about church didnt you locke hesitated before answering yes i made a very preliminary inquiry it amounted to contacting his family and asking his wife if she would grant me an interview she turned me down since the man himself was dead and there were no records about himother than the actual details of the murders which i was already familiar withi didnt pursue it i went with karps in texas bosch watched chandler cross several questions off on her legal pad and then flip several pages to a new set he guessed that she was changing tack she said while you were working with the task force you drew up a psychological profile of the killer correct yes locke said slowly he adjusted himself in the chair straightening up for what he knew was coming what was that based on an analysis of the crime scenes and method of homicide filtered through what little we know about the deviant mind i came up with common attributes that i thought might be part of our suspects makeupno pun intended no one in the courtroom laughed bosch looked around and saw that the spectator rows were becoming crowded this must be the best show in the building he thought maybe all of downtown you were not very successful were you if norman church was the dollmaker that is no not very successful but that happens its a lot of guesswork rather than a testimonial to my failure it is more a testimonial to how little we know about people this mans behavior did not make so much as a blip on anybodys radar screennot counting of course the women he killeduntil the night he was shot you speak as if it is a given that norman church was the killer the dollmaker do you know that to be true based on indisputable facts well i know it to be true because it is what the police told me if you take it backwards doctor if you start with what you know about norman church now and leave out what the police have told you about the supposed evidence would you ever believe him capable of what he has been accused of belk was about to stand up to object but bosch strongly put his hand on his arm and held him down belk turned and looked angrily at him but by then locke was answering i wouldnt be able to count him in or out as a suspect we dont know enough about him we dont know enough about the human mind in general all i know is anybody is capable of anything i could be a sexual killer even you ms chandler we all have an erotic mold and for most of us it is quite normal for some it may be a bit unusual but still only playful for the others on the extreme who find they can only reach erotic excitement and fulfillment through administering pain even killing their partners it is buried deep and dark chandler was looking down at her pad and writing when he finished when she didnt ask another question immediately he continued unbidden unfortunately the black heart is not worn on the sleeve the victims who see it usually dont live to talk about it thank you doctor chandler said i have nothing further belk plowed in without any preliminary softball questions a look of concentration on his wide florid face that bosch had not seen previously doctor these men with these socalled paraphilia what do they look like like anybody there is no look that gives them away yes and are they always on the prowl you know looking to indulge their aberrant fantasies by acting them out no actually studies have shown that these people obviously know they have aberrant tastes and they work to keep them in check those brave enough to come forward with their problems often lead completely normal lives with the aid of chemical and psychological therapy those that dont are periodically overcome by the compulsion to act out and they may follow these urges and commit a crime psychosexually motivated serial killers often exhibit patterns that are quite repetitive so that police tracking them can almost predict within a few days or a week when they will strike this is because the buildup of stress the compulsion to act will follow a pattern often what you have are decreasing intervalsthe overpowering urge comes back sooner and sooner each time belk was leaning over the lectern his weight firmly against it i see but between these moments of compulsion when the acts take place does this man seem to have a normal life or you know is he standing in the corner slobbering or whatever no nothing like thatat least until the intervals become so short that they literally dont exist then you might have someone out there always on the prowl as you said but between the intervals there is normalcy the aberrant sexual actrape strangulation voyeurism anythingwill provide the subject with the memory to construct fantasy he will be able to use the act to fantasize and stimulate arousal during masturbation or normal sex do you mean that he will sort of replay the murder in his mind so that he can become sexually aroused for having normal sexual intercourse with say his wife chandler objected and belk had to rephrase the question so it was not leading locke yes he will replay the aberrant act in his mind so that he can accomplish the act that is socially acceptable so in doing so a wife for example might not even know of her husbands real desires correct that is correct it has happened often and a person such as this could carry on at work and with friends and not reveal this side of himself correct again that is correct there is ample evidence of this in the case histories of sexual sadists who kill ted bundy led a welldocumented double life randy kraft killer of dozens of hitchhikers here in southern california i could name many many more you see this is the very reason they kill so many victims before being caught and then it is usually only because of a small mistake like with norman church yes as you testified earlier you could not find or gather enough information about norman churchs early development and behavior to include him in your book does that fact dissuade you from belief that he was the killer police claim him to be not in the least as i said these desires can be easily cloaked in normal behavior these people know they have desires that are not accepted by society believe me they take pains to hide them mr church was not the only subject i considered for the book and then discarded for lack of valuable information i did preliminary studies of at least three other serial killers who were either dead or uncooperative and dropped them as well because of the lack of public record or background on them you mentioned earlier that the roots of these problems are planted in childhood how i should have said may the roots may be planted in childhood it is a difficult science and nothing is known for sure getting to your question if i had a definite answer i guess i wouldnt have a job but what psychoanalysts such as myself believe is that the paraphilia can come through emotional or physical trauma or both it basically is a synthesis of these possibly some biological determinants and social learning it is hard to pinpoint but we believe it happens very early generally five to eight years of age one of the fellows in my book was molested by an uncle at age three my thesis or belief or whatever you want to call it is that this trauma set him on the trail toward becoming a murderer of homosexuals in most of these killings he emasculated his victims the courtroom had become so quiet during lockes testimony that bosch heard the slight bump of one of the rear doors opening he glanced back and saw jerry edgar taking a seat in the rear row edgar nodded at harry who looked up at the clock it was the trial would be recessed for the day in fifteen minutes bosch figured edgar was on his way back from the autopsy would the childhood trauma thats at the root of a persons criminal activities as an adult need to be so overt in other words as traumatic as molestation not necessarily it could be rooted in more traditional emotional stress placed on a child the awesome pressure to succeed in a parents eyes coupled with other things it is hard to discuss this in a hypothetical context because there are so many dimensions of human sexuality belk followed up with a few more general questions about lockes studies before ending chandler asked a couple more questions on redirect but bosch had lost interest he knew that edgar would not have come to the courtroom unless he had something important twice he glanced back at the clock on the wall and twice he looked at his watch finally when belk said he had nothing further on cross judge keyes called it a day bosch watched locke step down and head out through the gate and toward the door a couple of the reporters followed him then the jury stood and filed out belk turned to bosch as they watched and said better be ready tomorrow my guess is that its going to be your turn in the sun whatve you got jerry bosch asked when he caught up with edgar in the hallway leading to the escalator your car over at parker center yeah im there too lets walk that way they got on the escalator but didnt talk because it was crowded with spectators from the courtroom out on the sidewalk when they were alone edgar pulled a folded white form out of his coat pocket and handed it to bosch all right we got it confirmed the prints mora dug up on rebecca kaminski match the hand mold we made on the concrete blonde i also just came from the autopsy and the tattoo is there above the ass yosemite sam bosch unfolded the paper it was a photocopy of a standard missing person report thats a copy of the report on rebecca kaminski also known as magna cum loudly missing twentytwo months and three days bosch was looking at the report doesnt look like any doubt to me he said nope no doubt it was her the autopsy also confirms manual strangulation as the cause the knot pulled tight on the right side most likely a lefty they walked without talking for half a block bosch was surprised by how warm it was for so late in the day finally edgar spoke so obviously weve got it confirmed this may look like one of churchs dolls but theres no way in the world he did it unless he came back from the dead so i did some checking at the bookstore over by union station bremmers bookthe dollmaker with all the details a copycat would need was published in hardback seventeen months after you put church in the dirt becky kaminski goes missing about four months after the book came out so our killer couldve bought the book and then used it as a sort of blueprint on what to do to make it look like that dollmaker edgar looked over at him and smiled youre in the clear harry bosch nodded but didnt smile edgar didnt know about the videotape they walked down temple to los angeles street bosch didnt notice the people around him the homeless shaking their cups on the corners he almost crossed los angeles in front of traffic until edgar put a hand on his arm while waiting for the walk sign he looked down and scanned the report again it was bare bones rebecca kaminski had simply gone out on a date and not returned she was meeting the unnamed man at the hyatt on sunset that was it no followup no additional information the report had been made by a man named tom cerrone who was identified in the report as kaminskis roommate in studio city the light changed and they walked across los angeles street and then right toward parker center you going to talk to this cerrone guy the roommate he asked edgar i dont know probably get around to it im more interested in what you think about all of this harry where do we go from here bremmers book was a fuckin bestseller anybody who read it is a suspect bosch said nothing until they got to the parking lot and stopped near the entrance booth before separating bosch looked down at the report in his hands and then up at edgar can i keep this i might take a run by the guy be my guest another thing you should know harry edgar reached in his inside coat pocket and pulled out another piece of paper this one was yellow and bosch knew it was a subpoena i got served at the coroners office i dont know how she knew i was there when dyou have to be in court tomorrow at ten i had nothing to do with the dollmaker task force so we both know what shes going to ask about the concrete blonde bosch threw his cigarette into the fountain that was part of the memorial to officers killed in the line of duty and walked through the glass doors into parker center he badged one of the cops behind the front desk and walked around to the elevators there was a red line painted on the black tile floor that was the route visitors were told to take if they were going to the police commission hearing room there was also a yellow line for internal affairs and a blue for applicants who wanted to become cops it was a tradition for cops standing around waiting for elevators to stand on the yellow line thereby making any citizens who were going to iadusually to file complaintswalk around them this maneuver was usually accompanied by a baleful stare from cop to citizen every time bosch waited for an elevator he remembered the prank he had been partially responsible for while still in the academy he and another cadet had come into parker center at four one morning drunk and hiding paint brushes and cans of black and yellow paint in their windbreakers in a quick and daring operation his partner had used the black paint to obliterate the yellow line on the tile floor while bosch painted a new yellow line which went past the elevators down the hall into a mens room and right to a urinal the prank had given them near legendary status in their class even among the instructors he got off the elevator on the third floor and walked back to the robberyhomicide division the place was empty most rhd cops worked a strict seventothree shift that way the job didnt get in the way of all the moonlighting gigs they had lined up rhd dicks were the cream of the department they got all the best gigs chauffeuring visiting saudi princes security work for studio bosses bodyguarding vegas high rollerslvpd did not allow its people to moonlight so the highpaying jobs fell to lapd when bosch had first been promoted to rhd there were still a few detectivethrees around who had worked bodyguard duty for howard hughes they had spoken of the experience as if that was what the rhd job was all about a means to an end a way to get a job working for some deranged billionaire who didnt need any bodyguards because he never went anywhere bosch walked to the rear of the room and turned on one of the computers he lit a cigarette while the tube warmed up and took the report edgar had given him out of his coat pocket the report was nothing it had never been looked at acted on cared about he noticed it was a walkintom cerrone had come into the north hollywood division station and made the report at the front desk that meant it had probably been written up by a probationary rookie or a burnedout vet who didnt give a shit in either case it was not taken for what it was a coveryourass report cerrone said he was kaminskis roommate according to the brief summary two days before the report was made she had told cerrone she was going on a blind date meeting an unnamed man at the hyatt on the sunset strip and that she hoped the guy wasnt a creep she never came back cerrone got worried and went to the cops the report was taken passed through north hollywood detectives where it didnt make a blip on anyones screen and then sent to missing persons in downtown where four detectives are charged with finding the sixty people reported missing on average each week in the city in reality the report was put in a stack of others like it and was not looked at again until edgar and his pal morg found it none of this bothered bosch though anyone who spent two minutes reading the report should have known that cerrone wasnt what he said he was but bosch figured kaminski was dead and in the concrete long before the report was made so there was nothing anyone could have done anyway he punched the name thomas cerrone into the computer and ran a search on the california department of justice information network as he expected he got a hit the computer file on cerrone who was forty years old showed he had been popped nine times in as many years for soliciting for prostitution and twice for pandering he was a pimp bosch knew kaminskis pimp harry noticed that cerrone was on thirtysix months probation for his last conviction he got out his black telephone book and rolled his chair over to a desk with a phone he dialed the afterhours number for the county probation department and gave the clerk who answered cerrones name and doj number she gave back cerrones current address the pimp had come down in the world from studio city to van nuys since kaminski had gone to the hyatt and not come back after hanging up he thought of calling sylvia and wondered if he should tell her it was likely he would be called by chandler to testify the next day he was unsure if he wanted her to be there to see him cornered on the witness stand by money chandler he decided not to call cerrones home address was an apartment on sepulveda boulevard in an area where prostitutes were not too discreet about how they got their customers it was still daylight and bosch counted four young women spread apart over a twoblock stretch they wore halter tops and short shorts they held their thumb out like hitchhikers when cars went by but it was clear they were only interested in a ride around the corner to a parking lot where they could take care of business bosch parked at the curb across from the vanaire apartments where cerrone had told his probation officer he was living a couple of the numbers from the address had fallen off the front wall but it was readable because the smog had left the rest of the wall a dingy beige the place needed new paint new screens some plastering to fill in the cracks in the facade and probably new tenants actually it needed to be knocked down start over bosch thought as he crossed the street cerrones name was on the residents list next to the front security door but no one answered the buzzer at apartment six bosch lit a cigarette and decided to hang around for a while he counted twentyfour units on the residents list it was six oclock people would be coming home for dinner someone would come along he walked away from the door and back out to the curb there was graffiti on the sidewalk all of it in black paint the monikers of the local homeboys there was also a scrip painted in block letters that asked r u the nex roddy king he wondered how someone could misspell a name that had been heard and printed so many times a woman and two young children came to the steelgrated door from the other side bosch timed his approach so that he was at the door just as she opened it have you seen tommy cerrone around he asked as he passed her she was too busy with the children to answer bosch walked into the courtyard to get his bearings and to look for a door with a six on itcerrones apartment there was graffiti on the concrete floor of the courtyard a gang insignia bosch couldnt make out he found number six on the first floor toward the back there was a rustedout hibachi grill on the ground next to the door there was also a childs bike with training wheels parked under the front window the bike didnt fit bosch tried to look in but the curtains were drawn leaving only a threeinch band of darkness he could not see beyond he knocked on the door and as was his practice stepped to the side a mexican woman with what looked like an eightmonth pregnancy beneath her faded pink bathrobe answered the door behind the small woman bosch could see a young boy sitting on the living room floor in front of a blackandwhite tv tuned to a spanish language channel holabosch saidse√±or tom cerrone aqu√≠ the woman stared at him with frightened eyes she seemed to close in on herself as if to get smaller before him her arms moved up from her side and closed over her swollen belly no migrabosch saidpolic√≠a tom√°s cerrone aqu√≠ she shook her head no and began to close the door bosch put his hand out to stop it struggling with his spanish he asked if she knew cerrone and where he was she said he only came once a week to collect the mail and the rent she moved back a step and gestured to the card table where there was a small stack of mail bosch could see an american express bill on top gold card tel√©fono necesidad urgente she looked down from his eyes and her hesitation told him she had a number por favor she told him to wait and she left the doorway while she was gone the boy sitting ten feet inside the door turned from the tvbosch could see it was some kind of game showand looked at him bosch felt uncomfortable he looked away into the courtyard when he looked back the boy was smiling he had his hand up and was pointing a finger at bosch he made a shooting sound and giggled then the mother was back at the door with a piece of paper there was a local phone number on it that was all bosch copied it down in a small notebook he carried and then told her he would take the mail the woman turned and looked at the card table as if the answer to what she should do was sitting on it with the mail bosch told her it would be okay and she finally lifted the stack and handed it to him the frightened look was in her eyes again he stepped back and was going to walk away when he stopped and looked back at her he asked how much the rent was and she told him it was one hundred dollars a week bosch nodded and walked away out on the street he walked down to a pay phone that was in front of the next apartment complex he called the downtown communications center gave the operator the phone number he had just gotten and said he needed an address while he waited he thought about the pregnant woman and wondered why she stayed could things be worse back in the mexican town she came from for some he knew the journey here was so difficult that returning was out of the question as he was flipping through cerrones mail one of the hitchhikers walked up to him she wore an orange tank top over her surgically augmented breasts her cutoff jeans were cut so high above the thighs that the white pockets hung out below in one of the pockets he could see the distinctive shape of a condom package she had the gaunt tired look of a strawberrya woman who would do anything anytime anywhere to keep crack in her pipe factoring in her deteriorated appearance he put her age at no more than twenty to boschs surprise she said hey darling looking for a date he smiled and said youre going to have to be more careful than that you want to stay out of the cage oh shit she said and turned to walk away wait a minute wait a minute dont i know you yeah i know you its whats your name girl look man im not talking to you and im not blowing you so i gotta go wait wait i dont want anything i just thought you know that wed met arent you one of tommy cerrones girls yeah thats where i met you the name put a slight stutter in her step bosch let the phone dangle by its cord and caught up to her she stopped look im not with tommy anymore okay i gotta go to work she turned from him and put her thumb out as a wave of southbound traffic started by wait a minute just tell me something tell me where tommy is these days i need to get with him on something on what i dont know where he is a girl you remember becky couple years ago blonde liked red lipstick had a set like yours she mighta used the name maggie i want to find her and she was working for tom you remember her i wasnt even around then and i havent seen tommy in four months and you are full of shit she walked off and bosch called after her twenty bucks she stopped and came back for what an address im not bullshitting i want to talk to him well give it he took the money out of his wallet and gave it to her it occurred to him that van nuys vice might be watching him from somewhere around here and wondering why he was giving a hooker a twenty try the grandview she said i dont know the number or anything but its on the top floor you cant tellm i sent ya hell fuck me up she walked away putting the money in one of the flapping pockets he didnt have to ask her where the grandview was he watched her cut in between two apartment buildings and disappear probably going to get a rock he wondered if she had told the truth and why he could find it in himself to give her money but not the woman in apartment six the police operator had hung up by the time he got back to the pay phone bosch redialed and asked for her and she gave him the address that went with the phone number hed gotten suite p the grandview apartments on sepulveda in sherman oaks he had just wasted twenty bucks on crack cocaine he hung up in the car he finished looking through the mail half of it was junk mail the rest credit card bills and mailers from republican candidates there was also a postcard invitation to an adult film performers guild awards banquet in reseda the following week bosch opened the american express bill the illegality of this did not concern him in the least cerrone was a criminal who was lying to his probation officer there would be no complaint from him the pimp owed american express this month the bill was two pages and bosch noticed two billings for airline flights to las vegas and three billings from victorias secret bosch was familiar with victorias secret having studied the mailorder lingerie catalog at sylvias on occasion in one month cerrone had ordered nearly in lingerie by mail the money paid by the poor woman who rented the apartment cerrone was using as a front for a probation address was basically subsidizing the lingerie bills of cerrones whores it angered bosch but it gave him an idea the grandview apartments were the ultimate california ideal built alongside a shopping mall the building afforded its tenants the ability to walk directly from their apartment into the mall thereby cutting out the heretofore required middle ground for all southern california culture and interaction the car bosch parked in the malls garage and entered the outer lobby through the rear entrance it was an italian marble affair with a grand piano in its center that was playing by itself bosch recognized the song as a cab calloway standard everybody that comes to my place has to eat there was a directory and a phone on the wall by the security door that led to the elevators the name next to p was kuntz bosch took it to be an inside joke he lifted the phone and pushed the button a woman answered and he said ups gotta package uh she said from who um it says i cant read the writinglooks like victors secretary or something oh she said and he heard her giggle do i have to sign yes maam i need a signature rather than buzz him in she said she would come down bosch stood at the glass door for two minutes waiting before he realized the scam wouldnt work he was standing there in a suit and had no package in his hand he turned his back to the elevator just as the polished chrome doors began to part he took a step toward the piano and looked down as if he was fascinated by it and didnt notice the elevators arrival from behind him he heard the security door start to open and he turned around are you ups she was blonde and stunning even in her blue jeans and pale blue oxford shirt their eyes met and right away bosch knew she knew it was a scam she immediately tried to close the door but bosch got there in time and pushed his way through what are you doing i bosch clamped a hand over her mouth because he thought she was about to scream covering half her face accentuated the fright in her eyes she didnt seem as stunning to bosch anymore its okay im not going to hurt you i just want to talk to tommy lets go up he slowly pulled his hand back and she didnt scream tommys not there she said in a whisper as if to signal her cooperation then we can wait he gently pushed her toward the elevator and punched the button she was right cerrone wasnt there but bosch didnt have to wait long he had barely had time to check on the opulent furnishings of the twobedroom twobath and loft apartment with private roof garden when the man arrived cerrone stepped through the front doorracing forum in hand just as bosch stepped into the living room from the balcony that overlooked sepulveda and the crowded ventura freeway cerrone initially smiled at bosch but then the face became blank this often happened to bosch with crooks he believed it was because the crooks often thought they recognized him and it was true they probably did boschs picture had been in the paper and on tv several times in the last few years including once this week harry believed that most crooks who read the papers or watched the news looked closely at the pictures of the cops they probably thought it gave them an added advantage someone to look out for but instead it bred familiarity cerrone had smiled as though bosch was a longlost friend then he realized it was probably the enemy a cop thats right bosch said tommy he made me bring him up the girl said he called on the shut up cerrone barked then to bosch he said if you had a warrant you wouldnt be here alone no warrant get the fuck out very observant bosch said sit down i have questions fuck you and the questions you rode in on get out bosch sat down on a black leather couch and took out his cigarettes tom if i go its to go see your po and see about getting you revoked for this address scam youre playing the probation department frowns on cons telling them they live one place when they actually live somewhere else especially when ones a dump and ones the grandview cerrone threw theforum across the room at the girl see he said see the shit you got me in she seemed to know better than to say anything cerrone folded his arms and stood in the living room but he wasnt going to sit down he was a wellbuilt guy gone to fat too many afternoons at hollywood or del mar sipping cocktails and watching the ponies look what do you want i want to know about becky kaminski cerrone looked puzzled you remember maggie cum loudly the blonde with the tits you probably had her enlarge you were bringing her up through the video business doin some outcall work on the side and then she disappeared on you what about her that was a long time ago twentytwo months and three days i am told so what she turned up and is saying some shit about me it dont matter take it to court man well see bosch jumped up off the couch and slapped him hard across the face then pushed him over a black leather chair onto the floor cerrones eyes immediately went to the girls which told bosch that he had complete control of the situation the power of humiliation sometimes was more awesome than a gun held to the head cerrones face was a bright red all over boschs hand stung he bent over the fallen man and said she didnt turn up and you know it shes dead and you knew it when you made the missing person report you were just covering your ass i want to know how you knew look man i didnt have any but you knew she wasnt coming back how i just had a hunch she didnt turn up for a couple days guys like you dont go to the police on hunches guys like you they get their place broken into they dont even call the cops like i said you were just covering your ass you didnt want to get blamed cause you knew she wasnt coming back alive awright awright it was more than a hunch okay it was the guy i never saw him but his voice and some of the things he said it was familiar you know then after i sent her and she didnt come back it dawned on me i remembered him i had sent him somebody else once and she ended up dead who holly lere i cant remember her real name bosch could holly lere was the porno name of nicole knapp the seventh victim of the dollmaker he sat back down on the couch and put a cigarette in his mouth tommy the girl said hes smoking shut the fuck up he said to her well you said no smoking in here except on the bal shut the fuck up nicole knapp bosch said yeah thats it you knew the cops said the dollmaker got her yeah and i always thought that until becky disappeared and i remembered this guy and what he said but you didnt tell anybody you didnt call the cops its like you said man guys like me we dont call bosch nodded what did he say the caller what was it he said he said i have a special need tonight both times just like that he said the same thing both times and his voice was weird it was like he was talking through clenched teeth or something and you sent her to that i didnt put it together until after she didnt come back look man i made a report i told the cops the hotel she went to and they never did nothing im not the only one to blame shit the cops said that guy was caught that he was dead i thought it was safe safe for you or the girls you put out on the street look you think i wouldve sent her if i knew i had a lot invested in her man im sure you did bosch looked over at the blonde and wondered how long it would be before she looked like the one he had given the twenty to on the street his guess was that cerrones girls all ended up used up and on the street with their thumb out or they ended up dead he looked back at cerrone did rebecca smoke what smoke did she smoke you lived with her you should know no she didnt smoke its a disgusting habit cerrone looked over at the blonde and glared bosch dropped his cigarette on the white rug and ground it out as he stood up he headed toward the door but stopped after he opened it cerrone the woman in that dump your mail goes to what about her she doesnt pay rent anymore what are you talking about he climbed up from the floor regaining a measure of his pride im talking about her not paying you rent anymore im going to check on her from time to time if shes paying rent your po gets a call and your scam gets blown probation gets revoked and you do your time its tough to run an outcall business from county lockup only two phones on each floor and the brothers control who uses them and for how long i guess youd have to cut them in cerrone just stared at him anger thumping in his temples and she better still be there when i check bosch said if i hear she went back to mexico i blame you and make the call if i hear she bought a fucking condo i make the call she just better be there thats extortion cerrone said no asshole thats justice he left the door open out in the hallway waiting for the elevator he once again heard cerrone yell shut the fuck up the last vestiges of the evening rush hour made it a slow run up to sylvias she was sitting at the dining room table in faded blue jeans and a grant high tshirt reading book reports when he came in one of the eleventhgrade english classes she taught down in the valley at grant was called los angeles in literature she had told him she developed the class so the students might come to know their city better most of them came from other places other countries she had once told him that the students in one of her classes accounted for eleven different native languages he put his hand on the back of her neck and bent down to kiss her he noticed the reports were on nathanael westsday of the locust ever read it she asked long time ago some english teacher in high school made us read it she was crazy she elbowed him in the thigh all right wise guy i try to rotate the tough ones with the easy ones i assigned themthe big sleep thats probably what they thought this one shouldve been called arent you the life of the party today something good happen actually no everything is turning to shit out there but in here its different she got up and they embraced he ran his hand up and down her back the way he knew she liked whats happening on the case nothing everything i might be going into the mud puddle wonder if i can get a job after this as a private eye like marlowe she pushed away what are you talking about im not sure something i have to work on it tonight ill take the kitchen table you can stay out here with the locusts its your turn to cook then im going to hire the colonel shit hey thats not a good thing for an english teacher to say whats the matter with the colonel hes been dead for years never mind its okay she smiled at him this ritual occurred often when it was his turn to cook he usually took her out he could see she was disappointed by the prospect of fried chicken to go but there was too much going on too much to think about she had a face that made him want to confess everything bad he had ever done yet he knew he could not she knew it too i humiliated a man today what why because he humiliates women all men do that harry what did you do to him knocked him down in front of his woman he probably needed it i dont want you to come to court tomorrow im probably going to be called by chandler to testify but i dont want you there its going to be bad she was silent for a moment why do you do this harry tell me all these things that you do but keep the rest a secret in some ways we are so intimate and in others you tell me about the men you knock down but not about you what do i know about you your past i want us to get to that harry we have to or well end up humiliating each other thats how it ended for me before bosch nodded and looked down he didnt know what to say he was too burdened by other thoughts to get into this now you want the extra crispy he finally asked fine she went back to her book reports and he went out to get dinner after they were done eating and she went back to the dining room table he opened his briefcase on the kitchen table and took out the blue murder books he had a bottle of henry weinhards on the table but no cigarette he wouldnt smoke inside at least not while she was awake he unsnapped the first binder and laid out the sections on each of the eleven victims across the table he stood up with the bottle so he could look down and take them all in at once each section was fronted by a photograph of the victims remains as they were found there were eleven of these photos in front of him he did some thinking on the cases and then went into the bedroom and checked the suit he had worn the day before the polaroid of the concrete blonde was still in the pocket he brought it back to the kitchen and laid it on the table with the others number twelve it was a horrible gallery of broken abused bodies their garish makeup showing false smiles below dead eyes their bodies were naked exposed to the harsh light of the police photographer bosch drained the bottle and kept staring reading the names and the dates of the deaths looking at the faces all of them lost angels in the city of night he didnt notice sylvia come in until it was too late my god she said in a whisper as she saw the photos she took a step backward she was holding one of her students papers in her hand her other hand had come up to her mouth im sorry sylvia bosch said i shouldve warned you not to come in those are the women he nodded what are you doing im not sure trying to make something happen i guess i thought if i looked at them all again i might get an idea figure out whats happening but how can you look at those you were just standing there looking because i have to she looked down at the paper in her hand what is it he asked nothing uh one of my students wrote something i was going to read it to you go ahead he stepped over to the wall and turned off the light that hung over the table the photos and bosch became shrouded in darkness sylvia stood in the light cast from the dining room through the kitchen entrance go ahead she held up the paper and said its a girl she wrote west foreshadowed the end of los angeless halcyon moment he saw the city of angels becoming a city of despair a place where hopes get crushed under the weight of the mad crowd his book was the warning she looked up she goes on but that was the part i wanted to read shes only a tenthgrader taking advanced classes but she seemed to grasp something so strong there he admired her lack of cynicism boschs first thought was that the kid had plagiarizedwhered she get a word like halcyon but sylvia saw past that she saw the beauty in things he saw the darkness its good he said shes africanamerican she comes up on the bus shes one of the smartest i have and i worry about her on the bus she said the trip is seventyfive minutes each way and that is the time when she reads the assignments i give but i worry about her she seems so sensitive maybe too much so give her time and shell grow a callous on her heart everybody does no not everybody harry thats what i worry about with her she looked at him there in the darkness for a long moment im sorry i intruded you never intrude on me sylvia i am sorry i brought this home i can leave if you want take it to my place no harry i want you here you want me to put on some coffee no im fine she went back to the living room and he turned the light back on he looked over the gallery again though they looked the same in death because of the makeup applied by each ones killer the women fell into numerous physical categories according to race size coloring and so on locke had told the task force that this meant that the killer was simply an opportunistic predator not concerned with body type only the acquisition of a victim which he could then place into his erotic program he did not care if they were black or white as long as he could snatch them with as little notice as possible he was a bottom feeder he moved on a level where the women he encountered were victims long before he got to them they were women who had already given up their bodies to the unloving hands and eyes of strangers they were out there waiting for him the question bosch now knew was whether the dollmaker was still out there too he sat down and from the pocket of the binder he pulled a map of west la its creases cracked and split in some sections as he unfolded it and put it down on top of the photos the round black stickers that represented locations where bodies had been found were still in place the victims name and date of discovery were written next to each black dot geographically the task force had found no significance until after church was dead the bodies were found in locations stretching from silverlake to malibu the dollmaker littered the entire westside still for the most part the bodies were clustered in silverlake and hollywood with only one found in malibu and one in west hollywood the concrete blonde was found farther south in hollywood than any of the previous bodies she was also the only one that had been buried locke had said location of disposal was probably a choice of convenience after church was dead this seemed true four of the bodies had been dumped within a mile of his silverlake apartment another four were in eastern hollywood not a long drive either the dates had done nothing for the investigation no pattern initially there was a decreasinginterval pattern between discoveries of victims then it began to vary widely the dollmaker would go five weeks between strikes then two weeks then three nothing to make of this the detectives on the task force simply let it go bosch moved on he began reading the background packets that had been drawn up on each victim most of these were shorttwo to three pages about their sad lives one of the women who worked hollywood boulevard at night was going to beautician school by day another had been sending money to chihuahua mexico where her parents believed she had a good job as a tour guide at the famous disneyland there were odd matches between some of the victims but nothing that ever amounted to anything three of the boulevard whores went to the same doctor for weekly clap shots members of the task force put him under surveillance for three weeks but one night while they were watching him the real dollmaker picked up a prostitute on sunset and her body was found in silverlake the next morning two of the other women also shared a doctor the same beverly hills plastic surgeon had performed breastimplant surgery on them the task force had rallied on this discovery for a plastic surgeon remakes images similarly after a fashion to the way the dollmaker used makeup the plastic man as he was called by the cops was also placed under surveillance but he never made a suspicious move and seemed to be the picture of domestic bliss with a wife whose physical features he had sculpted to his own liking they were still watching him when bosch took the telephone tip that led to the shooting of norman church as far as bosch knew neither doctor ever knew he had been watched in the book bremmer wrote they were identified by pseudonyms nearly twothirds through the background packets as he read about nicole knapp the seventh victim bosch saw the pattern within the pattern he had somehow missed it before all of them had the task force locke the media they had put all the victims into the same classification a whore is a whore is a whore but there were differences some were streetwalkers some were higher up the scale as escorts within these two groups some were also dancers one was a telegram stripper and two made livings in the pornography tradeas had the latest victim becky kaminskiwhile taking outcall hooking assignments on the side bosch took the packets and photos of nicole knapp the seventh victim and shirleen kemp the eleventh victim off the table these were the two porn actresses known on video as holly lere and heather cumhither respectively he then paged through one of the binders until he found the package on the lone survivor the woman who had gotten away she too was a porn actress who took outcall sex jobs her name was georgia stern her video name was velvet box she had gone to the hollywood star motel to meet a date arranged through the outcall service she advertised in the local sex tabloids after she arrived her client asked her to undress she turned her back to do this offering a show of modesty in case that was a turnon for the client she then saw the leather strap of her purse come over her head and he began choking her from behind she fought as probably all the victims had but she was able to get free by driving an elbow into her attackers ribs then turning and delivering a kick to his genitals she ran naked from the room all thought of modesty long gone by the time police went back in the attacker was gone it was three days before the reports on the incident filtered their way to the task force by then the hotel room had been used dozens of timesthe hollywood star offered hourly ratesand it was useless as far as gathering physical evidence went reading the reports on it now bosch realized why the composite drawing that georgia stern had helped a police artist sketch was so different from the appearance of norman church it had been a different man an hour later he turned one of the binders to the last page where he had kept a listing of phone numbers and addresses of the principals involved in the investigation he went to the wall phone and dialed the home of dr john locke he hoped the psychologist had not changed his number in four years locke picked up after five rings sorry dr locke i know its getting late its harry bosch harry how are you i am sorry we didnt get to talk today it was not the best circumstance for you im sure but i yes doctor listen somethings come up its related to the dollmaker i have some things i want to show you and talk about would it be possible for me to come there there was a lengthy silence before locke answered would that be about this new case ive read about in the paper yes that and some other things well lets see its nearly ten oclock are you sure this cant wait until tomorrow morning i am in court tomorrow morning doctor all day its important id really appreciate your time ill be there before eleven and be out before twelve when locke didnt say anything harry wondered if the softspoken doctor was afraid of him or just didnt want a killer cop in his home besides bosch said into the silence i think youll find it interesting very well locke said after getting the address harry packed all the paperwork back into the two binders sylvia came into the kitchen after hesitating at the doorway until she was sure the photos were packed away i heard you talking are you going to his place tonight yeah right now in laurel canyon whats going on he stopped his hurried movement he had both binders stacked under his right arm i well we missed something the task force we messed up i think all along there were two but i didnt see it until now two killers i think so i want to ask locke about it are you coming back tonight i dont know it will be late i was thinking about just going to my place check my messages get some fresh clothes this weekend is not looking good is it whatoh yeah lone pine yeah well uh i dont worry about it but i may want to hang out at your place while they have the open house here sure she walked him to the door and opened it she told him to be careful and to call her the next day he said he would at the threshold he hesitated he said you know you were right about what what you said about men laurel canyon is a winding cut through the santa monica mountains that connects studio city with hollywood and the sunset strip on the south side where the road drops below mulholland drive and the fast four lanes thin to two crumbling invitations to a headon collision the canyon becomes funky la where fortyyearold hollywood bungalows sit next to multilevel glass contemporaries that sit next to gingerbread houses harry houdini built a castle in here among the steep hillsides jim morrison lived in a clapboard house near the little market that still serves as the canyons only commercial outpost the canyon was a place where the new richrock stars writers film actors and drug dealerscame to live they braved the mudslides and the monumental traffic tieups just to call laurel canyon home locke lived on lookout mountain drive a steep upward grade off laurel canyon boulevard that made boschs departmentissue caprice work extra hard the address he was looking for could not be missed because it blinked in blue neon from the front wall of lockes house harry pulled to the curb behind a multicolor volkswagen van that was at least twentyfive years old laurel canyon was like that a time warp bosch got out dropped his cigarette in the street and stepped on it it was very quiet and dark he heard the caprices engine ticking away its heat the smell of burning oil wafting from the undercarriage he reached in through the open window and grabbed the two binders it had taken most of an hour to get to lockes and during that time bosch had been able to refine his thoughts on the discovery of the pattern within a pattern he also realized along the way that there was a key way of attempting to confirm it locke answered with a glass of red wine in his hand he was barefoot and wearing blue jeans and a surgeons green shirt hanging from a leather thong around his neck was a large pink crystal good evening detective bosch please come in he led the way through an entry hall to a large living roomdining room area with a wall of french doors that opened onto a brick patio surrounding a lighted blue pool bosch noticed the pinkish carpet was dirty and worn but otherwise the place was not bad for a college sex professor and author he noticed the water of the pool was choppy as if someone had been swimming recently he thought he smelled a trace of stale marijuana smoke beautiful place bosch said you know were almost neighbors i live on the other side of the hill on woodrow wilson oh really how come it took you so long to get here well actually i didnt come from home i was at a friends place up in bouquet canyon ah a girlfriend that explains the fortyfiveminute wait sorry to hold you up doctor why dont we get on with this so i dont keep you any longer than necessary yes please he signaled bosch to put the binders down on the dining room table he didnt ask if harry wanted a glass of wine an ashtray or even a pair of swimming trunks im sorry to intrude harry offered ill be quick yes you said that im sorry this came up now myself testifying put me back a day on my research and writing schedule and i was trying to recoup tonight bosch noticed his hair wasnt wet maybe he had been working while someone else had been in the pool locke took a seat at the dining room table and bosch told the story of the concrete blonde investigation in exact chronological order after starting by showing him the copy of the new note left at the station on monday while telling the details of the latest death bosch saw lockes eyes brighten with interest when he was done the psychologist folded his arms and closed his eyes and said let me think about this before we go on he sat perfectly still bosch wasnt sure what to make of it after twenty seconds went by he finally said if youre going to think im going to borrow your phone in the kitchen locke said without opening his eyes bosch got amados phone number from the task force list in the binder and called him he could tell he had awakened the coroners analyst after identifying himself bosch said sorry to wake you but things are happening very quickly on this new dollmaker case did you read about it in the paper yeah but they said it wasnt known for sure if it was the dollmaker right thats what im working on i have a question go ahead you testified yesterday about the rape kits taken from each victim where are they now the evidence i mean there was a long silence before amado said theyre probably still in evidence storage the coroners policy is to keep evidence seven years after resolution of a case you know in case of appeals or something now since your perp is dead there would be no reason to keep the stuff even that long but it takes an order from the medical examiner to clear out an evidence locker the chances are the me at the time would not have thought or remembered to do this after you uh killed church its too big of a bureaucracy to run that well my guess is the kits would still be there the evidence custodian would only request a disposal order after seven years okay bosch said excitement evident in his voice what about the condition would it still be usable as evidence and for analysis should be no deterioration i would think how fulls your plate its always full but youve got me hooked here whats up i need someone to pull the kits from victims seven and eleven thats nicole knapp and shirleen kemp got it seven and eleven like the store i got it seven eleven then what crossreference the pubic combs look for the same foreign hair in both places on both women how long will it take three four days we have to send that to the doj lab i can put a rush on it maybe get it sooner can i ask you something why are we doing this i think there was someone else besides church a copycat he did seven eleven and the one this week and im thinking he might not have been smart enough to shave himself like church if you find similar hair in the combs i think that will clinch it well i can tell you something right off that is interesting about those two seven and eleven bosch waited i reviewed everything before i testified so its still fresh you know remember i testified that two of the victims had extreme damage vaginal tears well it was those two seven and eleven bosch thought about this for a few moments from out in the dining room he heard locke say harry be right there he called out to amado he said thats interesting it means this second guy whoever he is hes rougher trade than church those two women were hurt the most something came together in boschs mind then something that had not seemed right about amados testimony the day before now it was clear the condoms he said what about them you testified that it was a box of twelve only three left thats right nine used you subtract victims seven and eleven from the list and you have nine victims it fits harry okay first thing tomorrow im on this give me three days max they hung up and bosch wondered if amado would get any sleep tonight locke had replenished his wineglass but still did not ask bosch if he wanted a glass when he returned to the dining room bosch sat down across the table from him im ready to go on locke said lets do it youre saying that the body found this week exhibited every known detail ascribed to the dollmaker right except now we have a new method of disposal a private disposal as opposed to the public challenge of the others its all very interesting what else well from trial testimony i think we can eliminate church as the perp in the eleventh killing a wit produced a tape in a wit a witness in court he was a friend of churchs he came in with a video that showed church at a party at the time number eleven got abducted the tape is convincing locke nodded his head and was silent at least he didnt close his eyes bosch thought the psychologist thoughtfully rubbed the graying whiskers on his chin which made bosch do the same thing then there is number seven bosch said he told locke about the information he got from cerrone about the voice the pimp had recognized voice identification wouldnt pass as evidence but say for the sake of argument he is right that connects the concrete blonde to our seventh victim the videotape eliminates church from the eleventh case amado the guy from the coroners office i dont know if you remember him he says numbers seven and eleven had similar injuries injuries that stood out if compared with those of the others another thing i just remembered is the makeup after church was dead they found the makeup in the hyperion apartment remember they matched it to nine of the victims the two victims there was no makeup for were seven and eleven right so what we have are multiple ties between these two casesseven and eleven then you have a tangential connection to number twelve this weeks victim based on the pimp recognizing the customers voice the connection gets stronger if you look at the lifestyles of the three women all were in porno all worked outcall i see the pattern within the pattern locke said gets better now we add in our lone survivor she was also in porno and did outcall work and she described an attacker who looked nothing like church exactly thats because i dont think it was church i think the three plus the survivor make up one set of victims of one killer the remaining nine are another set with another killer church locke got up and began pacing back and forth on one side of the dining room table he kept his hand to his chin anything else bosch opened one of the binders and took out the map and a folded piece of paper on which he had earlier written a series of dates he carefully unfolded the map and spread it on the table he leaned in and over it okay look lets call the nine group a and the three group b on the map i have circled the locations where group a victims were found you see if you take the group b victims out of the picture you have a nice geographic concentration group b vics were found in malibu west hollywood south hollywood but the a list was concentrated here in eastern hollywood and silverlake bosch ran his finger in a circle on the map showing the dumping zone church had used and here in almost the center of this zone is hyperion streetchurchs killing pad he straightened up and dropped the folded paper on the map now here is a list of dates of the eleven killings originally attributed to church you see there is an interval pattern at the startthirty days thirtytwo days twentyeight thirtyone thirtyone but then the pattern goes to hell remember that how it confused us back then yes i do we have twelve days then sixteen then twentyseven thirty and eleven the pattern disintegrates into no pattern but now separate the dates of group a and group b bosch unfolded the paper there were two columns of dates locke leaned over the table into the light to study the columns bosch could see a thin line a scar on the top of his bald and freckled crown on group a we now have a pattern bosch continued a clearly discernable pattern of intervals we have thirty days thirtytwo twentyeight thirtyone thirtyone twentyeight twentyseven and thirty on group b we have eightyfour days between the two killings better stress management what the intervals between the acting out of these fantasies is dictated by the buildup of stress i testified about this the better the actor handles it the longer the interval between killings the second killer has better stress management or at least had it back then bosch watched him pace the room he took out a cigarette and lit it locke said nothing what i want to know is is this possible bosch asked i mean is there any precedent for this that you know of of course its possible the black heart does not beat alone you dont even have to look outside the boundaries of your own jurisdiction to find ample evidence it is possible look at the hillside stranglers there was even a book written about them calledtwo of a kind look at the similarities in the method of operation employed by the nightstalker and the sunset strip strangler in the early eighties the short answer is yes its possible i know about those cases but this is different i worked some of those and i know this is different the hillside stranglers worked together they were cousins the other two were similar but there were major differences here someone came along and copied the other exactly so closely that we missed it and he got away two killers working independently of each other but using exactly the same methodology right again i say anything is possible another example remember in the eighties there was the freeway killer in orange and la counties bosch nodded he had never worked those cases so he knew little about them well one day they got lucky and caught a vietnam vet named william bonin they tied him to a handful of the cases and believed he was good for the rest he went to death row but the killings kept happening they kept right on happening until a highway patrol officer pulled over a guy named randy kraft who was driving down the freeway with a body in his car kraft and bonin didnt know each other but for a while they secretly shared the nom de plume the freeway killer each working independently of the other out there killing and being mistaken for the same person that sounded close to the theory bosch was working with locke continued talking no longer bothered by the latenight intrusion do you know there is a guard on death row at san quentin whom i know from doing research up there he told me there are four serial killers including kraft and bonin waiting for the gas and well the four of them play cards every day bridge among them theyve got fiftynine convictions for murder and they play bridge anyway the point is he says kraft and bonin think so much alike that as a team they are almost never beaten bosch started refolding the map without looking up he said kraft and bonin did they kill their victims the same way the exact same way not exactly but my point is that there could be two but the follower in this case is smarter he knew exactly what to do to have all the police go the other way to put it on church then when church was dead and no longer available for use as camouflage the follower went underground so to speak bosch looked up at him and a thought suddenly struck him that spun everything he knew into a new light it was like the cue ball hitting a rack of eight colors shooting off in all directions but he didnt say anything this new thought was too dangerous to bring up instead he asked locke a question but even when this follower went underground he kept the same program as the dollmaker bosch said why do it if no one was going to see it remember with the dollmaker we believed his leaving of the bodies in public locations their faces painted was part of the erotic program part of his turnon but why did the second killer do itfollow the same programif the body was never intended to be found locke put both hands on the table to brace his weight and thought a moment bosch thought he heard a sound from the patio he looked through the open french doors and saw only the darkness of the steep hillside rising above the illuminated pool its kidneyshaped surface was calm now he looked at his watch it was midnight its a good question locke said i dont know the answer maybe the acolyte knew that eventually the body would be revealed that he himself might want to reveal it you see we probably have to assume now that it was the follower who sent the notes to you and the newspaper four years ago it shows the exhibitionistic portion of his program church apparently didnt find the same need to torment his hunters the follower got off on tweaking us exactly what he was doing was having his fun taunting his trackers and all the while the blame for the murders he committed went to the real dollmaker follow yes okay so what happened the real dollmaker mr church is killed by you the follower no longer has a cover so what he does is he continues his workhis killingbut now he buries the victim hides her under concrete youre saying he still follows the whole erotic program with the makeup and everything but then buries her so no one will see her so no one will know yes he follows the program because that is what turned him on in the first place but he can no longer afford to discard the bodies publicly because that would reveal his secret so then why the note why send a note to the police this week that opens him to exposure locke paced around the dining room table thinking confidence he finally said the follower has become strong over the past four years he thinks he is invincible it is a common trait in the disassembling phase of a psychopath a state of confidence and invulnerability rises as in actuality the psychopath is making more and more mistakes disassembling becoming vulnerable to discovery so because he has gotten away with his actions for four years he thinks he is clear and is so untouchable that he sends another note to tweak us exactly but that is only one factor another is pride authorship this big trial on the dollmaker has begun and he wants to steal some of the attention you must understand he craves attention for his acts after all it was the follower not church who sent the letters earlier so being prideful and feeling above the reach of the policei guess godlike is the way to describe his sense of himselfhe writes the note this week catch me if you can yes one of the oldest games around and lastly he might have sent the note because he is still angry with you me bosch was surprised he had never considered this yes you took church away you ruined his perfect cover i dont imagine the note and its mention in the press has helped your court case any has it no it might sink me yes so maybe this is the followers way of repaying you his revenge bosch thought about all of this for a moment he could almost feel the adrenaline surging through his body it was after midnight but he wasnt the least bit tired he had a focus now he was no longer lost in the void you think there are more out there dont you he asked you mean women in concrete or similar confinement yes unfortunately i do four years is a long time many others are out there im afraid how do i find him im not sure my work has usually come at the end after theyre caught after theyre dead bosch nodded closed the binders and put them under his arm there is one thing though locke said look at his pool of victims who are they how does he get to them the three who are dead and the survivor they all were in the porno industry you said bosch put the binders back down on the table he lit another cigarette yes they all did outcall work too he said yes so while church was the opportunistic killer taking victims of any size age or race the follower was more specific in his tastes bosch recalled the porno victims quickly right the followers victims were white young blonde and largebreasted that is a clear pattern did these women advertise their outcall services in the adultrelated media i know two of them did and the survivor the latest victim did outcall but im not sure how she advertised did the three who did advertise include photographs of themselves in the copy bosch could specifically remember only holly leres ad and it did not include her photo just her stage name a phone drop and a guarantee of lewd pleasure i dont think so the one i remember didnt but her porno name was in the ad so anyone familiar with her work in video would know her physical appearance and attributes very good we are already creating a profile of the follower he is someone who uses adult videos to choose the women for his erotic program he then contacts them through ads in the adult media by seeing either their names or photos in the advertisements have i helped you detective bosch absolutely thanks for the time and keep this under your hat im not sure we want to go public with this yet bosch picked up the binders again and headed toward the door but locke stopped him we havent finished you know bosch turned around how do you mean he asked though he knew you havent spoken about the aspect of this that is most troubling the question of how our follower learned the killers routine the task force did not divulge every detail of the dollmakers program to the media not back then details were held back so the loonies who confessed would not know exactly what to confess to it was a safeguard the task force could quickly eliminate the bogus confessions so so the question is how did the follower know i dont yes you do the book mr bremmer wrote made those details available to the world that of course could account for the concrete blonde but not as i am sure you have realized for victims seven and eleven locke was right it was what bosch had realized earlier he avoided thinking about it because he dreaded the implications locke said the answer is that the follower was somehow privy to the details the details are what triggered his action you have to remember that what we are dealing with here is someone who very likely was already in the midst of some great internal struggle when he stumbled onto an erotic program that matched his own needs this man already had problems whether they had manifested in his committing crimes or not he was a sick puppy harry and he saw the dollmakers erotic mold and realized thats me thats what i want what i need for fulfillment he then adopted the dollmakers program and acted on it to the very last detail the question is how did he stumble onto it and the answer is he was given access for a moment they just looked at each other then bosch spoke youre talking about a cop someone on the task force that cant be i was there we all wanted this guy to go down nobody was getting off on this man possibly a member of the task force harry only possibly but remember the circle of those who knew about the program was much larger than just the task force you have medical examiners investigators beat cops photographers reporters paramedics the passersby who found the bodiesmany people who had access to details the follower obviously knew about bosch tried to pull together a quick profile in his mind locke read him it would have to be someone in or around the investigation harry not necessarily a vital part or a continuous part but someone who intersected with the investigation at a point that would allow him to gain knowledge of the full program more than what was publicly known at the time bosch said nothing until locke prompted him what else harry narrow it down lefthanded possibly but not necessarily church was lefthanded the follower may only have used the left hand to make the perfect copy of churchs crimes thats right but then there are the notes suspicious docs said they believed it was a lefthanded writer they werent one hundred percent they never are okay then possibly lefthanded what else bosch thought for a moment maybe a smoker there was a package found in the concrete kaminski the victim didnt smoke okay thats good these are the things you need to think about to narrow it down its in the details harry im sure of it a cool wind came down the hillside and in through the french doors and chilled bosch it was time to go to be alone with this thanks again he said as he started once more for the door what will you do locke called after him i dont know yet harry bosch stopped at the threshold and looked back at locke the pool glowing eerily in the darkness behind him the follower he may be the smartest to come along in a long time because hes a cop because he probably knows everything about the case that you know it was cold in the caprice at night the canyons always carried a dark chill bosch turned the car around and it floated quietly down lookout mountain to laurel canyon he took a right and drove to the canyon market where he bought a sixpack of anchor steam then he took his beer and his questions back up the hill to mulholland he drove to woodrow wilson drive and then down to his small house that stood on cantilevers and looked out across the cahuenga pass he had left no lights on inside because with sylvia in his life he never knew how long he would go without being here he opened the first beer as soon as the caprice was parked at the curb in front a car slowly went by and left him in the dark he watched one of the beams from the spotlights at universal city cut across the clouds over the house another one chased after it a few seconds later the beer felt and tasted good going down his throat but it felt heavy in his stomach and bosch stopped drinking he put the bottle back in its carton but it wasnt the beer he knew that was really bothering him it was ray mora of all the people who were close enough to the case to know the details of the program mora was the one who jabbed at boschs gut the followers three victims were porno actresses and that was moras gig he probably knew them all the question that was now beginning to push its way into boschs mind was did he kill them all it bothered him to even think about it but he knew he had to mora was a logical starting point when bosch considered lockes advice the vice cop stood out in boschs mind as someone who easily intersected both worlds the porn trade and the dollmakers was it just coincidence or enough to classify mora as an actual suspect bosch wasnt sure he knew he had to proceed as cautiously with an innocent man as he would with a guilty man inside the place smelled musty he went directly to the rear sliding door and opened it he stood there for a moment listening to the hissing sound of traffic coming up from the freeway at the bottom of the pass the sound never died no matter what time what day there was always traffic down there blood coursing through the veins of the city the light on the answering machine was blinking the number three bosch hit rewind and lit a cigarette the first voice was sylvias i just want to say goodnight sweetheart i love you and be careful jerry edgar was next harry its edgar wanted to let you know im off it irving called me at home and told me to turn everything ive got over to rhd in the morning to a lieutenant rollenberger take care buddy and watch six watch six bosch thought watch your back he hadnt heard that one since vietnam and he knew edgar had never been there its ray the last voice on the tape said ive been thinking about this concrete blonde job and have a few ideas you might be interested in call me in the morning and well talk i want a continuance what you have to get the trial delayed tell the judge what the fuck are you talking about bosch bosch and belk were sitting at the defense table waiting for the thursday morning court session to begin they were speaking in loud whispers and bosch thought that when belk cursed it came off as sounding too contrived as if he were a sixthgrader trying to fit in with the eighthgraders i am talking about that witness yesterday wieczorek he was right about what the alibi belk the alibi on the eleventh victim its legit church didnt wait a minute belk yelped then in a low whisper he said if you are about to confess to me that you killed the wrong guy i dont want to hear it bosch not now its too late he turned back to his legal tablet belk listen goddammit im not confessing anything i got the right guy but we missed something another guy there were two killers church is good for ninethe nine we tied up on the makeup comparisons the other two and the one we found in the concrete this week were done by somebody else you have to stop this thing until we figure out what exactly is going on if it comes out in court it will tip the second killer the follower to how close we are to him belk threw his pen down on the pad and it bounced off the table he didnt get up to get it im going to tell you whats going on bosch we are not stopping anything even if i wanted to i probably couldntthe judge is in her pants all she needs to do is object and no sale no delay so im not even going to bring it up you have to understand something bosch this is a trial this is the controlling factor of your universe right now you dont control it you cant expect the trial to recess every time you need to change your story you finished yes im finished belk i understand everything you just said but we have to protect the investigation there is another guy out there killing people and if chandler puts me or edgar up there and starts asking questions the killer is going to read about it and know everything weve got well never get him then you want that bosch my duty is to win this case if in doing that it compromises your yeah but dont you want to know the truth belk i think were close delay it until next week and by then well have it together well be able to come in here and blow money chandler out of the water bosch leaned back away from him he was tired of fighting him bosch how long you been a cop belk asked without looking at him twenty years that was close but bosch didnt answer he knew what was coming and youre going to sit there and talk to me about truth when was the last time you saw a truthful police report when was the last time that you put down the unadulterated truth in a search warrant application dont tell me about truth you want truth go see a priest or something i dont know where to go but dont come in here after twenty on the job you should know the truth has got nothing to do with what goes on in here neither does justice just words in a law book i read in my previous life belk turned away and took another pen out of his shirt pocket okay belk youre the man but im going to tell you how its going to look when it comes out its going to come out in bits and pieces and it will look bad thats chandlers specialty it will look like i hit the wrong guy belk was ignoring him writing on his yellow pad you fool she is going to stick it into us so deep its going to come out the other side you keep writing her off as having the judges hand on her ass but we both know thats how you deal with the fact that you couldnt carry her lunch for the last time get a delay belk stood up and walked around the table to pick up the fallen pen after straightening up he adjusted his tie and his cuffs and sat back down he leaned over his pad and without looking at bosch said youre just afraid of her arent you bosch dont want to be on the stand with the cunt asking questions questions that might expose you for what you are a cop who likes killing people now he turned and looked at bosch well its too late your time has come and there is no backing away no delays show time harry stood up and bent over the fat man fuck you belk im going outside thats nice belk said you know you guys are all the same you blow some guy away and then come in here and think that just because you wear that badge that you have some kind of a divine right to do whatever you want that badge is the biggest power trip going bosch went out to the bank of phones and called edgar he picked up on the homicide table after one ring i got your message last night yeah well thats all there is im gone rhd came up this morning and took my file saw them snoopin around your spot too but they didnt take anything who came sheehan and opelt you know em yeah theyre okay you coming over here on the subpoena yeah i gotta be there by ten bosch saw the door to courtroom open and the deputy marshal leaned out and signaled to him i gotta go back in the courtroom chandler was at the lectern and the judge was speaking the jury was not in the box yet what about the other subpoenas the judge asked your honor my office is in the process of notifying those people this morning releasing them very well then mr belk ready to proceed as bosch came through the gate belk passed him on the way to the lectern without even looking at him your honor since this is unexpected i would ask for a halfhour recess so i can consult with my client we would be ready to proceed after that very well were going to do exactly that recess for a half hour ill see all parties back here then and mr bosch i expect you to be in your place there the next time i come out ready to begin i dont like sending marshals up and down the halls when the defendant knows where he ought to be and when he ought to be there bosch said nothing sorry your honor belk said for him they stood as the judge left the bench and belk said lets go down the hall to one of the lawyerclient conference rooms what happened lets go down the hall as he was going through the courtroom door bremmer was coming in holding his notebook and pen hey whats happening i dont know bosch said halfhour recess harry i have to talk to you later its important at the end of the hall near the lavatories there were several small attorney conference rooms all about the size of the interrogation rooms at the hollywood station bosch and belk went into one and took chairs on either side of a gray table what happened bosch asked your heroine rested chandler rested without calling me this seemed to make no sense to bosch whats she doing he asked shes being extremely shrewd its a very smart move why look at the case she is in very good shape if it ended today and went to the jury who would win she would see she knows you have to get on the stand and defend what you did like i told you the other day we win or lose with you you either take the ball and ram it down her throat or you fumble it she knows that and if she was to call you she would ask the questions first then i would come in with the fungoesthe easy ones that youd hit out of the park now shes reversing that my choice is to not call you and lose the case or to call you and essentially give her the best shot at you very shrewd so what are we going to do call you what about the delay what delay bosch nodded there was no changing it there would be no delay he realized he had handled it badly he had approached belk the wrong way he should have tried to make belk believe it had been his own idea to go for a delay then it would have worked instead bosch was beginning to feel the jittersthat uneasy feeling that came with approaching the unknown he felt the way he did before he climbed down into a vc tunnel for the first time in vietnam it was fear he knew blossoming like a black rose in the pit of his chest weve got twentyfive minutes belk said lets forget about delays and try to work out how we want your testimony to go i am going to lead you down the path the jury will follow but remember you have to take it slow or you will lose them okay we got twenty minutes bosch corrected him i need to go out for a smoke before i sit up there on the stand belk pressed on as if he hadnt heard remember bosch there could be millions of dollars at stake here it may not be your money but it may be your career what career bremmer was hanging around the door to the conference room when bosch came out twenty minutes later get it all harry asked he walked by him and headed toward the escalator bremmer followed no man i wasnt listening im just waiting for you listen whats going on with the new case edgar wont tell me shit did you get an id or what yeah we idd her who was it not my case man i cant give it out besides i give it to you and youll run to money chandler with it right bremmer stopped walking beside him what what are you talking about then he scurried up to boschs side and whispered listen harry youre one of my main sources i wouldnt screw you like that if shes getting inside shit look for somebody else bosch felt bad about accusing the reporter hed had no evidence you sure im mistaken about this right absolutely youre too valuable to me i wouldnt do it okay then that was as close as hed come to an apology so what can you tell me about the id nothing its still not my case try rhd rhd has it they took it from edgar bosch got on the escalator and looked back at him he nodded as he went down bremmer didnt follow money chandler was already on the steps smoking when bosch came out he lit a cigarette and looked back at her surprise surprise he said what resting only a surprise to bulk she said any other lawyer would have seen it coming i almost feel sorry for you bosch almost but not quite in a civil rights case the chances of a win are always a long shot but going up against the city attorneys office always kind of levels the playing field these guys like bulk they couldnt make it on the outside if he had to win in order to eat your lawyer would be a thin man he needs that steady paycheck from the city coming in win or lose what she said of course was correct but it was old news bosch smiled he didnt know how to act a part of himself liked her she was wrong about him but somehow he liked her maybe it was her tenacity because her angerthough misdirectedwas so pure maybe it was because she wasnt afraid to talk to him outside of court he had seen how belk studiously avoided coming in contact with churchs family before getting up during recesses he would sit at the defendants table until he was sure they were all safely down the hall and on the escalator but chandler didnt play that kind of game she was an upfront player bosch guessed that this was what it was like when two boxers touched gloves before the bell he changed the subject i talked to tommy faraday out here the other day hes tommy faraway now i asked him what happened but he didnt say he just said justice happened whatever that means she blew a long stream of blue smoke out but didnt say anything for a while bosch looked at his watch they had three minutes you remember the galton case she said it was a civil rights case an excessive force bosch thought about it the name was familiar but it was difficult to place in the blend of excessive force cases he had heard or known about over the years it was a dog case right yes andr√© galton this was before rodney king back when the wide majority of people in this city did not believe that their police engaged in horrible abuses as a matter of routine galton was black and driving with an expired tag through the hills of studio city when a cop decided to pull him over he had done nothing wrong wasnt wanted just had the tag one month overdue but he ran great mystery of life he ran he got all the way up to mulholland and ditched the car at one of those pulloffs where people look out at the view then he jumped out and climbed down the incline there was nowhere to go down there but he wouldnt come back up and the cops wouldnt go downtoo dangerous they claimed at the trial bosch remembered the story now but he let her tell it her indignation was so pure and stripped of lawyerly pose that he just wanted to hear her tell it so they sent a dog down she said galton lost both testicles and had permanent nerve damage to the right leg he could walk but he had to kind of drag it behind him enter tommy faraday bosch prompted yeah he took the case it was dead bang galton had done nothing wrong but to run the response of the police certainly did not meet the offense any jury would see this and the city attorneys office knew this in fact i think it was bulks case they offered half a million to settle and faraday passed he thought hed get a minimum three times that in trial so he passed and like i said this was in the old days civil rights lawyers call it bk thats short for before king a jury listened to four days of evidence and found for the cops in thirty minutes galton got nothing but a dead leg and a dead dick out of the whole thing he came out here afterward and went to that hedge right there he had hidden a gunwrapped it in plastic and buried it there he came over to the statue here and put the gun in his mouth faraday was coming through the door just then and saw it happen blood all over the statue everywhere bosch didnt say anything he remembered the case very clearly now he looked up at the city hall tower and watched the gulls circling above it he always wondered what drew them there it was miles from the ocean but there were always seabirds on top of city hall chandler kept talking two things ive always been curious about she said one why did galton run and two why did he hide the gun and i think the answers are both the same he had no faith in justice in the system no hope he had done nothing wrong but he ran because he was a black man in a white neighborhood and he had heard the stories all his life about what white cops do to black men in that position his lawyer told him he had a deadbang case but he brought a gun to the courthouse because he had heard all his life about what jurors decide when its a black mans word against the cops bosch looked at his watch it was time to go in but he did not want to walk away from her so thats why tommy said justice happened she said that was justice for andr√© galton faraday referred all his cases to other lawyers after that i took a few and he never set foot in a courtroom again she stubbed out what was left of her cigarette end of story she said im sure the civil rights lawyers tell that one a lot bosch said and now you put me and church into that is that it im like the guy who sent the dog down the hill after galton there are degrees detective bosch even if church was the monster you claim he didnt have to die if the system turns away from the abuses inflicted on the guilty then who can be next but the innocents you see thats why i have to do what im going to do to you in there for the innocents well good luck he said he put his own cigarette out i wont need it she said bosch followed her gaze to the statue above the spot where galton had killed himself chandler looked at it as if the blood were still there thats justice she said nodding at the statue she doesnt hear you she doesnt see you she cant feel you and wont speak to you justice detective bosch is just a concrete blonde the courtroom seemed as silent as a dead mans heart while bosch walked behind the plaintiff and defendant tables and in front of the jury box to get to the witness stand after taking the oath he gave his full name and the clerk asked him to spell it hieronymus bosch then the judge turned it over to belk tell us a little bit about yourself detective bosch about your career ive been a police officer nearly twenty years i currently am assigned to the homicide table at hollywood division before that why do they call it a table jesus bosch thought because its like a table it is six small desks pushed together to make a long table three detectives on each side its always called a table okay go on before this assignment i spent eight years in robberyhomicide divisions homicide special squad before that i was a detective on the homicide table in north hollywood and robbery and burglary tables in van nuys i was on patrol about five years mostly in the hollywood and wilshire divisions belk slowly led him through his career up until the time he was on the dollmaker task force the questioning was slow and boringeven to bosch and it was his life every now and then he would look at the jurors when he answered a question and only a few seemed to be looking at him or paying attention bosch felt nervous and his palms were damp he had testified in court at least a hundred times but never like this in his own defense he felt hot though he knew the courtroom was overly cool now where was the task force physically located we used a secondfloor storage room at the hollywood station it was an evidence and file storage room we temporarily moved that stuff out into a rented trailer and used the room we also had a room at parker center the night shift which i was on generally worked out of hollywood you were closer to the source correct we thought so yes most of the victims were taken from hollywood streets many were later found in the area so you wanted to be able to act quickly on tips and leads and being right there in the center of things helped you do that correct correct on the night you got the call from the woman named dixie mcqueen how did you get that call she called in on nine one one and when the dispatcher realized what she was talking about the call was transferred out to the task force in hollywood who answered it i did why is that i thought you testified you were the supervisor of the night shift didnt they have people answering phones yes we had people but this call came in late everybody had left for the night i was only there because i was bringing the chronological investigation record up to datewe had to turn it in at the end of each week i was the only one there i answered when you went to meet this woman why didnt you call for a backup she hadnt told me enough over the phone to convince me there was anything to it we were getting dozens of calls a day none of them amounted to anything i have to admit i went to take her report not believing it would amount to anything well if you thought that detective why did you go to her why not just take her information over the phone the main reason was that she said she didnt know the address she had been to with this man but could show me the place if i drove her down hyperion also there seemed to be something genuine about her complaint you know it seemed that something had definitely scared her i was about to head home so i thought i would just check it out on the way tell us what happened after you got to hyperion when we got there we could see lights on in the apartment over the garage we even saw a shadow pass across one of the windows so we knew the guy was still there thats when miss mcqueen told me about the makeup she saw in the cabinet under the sink what did that mean to you a lot it immediately got my attention because we had never said in the press that the killer was keeping the victims makeup it had leaked that he was painting their faces but not that he also kept their makeup so when she told me she had seen this collection of makeup it all clicked it gave what she said some immediate legitimacy bosch drank some water from a paper cup the marshal had filled for him earlier okay what did you do next belk said it occurred to me that in the time it had taken her to call me and for me to pick her up and get back to hyperion he could have gone out and gotten another victim so i knew there was a good chance there was another woman up there in danger i went up i ran up why didnt you call for backup first of all i did not believe there was time to wait even five minutes for backup if he had another woman in there five minutes could mean her life secondly i did not have a rover with me i couldnt make the call even if i wanted to a rover a portable radio detectives usually take them on assignment problem is there are not enough of them to go around and since i was going home i didnt want to take one because i wasnt coming back until the next evening shift that would mean one less rover available during the next day so you couldnt radio for backup what about a phone it was a residential neighborhood i could drive out and find a pay phone or knock on somebodys door it was about oneam and i didnt think people would open their doors quickly to a single man claiming to be a police officer everything was a question of time i didnt believe i had any i had to go up by myself what happened believing someone was in imminent danger i went through the door without knocking i was holding my gun out kicked it open yes what did you see first of all i announced myself i yelled police i moved a few steps into the roomit was a studio apartmentand i saw the man later identified as church standing next to the bed it was a foldout bed from a couch what was he doing he was standing there naked next to the bed did you see anyone else no what next i yelled something along the lines of freeze or dont move and took another step into the room at first he didnt move then he suddenly reached down to the bed and his hand swept under the pillow i yelled no but he continued the movement i could see his arm move as if his hand had grasped something and he started bringing the hand out i fired one time it killed him how far away from him would you say you were i was twenty feet away it was one big room we were at opposite sides of it and did he die instantly very quickly he dropped across the bed the autopsy later showed the bullet entered under the right armthe one he was reaching under the pillow withand crossed through the chest it hit his heart and both lungs after he was down what did you do i went to the bed and checked to see if he was alive he was still alive at that point so i handcuffed him he died a few moments later i lifted the pillow there was no gun what was there looking directly at chandler bosch said great mystery of life he had been reaching for a toupee chandler had her head down and was busy writing but she stopped and looked up at him and their eyes locked momentarily until she said objection your honor the judge agreed to strike boschs comment about the mystery of life belk asked a few more questions about the shooting scene and then moved on to the investigation of church you were no longer part of that correct no as is routine i was assigned desk duty while my actions in the shooting were investigated well were you made aware of the results of the task forces investigation into churchs background generally because i had a stake in the outcome i was kept informed what did you learn that the makeup found in the bathroom cabinet was tied to nine of the victims did you ever have any doubts yourself or hear of any doubts from other investigators as to whether norman church was responsible for the deaths of those women for those nine no no doubts at all ever well detective bosch you heard mr wieczorek testify about being with mr church on the night the eleventh victim shirleen kemp was killed you saw the videotape presented as evidence didnt that raise any doubts it does about that case but shirleen kemp was not among the nine whose makeup was found in churchs apartment there is no doubt in my mind or in anybodys on the task force that church killed those nine women chandler objected to bosch speaking for the rest of the task force and the judge sustained it belk changed the subject not wanting to venture any further into the area of victims seven and eleven his strategy was to avoid any reference to a second killer leaving that to chandler to take a swing at on crossexamination if she wanted to you were disciplined for not going in with backup do you feel the department handled the matter correctly no how so as i explained i did not believe i had a choice in what i did if i had to do it againeven knowing i would be transferred as a resulti would do the same thing i would have to if there had been another woman in there another victim and i had saved her i probably would have been promoted when belk didnt immediately ask a followup question bosch continued i believe the transfer was a political necessity the bottom line was i shot an unarmed man it did not matter that the man i shot was a serial killer a monster besides i was carrying baggage from that will be fine runins with detective bosch bosch stopped he had made his point so what you are saying is you dont have any regrets about what happened in the apartment correct no thats not correct this apparently surprised belk he looked down at his notes he had asked a question he expected a different reply to but he realized he had to follow through what do you regret that church made that move he drew the fire there was nothing i could do but respond i wanted to stop the killings i didnt want to kill him to do that but thats the way it turned out it was his play belk showed his relief by breathing heavily into the microphone before saying he had no further questions judge keyes said there would be a tenminute break before crossexamination began bosch returned to the defense table where belk whispered that he thought they had done well bosch didnt respond i think everything is going to ride on her cross if you can get through it without heavy damage i think weve got it what about when she brings up the follower introduces the note i dont see how she can if she does shell be flying blind no she wont shes got a source in the department someone fed her stuff about the note ill ask for a sidebar conference if it gets to that point that wasnt very encouraging bosch looked at the clock trying to gauge whether he had time for a smoke he didnt think so and got up and went back to the witness stand he passed behind chandler who was writing on a legal pad great mystery of life she said without looking up yeah bosch said without looking back at her as he sat and waited he saw bremmer come in followed by the guy from thedaily news and a couple of wire service reporters somebody had put out the word that the top act was about to begin cameras were not allowed in federal court so one of the stations had sent a sketch artist over from the witness seat bosch watched chandler working he guessed she was writing out questions for him deborah church sat next to her with her hands folded on the table her eyes averted from bosch a minute later the door to the jury room opened and the jurors filed into the box then the judge came out bosch took a deep breath and got ready as chandler walked to the lectern with her yellow pad mr bosch she began how many people have you killed belk immediately objected and asked for a sidebar the attorneys and the court reporter moved to the side of the bench and whispered for five minutes bosch only heard bits and pieces most of it from belk who was loudest at one point he argued that one shooting only was in disputethe church slayingand all others were irrelevant he heard chandler say that the information was relevant because it illustrated the mindset of the defendant bosch couldnt hear the judges response but after the attorneys and reporter were back in place the judge said the defendant will answer the question i cant bosch replied detective bosch the court is ordering you to answer i cant answer it judge i dont know how many people ive killed you served in combat in vietnam chandler asked yes what were your duties tunnel rat i went into the enemys tunnels sometimes this resulted in direct confrontation sometimes i used explosives to destroy tunnel complexes its impossible for me to know how many people were in them okay detective since you finished your duties with the armed services and became a police officer how many people have you killed three including norman church can you tell us about the two incidents not involving mr church in general yes one was before church the other after the first time i killed someone it was during a murder investigation i went to question a man i thought was a witness turned out he was the killer when i knocked on the door he fired a shot through it missed me i kicked the door open and went in i heard him running toward the rear of the house i followed him to the yard where he was climbing over a fence as he was about to go over he twisted around to take another shot at me i fired first and he went down the second time this was after church i was involved in a murder and robbery investigation with the fbi there was a shootout between two suspects and myself and my partner at the time an fbi agent i killed one of the suspects so in those two cases the men you killed were armed that is correct three shootings involving deaths that is quite a lot even for a twentyyear veteran isnt it bosch waited a beat for belk to make an objection but the fat man was too busy writing on his tablet he had missed it um i know twentyyear cops who have never even had to draw their guns and i know some that have been involved in as many as seven deaths its a matter of what kind of cases you draw its a matter of luck good luck or bad luck this time belk objected and the judge sustained it chandler quickly went on after you killed mr church while he was unarmed did you feel badly about it not really not until i got sued and heard you were the lawyer there was laughter in the courtroom and even honey chandler smiled after he had quieted the room with a sharp rebuke from his gavel the judge instructed bosch to keep his answers on point and to refrain from personal asides no bad feelings bosch said like i said before i would rather have taken church alive than dead but i wanted to take him off the street either way but you set the whole thing up tactically so that it had to end in his permanent removal didnt you no i didnt nothing was set up things just happened bosch knew better than to show any anger toward her rather than make angry denouncements the rule of thumb was to answer each question as if he was dealing with a person who was simply mistaken you were however satisfied that mr church had been killed while unarmed nude totally defenseless satisfaction doesnt enter into it your honor chandler said may i approach the witness with an exhibit its marked plaintiffs a she handed copies of a piece of paper to belk and the judges clerk who handed it over the bench to the judge while the judge was reading it belk went to the lectern and objected your honor if this is offered as impeachment i dont see how it is valid these are the words of a psychiatrist not my client chandler moved to the microphone and said judge if you look in the section marked summary the last paragraph is what i would like to be read by the witness you will also notice that the defendant signed the statement at the bottom judge keyes read some more wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and said ill accept it you may show it to the witness chandler brought another copy up to bosch and placed it in front of him without looking at him then she walked back to the lectern can you tell us what that is detective bosch its a confidential psychological release form supposedly confidential i guess i should say yes and what does it relate to my release allowing me to return to duty after the church shooting it is routine to be interviewed by the departments psychiatrist after being involved in a shooting then he clears you to return to duty you must know him well excuse me ms chandler thats not necessary judge keyes said before belk got up no your honor strike that you were cleared to return to dutyto your new assignment in hollywoodafter the interview correct correct isnt it true that this is really nothing more than a rubberstamp process the psychiatrist never holds an officer back from returning on psychiatric grounds no on the first question i dont know on the second well let me turn it around have you ever heard of an officer being held back by the psychiatric interview no i havent theyre supposed to be confidential so i doubt i would hear anything anyway will you please read the last paragraph of the summary section on the report in front of you yes he picked up the paper and began reading silently out loud detective bosch she said in an exasperated tone i thought that was implicit in the question sorry it says through his war and police experiences most notably including the aforementioned shooting resulting in fatality the subject has to a high degree become desensitized to violence he speaks in terms of violence or the aspect of violence being an accepted part of his daytoday life for all of his life therefore it is unlikely that what transpired previously will act as a psychological deterrent should he again be placed in circumstances where he must act with deadly force in order to protect himself or others i believe he will be able to act without delay he will be able to pull the trigger in fact his conversation reveals no ill effects at all from the shooting unless his sense of satisfaction with the outcome of the incidentthe suspects deathshould be deemed inappropriate bosch put the paper down he noticed the entire jury was looking at him now he had no idea whether the report was highly damaging or helpful to his cause the subject of that report is you correct chandler asked yes its me you just testified that there was no satisfaction but the report by the psychiatrist said you did feel a sense of satisfaction with the outcome of the incident which is right those are his words on the report not mine i dont think i would have said that what would you have said i dont know not that then why did you sign the release form i signed it because i wanted to get back to work if i was going to argue with him about what words he used i was never going to get back to work tell me detective did the psychiatrist who examined you and made that report know about your mother bosch hesitated i dont know he finally answered i didnt tell him i dont know if he would have had the information previously he could hardly concentrate on his words for his mind was scrambling what happened to your mother he looked directly at chandler for a long moment before answering she didnt look away as was testified to earlier she was killed i was eleven it happened in hollywood and no one was ever arrested correct that is correct can we go on to something else this has already been testified about bosch looked over at belk who got the point and stood up and objected to chandlers repetitive line of questioning detective bosch do you want a break judge keyes asked to sort of calm down a little no judge im fine well im sorry i cant restrict proper crossexamination the objection is overruled the judge nodded to chandler im sorry to ask such personal questions but after she was gone did your father raise you youre not sorry you detective bosch the judge boomed we cannot have this you must answer the questions asked of you say nothing else just answer the questions no i never knew my father i was put in the youth hall and then foster homes any brothers or sisters no so the man who strangled your mother not only took the one closest to you he destroyed much of your life at that point id say so did the crime have something to do with your becoming a policeman bosch found he could no longer look at the jury he knew his face had turned red and he felt as if he were dying under a magnifying glass i dont know i never really analyzed myself to that extent did it have something to do with the satisfaction you felt in killing mr church as i said before if there was any satisfactionyou keep using that wordit was that i was satisfied with closing the case to use your word the man was a monster he was a killer i was satisfied we stopped him wouldnt you be youre answering the questions detective bosch chandler said the question i now have is did you stop the killings all of them belk jumped up and asked for a sidebar conference the judge said to the jurors were going to take that break now after all well call you back when were ready belk asked for a discussion of his objection to chandlers question out of earshot of the press so the judge convened a hearing in his chambers the hearing included the judge chandler belk bosch the court reporter and the court clerk they had to drag a couple of chairs in from the courtroom then they all took places around the judges huge desk it was dark mahogany and looked like a box a small foreign car could have come in the first thing the judge did was light a cigarette when bosch saw chandler follow suit he did the same the judge pushed the ashtray on his desk to the corner so they all could get at it so mr belk its your party the judge said your honor i am concerned with the direction miss chandler is taking this call her ms chandler mr belk you know she prefers it as far as which way shes going how can you tell from one question it was obvious to bosch that belk may have objected too soon it was unclear how much information chandler had aside from the note but bosch thought belks tapdancing around the problem was a waste of time judge he said if i answer that last question it will compromise an ongoing investigation the judge leaned back in his padded leather chair how so he asked we believe there is another killer bosch said the body found this week was identified yesterday and it has been determined that she could not have been killed by church she was alive up until two years ago the the method used by the killer was identical to that of the real dollmaker belk interjected the police believe there is a follower someone who knew how church killed and followed the same pattern there is evidence to suggest the follower was responsible for the seventh and eleventh victims previously attributed to church bosch said the follower would have to be someone close to the original investigation someone who knew the details belk said if you allow her to open this line of questioning it will be reported by the media and it will tip off the follower he will know how close he is to being revealed the judge was silent as he considered all of this for a moment that all sounds real interesting and i wish you all the best of luck catching this follower as you call him he finally said but the problem you have mr belk is that you havent given me any legal reason to stop your client from answering the question ms chandler put to him no one wants to compromise an investigation but you put your client on the stand thats if there is a second killer chandler said its obvious there was only one killer and it wasnt church theyve come up with this elaborate ms chandler the judge interrupted thats for the jury to decide save your argument for them mr belk the problem is this is your witness you called him and youve left him open to this line of questioning i dont know what to tell you im certainly not going to clear the media out of there off the record here miss penny the judge watched the court reporter lift her fingers from the keys mr belk youre fuckedscuse the language ladies hes gonna answer the question and the one after that and the one after that okay were back on the reporter put her fingers back on the keys your honor this cant ive made my ruling mr belk anything else belk then surprised bosch we would like a continuance what your honor plaintiff opposes chandler said i know you do the judge said what are you talking about mr belk your honor you have to put the trial on hiatus until at least next week it will give the investigation time to possibly come to some fruition some fruition forget it belk youre in the middle of a trial my friend belk stood and leaned across the great wide desk your honor i request an emergency stay of these proceedings while we take the matter on appeal to the ninth district you can appeal anything you like mr belk but there is no stay were in trial here there was silence as everyone looked at belk what if i refuse to answer bosch asked judge keyes looked at him a long moment and said then ill hold you in contempt then ill ask you to answer again and if you refuse again i will put you in jail then when your attorney here asks for bail while he appeals i will say no bail all of this will take place out there in front of the jury and the media folks and i will place no restrictions on what ms chandler does or doesnt say to the reporters in the hallway so what i am saying is you can try to be some kind of hero and not answer but the story will get to the media anyway its like i said a few minutes ago to mr belk when we were off the rec you cant do this belk suddenly erupted it itits not right you have to protect this investigation you son dont you ever tell me what i have to do the judge said very slowly and sternly he seemed to grow in stature while belk shrank back away from him only thing i have to do is ensure there is a fair trial on this matter you are asking me to sit on information that could be vital to the plaintiffs case you are also trying to intimidate me and that is one thing i dont take to im no county judge that needs your nod every time an election comes round im appointed for life were off here miss penny stopped typing bosch almost didnt want to see belks slaughter the deputy city attorneys head was bowed and he had assumed the posture of the doomed the back of his neck was turned up and ready to receive the axe so my advice here is that you get your fat ass out there and start working on how the hell youre going to salvage this on redirect because in five minutes detective bosch is going to answer that question or hes going to be handing his gun and his badge and his belt and shoelaces over to a marshal at the federal lockup were back on hearing adjourned judge keyes brought his arm down and ground his cigarette into the ashtray he never took his eyes off belk as the procession made its way back into the courtroom bosch moved up closely behind chandler he glanced back to make sure the judge had turned to go to the bench and then said in a low voice if youre getting your information from inside the department im going to burn your source down when i find him she didnt miss a stride she didnt even turn back when she said you mean if youre not already ashes bosch took his place at the witness stand and the jury was brought back in the judge told chandler to continue rather than have the reporter find the last question let me just rephrase it after you killed mr church did the so called dollmaker killings stop bosch hesitated thinking he looked out into the spectator section and saw that there were more reporters nowor at least people he thought were reporters they all sat together he also saw sylvia sitting in the back row by herself she offered a small smile to him which he did not return he wondered how long she had been out there detective bosch the judge prompted i cant answer the question without compromising an ongoing investigation bosch finally said detective bosch we just went over this the judge said angrily answer the question bosch knew that his refusal and jailing would not stop the story from getting out chandler would tell all the reporters as the judge had given her the okay to do so putting himself in jail he knew only stopped him from chasing the follower he decided to answer he carefully composed a statement while stalling by taking a long slow drink of water from the paper cup norman church obviously stopped killing people after he was dead but there was somebodythere is somebody else still out there a killer who uses the same methods as norman church thank you mr bosch and when did you come to that conclusion this week when another body was found who was that victim a woman named rebecca kaminski she had been missing two years the details of her death matched the murders of the other dollmaker victims exactly except for one thing and that was what she had been entombed in concrete hidden norman church always discarded his victims in public places no other differences not that i know of at the moment yet because she died two years after norman church was killed by you there is no way possible that he is responsible correct because he was dead he has the perfect alibi doesnt he correct how was the body found as i said it had been buried in concrete and what led police to the spot where it was buried we received a note with directions chandler then offered a copy of the note as plaintiffs exhibit a and judge keyes accepted it after overruling an objection by belk chandler then handed a copy to bosch to identify and read out loud this time she said before he could start for the jury bosch felt eerie reading the words of the follower out loud in the quiet courtroom after a beat of silence when he was done chandler began again im still in the game he writes what does that mean it means he is trying to take credit for all of the killings he wants attention could that be because he committed all of the murders no because norman church committed nine of them the evidence found in churchs apartment irrefutably links him to those nine there is no doubt who found this evidence bosch said me so then isnt there a lot of doubt detective bosch isnt this idea of a second killer who uses the exact same method preposterous no its not preposterous it is happening i did not kill the wrong man isnt it the truth that this talk of a copycat killer a follower is all an elaborate charade for covering up the fact that you did exactly that killed the wrong man an innocent unarmed man who had done nothing worse than hire a prostitute with his wifes tacit approval no its not norman church killed thank you mr bosch a lot of women he was a monster like the one who killed your mother he unconsciously looked out into the audience saw sylvia and then looked away he tried to compose himself slow his breathing he was not going to let chandler tear him open i would say yes they were probably similar both monsters thats why you killed him wasnt it the toupee wasnt under the pillow you killed him in cold blood because you saw your mothers killer no you are wrong dont you think if i was going to make up a story i could come up with something better than a toupee there was a kitchenette knives in the drawer why would i plant hold it hold it hold it judge keyes barked now weve gone off the tracks here ms chandler you started making statements instead of asking questions and detective bosch you did the same thing instead of answering lets start over yes your honor chandler said isnt it true detective bosch that the whole thingthis pinning all the murders on norman churchwas an elaborate coverup that is now unraveling with the discovery of the woman in the concrete this week no it is not true nothing is unraveling church was a killer and he deserved what he got bosch mentally flinched and closed his eyes as soon as the words were out of his mouth she had done it he opened his eyes and looked at chandler her eyes seemed flat and blank emotionless softly she said you say he deserved what he got when were you appointed judge jury and executioner bosch drank more water from the cup what i meant was that it was his play whatever happened to him he was ultimately responsible you put something in play like that and you have to accept the consequences like rodney king deserved what he got objection belk shouted like andr√© galton deserved what he got objection sustained sustained the judge said all right now ms chandler you theyre not the same detective bosch i sustained the objections that means dont answer no further questions at this time your honor chandler said bosch watched her walk to the plaintiffs table and drop her tablet onto the wooden surface the loose strand of hair was there at the back of her neck he was sure now that even that detail was part of her carefully planned and orchestrated performance during the trial after she sat down deborah church reached over and squeezed her arm chandler didnt smile or make any gesture in return belk did what he could to repair the damage on redirect examination asking more details about the heinous nature of the crimes and the shooting and investigation of church but it seemed as if no one was listening the courtroom had been sucked into a vacuum created by chandlers crossexamination belk was apparently so ineffective that chandler didnt bother to ask anything on recross and bosch was excused from the witness seat he felt as if the walk back to the defense table covered at least a mile next witness mr belk the judge asked your honor can i have a few minutes surely belk turned to bosch and whispered were going to rest you have a problem with that i dont know there is no one else to call unless you want to get other members of the task force over here theyll say the same thing you did and get the same treatment from chandler id rather leave that alone what about bringing locke back hell back me up on everything i said about the follower too risky he is a psychologist for everything we get him to say is a possibility shell also get him to concede it is possibly not he hasnt been deposed on this matter and we wont know for sure what he would say besides i think we need to stay off the second killer its confusing the jury and we mr belk the judge said were waiting belk stood up and said your honor the defense rests the judge stared a long moment at belk before turning to the jury and telling them they were excused for the day because the lawyers would need the afternoon to prepare closing arguments and he would need time to prepare jury instructions after the jury filed out chandler went to the lectern she asked for a directed verdict in favor of the plaintiff which the judge denied belk did the same thing asking for a verdict in favor of the defendant in a seemingly sarcastic tone the judge told him to sit down bosch met sylvia in the hallway outside after the crowded courtroom took several minutes to empty there was a large gathering of reporters around the two lawyers and bosch took her arm and moved her down the hall i told you not to come here sylvia i know but i felt i had to come i wanted you to know that i support you no matter what harry i know things about you the jury will never know no matter how she tries to portray you i know you dont forget that she was wearing a black dress with a silverywhite pattern that bosch liked she looked very beautiful i uh ihow long were you here for most of it im glad i came i know it was rough but i saw the goodness of what you are come through all the harshness of what you sometimes have to do he just looked at her a moment be optimistic harry the stuff about my mother yes i heard it it hurt me that this is where i learned about it harry where are we if there are those kinds of secrets between us how many times do i have to tell you that it is endangering what we have look he said i cant do this right now deal with this and you usits too much for right now its not the right place lets talk about it later youre right sylvia but i uh i just cant talk i she reached up and straightened his tie and then smoothed it on his chest its okay she said what will you do now follow the case whether officially or not i have to follow this i have to find the second man the second killer she just looked at him for a few moments and he knew she had probably hoped for a different answer im sorry its not something i can put off things are happening im going to go in to school then so i dont lose the whole day will you be up to the house tonight ill try okay see you harry be optimistic he smiled and she leaned into him and kissed him on the cheek then she walked off toward the escalator bosch was watching her go when bremmer came up you want to talk about this that was some interesting testimony in there i said all im saying on the stand nothing else nope what about what she says that the second killer is really the first and that church didnt kill anybody what do you expect her to say its bullshit just remember what i said in the courtroom was under oath what she says out here isnt its bullshit bremmer dont fall for it look harry i have to write this you know its my job you going to understand that no hard feelings no hard feelings bremmer everybody has got their job to do now im going to go do mine okay he walked off toward the escalator outside at the statue he lit a cigarette and gave one to tommy faraway who had been sifting through the ash can whats happening lieutenant the homeless man asked justice is happening bosch drove over to central division and found an open parking space at the front curb for a while he sat in his car looking at two trustees from the lockup washing the painted enamel mural that stretched along the front wall of the bunkerlike station it was a depiction of a nirvana where black and white and brown children played together and smiled at friendly police officers it was a depiction of a place where the children still had hope in angry black spray paint along the bottom of the mural someone had written this is a damnable lie bosch wondered whether someone from the neighborhood or a cop had done it he smoked two cigarettes and tried to clear his mind of what had happened in the courtroom he felt strangely at peace with the idea that some of his secrets had been revealed but he held little hope for the outcome of the trial he had moved into a feeling of resignation an acceptance that the jury would find against him that the twisted delivery of evidence in the case would convince them that he had acted if not like the monster chandler had described then at least in an undesirable and reckless manner they would never know what it was like to have to make such decisions as he had made in so fleeting a moment it was the same old story that every cop knew the citizens want their police to protect them to keep the plague from their eyes from their doors but those same john qs are the first to stare wideeyed and point the finger of outrage when they see close up exactly what the job theyve given the cops entails bosch wasnt a hardliner he didnt condone the actions taken by police in the andr√© galton cases and the rodney king cases but he understood those actions and knew that his own actions ultimately shared a common root through political opportunism and ineptitude the city had allowed the department to languish for years as an understaffed and underequipped paramilitary organization infected with political bacteria itself the department was topheavy with managers while the ranks below were so thin that the dog soldiers on the street rarely had the time or inclination to step out of their protective machines their cars to meet the people they served they only ventured out to deal with the dirtbags and consequently bosch knew it had created a police culture in which everybody not in blue was seen as a dirtbag and was treated as such everybody you ended up with your andr√© galtons and your rodney kings you ended up with a riot the dog soldiers couldnt control you ended up with a mural on a station house wall that was a damnable lie he badged his way past the front desk and took the stairs up to the administrative vice offices at the door to the squad room he stood for a half minute and watched ray mora sitting at his desk on the other side of the room it looked as if mora was writing a report rather than typing it that probably meant it was a daily activity report which required little attentionjust a few linesand wasnt worth the time it took to get up and find a working typewriter bosch noticed that mora wrote with his right hand but he knew this did not eliminate the vice cop as possibly being the follower the follower knew the details and would have known about pulling the ligature around his victims neck from the left side thereby emulating the dollmaker just as he knew about painting the white cross on the toe mora looked up and saw him whatre you doing over there harry didnt want to interrupt bosch walked over what interrupt a day report are you kidding thought it might be something important its important for me to get my paycheck thats about it bosch dragged a chair away from an empty desk and pulled it up and sat down he noticed the statue of the infant of prague had been moved turned actually its face was no longer looking at the nakedness of the actress on the porn calendar bosch looked at mora and realized he was not sure how to proceed here you left a message last night yeah i was thinking about what well we know church didnt kill maggie cum loudly because of the timing right he was already dead when she got her ass dropped in the concrete thats right so weve gotta copycat right again so i was thinking what if the copycat who did her started earlier bosch felt his throat start to tighten he tried not to show mora anything just gave him the deadpan look earlier yeah what if the two other porno chicks who were killed were actually done by the copycat who says he had to start after church was dead bosch felt the full chill now if mora was the follower was he so confident that he would risk laying the whole pattern out for bosch or could his hunchafter all thats all it was a guessbe completely out of line regardless it felt creepy sitting with mora his desk covered by magazines with sex acts depicted on the covers the calendar girl leering from the vertical file the statues clay face turned away bosch realized that delta bush the actress on the calendar mora had displayed was blondehaired and buxom she fit the pattern was that why mora had put up the calendar you know ray he said after composing his voice into a monotone ive been thinking the same thing it fits better that way all the evidence i mean if the follower did all three of them what made you think of it mora put the report he was working on away in a desk drawer and leaned onto his desk subconsciously he brought his left hand up and pulled the holy spirit medal from his open collar he rubbed it between his thumb and forefinger as he leaned back in his seat again elbows on the arm rests he dropped the medal and said well i remembered something is what i did it was a tip that i got right before you nailed church see i dropped it when you dropped church youre talking about four years ago yeah we all thought that was it end of case when you got church get to it ray whatd you remember yeah right well i remember a couple days maybe a week before you got church i was given one of the callin tips it was given to me cause i was the resident expert on porno and it was a porno chick who called it in she used the name gallery thats it just gallery she was in the bottomline stuff loops live shows peep booths nine hundred phone call stuff and she was just beginning to move up get her name on some video boxes anyway she called the task forcethis was right before you nailed churchand said there was a tom thatd been making the rounds of the sets up in the valley you know watching the action hanging out with the producers but he wasnt like the other toms i dont know what you mean toms thats short for peeping tom thats what the girls call these guys who hang out on the sets usually theyre friendly with the producer or theyve kicked in part of the budget they throw a grand to the producer and he lets the guy hang around and watch em shoot it s pretty common these shoots draw a lot of people for whom seeing it on video isnt enough they want to be right up there and see it live all right so what about this guy well harry look theres really only one reason these people hang around the sets theyre hitting on the chicks between takes i mean these guys wanna get laid or they want to make flicks themselves they want to break in and that was the thing with this guy he wasnt hitting on anybody he was just hanging around shethis is gallerysaid she never saw this dude make the move on anybody he talked to some of the girls but never left with any of them and thats what made him weird he didnt want to get laid mora raised his hands and shrugged like he knew it sounded weak yeah basically but listen gallery worked shoots with both heather cumhither and holly lere the two dollmaker victims and she said it was on those shoots that she saw this tom thats why she called now the story had boschs attention but he didnt know what to make of it mora could be simply trying to deflect attention to send bosch down the wrong trail she didnt have a name on the guy no that was the problem that was why i didnt jump all over it i had a backlog of tips i was assigned and she calls in with this one without a name i would have gotten to it eventually but a few days later you put churchs dick in the dirt and that was that you let it go yeah dropped it like a bag of shit bosch waited he knew mora would go on he had more to say there had to be more so the thing is when i looked up the card on magna cum loudly for you yesterday i recognized some of her early titles she worked with gallery in some of her early work thats what made me remember the tip so just stringing along on a hunch i try to look gallery up ask around with some people in the business i know and it turns out gallery dropped out of the scene three years ago just like that i mean i know a top producer with the adult film association and he told me she dropped out right in the middle of one of his shoots never said a word to anyone and no one ever heard from her again the producer he remembered it pretty clearly cause it cost him a lot of money to reshoot the flick there wouldve been no continuity if he just dumped in another actress to take her place bosch was surprised that continuity was even a factor in such films he and mora were both silent a moment thinking about the story before bosch finally spoke so youre thinking she might be in the ground somewhere gallery im talking about in concrete like the one we found this week yeah thats exactly what im thinking people in the industryi mean they are not your mainstream people so there are plenty of disappearing acts i remember this one broad she dropped out next thing i know i see her inpeople magazine one of those stories about some celebrity fundraiser and shes on the arm of whats his name guy has his own tv show about the guy in charge of a kennel noahs bark i cant think of ray i dont give okay okay anyway the point is these chicks drop in and out of the biz all the time not unusual they arent the smartest people in the first place they just get it in their mind to do something else maybe they meet a guy who they think is going to keep them in cocaine and caviar be their sugar daddy like that noahs bark asshole and they never show up for work againuntil they find out they were wrong as a group they dont look much past the next line of blow yask me what theyre all looking for is daddy they all got knocked around when they were a kid and this is some fuckedup way of showing theyre worth something to daddy least i read that somewhere probly bullshit like everything else bosch didnt need the psychology lesson cmon ray im in court and im trying to run down this case get to the point what about gallery what im saying is that with gallery the situations unusual cause its been almost three years and she never came back see they always come back even if theyve fucked over a producer so bad he had to do reshoots they always come back they start at the bottomloops fluffingand work their way back up fluffing a fluff is offcamera talent you could say girls who keep the acts up and ready to perform while theyre getting cameras ready moving lights changing angles things like that if you know what i mean yeah i know what you mean bosch was depressed after hearing about the business for ten minutes he looked at mora who had been in advice for as long as bosch could remember what about the survivor you ever check with her on this tip never got around to it like i said i dropped it when you dropped church thought we were done with the whole thing yeah so did i bosch took out a small pocket notebook and wrote down a few notes from the conversation did you save any notes from this from back then nope theyre gone the original tip sheet is probably in the main task force files but it wont say more than i just told you bosch nodded mora was probably right what did this gallery look like blonde nice setdefinitely beverly hills plastic i think i got a picture here he rolled his chair to the file cabinets behind him and dug through one of the drawers then rolled back with a file from it he pulled an color publicity shot it was a blonde woman posed at the edge of the ocean she was nude she had shaved her pubic area bosch handed the photo back to mora and felt embarrassed as if they were two boys in the schoolyard telling secrets about one of the girls he thought he saw a slight smile on moras face and wondered if the vice cop found humor in his discomfort or it was something else hell of a job youve got yeah well somebodys gotta do it bosch studied him a moment he decided to take a chance to try to figure out what made mora hang on to the job yeah but why you ray youve been doing this a long time i guess im a watchdog bosch the supreme court says this stuff is legal to a point that makes me one of the pointmen its gotta be monitored its gotta be kept clean no joke intended that means these peopleve gotta be licensed of legal age and nobodys forced to do something they dont want to do i spend a lot of days looking through this trash looking for the stuff even the supreme court couldnt take trouble is community standards la doesnt have any bosch hasnt been a successful obscenity prosecution here in years ive made some underage cases but im still looking for my first obscenity jacket he stopped a moment before saying most cops do a year in advice and then transfer out thats all they can take this is my seventh year man i cant tell you why i guess because theres no shortage of surprises yeah but year after year of this shit how can you take it moras eyes dropped to the statue on the desk im provided for dont worry about me he waited another beat and said ive got no family no wife anymore whos going to complain about what i do anyway bosch knew from their work on the task force that mora had volunteered for the b squad to work nights because his wife had just left him he had told bosch that he found it hardest to get through the nights bosch now wondered if moras exwife was blonde and if she was what it would mean look ray ive been thinking the same things about this follower and she fits you know gallery the three vics and the survivor were all blondes church wasnt choosey but the follower apparently is hey youre right mora said looking at the photo of gallery i hadnt thought about that anyway this fouryearold tip is as good a place to start as any there also might be other women other victims whatve you got going mora smiled and said harry doesnt matter what i got going its dogshit compared to this i gotta vacation next week but i dont leave till monday till then im on it you mentioned the adult association is that adult film association yeah its run out of a lawyers office in sherman oaks yeah you tight with anybody there i know the chief counsel hes interested in keeping the biz clean so hes a cooperative individual can you talk to him ask around try to find out if anybody else dropped out like gallery theyd have to be blonde and built you want to know how many other victims we might have thats right ill get on it what about the agents and the performers guild bosch nodded at the calendar with delta bush on it ill hit them too two agents handle ninety percent of the casting in this business theyd be the place to start what about outcall do all of the women do it not the top ranks of performers but the ones below that yeah they pretty much go the outcall route see the top performers they spend ten percent of the time making movies and the rest out on the road dancing they go from strip club to strip club make a lot of money they can make a hundred grand a year dancing most people think theyre getting a bundle to do the nasty on video thats wrong its the dancing then if you go below that level to the performers either going up or coming down theyre the ones you find doing outcall work in addition to the movies and the dancing a lot of money there too these chicks will pull down a grand a night for outcall work do they work with pimps what yeah some got management but its not a requirement its not like the street where a girl needs her pimp to protect her from the bad johns and other whores in outcall all you need is an answering service chick puts her ad and her picture in the x press and the calls come in most have rules they wont go to anybodys house strictly hotel work they can control the class of clientele they keep by the expense of the hotel good way to keep the riffraff out bosch thought about rebecca kaminski and how she had gone to the hyatt on sunset a nice place but the riffraff got in apparently thinking the same thing mora said it doesnt always work though obviously so ill see what i can come up with okay but off the top of my head i dont think there will be many if there was a bunch of women doing the sudden and permanent disappearing act like gallery did i think i wouldve gotten wind of it you got my beeper number mora wrote it down and bosch headed out of the office he was heading across the lobby past the front desk when the pager on his belt sounded he checked the number and saw it was a exchange he assumed mora had forgotten to tell him something he took the stairs back up to the second floor and ducked back into the advice squad room mora was there holding the photo of gallery and staring at it in a contemplative manner he looked up then and saw bosch did you just beep me me no oh i just thought you were trying to catch me before i left im gonna use one of the phones youre welcome to em harry bosch walked to an empty desk and dialed the number from the pager he saw mora slide the photo into the file he put the file into a briefcase that was on the floor next to his chair a male voice answered the call after two rings chief irvin irvings office this is lieutenant felder how can i help you as with all three of the departments assistant chiefs irving had his own private conference room at parker center it was furnished with a large round formicatopped table and six chairs a potted plant and a counter that ran along the rear wall there were no windows the room could be entered through a door from irvings adjutants office or from the sixth floors main hallway bosch was the last one to arrive at the summit meeting called by irving taking the last chair in the others sat the assistant chief followed counterclockwise by edgar and three men from robberyhomicide division two of them bosch knew detectives frankie sheehan and mike opelt they had also been attached to the dollmaker task force four years earlier the third man from rhd bosch knew by name and reputation only lieutenant hans rollenberger he had been promoted to rhd sometime after bosch had been demoted out of it but friends like sheehan kept bosch informed they told him rollenberger was another cookiecutter bureaucrat who avoided controversial and careerthreatening decisions the way people avoid panhandlers on the sidewalk pretending not to see or hear them he was a climber and therefore he couldnt be trusted in rhd the troops already referred to him as hans off because that was the kind of commander he was morale in rhd the unit every detective in the police department aspired to was probably the lowest since the day the rodney king video hit the tv sit down detective bosch irving said cordially i think you know everybody before bosch could answer rollenberger sprang from his chair and offered his hand lieutenant hans rollenberger bosch shook it then they both sat down bosch noticed a large stack of files at the center of the table and immediately recognized them as the dollmaker task force case files the murder books bosch had were his own personal files what was piled on the table was the entire main file probably pulled out of the archives warehouse were sitting down to see what we can do about this problem thats come up with the dollmaker case irving said i haveas detective edgar has probably told you i am swinging this case over to rhd i am prepared to have lieutenant rollenberger put as many people on it as needed i have also arranged for the loan of detective edgar to the case and you as soon as you are free from the trial i want results quickly this is already turning into a public relations nightmare with what i understand was revealed during testimony today in your trial yeah well sorry about that i was under oath i understand that the problem was you were testifying to things only you knew about i had my adjutant sit in and he informed us of your uh theory on what has happened with this new case last night i made the decision to have rhd handle the matter after hearing the sense of your testimony today i want to taskforce this and get it going now i want you to bring us up to speed on exactly what is going on what you think what you know then we will plan from there they all looked at bosch for a moment and he was unsure where to begin sheehan stepped in with a question it was a signal that he believed irving was playing on the level on this one that bosch could feel safe edgar says its a copycat that there is no problem with church thats right bosch answered church was the man but he was good for nine of the victims not eleven he spawned a follower halfway through his run and we didnt see it tell it irving said he did it took bosch fortyfive minutes to tell it sheehan and opelt asked several questions as he went the only thing or person he did not mention was mora at the end irving said when you ran this follower theory by locke did he say its possible yes with him i think he thinks anything is possible but he was useful he made it pretty clear for me i want to keep him informed hes good to bounce stuff off of i understand theres a leak could it be locke shaking his head bosch said i didnt go to him until last night and chandler has known things from the start she knew i was out at the scene the first day today she seemed to know the direction we are going that there is a follower shes got a good source keeping her informed and bremmer over at thetimes who knows hes got a lot of sources okay irving said well aside from dr locke being the exception nothing in this room leaves this room no one talks to anyone you twohe looked at bosch and edgardont even tell your supervisors at hollywood what youre doing without naming pounds irving was postulating his suspicion that pounds could be a leak edgar and bosch nodded in agreement nowirving looked at boschwhere do we go from here without hesitation bosch said we have to retrace the investigation like i told you locke said it was someone who had intimate access to the case who knew every detail and then copied them it was a perfect cover for a while at least youre talking about a cop rollenberger said his first words since the briefing began maybe but there are other possibilities the suspect pool is actually pretty large you got the cops people who found the bodies the coroners staff passersby at the crime scenes reporters lot of people shit opelt said were going to need more people dont worry about that irving said ill get more how do we narrow it down bosch said when we look at the victims we learn things about the killer the victims and the survivor generally fall into the same archetype blonde well built worked in porno and did outcall work on the side locke thinks that is how the follower picked his victims he saw them in videos then found the means of contacting them in the outcall ads in the local adult newspapers its like he went shopping for victims sheehan said yeah what else irving said not a lot locke said the follower is very smart much more so than church was but that he could be disassembling as he calls it coming apart thats why he sent the note nobody wouldve ever known but then he sent the note hes moved into a phase where he wants the attention that the dollmaker had he got jealous that this trial threw attention on church what about other victims sheehan asked ones we dont know about yet its been four years yeah im working on that locke says theres gotta be others shit opelt said we need more people everyone was quiet while they thought about this what about the fbi shouldnt we contact their behavioral science people rollenberger asked everyone looked at hans off as if he were the kid who came to the sandlot football game wearing white pants fuck them sheehan said we seem to have a handle on thisinitially at least irving said what else do we know about the follower rollenberger said hoping to immediately deflect attention from his miscue do we have any physical evidence that can give us any insight into him well we need to track down the survivor bosch said she gave a composite drawing that everyone dismissed after i nailed church but now we know her drawing was probably of the follower we need to find her and see if there is anything else that she has that she can still remember that will help as he said this sheehan dug through the stack of files on the table and found the composite it was very generic and didnt look like anyone bosch recognized least of all mora we have to assume he wore disguises same as church so the composite might not help but she might remember something else something about the suspects manners that might let us know if it was a cop also im having amado at the coroners office compare the rape kits between the two victims we now attribute to the follower theres a good chance the follower may have made a mistake here explain irving said the follower did everything the dollmaker did right right rollenberger said wrong he only did what was known at the time about the dollmaker what we knew what we didnt know was that church had been smart he had shaved his body so he would not leave trace hair evidence behind we didnt know that until after he was dead so neither did the follower and by then he had already done two of the victims so there is a chance those two rape kits hold physical evidence to our guy irving said right im having amado crosscheck between the two kits he should know something by monday thats very good detective bosch irving looked at bosch and their eyes met it was as if the assistant chief was sending him a message and taking one at the same time well see bosch said other than that thats all weve got right rollenberger said right no it was edgar who up until now had been silent everyone looked at him in the concrete we foundactually harry found ita cigarette pack it went in when the concrete was wet so theres a good chance they were the followers marlboro regulars soft pack they also could have been the vics right rollenberger asked no bosch said i talked to her manager last night he said she didnt smoke the smokes were in all likelihood the followers sheehan smiled at bosch and bosch smiled back sheehan held his hands together as if waiting for handcuffs here i am boys he said thats my brand mine too bosch said but ive got you beat im lefthanded too i better get an alibi working the men at the table smiled bosch dropped his smile when he suddenly thought of something but knew he could not say anything yet he looked at the files stacked at the center of the table shit every cop smokes marlboros or camels opelt said its a dirty habit irving said i agree said rollenberger a little too quickly it brought silence back to the table whos your suspect it was irving who asked it he was looking at bosch again with those eyes harry couldnt decipher the question shocked bosch irving knew somehow he knew harry didnt answer detective it is clear youve had a handle on whats going on for a day youve also been on this case from the start i think youve got someone in mind tell us we need to start somewhere bosch hesitated again but finally said im not sure and i dont want to ruin someones career if youre wrong to set the dogs on a possibly innocent man thats understood but we cant have you pursuing this on your own havent you learned anything from this trial i believe cowboying was the term money chandler used to describe it they were all looking at him he was thinking of mora the vice cop was strange but was he that strange over the years bosch had often been investigated by the department and did not want to bring that kind of weight down on the wrong person detective irving prompted even if all you have is a hunch then you must tell us investigations start with hunches you want to protect one person but what are we going to do we are about to go out and investigate cops what difference is it if we start with this person or come to him in time either way we will get to him give us the name bosch thought about everything irving had said he wondered what his own motive was was he protecting mora or simply keeping him for himself he thought a few more moments and finally said give me five minutes alone in here with the files if there is something there that i think is there then ill tell you gentlemen irving said lets go get some coffee after the room was cleared bosch looked at the files for nearly a minute without moving he felt confused he wasnt sure whether he wanted to find something that would convince him mora was the follower or convince him he was not he thought about what chandler had said to the jury about monsters and the black abyss where they dwell whoever fights monsters he thought should not think too hard about it he lit a cigarette and pulled the stack close to him and began looking for two files the chronologies file was near the top it was thin it was basically a quick guide to important dates in the investigation he found the task force personnel file at the bottom of the stack it was thicker than the first he pulled out because it contained the weekly shifts schedule for the detectives assigned to the task force and the overtime approval forms as the detectivethree in charge of the b squad bosch had been in charge of keeping the personnel file up to date from the chronologies file bosch quickly looked up the times and dates that the first two porno actresses were murdered and other pertinent information about the way they were lured to their death then he looked up the same information about the lone survivor he wrote it all down in order on a page of his pocket notebook june pm georgia stern aka velvet box survivor july pm nicole knapp aka holly lere w hollywood sept am shirleen kemp aka heather cumhither malibu bosch opened the personnel file and pulled the shift schedules for the weeks the women were attacked or murdered june seventeenth the night georgia stern was attacked was a sunday which was the b squads night off mora couldve done it but so could anyone else who was on the squad on the knapp case bosch got a hit and his fingers trembled a little as he held the schedule for the week of july his adrenaline was moving faster now july sixth the day knapp was sent on an outcall request at pm and was found dead on the sidewalk on sweetzer in west hollywood at pm was a friday mora was on the schedule to be working the threetomidnight shift with the b squad but there next to his name in boschs own writing was the word sick bosch quickly pulled out the schedule for the week of september twentysecond the nude body of shirleen kemp had been found at the side of the pacific coast highway in malibu at four in the morning on friday september twentyeighth he realized that wasnt enough information and looked for the file that contained the investigation of her death he quickly read through the file and learned that kemp had a phone service that had logged a call for her services at the malibu inn at am when detectives went there they learned from phone records that at am a call had been placed by the occupant of room the front desk staff could not provide a good description of the man in and the identification he gave proved to be false he had paid in cash the one thing the desk people could say with absolute accuracy was that he checked in at am each registration card was punched with the time the man had called for heather cumhither twenty minutes after he checked in bosch referred back to the work schedule on the thursday night before kemp was murdered mora had worked but he had apparently come in and left early he had signed in at pm and out at pm that gave him fifty minutes to get from the hollywood station to the malibu inn and checked into room at am friday bosch knew that it could be done traffic would be light on the pch that late at night it could be mora he noticed that the cigarette he had set on the edge of the table had burned down to the butt and it had discolored the formica edge he quickly dropped the cigarette into a pot containing a ficus plant in the corner of the room and turned the table around so the burn mark was positioned at the spot where rollenberger had been sitting he waved one of the files in the air to disperse the smoke and then opened the door to irvings office raymond mora irving had said the name out loud apparently to see how it sounded he said nothing else when bosch was finished telling what he knew bosch watched him and waited for more but the assistant chief only sniffed at the air identified the cigarette smoke and frowned another thing bosch said locke wasnt the only one i talked to about the follower mora knows just about everything i just told you he was on the task force and we went to him this week for help on the id of the concrete blonde i was over at advice when you paged me he had called me last night what did he want irving asked he wanted to let me know that he thought the follower mightve done the two porno queens from the original eleven he said it had just come to him that maybe the follower had started way back then shit sheehan said this guy is playing with us if he what did you tell him irving interrupted i told him i was thinking that too and i asked him to check with his sources to see if he could find out if there were other women who disappeared or dropped out of the business like becky kaminski did you asked him to go to work on this rollenberger said his eyebrows arched in astonishment and outrage i had to it was the obvious thing for me to ask him if i didnt hed know i was suspicious hes right irving said rollenbergers chest seemed to deflate a little bit he couldnt get anything right yes now i see he dutifully responded good work were going to need more people opelt said since everybody was being so agreeable i want to begin surveillance on him by tomorrow morning irving said were going to need at least three teams sheehan and opelt will be one bosch youre involved in court and edgar i want you working on tracking down the survivor so you two are out lieutenant rollenberger who else can you spare well yde is sitting around since buchert is on vacation and mayfield and rutherford are in court on the same case i can shake one of them loose to pair with yde thats all ive got unless you want to pull back on some ongoing no i dont want that get yde and mayfield in on this ill go to lieutenant hilliard and see what she can spare from the valley shes had three teams on the catering truck case for a month and theyre at the wall ill take a team off of that very good sir rollenberger said sheehan looked at harry and made a face like he was going to puke with this guy in charge bosch held back his smile there was always this giddiness that detectives felt when they received their marching orders and were about to go out into the hunt opelt sheehan i want you on mora tomorrow morning at eight irving said lieutenant i want you to set up a meeting with the new people tomorrow morning bring them up to date on what we have and have one team take over surveillance from opelt and sheehan at fourpm they stay with mora until lights out if overtime is needed im authorizing it the other pair will take the surveillance at eightam saturday and opelt and sheehan will take it back at four rotate like that the nightshift watchers have to stay with him until they are sure he is in his home in bed for the night i want no mistakes if this guy pulls off something while were watching him we can all kiss our careers goodbye chief yes bosch there is no guarantee that he is going to do something locke said he thinks the follower has a lot of control he doesnt think he is out there hunting every night he thinks he controls the urge and lives pretty normally then strikes at irregular intervals there is no guarantee that well even be watching the right man detective bosch but i want to watch him anyway i am sitting here hoping we are dreadfully wrong about detective mora but the things you have said here are convincing in a circumstantial way nothing near being usable in court so we watch him and hope if its him well see the sign before he hurts anybody else my i agree sir rollenberger said dont interrupt me lieutenant my forte is neither detective work nor psychoanalysis but something tells me that whoever the follower is hes feeling the pressure sure he brought it on himself with that note and he may think this is a catandmouse game he can master nevertheless he is feeling the pressure and one thing i know just from being a cop when the pressure is on these people the edgedwellers i call them then they react sometimes they crack sometimes they act out so what i am saying is knowing what i know about this case i want mora covered if he even walks outside to get the mail they sat there in silence even rollenberger who seemed cowed by his misstep in interrupting irving okay then we have our assignments sheehan opelt surveillance bosch you are freelancing until you get done with the trial edgar you have the survivor and when you have the time do some checking on mora nothing that will get back to him hes divorced bosch offered got divorced right before the dollmaker task force was put together all right theres your start go to court pull his divorce who knows we might get lucky maybe his wife dropped him because he liked making her up like a doll things have been hard enough on this case we could use a break like that irving looked around the table at each mans face the potential for embarrassment to the department on this case is huge but i dont want anybody holding back let the stones fall where they will okay then everybody has their assignments go to it everyone is excused with the exception of detective bosch as the others filed out of the room bosch thought rollenbergers face showed his disappointment at not getting a chance for a private asskissing conference with irving after the door closed irving was quiet for a few moments as he composed what he wanted to say throughout most of boschs career as a detective irving had been a nemesis of sorts always trying to control him and bring him into the fold bosch had always resisted nothing personal it just wasnt boschs gig but now bosch sensed a softening in irving in the way he had treated bosch during the meeting in the way he testified earlier in the week he could have hung bosch out to dry but didnt yet it wasnt something bosch could or would acknowledge so he sat there silently and waited good work on this detective especially with the trial and everything going on bosch nodded but knew that wasnt what this was about uh thats why i held you here the trial i wanted tolets see how do i say this i wanted to tell you and excuse the language but i dont give a flying fuck what that jury decides or how much money they give those people that jury has no idea what its like to be out there on the edge to have to make the decisions that may cost or save lives you cant take a week to accurately examine and judge the decision you had to make in a second bosch was trying to think of something to say and the silence seemed to drag on too long anyway irving finally said i guess its taken me four years to come to that conclusion but better late than never hey i could use you for closing arguments tomorrow irvings face cringed the muscular jaws flexing as if he had just taken a mouthful of cold sauerkraut dont get me started on that either i mean what is this city doing the city attorneys office is nothing but a school a law school for trial lawyers and the taxpayers pay the tuition we get these greenhorn uh uh preppies who dont know the first thing about trial law they learn from the mistakes they make in court when it countsfor us and when they finally get good and know what the hell theyre doing they quit and then theyre the lawyers suing us bosch had never seen irving so animated it was as if he had taken off the starched public persona he always wore like a uniform harry was entranced sorry about that irving said i get carried away anyway good luck with this jury but dont let it worry you bosch said nothing you know bosch it only takes a halfhour meeting with lieutenant rollenberger in the room for me to want to take a good look at myself and this department and where its headed hes not the lapd i joined or you joined hes a good manager yes and so am i at least i think so but we cant forget were cops bosch didnt know what to say or if he should say anything it seemed that irving was almost rambling now as if there was something he wanted to say but was looking for anything else to say instead hans rollenberger what a name huh i can guess the detectives in his crew must call him hans off am i right sometimes yes well i guess thats expected heuh you know harry ive got thirtyeight years in the department bosch just nodded this was getting weird irving had never even called him by his first name before and uh i worked hollywood patrol for a lot of years right out of the academy that question money chandler asked me about your mother that really came out of the blue and im sorry about that harry sorry for your loss it was a long time ago bosch waited a beat irving was looking down at his hands which were clasped on the table if thats it i think ill yes thats basically it but you know what i wanted to tell you is that i was there that day what day that day that your motheri was the ro the reporting officer yes i was the one that found her i was walking a foot beat on the boulevard and i ducked into that alley off of gower i usually hit it once a day and uh i found her when chandler showed me those reports i recognized the case right away she didnt know my badge numberit was there on the reportor she wouldve known i was the one who found her chandler wouldve had some kind of a field day with that i guess this was hard for bosch to sit through now he was glad irving wasnt looking at him he knew or thought he knew what it was that irving wasnt saying if he had worked the boulevard foot beat then he had known boschs mother before she was dead irving glanced up at him and then looked away toward the corner of the room his eyes fell on the ficus plant somebody put a cigarette butt in my pot he said that yours harry bosch was lighting a cigarette as he used his shoulder to push through one of the glass doors at the entrance to parker center irving had jolted him with his smallworld story bosch had always figured hed run into somebody in the department who knew her or knew the case never did irving fit into that scenario as he walked through the south lot to the caprice he noticed jerry edgar standing at the corner of los angeles and first waiting for the cross light bosch looked at his watch and saw it was quitting time he thought edgar was probably walking up to the code seven or the red wind for a draft before fighting the freeway he thought that wasnt a bad idea sheehan and opelt were probably already sitting on stools at one of the bars by the time bosch got to the corner edgar had a blockandahalf lead on him and was walking up first toward the seven bosch picked up the pace for the first time in a long time he felt the actual mental craving for alcohol for just a while he wanted to forget church and mora and chandler and his own secrets and what irving had told him in the conference room but then edgar walked right on by the billy club that served as the door handle at the seven without even giving it a glance he crossed spring and walked alongside thetimes building toward broadway then its the red wind bosch thought the wind was okay as far as a watering hole went they had weinhards by the bottle instead of on draft so the place lost points there another minus was that the yuppies from thetimes newsroom favored the place and it often was more crowded with reporters than cops the big plus however was that on thursdays and fridays they had a quartet come in and play sets from six to ten they were mostly retired club men who werent too tight but it was as good a way as any to miss the rush hour he watched edgar cross broadway and stay on first instead of taking a left to go down to the wind bosch slowed his pace a bit so edgar could renew his blockandahalf lead he lit another cigarette and felt uneasy about the prospect of following the other detective but did it anyway there was a bad feeling beginning to nag at him edgar turned left on hill and ducked into the first door on the east side across from the new subway entrance the door he went through was to the hung jury a bar that was off the lobby of the fuentes legal center an eightstory office building solely occupied by attorney offices mostly the tenants were defense and litigation attorneys who had chosen the nondescript if not ugly building because of its main selling point it was only a half block from the county courts building a block from the criminal courts building and a block and a half from the federal building bosch knew all of this because belk had told him all about it on the day the two of them had come to the fuentes legal center to find honey chandlers office bosch had been subpoenaed to give a deposition in the norman church case the uneasy feeling turned into a hollow in his gut as he passed the door to the hung jury and went into the main lobby of the fuentes center he knew the layout of the bar having dropped in for a beer and a shot after the deposition with chandler and he knew there was an entrance off the buildings lobby he pushed through the lobby entrance door now and stepped into an alcove where there were two pay phones and the doors to the restrooms he moved up to the corner and carefully looked into the bar area a juke box bosch couldnt see was playing sinatras summer wind a barmaid with a puffy wig and bills wrapped through her fingerstens fives oneswas delivering a batch of martinis to a four top of lawyers sitting near the front entrance and the bartender was leaning over the dimly lit bar smoking a cigarette and reading thehollywood reporter probably an actor or a screenwriter when he wasnt tending bar bosch thought maybe a talent scout who in this town wasnt when the bartender leaned forward to stub out his smoke in an ashtray bosch saw edgar sitting at the far end of the bar with a draft beer in front of him a match flared in the darkness next to him and bosch watched honey chandler light a smoke and then drop her match into an ashtray next to what looked like a bloody mary bosch moved back into the alcove out of sight he waited next to an old plywood shack that was built on the sidewalk at hill and first and served as a news and magazine stand it had been closed and boarded for the night as it grew dark and the streetlights came on bosch spent his time fending off panhandlers and passing prostitutes looking for one last businessmans special before heading from downtown into hollywood for the eveningand the roughertrade by the time he saw edgar come out of the hung jury bosch had a nice little pile of cigarette butts on the sidewalk at his feet he flicked the one he had going into the street and stepped back alongside the news stand so edgar wouldnt notice him bosch saw no sign of chandler and assumed that she had left the bar through the other door and gone down to the garage and her car edgar probably had wisely declined a ride over to the parker center lot as edgar passed the stand bosch stepped out behind him jerry whereyat edgar jumped as if an ice cube had been pressed against his neck and whipped around harry whatre youhey you wanna grab a drink thats what i was looking to do bosch let him stand there and squirm for a few seconds before saying you already had your drink what do you mean bosch took a step toward him edgar looked genuinely scared you know what i mean a beer for you right bloody mary for the lady listen harry look i dont call me that dont ever call me harry again understand you want to talk to me call me bosch thats what the people who arent my friends call me the people i dont trust just call me that can i explain haruh id like the chance to explain whats to explain you fucked me over nothing to explain about that whatd you tell her tonight you just run down everything we just talked about in irvings office i dont think she needs it pal the damage is already done no she left a long time ago i was in there most of the time alone thinking about how to get out of this i didnt tell her shit about todays meeting harry i didnt bosch took one more step and in a quick motion brought his hand up palm out and hit edgar in the chest knocking him backward i said dont call me that he yelled you fuck youwe worked together man i taught you im in that courtroom getting fucked in the ass and i find out youre the guy youre the goddamn leak im sorry i what about bremmer you the one who told him about the note is that where youre going for a drink now going to meet bremmer well dont let me stop you no man i havent talked to bremmer look i made a mistake okay im sorry she screwed me too it was like blackmail i couldnti tried to get out of it but she had me by the shorthairs you gotta believe me man bosch looked at him for a long moment it was fully dark now but he thought he saw that edgars eyes were shiny in the glow of the streetlights maybe he was holding back tears but what were they tears for bosch wondered for the loss of the relationship they had or were they tears of fear bosch felt the surge of his power over edgar and edgar knew he had it in a low and very even voice bosch said i want to know everything you are going to tell me what you did the quartet at the wind was on a break they sat at a table in the back it was a dark woodpaneled room like hundreds of others in the city a red leatherette pad ran along the edge of the cigarettescarred bar and the barmaids wore black uniforms and white aprons and they all had too much red lipstick on their thin lips bosch ordered a double shot of jack black straight up and a bottle of weinhards he also gave the barmaid money for a pack of cigarettes edgar who now wore the face of a man whose life had run out on him ordered jack black water back its the damn recession edgar began before bosch asked a question real estate is in the toilet i had to drop that gig and we had the mortgage and you know how it is man brenda had gotten used to a cert fuck that you think i want to hear about how you sell me out because your wife has to drive a chevy instead of a bmw fuck you you its not like that i shut up im talking youre going to they both shut up while the barmaid put the drinks and cigarettes down bosch put a twenty on her tray he never took his dark angry eyes off edgar now skip the bullshit and tell me what you did edgar threw back his shot and washed it down with water before starting uh you see uh it was late monday afternoon this was after wed been out to the scene at bings and i was back at the office and i got a call at the office and it was chandler she knew something was up i dont know how she knew but she knew about the note we got and the body being found she musta gotten tipped by bremmer or something she started asking questions you know was it confirmed as the dollmaker things like that i put her off no comment and then then well she offered me something im two back on the mortgage and brenda doesnt even know whatd i tell you i dont want to hear your sad story edgar im telling you i dont have any sympathy for that you tell it and it will only make me madder all right all right she offered me money i said id think about it she said if i wanted to deal to meet her at the hung jury that night you wont let me say why but i had reasons and so i went yeah i went yeah and you fucked yourself up bosch said hoping to knock down the defiant tone that had crept into edgars voice he had finished the last of his jack black and signaled the barmaid but she didnt see him the musicians were taking their places behind their instruments the front man was a saxophone player and bosch wished he was here under other circumstances what did you give her just what we knew that day but she already had just about everything already i told her you said it looked like the dollmaker it wasnt a lot haand most of it was in the paper the next day anyway and i wasnt bremmers source on that you have to believe me you told her i came out there to the scene yeah i told her what was the big secret about that bosch thought about all of this for a few minutes he watched the band start up with a billy strayhorn number called lush life their table was far enough away from the quartet that it wasnt too loud harrys eyes scanned the rest of the bar to see if anyone else was into it and he saw bremmer sitting at the bar nursing a beer he was with a group of what looked like reporter types one of the other men even had one of those long skinny notebooks that reporters always carry sticking out of his back pocket speaking of bremmer there he is maybe he wants to check a detail or two with you after were done harry its not me bosch let him get away with the harry that time he was getting tired and depressed with this scene he wanted to get it over with and get out of there go see sylvia how many times did you talk to her every night she turned it on you didnt she you had to go see her i was stupid i needed the money once i met her the first night she had me by the balls she said she wanted updates on the investigation or shed tell you i was the leak shed inform iad fuck she never even paid me what happened tonight to make her split early she said the case was over going to closing arguments tomorrow so it didnt matter what was happening in the case she cut me loose but it wont end there you know that dont you whenever she needs a plate run an address from dmv a witnesss unlisted number shes going to call you shes got you man i know ill have to deal with it all for what what was the price that first night i wanted one goddamn mortgage payment cant sell the fuckin house cant make the mortgage i dont know what im going to do what about me arent you worried about what im going to do yes yes i am bosch looked back at the quartet they were staying with a strayhorn set and were on to blood count there was a journeyman quality to the sax mans work he stayed on point and his phrasing was clean what are you going to do edgar asked bosch didnt have to think he already knew he didnt take his eyes from the sax man as he spoke nothing nothing its what you are going to do i cant work with you anymore man i know we got this thing with irving but thats it thats the end after this is over you go to pounds and tell him you want to transfer out of hollywood but there arent openings in homicide anywhere else i looked at the board you know how rarely they come i didnt say anything about homicide i just said youre going to ask for a transfer you ask for the first thing open understand i dont care if you end up on autos in the seventyseventh you take the first thing you can get now he looked at edgar whose mouth was slightly open and said thats the price you pay but homicide is what i do you know that its where its at and youre not where its at anymore this isnt negotiable unless you want to take your chances with iad but either you go to pounds or i go to them i cant work with you anymore thats it he looked back at the band edgar was silent and after a few moments bosch told him to leave you go first i cant walk with you back to parker edgar stood up and hovered near the table for a few moments before saying someday youre going to need all the friends you can get thats the day youll remember doing this to me without looking at him bosch said i know after edgar had gone bosch got the barmaids attention and ordered another round the quartet played rain check with some improvisational riffs that bosch liked the whiskey was beginning to warm his gut and he sat back and smoked and listened trying not to think about anything to do with cops and killers but soon he felt a presence nearby and turned to see bremmer standing there with his bottle of beer in hand i take it by the look on edgars face when he left that he wont be coming back can i join you no he wont be back and you can do whatever you want but im off duty off the record and off the road in other words you aint saying shit you got it the reporter sat down and lit a cigarette his small but sharp green eyes squinted through the smoke its okay cause im not working either bremmer youre always working even now i say the wrong word and you arent going to forget about it i suppose but you forget the times we worked together the stories that helped you harry i write one story that doesnt go the way you want and all of that is forgotten now im just that damn reporter who i havent forgotten shit youre sitting here right i remember what you did for me and ill remember what you did against me it all evens out in the end they sat in silence for a while and listened to the music the set ended just as the barmaid was putting boschs third double jack black on the table im not saying i would ever reveal it bremmer said but how come my source on the note story was so important its not that important anymore at the time i just wanted to know who was trying to nail me you said that before that someone was setting you up you really think that it doesnt matter what kind of story did you write for tomorrow the reporter straightened up and and his eyes brightened youll see it pretty much a straight court story your testimony about someone else continuing the killings its going out front its a big story that why im here i always come in for a pop after i hit the front page party time huh what about my mother did you put that stuff in harry if thats what you are worried about forget it i didnt even mention that in the story to be honest its of course vitally interesting to you but as far as a newspaper story goes i thought it was too much inside baseball i left it out inside baseball too arcane like the stats those sports guys on tv throw around you know like how many fastballs lefty so and so threw during the third inning of the fifth game of the world series i thought the stuff with your motherchandlers attempt to use it as your motivation for dropping this guywas going too far inside bosch just nodded he was glad that part of his life would not be in the hands of a million newspaper buyers tomorrow but he acted nonchalant about it but bremmer said i gotta tell you if we get a verdict back on this that goes against you and the jurors start saying they thought you did it to avenge your mothers death then that is usable and i wont have a choice bosch nodded again it seemed fair enough he looked at his watch and saw it was nearly ten he knew he should call sylvia and he knew he should get out of there before the next set started and he became entranced by the music again he finished his drink and said im gonna hit it yeah me too bremmer said ill walk out with you outside the chilled night air cut through boschs whiskey daze he said goodbye to bremmer and put his hands in his pockets as he started down the sidewalk harry you walking all the way back to parker center hop in my car is right here bosch watched bremmer unlock the passenger door to his le sabre which was parked right at the curb in front of the wind bosch got in without a word of thanks and leaned over and unlocked the other side when he was drunk he went through a stage where he said almost nothing just vegetated in his own juices and listened bremmer started the conversation during the four blocks to parker center that money chandler is something else isnt she she really knows how to play a jury you think shes got it dont you its going to be close harry i think but even if its one of those statement verdicts that are popular these days against the lapd shell get rich whaddaya mean you havent been in federal court before have you no i try not to make it a habit well in a civil rights case if the plaintiff winsin this case chandlerthen the defendantin this case the city is paying your tabhas to pay the lawyers fees i guarantee you harry that in her closing argument tomorrow money will tell those jurors that all they need to do is make a statement that you acted wrongly and even damages of a dollar make that statement the jury will see that as the easy way out they can say you were wrong and only give a dollar in damages they wont know because belk is not allowed to tell them that even if the plaintiff wins a dollar chandler bills the city and that wont be a dollar more like a couple hundred thousand of them its a scam shit yeah thats the justice system bremmer pulled into the lot and bosch pointed out his caprice in one of the front rows you going to be all right to drive bremmer asked no problem bosch was about to close the door when bremmer stopped him hey harry we both know i cant reveal my source but i can tell you who it isnt and ill tell you it is not someone youd expect you know edgar and pounds if thats who you think it is forget it youd never guess who it was so dont bother okay bosch just nodded and shut the door after fumbling to find the right one bosch put the key in the ignition but didnt turn it he briefly considered whether he should try to drive or whether he should go get coffee from the cafeteria first he looked up through the windshield at the gray monolith that was parker center most of the lights were on but he knew the offices had emptied the lights of the squad rooms were always left on to give the appearance that the fight against crime never sleeps it was a lie he thought of the couch that was kept in one of the rhd interrogation rooms that was also an alternative to driving unless of course it was already taken but then he thought of sylvia and how she had come to court despite what he had said about not wanting her there he wanted to get home to her yes he thought home he put his hand on the key but then dropped it away again he rubbed his eyes they were tired and there were so many thoughts swimming in the whiskey there was the sound of the tenor sax floating there too his own improvisational riff he tried to think of what bremmer had just said that bosch would never guess who the source was why had he said it that way he found that more tantalizing than wondering who his source actually was it didnt matter he told himself all would be over soon he leaned his head against the side window thinking about the trial and his testimony he wondered how he had looked up there all eyes on him he never wanted to be in that position again ever to have honey chandler cornering him with words whoever fights monsters he thought what had she told the jury about the abyss yes where monsters dwell is that where i dwell in the black place the black heart he remembered then locke had called it that the black heart does not beat alone in his mind he replayed the vision of norman church being knocked upright by the bullet and then flopping helplessly naked on the bed the look in the dying mans eyes stayed with him four years later and the vision was as clear as yesterday why was that he wanted to know why did he remember norman churchs face and not his own mothers do i have the black heart bosch asked himself do i the darkness came up on him then like a wave and pulled him down he was there with the monsters there was a sharp rap on the glass bosch abruptly opened his eyes and saw the patrolman next to the car holding his baton and flashlight harry quickly looked around and grabbed the wheel and put his foot on the brake he didnt think he had been driving that badly then he realized he hadnt been driving at all he was still in the parker center lot he reached over and rolled the window down the kid in the uniform was the lot cop the lowestrated cadet in each academy class was first assigned to watch the parker center lot duringpm watch it was a tradition but it also served a purpose if the cops couldnt prevent car breakins and other crime in the parking lot of their own headquarters then it begged the question where could they stop crime detective are you all right he said as he slid his baton back into the ring on his belt i saw you get dropped off and get in your car then when you didnt leave i wanted to check yes bosch managed to say im uh fine thanks i musta dozed off there been a long day yes they all are be careful now yes are you okay driving fine thank you you sure im sure he waited until the cop walked away before starting the car bosch looked at his watch and figured he had slept for no more than thirty minutes but the nap and the sudden waking had refreshed him he lit a cigarette and pulled the car out onto los angeles street and took it to the hollywood freeway entrance as he drove north on the freeway he rolled the window down so the cool air would keep him alert it was a clear night ahead of him the lights of the hollywood hills ascended into the sky where spotlights from two different locations behind the mountains cut through the darkness he thought it was a beautiful scene yet it made him feel melancholy los angeles had changed in the last few years but then there was nothing new about that it was always changing and that was why he loved it but riot and recession had left a particularly harsh mark on the landscape the landscape of memory bosch believed he would never forget the pall of smoke that hung over the city like some kind of supersmog that could not be lifted by the evening winds the tv pictures of burning buildings and looters unchecked by the police it had been the departments darkest hour and it still had not recovered and neither had the city many of the ills that led to such volcanic rage were still left untended the city offered so much beauty and yet it offered so much danger and hate it was a city of shaken confidence living solely on its stores of hope in boschs mind he saw the polarization of the haves and havenots as a scene in which a ferry was leaving the dock an overloaded ferry leaving an overloaded dock with some people with a foot on the boat and a foot on the dock the boat was pulling further away and it would only be so long before those in the middle would fall in meanwhile the ferry was still too crowded and it would capsize at the first wave those left on the dock would certainly cheer this they prayed for the wave he thought of edgar and what he had done he was one of those about to fall in nothing could be done about it he and his wife whom edgar could not bring himself to tell about their precarious position bosch wondered if he had done the right thing edgar had spoken of the time that would come when bosch would need every friend he could get would it have been wiser to bank this one to let edgar go no harm no foul he didnt know but there was still time he would have to decide as he drove through the cahuenga pass he rolled the window back up it was getting cold he looked up into the hills to the west and tried to spot the unlighted area where his dark house sat he felt glad that he wasnt going up there tonight that he was going to sylvia he got there at and used his own key to get in there was a light on in the kitchen but the rest of the place was dark sylvia was asleep it was too late for the news and the latenight talk shows never held his interest he took his shoes off in the living room so as to not make any noise and went down the hall to her bedroom he stood still in the complete darkness letting his eyes adjust hi she said from the bed though he could not yet see her lo where have you been harry she said it sweetly and with sleep still in her voice it was not a challenge or a demand i had to do a few things then i had a few drinks hear any good music yeah they had a quartet not bad played a lot of billy strayhorn do you want me to fix you something nah go to sleep you have school tomorrow im not that hungry anyway and i can get something if i want it cmere he made his way to the bed and crawled across the down quilt her hand came up and around his neck and she pulled him down into a kiss yes you did have a few drinks he laughed and then so did she let me go brush my teeth wait a minute she pulled him down again and he kissed her mouth and neck she had a milky sweet smell of sleep and perfume about her that he liked he noticed that she was not wearing a nightgown though she usually did he put his hand under the covers and traced the flatness of her stomach he brought it up and caressed her breasts and then her neck he kissed her again and then pushed his face into her hair and neck sylvia thank you he whispered for what for coming today and being there i know what i said before but it meant something to see you when i looked out there it meant a lot that was all he could say about it he got up then and went into the bathroom he stripped off his clothes and carefully hung them on hooks on the back of the door he would have to wear them again in the morning he took a quick shower then shaved and brushed his teeth with the second set of toiletries he kept in her bathroom he looked in the mirror as he brushed his damp hair back with his hands and he smiled it might have been the residue of the whiskey and beer he knew but he doubted it it was because he felt lucky he felt that he was neither on the ferry with the mad crowd nor left behind on the dock with the angry crowd he was in his own boat with just sylvia they made love the way lonely people do silently with each trying too hard in the dark to please the other until they were almost clumsy about it still there was a healing sense about it for bosch afterward she lay next to him her finger tracing the outline of his tattoo what are you thinking about she asked nothing just stuff tell me he waited a few moments before answering tonight i found out somebody betrayed me somebody close and well i was just thinking that maybe id had it wrong that it really wasnt me who was betrayed it was himself he had betrayed himself and maybe living with that is punishment enough i dont think i need to add to it he thought about what he had said to edgar at the red wind and decided he would have to stop him from going to pounds for the transfer betrayed how uh consorting with the enemy i guess youd call it honey chandler yeah how bad is it not too bad i guess its just that he did it that matters it hurts i guess is there anything you can do not to him i mean i mean to limit the damage no whatever damage there is its already done i only figured out it was him tonight it was by accident otherwise i probably would have never even thought of him anyway dont worry about it she caressed his chest with the tips of her fingernails if youre not worried im not he loved her knowing the boundaries of how much she could ask him and that she didnt even think to ask him who it was he was talking about he felt totally comfortable with her no worries no anxieties it was home to him he was just beginning to fall off when she spoke again harry uh huh are you worried about the trial how the closing arguments will go not really i dont like being in the fishbowl sitting at that table while everybody gets their chance to explain why they think i did what i did but im not worried about the outcome if thats what you mean it doesnt mean anything i just want it to be over and i dont really care anymore what they do no jury can sanction what i did or didnt do no jury can tell me i was right or wrong you know this trial could last a year and it wouldnt tell them everything about that night what about the department will they care he told her what irving had told him that afternoon about what effect the trials outcome would have he didnt say anything about what the assistant chief had said about knowing his mother but irvings story crossed through his mind and for the first time since he had been in bed he felt the need for a cigarette but he didnt get up he put the urge out of his mind and they lay quietly for a while after that bosch kept his eyes open in the dark his thoughts were now about edgar and then they segued to mora he wondered what the vice cop was doing at the same moment was he alone in the dark was he out looking i meant what i said earlier today harry sylvia said whats that that i want to know all about you your past the good and the bad and i want you to know about me dont ignore this it could hurt us her voice had lost some of its sleepy sweetness he was silent and closed his eyes he knew this one thing was more important to her than anything she had been the loser in a past relationship where the stories of the past were not used as the building blocks of the future he brought his hand up and rubbed his thumb along the back of her neck she always smelled powdery after sex he thought yet she had not even gotten up to go into the bathroom this was a mystery to him it took him a while to answer her you have to take me without a past ive let it go and dont want to go back to examine it to tell it to even think about it ive spent my whole life getting away from my past you understand just because a lawyer can throw it at me in a courtroom doesnt mean i have to what tell me he didnt answer he turned his body into her and kissed and embraced her he just wanted to hold her to pull back away from this cliff i love you she said i love you he said she pulled herself closer to him and put her face in the crook of his neck her arms held him tightly as if maybe she was scared it was the first time he had said it to her it was the first time he had said it to anyone as far back as he could remember maybe he had never said it it felt good to him almost like a palpable presence a warm flower of deep red opening in his chest and he realized he was the one who was a little bit scared as if by simply saying the words he had taken on a great responsibility it was scary yet exciting he thought of himself in the mirror smiling she held herself pressed against him and he could feel her breath against his neck in a short while her breathing became more measured as she fell asleep lying awake bosch held her like that until well into the night now sleep would not come to him and with the insomnia came realities that robbed him of the good feelings he had only minutes before he had thought about what she had said about betrayal and trust and he knew that the pledges they spoke to each other this night would founder if built on deception he knew what she had said was true he would have to tell her who he was what he was if the words he had spoken were ever to be more than words he thought about what judge keyes had said about words being beautiful and ugly on their own bosch had spoken the word love he knew now that he must make it either ugly or beautiful the bedrooms windows were on the east side of the house and the light of dawn was just beginning to cling to the edges of the blinds when bosch finally closed his eyes and slept bosch looked rumpled and wornout when he entered the courtroom friday morning belk was already there scribbling on his yellow pad he looked up and appraised him as bosch sat down you look like shit and smell like an ashtray and the jury will know thats the same suit and tie you wore yesterday a clear sign im guilty dont be such a smartass you never know what may turn a juror one way or the other i dont really care besides youre the one who has to look good today right belk this was not an encouraging thing to say to a man at least eighty pounds overweight who broke out in flop sweat every time the judge looked at him what the hell do you mean you dont care everything is on the line today and you waltz in looking like you slept in your car and say you dont care im relaxed belk i call it zen and the art of not giving a shit why now bosch when i could have settled this for five figures two weeks ago because i realize now that there are things more important than what twelve of my socalled peers think even if as peers they wouldnt give me the time of day on the street belk looked at his watch and said leave me alone bosch we start in ten minutes and i want to be ready im still working on my argument im going to go shorter than even keyes demanded earlier in the trial the judge had determined that closing arguments would be no longer than a half hour for each side this was to be divided with the plaintiffin the person of chandlerarguing for twenty minutes followed by the defendants lawyerbelkdelivering his entire thirtyminute argument the plaintiff would then be allowed the last ten minutes chandler would have first and last word another sign bosch believed that the system was stacked against him bosch looked over at the plaintiffs table and saw deborah church sitting there by herself eyes focused straight ahead the two daughters were in the first row of the gallery behind her chandler was not there but there were files and yellow pads laid out on the table she was around you work on your speech he said to belk ill leave you alone dont be late coming back not again please as he had hoped chandler was outside smoking by the statue she gave him a cold glance said nothing and then took a few steps away from the ash can in order to ignore him she had on her blue suitit was probably her lucky suitand the one tress of blonde hair was loose from the braid at the back of her neck rehearsing bosch asked i dont need to rehearse this is the easy part i suppose whats that mean i dont know i suppose youre freer from the constraints of law during the arguments not as many rules of what you can and cant say i think thats when youd be in your element very perceptive that was all she said there was no indication that she knew her arrangement with edgar had been discovered bosch had been counting on that when he rehearsed what he was going to say to her after waking from his brief sleep he had looked at the events of the night before with a fresh mind and eyes and had seen something that was missed before it was now his intention to play her he had thrown her the soft pitch now he had a curve when this is over he said id like the note what note the note the follower sent you a look of shock hit her face but was then quickly erased with the indifferent look she normally gave him but she had not been quick enough he had seen the look in her eyes she sensed danger he knew then he had her its evidence he said i dont know what youre talking about detective bosch i need to get back inside she stubbed a halfsmoked cigarette with a lipstick print on the butt into the ash can then took two steps toward the door i know about edgar i saw you with him last night that stopped her she turned around and looked at him the hung jury a bloody mary at the bar she weighed her response and then said whatever he told you im sure it was designed to place him in the best light i would be careful if you are planning to go public with it im not going public with anything unless you dont give me the note withholding evidence of a crime is a crime in itself but i dont need to tell you that whatever edgar told you about a note is a lie i told him noth and he told me nothing about a note he didnt need to i figured it out you called him monday after the body was found because you already knew about it and knew it was connected to the dollmaker i wondered how and then it was clear we got a note but that was secret until the next day the only one who found out was bremmer but his story said you couldnt be reached for comment that was because you were out meeting edgar he said you called that afternoon asking about the body you asked if we got a note that was because you got a note counselor and i need to see it if it is different from the one we got it could be helpful she looked at her watch and quickly lit another cigarette i can get a warrant he said she laughed a fake sort of laugh id like to see you get a warrant id like to see the judge in this town who would sign a warrant allowing the lapd to search my house with this case in the papers every day judges are political animals detective nobodys going to sign a warrant and then possibly come out on the wrong end of this i was thinking more along the lines of your office but thanks for at least telling me where it is the look came back into her face for a split second she had slipped and maybe that was as big a shock to her as anything he had said she put the cigarette into the sand after two puffs tommy faraway would cherish it when he found it later we convene in one minute detective i dont know anything about a note understand nothing at all there is no note if you try to make any trouble over this i will make even more for you i havent told belk and im not going to i just want the note its got nothing to do with the case at trial thats easy for for me to say because i havent read it youre slipping counselor better be more careful than that she ignored that and went on to other business another thing if you think my uh arrangement with edgar is grounds for a mistrial motion or a misconduct complaint you will find that you are dead wrong edgar agreed to our relationship without any provocation he suggested it in fact if you make any complaint i will sue you for slander and send out press releases when i do it he doubted anything that happened was at edgars suggestion but let it go she gave him her best deadeyed killer look then opened the door and disappeared through it bosch finished his smoke hoping his play might at least knock her off speed a little bit during her closing argument but most of all he was pleased that he had gotten tacit confirmation of his theory the follower had sent her a note the silence that descended over the courtroom as chandler walked to the lectern was the kind of tensionfilled quiet that accompanies the moment before a verdict is read bosch felt that this was because the verdict was a foregone conclusion in many of the minds in the courtroom and chandlers words here would serve as his coup de gr√¢ce the final deadly blow she began with the perfunctory thankyous to the jury for their patience and close attention to the case she said she was fully confident that they would fairly deliberate a verdict in the trials bosch had attended as an investigator this was always stated by both lawyers to the jury and he always thought it was a crock most juries have members who are there simply to avoid going to work at the factory or office but once there the issues are either too complicated or scary or boring and they spend their days in the box just trying to stay awake between the breaks when they can fortify themselves with sugar caffeine and nicotine after that opening salutation chandler quickly got to the heart of the matter she said you will recall that on monday i stood before you and gave you the road map i told you what i would set out to prove what i needed to prove and now it is your job to decide if i have done that i think when you consider the weeks testimony you will have no doubt that i have and speaking of doubt the judge will instruct you but i would like to take a moment to explain to you once again that this is a civil matter it is not a criminal case it is not like perry mason or like anything else you have seen on tv or at the movies in a civil trial in order for you to find for the plaintiff it requires only that a preponderance of the evidence be in favor of the plaintiffs case a preponderance what does that mean it means the evidence for the plaintiffs case outweighs the evidence against it a majority it can be a simple majority just fifty percent plus one she spent a lot of time on this subject because this would be where the case was won or lost she had to take twelve legally inept peoplethis was guaranteed by the juror selection processand relieve them of mediaconditioned beliefs or perceptions that cases were decided by reasonable doubts or beyond the shadow of doubt that was for criminal cases this was civil in civil the defendant lost the edge he got in criminal think of it as a set of scales the scales of justice and each piece of evidence or testimony introduced has a certain weight depending on the validity you give it one side of the scales is the plaintiffs case and the other the defendants i think that when you have gone into the jury room to deliberate and have properly weighed the evidence of the case there will be no doubt that the scales are tipped in the plaintiffs favor if you find that is indeed the case then you must find for mrs church with the preliminaries out of the way bosch knew that she now had to finesse the rest because the plaintiff was essentially presenting a twopart case hoping to win at least one of them one being that maybe norman church was the dollmaker a monstrous serial killer but even if so boschs actions behind the badge were equally heinous and should not be forgiven the second part the one that would surely bring untold riches if the jury bought it was that norman church was an innocent and that bosch had cut him down in cold blood depriving his family of a loving husband and father the evidence presented this week points to two possible findings by you chandler told the jury and this will be the most difficult task you have to determine the level of detective boschs culpability without a doubt it is clear that he acted rashly recklessly and with wanton disregard for life and safety on the night norman church was killed his actions were inexcusable and a man paid for it with his life a family paid for it with its husband and father but you must look beyond that at the man who was killed the evidencefrom the videotape that is a clear alibi for one killing attributed to norman church if not all of them to the testimony of loved onesshould convince you that the police had the wrong man if not then detective boschs own acknowledgments on the witness stand make it clear that the killings did not stop that he killed the wrong man bosch saw that belk was scribbling on his pad hopefully he was making note of all the things about boschs testimony and others that chandler was conveniently leaving out of her argument lastly she was saying you must look beyond the man who was killed and look at the killer killer bosch thought it sounded so awful when applied to him he said the word over and over in his mind yes he had killed he had killed before and after church yet being called simply a killer without the explanations attached somehow seemed horrible in that moment he realized that he did care after all despite what he had said earlier to belk he wanted the jury to sanction what he had done he needed to be told he had done the right thing you have a man she said who has repeatedly shown the taste for blood a cowboy who killed before and since the episode with the unarmed mr church a man who shoots first and looks for evidence later you have a man with a deepseated motive for killing a man who he thought might be a serial killer of women of women from the street like his own mother she let that float out there for a while as she pretended to be checking a point or two in the notes on her pad when you go back into that room you will have to decide if this is the kind of police officer you want in your city the police force is supposed to mirror the society it protects its officers should exemplify the best in us ask yourself while you deliberate who does harry bosch exemplify what segment of our society does he present the mirror image of if the answers to those questions dont trouble you then return with a verdict in the defendants favor if they do trouble you if you think our society deserves better than the coldblooded killing of a potential suspect then you have no choice but to return a verdict finding for the plaintiff chandler paused here to go to the plaintiffs table and pour a glass of water belk leaned close to bosch and whispered not bad but ive seen her do better ive also seen her do worse the time she did worse bosch whispered back did she win belk looked down at his pad making the answer clear as chandler was returning to the lectern he leaned back to bosch this is her routine now shell talk about money after getting the water money always talks about money chandler cleared her throat and began again you twelve people are in a rare position you have the ability to make societal change not many people ever get that chance if you feel detective bosch was wrong to whatever degree and find for the plaintiff you will be making change because you will be sending a clear signal a message to every police officer in this city from the chief and the administrators inside parker center two blocks from here to every rookie patrol officer on the street the message will be that we do not want you to act this way we will not accept it now if you return such a verdict you must also set monetary damages this is not a complicated task the complicated part is the first part deciding whether detective bosch was right or wrong the damages can be anything from one dollar to one million dollars or more it doesnt matter what is important is the message for with the message you will bring justice for norman church you will bring justice to his family bosch looked around behind himself and saw bremmer in the gallery with the other reporters bremmer smiled slyly and bosch turned back around the reporter had been right on the money about money chandler walked back to the plaintiffs table picked up a book and took it back to the lectern it was old and without a dust jacket its green cloth binding cracking bosch thought he could see a mark probably a library stamp on the top edge of its pages in closing now she said i would like to address a concern you might have i know it is one i might have if i were in your place and that is how is it that we have come to have men like detective bosch as our police well i dont think we can hope to answer that and it is not at point in this case but if you recall i quoted to you the philosopher nietzsche at the beginning of the week i read his words about the black place he called the abyss to paraphrase him he said we must take care that whoever fights monsters for us does not also become a monster in todays society it is not hard to accept that there are monsters out there many of them and so it is not hard then to believe that a police officer could become a monster himself after we finished here yesterday i spent the evening at the library she glanced over at bosch as she said this flaunting the lie he stared back at her and refused the impulse to look away and id like to finish by reading something i found that nathaniel hawthorne wrote about the same subject we are dealing with today that chasm of darkness where it can be easy for a person to cross over to the wrong side in his bookthe marble faun hawthorne wrote the chasm was merely one of the orifices of that pit of blackness that lies beneath us everywhere ladies and gentlemen be careful in your deliberations and be true to yourselves thank you it was so quiet that bosch could hear her heels on the rug as she walked back to her seat folks judge keyes said were gonna take a fifteen minute break and then mr belk gets his turn as they were standing for the jury belk whispered i cant believe she used the word orifice in her closing argument bosch looked at him belk seemed gleeful but bosch recognized that he was just latching on to something anything so that he could pump himself up and get ready for his own turn behind the lectern for bosch knew that whatever words chandler had used she had been awfully good appraising the sweating fat man next to him he felt not one bit of confidence bosch went out to the justice statue and smoked two cigarettes during the break but honey chandler never came out tommy faraway swung by however and clicked his tongue approvingly when he found the nearly whole cigarette she had put in the ash can before he moved on without saying anything else it occurred to bosch that he had never seen tommy faraway smoke one of the stubs he culled from the sand belk surprised bosch with his closing it wasnt half bad it was just that he wasnt in the same league as chandler his closing was more a reaction to chandlers than a standalone treatise on boschs innocence and the unfairness of the accusations against him he said things like in all of ms chandlers talk about the two possible findings you can come up with she completely forgot about a third that being that detective bosch acted properly and wisely correctly it scored points for the defense but it was also a backhanded confirmation by the defense that there were two possible findings for the plaintiff belk did not see this but bosch did the assistant city attorney was giving the jury three choices now instead of two and still only one choice absolved bosch at times he wanted to pull belk back to the table and rewrite his script but he couldnt he had to hunker down as he had in the tunnels of vietnam when the bombs would be hitting above ground and hope that there were no caveins the middle of belks argument was largely centered on the evidence linking church to the nine murders he repeatedly hammered home that church was the monster in this story not bosch and the evidence clearly backed that up he warned the jurors that the fact that similar murders apparently continued was unrelated to what church had done and how bosch reacted in the apartment on hyperion he finally hit what bosch figured to be his stride near the end an inflection of true anger entered his voice when he criticized chandlers description of bosch as having acted recklessly and with wanton disregard for life the truth is that life was all detective bosch had on his mind when he went through that door his actions were predicated on the belief that another woman another victim was there detective bosch had only one choice that was to go through that door secure the situation and deal with the consequences norman church was killed when he refused repeated orders from a police officer and made the move to the pillow it was a hand he dealt not bosch and he paid the ultimate price but think of bosch in that situation can you imagine being there alone afraid it is a unique individual who faces that kind of situation without flinching it is what our society calls a hero i think when you return to the jury room and carefully weigh the facts not the accusations of this case you will come to that same conclusion thank you very much bosch couldnt believe belk had used the word hero in a closing argument but decided not to bring that up with the portly lawyer as he returned to the defense table instead he whispered you did good thanks chandler went to the lectern for her last shot and promised to be brief she was you can easily see the disparity of the beliefs the lawyers have in this case the same disparity between the meanings of the words hero and monster i suspect as we all probably do that the truth of this case and detective bosch is somewhere in between two last things before you begin deliberations first i want you to remember that both sides had the opportunity here to present full and complete cases in norman churchs behalf we had a wife a coworker a friend stand up and testify to his character to what kind of man he was yet the defense chose to have only one witness testify before you detective bosch no one else stood up for detective objection belk yelled bosch hold it right there ms chandler judge keyes boomed the judges face became very red as he thought about how to proceed i should clear the jury out of here to do what i am going to do but i think if youre going to play with fire you have to accept the burns ms chandler im holding you in contempt of this court for that grievous display of poor judgment well talk about sanctions at a later date but i guarantee that it wont be a pleasant date to look forward to the judge then swiveled in his chair toward the jury and leaned forward folks this lady should never have said that you see the defense is not obligated to put anybody up as a witness and whether they do or dont that cannot be seen as a reflection on their guilt or innocence on the matter before you ms chandler darn well knew this shes an experienced trial lawyer and you better believe she knew this the fact that she went and said it anyway knowing mr belk over there and myself would practically hit the ceiling i think shows a cunning on her behalf that i find very distasteful and troubling in a court of law im going to complain about that to the state law board but your honor chandler cut in i object to you tell dont interrupt counselor you stand there and keep quiet until i am through yes your honor i said keep quiet he turned back to the jury as i was saying what happens to ms chandler is not for you to worry about see shes taking a gamble that no matter what i say to you now you will still think about what she said about detective bosch not bringing any supporters to testify i tell you now with the sternest admonition i can offer do not think about that what she said means nothing in fact i suspect that if he wanted to detective bosch and mr belk could muster a line of police officers ready to testify that would stretch out that door all the way to parker center if they thought they wanted it but they dont thats the strategy they chose and it is not your duty to question it in any way any way at all any questions no one in the jury box even moved the judge turned his chair back and looked at belk anything you want to say mr belk one moment your honor belk turned to bosch and whispered what do you think hes primed to grant a mistrial ive never seen him so mad wed get a new trial maybe by then this copycat thing will be wrapped up bosch thought a moment he wanted this over and did not like the prospect of going through another trial with chandler mr belk the judge said i think we go with what weve got bosch whispered what do you think belk nodded and said i think he might have just given us the verdict then he stood in his place and said nothing at this time your honor you sure now yes your honor okay ms chandler like i said well deal with this at a later time but we will deal with it you can proceed now but be very careful your honor thank you i want to say before going on that i apologize for my line of argument i meant no disrespect to you i uh was speaking extemporaneously and got carried away you did apology accepted but we will still deal with the contempt order later lets proceed i want the jury to begin their work right after lunch chandler adjusted her position at the lectern so that she was looking at the jury ladies and gentlemen you heard detective bosch on the stand yourself i ask you lastly to remember what he said he said norman church got what he deserved think about that statement coming from a police officer and what it means norman church got what he deserved we have seen in this courtroom how the justice system works the checks and balances the judge to referee the jury to decide by his own admission detective bosch decided that was not necessary he decided there was no need for a judge no need for a jury he robbed norman church of his chance for justice and so ultimately he robbed you think about that she picked her yellow pad up off the lectern and sat down the jury began its deliberations at and judge keyes ordered the federal marshals to arrange for lunch to be sent in he said the twelve would not be interrupted until unless they came up with a verdict first after the jury had filed out the judge ordered that all parties be able to appear for a reading of the verdict within fifteen minutes of notification by the clerk that meant chandler and belk could go back to their respective offices to wait norman churchs family was from burbank so the wife and two daughters opted to go to chandlers office for bosch the hollywood station would have been more than a fifteenminute commute but parker center was a fiveminute walk he gave the clerk his pager number and told her hed be there the last piece of business the judge brought up was the contempt order against chandler he set a hearing for it to be discussed for two weeks later and then banged his gavel down before leaving the courtroom belk took bosch aside and said i think were in pretty good shape but im nervous you want to spin the dice what are you talking about i could try to lowball chandler one last time offer to settle yeah i have carte blanche from the office for anything up to fifty after that id have to get approval but i could throw the fifty at her and see if theyd take it to walk away now what about legal fees on a settlement shed have to take the cut from the fifty someone like her shes probably going forty percent thatd be twenty grand for a week in trial and a week picking a jury not bad you think were going to lose i dont know im just thinking of all the angles you never know what a jury will do fifty grand would be a cheap way out she might take it the way the judge came down on her there at the end shes the one whos probably scared of losing now belk didnt get it bosch knew maybe it had been too subtle for him the whole contempt thing had been chandlers last scam she had purposely committed the infraction so the jury would see her being slapped down by the judge she was showing them the justice system at work a bad deed met with stern enforcement and punishment she was saying to them do you see this is what bosch escaped this is what norman church faced but bosch decided to take the judge and jurys role instead it was clever maybe too clever the more bosch thought about it the more he wondered how much the judge had been a willing and knowing player in it he looked at belk and saw the young assistant city attorney apparently suspected none of this instead he thought of it as a stroke on his side of the page probably in two weeks when keyes lets her go with a hundreddollar fine and a lecture during the contempt hearing hell get it you can do whatever you want he told belk but she isnt going to take it shes in on this one until the end at parker center bosch went into irvings conference room through the door that opened directly off the hallway irving had decided the day before that the nowcalled follower task force would work out of the conference room so the assistant chief could be kept up on developments to the minute what wasnt said about the move but was known was that keeping the group out of one of the squad rooms improved the chance that word of what was happening would remain securefor at least a few days when bosch walked in only rollenberger and edgar were in the room bosch noticed that four phones had been installed and were on the round meeting table there were also six roversmotorola twoway radiosand a main communications console on the table ready to be used as needed when edgar looked up and saw bosch he immediately looked away and picked up a phone to make a call bosch rollenberger said welcome to our operations center are you free from the trial no smoking in here by the way im free until a verdict but ive got a fifteenminute leash on me anything going on whats mora doing not much is happening been quiet mora spent the morning in the valley went to an attorneys office in sherman oaks and then to a couple of casting agencies also in sherman oaks rollenberger was looking at a logbook in front of him on the table after that he went to a couple houses in studio city there were vans outside of these houses and sheehan and opelt said they thought they might be making movies at these locations he didnt stay long at either place anyway hes back over at advice now sheehan called in a couple minutes ago did we get the extra people yeah mayfield and yde will take the watch at four from the first team then weve got two other teams after that two chief irving changed his mind and wants an aroundtheclock watch so well be on him through the night even if he just stays at home and sleeps personally i think its a good idea that we go round the clock yeah especially since irving decided to do it bosch thought but didnt say he looked at the radios on the table whats our freek uh were on frequency frequencyoh yeah were on five symplex five its a dwp communications freek that they only use during a public emergency earthquake flooding stuff like that chief thought it be best to keep off our own freeks if mora is our man then he might be keeping an ear to the radio bosch thought rollenberger probably thought it was a good idea but didnt ask him i think its a good idea to play it safe this way the lieutenant said right anything else i should know he looked at edgar who was still on the phone whats edgar got still trying to locate the survivor from four years ago he already pulled a copy of moras divorce file it was uncontested edgar hung up finished writing something in a notebook and then stood up without looking at bosch he said im going down to get a cup okay rollenberger said we should have our own coffeemaker in here by this afternoon i talked it over with the chief and he was going to requisition one bosch said good idea i think im going down with edgar edgar walked quickly down the hallway so that he could stay ahead of bosch at the elevator he pushed the button but then without breaking stride walked past the elevator and into the stairwell to go down bosch followed and after they had gone down one floor edgar stopped and whipped around what are you following me for coffee oh bullshit did no i didnt talk to pounds yet ive been busy remember good then dont what are you talking about if you havent talked to pounds about it then dont forget about it serious yeah he stood there looking at bosch still skeptical learn from it so will i i already have okay thanks harry no dont thanks harry me just say okay okay they walked down to the next floor and to the cafeteria rather than sit in front of rollenberger and talk bosch suggested they take their coffee to one of the tables hans off what a trip man edgar said i keep picturing this cuckoo clock only its him that comes out and says great idea chief great idea chief bosch smiled and edgar laughed harry could tell a great burden had been lifted off the man and so he was heartened by what he had done he felt good about it so nothing on the survivor yet he said shes out there somewhere but the four years since she escaped from the follower have not been good to georgia stern what happened well by reading her sheet and talking to some guys in street vice it looks like she got on the needle after that she probably got too skaggylooking to make movies i mean who wants to watch a film like that and the girls got track marks up her arms or her thighs or her neck thats the problem with the porno business if youre a hype youre naked man you cant hide that shit anyway i talked to mora just to make a routine contact and to tell him i was looking for her he kinda gave me that rundown on how needle marks are the quickest way out of the business but he had nothing else you think that was cool talking to him bosch considered it a few moments and then said yeah i do best way to keep him from being suspicious is to act like he knows as much as we do if you hadnt asked him and then he heard from a source or somebody else in vice that you were looking for her then hed probably tumble to us yeah thats the way i figured it so i called him this morning and asked a few questions and then went on far as he knows you and me are the only ones working this new case he doesnt know anything about our task force so far only problem with asking him about the survivor is that if he knows youre looking he may go looking for her well have to be careful about that let the surveillance teams know yeah i will maybe hans off can tell em you ought to hear this guy on the rovers sounds like a fuckin eagle scout bosch smiled he imagined hans off cut no slack in the use of radio code designations anyway so thats why she isnt in the porno biz anymore edgar said getting back to the survivor in the last three years we got check charges a couple of possessions a couple prostitution rousts and many many undertheinfluence beefs shes been in and out always time served never anything serious two three days at a time not enough to help her kick either so wheres she work the valley ive been on the phone with valley vice all morning they say she usually works the sepulveda corridor with the other street pros bosch remembered the young women he had seen the other afternoon while tracing down cerrone rebecca kaminskis managerpimp he wondered if he had seen or even talked to georgia stern and not known it what is it nothing i was out there the other day and was wondering if id seen her you know not knowing who she was did the vice guys say whether she had protection nah no pimp that they know of i got the idea shes bottom drawer stuff most pimps have better ponies so is vice up there looking for her not yet edgar said they have training today but theyll be out on sepulveda tomorrow night any recent photos yeah edgar reached into his sport coat and pulled out a stack of photos they were copies of a booking photo georgia stern certainly looked used up her bleachedblonde hair showed at least an inch of dark roots there were circles under her eyes so deep they looked as though they had been cut into her face with a knife her cheeks were gaunt and she was glassyeyed lucky for her she had fixed before she was busted it meant less time in the cage hurting waiting and craving the next fix this is three months old under the influence she did two in sybil and out sybil brand institute was the countys holding jail for women half of it was equipped to handle narcotics addicts get this edgar said i forgot about this this guy dean up in valley vice says he was the one who made this bust on her and when he was booking her he found a bottle of powder and was just about ready to run her ticket up to possession when he realized the bottle was a legit scrip he said the powder was azt you know for aids shes got the virus man and shes out there on the street on sepulveda he asked her if she makes em use rubbers and her answer was not if they dont want to bosch just nodded the story was not unusual it had been boschs experience that most prostitutes despised the men they waved down and serviced for money those who became sick got it either from their customers or from dirty needles which also sometimes came from customers either way he believed it was part of the psychology to not care about passing it on to the population that may have given it to you it was the belief that what goes around comes around not if they dont want to edgar said again shaking his head i mean man thats cold bosch finished his coffee and pushed his chair back there was no smoking in the cafeteria so he wanted to go down to the lobby and out by the fallenofficers memorial to smoke as long as rollenberger was camped out in the conference room smoking there was out so boschs pager went off and he visibly flinched he had always subscribed to the theory that a quick verdict was a bad verdict was a stupid verdict hadnt they given the evidence careful consideration he pulled it off his belt and looked at the number on the display he breathed easier it was an lapd exchange i think mora is calling me better be careful what were you going to say uh oh yeah i was just wondering if stern will be any good to us if we find her its been four years shes on the spike and sick i wonder if shell even remember the follower yeah i was thinking that too but my only alternatives are to go back to hollywood and report to pounds or volunteer for one of the surveillance shifts on mora im sticking on this im going up there to sepulveda tonight bosch nodded hans off said you pulled the divorce nothing there not really she filed but then mora didnt contest it files about ten pages thats it only one thing of note in it and i dont know if it means anything or not what she filed on the usual grounds irreconcilable differences mental cruelty but in the records she also mentions the loss of consortium you know what that is no sex yeah what do you think that means bosch thought for a few moments and said i dont know they split just before the dollmaker stuff maybe he was into some strange stuff building up to the killings i can ask locke yeah thats what i was thinking anyway i had dmv run the wife and shes still alive but i was thinking we shouldnt approach her too dangerous she might tip him yeah dont go near her did dmv fax her dl yeah shes blonde fivefootfour hundred and ten it was only a face shot on the drivers license but id say she fits bosch nodded and stood up after taking one of the rovers from the conference room bosch drove over to central division and parked in the back lot he was still within the fifteenminute radius of the federal courthouse he left the rover in the car and walked out to the sidewalk and around front to the public entrance he did this so he could see if he could spot sheehan and opelt he assumed they would have to be parked within sight of the lots exit so they would see mora leaving but he did not see them or any car that looked suspicious a pair of headlights briefly flashed from a parking lot behind an old gas station that was now a taco stand featuring a sign that said home of the kosher burritopastrami he saw two figures in the car which was a gray eldorado and just looked away mora was at his desk eating a burrito that looked disgusting to bosch because he could see it was filled with pastrami it looked unnatural harry he said with his mouth full how is it its okay ill go back to plain beef after this i just tried it cause i saw a couple guys from rhd over across the street one of em said they come all the way over from parker to get these kosher things there thought id give it a try yeah i think ive heard of that place well you ask me it aint worth coming over from parker center for he wrapped what was left in the oilstained paper it came in and then got up and walked out of the squad room bosch heard the package hit the bottom of a trash can in the hallway and then mora was back dont want it to stink up my trash can so you buzzed yeah that was me hows the trial waiting on a verdict shit thats scary bosch knew from experience that if mora wanted to tell you something he would tell you in his own time it would do him no good to keep asking the vice cop why he beeped him back in his chair mora swiveled around to the filing cabinets behind him and began opening drawers over his shoulder he said hang on harry i gotta get some stuff together for you here it took him two minutes during which bosch saw him open several different files take out photos and create a short stack then he turned back around four he said ive come up with four more actresses that dropped out under what might be termed suspicious circumstances only four yeah actually there were more than four chicks that people mentioned but only four fit that profile we talked about blonde and built there is also gallery who we already knew about and your concrete blonde so weve got six altogether here are the new ones he handed the group of photos across the desk to bosch harry slowly looked through them they were color publicity glossies with each womans name printed in the white border at the bottom of the photo two of the women were naked and posing indoors on chairs their legs apart the other two were photographed at the beach and were wearing bikinis that would probably be illegal on most public beaches to bosch the women in the photos almost looked interchangeable their bodies were similar their faces had the same fake pouts that were intended to show mystery and sexual abandonment at the same time each of the women had hair so blonde it was nearly white all snow whites mora said an unneeded commentary that made bosch look up from the photos to look at him the vice cop just stared back and said you know the hair thats what a producer calls them when hes casting movies he says he wants a snow white for this part cause he already has a red or whatever snow white its like the model name these chicks are all interchangeable bosch looked back down at the photos not trusting that his eyes would not give his suspicions away he realized though that much of what mora had just said was true the main physical differences between the women in the photos were the tattoos and their locations on each body each woman had a small tattoo of a heart or a rose or a cartoon character candi cummings had a heart just to the left of her carefully trimmed triangle of pubic hair mood indigo had some kind of cartoon just above her left ankle but bosch couldnt make it out because of the angle the photograph had been taken from dee anne dozit had a heart wrapped in a vine of barbed wire about six inches above the left nipple which was pierced with a gold ring and texxxas rose had a red rose on the soft part of her right hand between the thumb and first finger bosch realized they might all be dead now no ones heard from them no one in the biz at least youre right physically they fit yeah they did outcall i assume they did but im not sure yet the people i talked to dealt with them in the film biz so they didnt know what these girls did when the cameras stopped rolling so to speak or so they said my next step was to get some back issues of the sex rags and look for ads any dates you know when they disappeared stuff like that just generally speaking these people the agents and the moviemakers they dont have minds for dates were dealing with memories so ive only got a general picture if i find out they ran outcall ads ill narrow it down pretty close to exact dates when i find out when they last ran anyway let me give you what i got you got your notebook mora told him what he had no specific dates just months and years adding in the approximate dates when rebecca kaminski the concrete blonde constance calvin who became gallery on film and the seventh and eleventh victims originally attributed to church had disappeared there was a rough pattern of disappearances of the porno starlets about every six to seven months the last disappearance was mood indigo eight months earlier see the pattern hes due hes out there hunting bosch nodded and looked up from his notebook at mora and thought he saw a gleam in his dark eyes he thought he could see through them into a black emptiness inside in that one chilling moment bosch thought he saw the confirmation of evil in the other man it was as if mora was challenging him to come farther into the dark with him bosch knew he was stretching his leash by going down to usc but it was two oclock and his choice was to hang around the conference room with rollenberger and wait for a verdict or do something useful with his time he decided on the latter and got on the harbor freeway going south depending on how northbound traffic on the freeway was he could conceivably get back to downtown in fifteen minutes if a verdict came in getting a parking space at parker center and walking over to the courthouse would be another matter the university of southern california was located in the tough neighborhoods that surround the coliseum but once through the gate and into the general campus it seemed as bucolic as catalina though bosch knew this peace had been interrupted with a quickening frequency in recent years to the point that even trojan football practice could be dangerous a couple of seasons back a stray bullet from one of the daily driveby shootings in the nearby neighborhoods had struck a gifted freshman linebacker while he stood with teammates on the practice field it was incidents like that that had administrators complaining on a routine basis to the lapd and students longingly thinking about ucla which was cheaper and located in the relatively crimefree suburban milieu of westwood bosch easily found the psychology building with a map given to him at the entry gate but once he was inside the fourstory brick building there was no directory to help him find dr john locke or the psychohormonal studies lab he walked down one lengthy hallway and then took stairs to the second floor the first female student he asked for directions to the lab laughed apparently believing his question was a comeon and walked away without answering he finally was directed to the basement of the building he read the signs on the doors as he walked along the dimly lit corridor and finally found the lab at the secondtolast doorway at the end of the hall a blonde student sat behind a desk in the entry she was reading a thick textbook she looked up and smiled and bosch asked for locke ill call does he expect you you never know with a shrink he smiled but she didnt get it then he wondered if it was even a joke no i didnt say i was coming well dr locke has student labs running all day i shouldnt disturb him if she finally looked up and saw the badge he was holding ill call right away just tell him its bosch and i need a few minutes if he can spare them she spoke briefly on the phone to someone reiterating what bosch had just said she then waited silently for a few moments said okay and hung up the grad assistant said dr locke said he will come get you it should only be a few minutes he thanked her and sat in one of the chairs by the door he looked around the entry room there was a bulletin board with handprinted announcements pinned to the cork mostly they were the roommatewanted type of posting there was an announcement of a party for psych undergrads this coming saturday there was one other desk in the room in addition to the one the student occupied but this one was empty at the moment this part of the curriculum he asked you have to put in time here as the receptionist she looked up from the textbook no its just a job im in child psych but jobs in the lab there are hard to come by nobody likes working down here in the basement so this was open how come all the creepy psychology is down here psychohormonal at this end there is the door opened on the other side of the room and locke stepped through he was wearing blue jeans and a tiedyed tshirt he stuck his hand out to bosch and harry noticed the leather thong tied around his wrist harry how goes it fine im fine howre you im sorry to barge in on you like this but i was wondering if you have a few minutes i have some new information on that thing i bothered you with the other night no bother at all believe me its great to get my fingers on a real case student labs can be boring he told bosch to follow him and they went back through the door down a hallway and into a suite of offices locke led him to the room in the back which was his office rows of textbooks and what bosch guessed were collected theses lined shelves on the wall behind his desk locke dropped into a padded chair and put a foot up on the desk a green bankers light on the table was lit and the only other light came from a small casement window set high on the wall to the right every now and then the light from the window would flicker as someone up on the ground level walked by and briefly blocked its path a human eclipse looking up at the window locke said sometimes i feel like im working in a dungeon down here i think the student out front thinks so too melissa well what do you expect shes chosen child psychology as her major and i cant seem to convince her to cross to my side of the road anyway i doubt you came to campus to hear stories about pretty young students though i dont suppose it could hurt maybe some other time bosch could smell that someone had smoked in the room though he saw no ashtray he took his cigarettes out without asking you know harry i could hypnotize you and alleviate that problem for you no thanks doc i hypnotized myself once and it didnt work really are you one of the last of the dying breed of lapd hypnotists i heard about that experiment courts shot it down right yeah wouldnt accept hypnotized witnesses in court im the last one they taught whos still in the department i think interesting anyway thereve been some developments since we last talked and i thought it would be good to touch base with you see what you think i think you steered us right with that porno angle and maybe youll come up with something now what have you got we have first off do you want some coffee are you having any never touch it then im fine weve come up with a suspect really he dropped his foot off the desk and leaned forward he seemed genuinely interested and he had a foot in both camps like you said he was on the task force and his beat uh his area of expertise is the pornography business i dont think i should identify him at this time because of course not i understand hes a suspect hasnt been charged with anything detective dont worry this entire conversation is off the record speak freely bosch used a trash can next to lockes desk as an ashtray i appreciate it so we are watching him seeing what he is doing but it gets tricky here see because he is probably the departments top man on the porno industry it is natural we go to him for advice and information naturally if you didnt he would most assuredly become suspicious of the fact that you are suspicious of him oh what a wonderful web we weave harry tangled what nothing locke got up and started pacing around the room he put his hands in his pockets and then took them out he was staring at nothing just thinking the whole time go on this is great whatd i tell you two independent actors playing the same role the black heart does not beat alone go on well like i said it was natural to go to him and we did we suspected that with the discovery of the body this week and what you said that there might be others other women who disappeared who were in that business so you asked him to check it out excellent yes i asked him yesterday and today he gave me four more names we already had the name of the concrete blonde found this week and one other that the suspect provided the other day so you add the first twodollmaker victims seven and elevenand now we have a total of eight the suspect was under surveillance all day so we know he did the legwork needed to come up with these new names he didnt just give me four names he went through the motions of course he would do that he would keep up the appearance of normal routine life whether he knew he was being followed or not he would already know these names you understand but he would still go out and get them by doing the routine legwork its one of the signs of how smart he he stopped put his hands in his pockets and frowned while seemingly staring at the floor between his feet you said six new names plus the first two right eight kills in almost five years any chance there are others i was going to ask you that this information comes from the suspect would he lie would he tell us less give us fewer names than there actually were to screw with us to mess up the investigation ah he continued pacing but didnt continue speaking for a half minute my gut instinct is to say no no he would not screw with you as you say he would do his job in earnest i think if all he has given you are five new names then thats all there are you have to remember that this man thinks he is superior to you the police in every aspect it would not be unusual for him to be perfectly honest with you about some aspects of the case we have a rough idea of the times the times of the killings what it looks like is that he slowed his pace after the dollmaker was killed when he started hiding them burying them because he couldnt blend in any longer with the dollmaker the intervals lengthened it looks like he went from less than two months between kills during the dollmaker period to seven months maybe even longer the last disappearance was almost eight months ago locke looked up from the floor at bosch and all this recent activity he said the trial in the papers his sending the note his involvement as a detective in the case the high activity will speed the end of the cycle dont lose him harry it could be time he turned and looked at the calendar that hung on the wall next to the door there was some kind of mazelike design above the chart of the months days locke started laughing bosch didnt get it what he asked jeez this weekend is a full moon too he spun around to look at bosch can you take me on the surveillance what take me along it would be the rarest of opportunities in the field of psychosexual studies to observe the stalking pattern of a sexual sadist as it is actually taking place unbelievable harry this could get me a grant from hopkins it could it couldhis eyes lit up as he looked at the casement windowget me out of this fucking dungeon bosch stood up he was thinking he had made a mistake lockes vision of his own future was obscuring everything else he had come for help not to make locke shrink of the year look were talking about a killer here real people real blood im not going to do anything that might compromise the investigation a surveillance is a delicate operation when you add that it is a cop we are watching then it makes it even harder i cant bring you along dont even ask i can tell you things here and fill you in whenever i can but there is no way i or my commander on this would approve bringing a civilian along for the ride lockes eyes dropped and he looked like a chastised boy he took a quick glance at the window again and walked around behind the desk he sat down and his shoulders dropped yes of course he said quietly i completely understand harry i got carried away there the important thing is that we stop this man well worry about studying him later now a sevenmonth cycle wow thats impressive bosch flicked his ashes and sat back down well we dont know for sure considering the source there still could be others i doubt it locke pinched the bridge of his nose and leaned back in his chair he closed his eyes he did not move for several seconds harry im not sleeping just concentrating just thinking bosch watched him for a few moments it was weird he then noticed that lined on a shelf just above lockes head were the books the psychologist had written there were several all with his name on the spine there were several duplicates too maybe bosch thought so he could give them away he saw five copies ofblack hearts the book locke had mentioned during his testimony and three copies of a book calledthe private sex life of the public porn princess you wrote about the porno business he opened his eyes why yes that was the book i did beforeblack hearts did you read it uh no he closed his eyes again of course not despite the sexy title it really is a textbook used at the university level last i checked with my publisher it was being sold in the bookstores at a hundred and fortysix universities including hopkins its been out two years fourth printing still havent seen a royalty check would you like to read it i would well if you go by the student union on your way out of here they sell it there its steep i should warn you thirty bucks but im sure you can expense it i should also warn you its quite explicit bosch was annoyed that locke didnt give him one of the extra copies on the shelf perhaps it was lockes childlike way of getting back at him for nixing the surveillance ridealong he wondered what melissa the childpsych major would make of such behavior there is something else about this suspect i dont know what it means locke opened his eyes but didnt move he was divorced about a year before the dollmaker killings began in the divorce record theres mention by the wife that there was a loss of consortium would that still fit they stopped doing it huh i guess it was in the court file it could fit but to be honest we shrinks could find a way to make any activity fit into any prognosis we make thats the field for you but it could be a case where your suspect simply became impotent with his wife he was moving toward the erotic mold and she had no part in it in effect he was leaving her behind so it is not seen by you to be a cause for rethinking our suspicions of this man on the contrary my view is that it is more evidence that he has gone through major psychological changes his sexual persona is evolving bosch gave this some thought while trying to envision mora the vice cop spent every day in the tawdry milieu of pornography after a while he couldnt get it up for his own wife is there anything else you can tell me anything about this suspect that might help us we dont have anything on him no probable cause we cant arrest him all we can do is watch and that gets dangerous if we lose him he could kill right and then you are still left with no probable cause no evidence what about trophies what do i look for where in his home ah i see you plan to continue your professional interaction with him to visit him at home on a ruse perhaps but you wont be able to move about freely i might be able to if someone else keeps him occupied ill go with somebody else locke leaned forward in his chair his eyes wide it was starting again his excitement what if you kept him busy and i had a look around i am the expert on this harry you would be better at keeping him busy you could talk detective talk id ask to use the bathroom i would have a better grasp of forget it dr locke listen to me there is no way its going to happen that way okay its too dangerous now do you want to help me here or not okay okay again im sorry the reason i am so excited by the prospect of being inside this mans house and mind is that i think that this man who is on a killing cycle of seven months plus would almost certainly have trophies that would help him feed into his fantasy and recreate his kills thereby dulling urges to physically act out i understand youve got a man with an unusually long cycle believe me during those seven months the impulses to act out to go out and kill do not lie dormant they are there they are always there remember the erotic mold i testified about it i remember okay well he is going to need to satisfy that erotic mold to fulfill it how does he do it how does he last six or seven or eight months the answer is he has trophies these are reminders of past conquests by conquests i mean kills he has things that remind him and help bring the fantasy alive its not the real thing by a long shot but he can still use the reminders to widen the cycle to stave off the impulse to act he knows the less he kills the less chance there is that he will be caught if youre right about him he is now nearly eight months into a cycle it means he is pushing the edge of the envelope all the while trying to maintain his control yet at the same time we have this note and his strange compulsion to not be overlooked to stand up and say im better than the dollmaker i go on and if you dont believe me check out what i left in the concrete at such and such a place the note shows severe disassembling at the same time he is locked in this tremendous battle to control the impulses he has gone seven months plus bosch pressed his cigarette against the side of the trash can and dropped it in he took out his notebook he said the clothing of the victims both the dollmakers and the followers was never found these could be the trophies he uses they could be but put the notebook away harry its easier than that remember what you have here is a man who chose his victims after seeing them in videos so what better way to keep his fantasies alive than through videos if you get free of him in the house look for videos harry and a camera he videotaped the killings bosch said it wasnt a question he was just repeating locke preparing himself for what was ahead with mora of course we cant say for sure locke said who knows but id put my money on it you remember westley dodd bosch shook his head no he was the one they executed a couple of years ago in washington hanged hima perfect example of what goes around comes around he was a childkiller liked to hang kids in his closet on coat hangers and he also had a polaroid camera he liked to use after his arrest the police found a carefully kept photo album complete with polaroids of the little boys he killedhanging in the closet he had taken the time to carefully label each picture with a caption very sick stuff but as sick as it was i guarantee you that that photo album saved the lives of other little boys absolutely because he could use it to indulge his fantasy and not act it out bosch nodded his understanding somewhere in moras house he would find a video or maybe a photographic gallery that would turn most peoples stomachs but for mora it was what kept him out of the black place for as long as eight months at a time what about jeffrey dahmer locke said remember him in milwaukee he was a cameraman too liked taking pictures of corpses parts of corpses helped him go undetected by the police for years and years then he started keeping the corpses that was his mistake they were silent for a few moments after that boschs head filled with horrible images of the dead he had seen he rubbed his eyes as if that might erase them whats that they say about photos locke asked then on the tv commercials something like the gift that keeps on giving then whats that make videotape to a serial killer before leaving campus bosch dropped by the student union and went into the bookstore he found a stack of copies of lockes book on the porno business in the section on psychology and social studies the top one on the stack was well worn around the edges from being thumbed through bosch took the one below it when the girl at the register opened the book to get the price it flopped open to a blackandwhite photo of a woman performing fellatio on a man the girls face turned red but not as scarlet as boschs sorry was all he could think to say thats okay ive seen it before the book i mean yeah are you teaching a class with it next semester bosch realized that since he was too old to look like a student seemingly the only valid reason for him to be buying the book was if he was a teacher he thought that explaining that his interest was as a police officer would sound phony and get him more attention than he wanted yes he lied really whats it called maybe ill take it uh well i havent decided yet im still formulating a well whats your name ill look for it in the catalog uh locke dr john locke psychology oh you wrote the book yeah ive heard of you ill look the class up thanks and have a good day she gave him his change he thanked her and left with the book in a bag bosch was back in the federal courthouse shortly after four while they waited for judge keyes to come out and dismiss the jury for the weekend belk whispered that he had called chandlers office during the afternoon and offered the plaintiff fifty grand to walk away from the case she told you to shove it she wasnt that polite actually bosch smiled and looked over at chandler she was whispering something to churchs wife but must have felt boschs stare she stopped speaking and looked over at him for nearly half a minute they engaged in an adolescent staredown contest with neither backing down until the door to the judges chambers opened and judge keyes bounded out and up to his place on the bench he had the clerk buzz in the jury he asked if there was anything anybody needed to talk about and when there wasnt he instructed the jurors to avoid reading newspaper accounts of the case or watching the local tv news he then ordered the jurors and all other parties to the case to be back by am monday when deliberations would begin again bosch stepped on the escalator right behind chandler to go down to the lobby exit she was standing about two steps up from deborah church counselor he said in a low voice so the widow would not hear chandler turned around on the step grabbing the handrail for balance the jury is out there is nothing that can change the case now he said norman church himself could be waiting for us in the lobby and we wouldnt be able to tell the jury so why dont you give me the note this case might be over but there is still an investigation chandler said nothing the rest of the way down but in the lobby she told deborah church to go on out to the sidewalk and shed be along soon then she turned to bosch again i deny there is a note okay bosch smiled were already past that remember you slipped up yesterday you said i dont care what i said or you said look if the guy sent me a note it wouldve just been a copy of what you already got he wouldnt waste his time writing a new one i appreciate you at least telling me that but even a copy could be helpful there could be fingerprints the copy paper might be traceable detective bosch how many times did you pull prints from the other letters he sent bosch didnt answer thats what i figured she said have a good weekend she turned and pushed her way through the exit door bosch waited a few seconds put a cigarette in his mouth and went out himself sheehan and opelt were in the conference room filling in rollenberger on their surveillance shift edgar was also sitting at the round table listening bosch saw he had a photo of mora on the table in front of him it was a face shot like the one the department takes of every cop every year when they reissue id cards if it happens its not going to happen during the day anyway sheehan was saying so maybe tonight theyll have good luck all right rollenberger said just type something up for the chron log and you guys can call it a day ill need it because i have a briefing with chief irving at five but remember youre both on call tonight its going to be all hands if mora starts acting hinky i want you to get back out there with mayfield and yde right opelt said while opelt sat down at the lone typewriter rollenberger had requisitioned sheehan poured them cups of coffee from the mr coffee that had appeared on the counter behind the round table sometime during the afternoon hans off wasnt much of a cop but he could sure set up an ops center bosch thought he poured himself a cup and joined sheehan and edgar at the table i missed most of that he said to sheehan sounds like nothing happened right after you dropped by he went back out to the valley in the afternoon and stopped by a bunch of different offices and warehouses in canoga park and northridge weve got the addresses if you want em they were all porno distributors never stayed more than a half hour at any of them but we dont know what he was doing then he came back did a little office work and went home bosch assumed mora was checking with other producers trying to hunt down more victims maybe asking about the mystery man gallery had described four years ago he asked sheehan where mora lived and wrote down the sierra bonita avenue address in his notebook he wanted to warn sheehan about how close he had come to blowing the operation at the taco stand but didnt want to do so in front of rollenberger hed mention it later anything new he asked edgar nothing on the survivor yet edgar answered im leaving in five minutes to go up to sepulveda the girls do a lot of rushhour work up there maybe ill see her pick her up having gotten the updates from everyone else bosch told the detectives in the room about the information he had gotten from mora and what locke thought of it at the end rollenberger whistled at the information as if it were a beautiful woman man the chief should know this pronto he might want to double up on the surveillance moras a cop bosch said the more bodies you put on the watch the better chance he has of making them if he knows were watching him you can forget the whole thing rollenberger thought about this and nodded but said well we still have to let the man know whats developing tell you what nobody go anywhere for a few minutes ill see if i can get with him a little early and well see where we go from there he stood up with some papers in his hand and knocked on the door leading to irvings office he then opened it and disappeared through dipshit sheehan said after the door was closed goin in for a little mouthtoass resuscitation everybody laughed hey you two bosch said to sheehan and opelt mora mentioned your little meeting at the taco stand shit opelt exclaimed i think he bought the kosher burrito line bosch said and started laughing until he tasted one he couldnt get why you guysd come all the way over from parker for one of those shitty things he threw half of his out so if he sees you again out there hell put it together watch your ass we will sheehan said that was opelts idea that kosher burrito shit he what whatd you want me to say the guy were watching suddenly walks up to the car and says whats happening boys i had to think of the door opened and rollenberger came back in he went to his place but didnt sit down instead he put both hands on the table and sternly leaned forward as if he had just been given orders from god ive brought the chief up to date hes very pleased with everything weve come up with in just twentyfour hours he is concerned about losing mora especially with the shrink saying we are at the end of the cycle but he doesnt want to change the surveillance adding another team doubles the chance mora will see something i think hes right its a very good idea to maintain status quo we edgar tried to hold back a laugh but couldnt it sounded more like a sneeze detective edgar something funny no i think im getting a cold or something go on please well thats it proceed as planned i will inform the other surveillance teams of what bosch has come up with we have rector and heikes taking the midnight shift then the presidents tomorrow morning at eight the presidents were a pair of rhd partners named johnson and nixon they didnt like being called the presidents especially nixon sheehan opelt you are back on tomorrow at four youve got saturday night so be bright bosch edgar still freelancing see what you can come up with keep your pagers on and the rovers handy we might need to pull everybody together on short notice ot approved edgar asked all weekend but if youre on the clock i want to see the work only humps on this job no freeloading all right thats it rollenberger sat down then and pulled his chair close to the table bosch figured it was to cover up an erection he seemed to get off so much on being the taskmaster here all of them but hans off pushed into the hallway then and headed to the elevator whos drinking tonight sheehan asked more like who isnt opelt answered bosch got to his house by seven after having only one beer at the code seven and finding that the alcohol was a turnoff after the overindulgence of the night before he called sylvia and told her there was no verdict yet he said he was going to shower and change clothes and he would be up to see her by eight his hair was still damp when she opened her door she grabbed him as soon as he stepped in and they held each other and kissed in the entry of her house for a long time it was only when she stepped back that he saw she was wearing a black dress with a neckline that cut deeply between her breasts and a hemline about four inches over her knees howd it go today the closing arguments and all fine what are you all dressed up for because i am taking you out to dinner i made reservations she leaned into him and kissed him on the mouth harry last night was the best night weve ever had together it was the best night i can remember with anyone and not because of the sex actually you and i have done better always room for improvement how bout a little practice before dinner she smiled and told him there was no time they drove down through the valley and into malibu canyon to the saddle peak lodge it was an old hunting lodge and the menu featured a vegetarians nightmare it was all meat from venison to buffalo they each had a steak and sylvia ordered a bottle of merlot bosch sipped his slowly he thought the meal and the evening were wonderful they talked little about the case or anything else they did a lot of looking at each other when they returned to her house sylvia turned down the airconditioner thermostat and built a fire in the living room fireplace he just watched her he had never been good at building fires that lasted even with the ac on sixty it got very warm they made love on a blanket she spread out in front of the fireplace they were perfectly relaxed and moved smoothly together afterward he watched the fire reflect on the light sheen of sweat on her chest he kissed her there and put his head down to listen to her heart the rhythm was strong and it beat counterpoint to his own he closed his eyes and started thinking of ways to guard against ever losing this woman the fire was nothing but a few glowing embers when he woke up in the darkness there was a shrill sound and he was very cold your beeper sylvia said he crawled to the pile of clothes near the couch traced the sound and cut it off god what time is it she said i dont know thats scary i remember when she stopped herself bosch knew it was a story about her husband that she was about to tell she must have decided not to let his memory intrude here but it was too late bosch found himself wondering if sylvia and her husband had ever turned down the thermostat on a summer night and made love in front of the fireplace on that same blanket arent you going to call huh oh yeah im uh just trying to wake up he pulled his pants on and went into the kitchen he slid the door closed so the light would not bother her after flicking the switch he looked at the clock on the wall it was a plate and where the numbers should be were different vegetables it was half past the carrot meaning onethirty he realized he and sylvia had been asleep only about an hour it had seemed like days the number had an area code and he didnt recognize it jerry edgar picked up after a half ring harry yeah sorry to bother you man especially since youre not home its okay whats up im on sepulveda just south of roscoe i got her man bosch knew he was talking about the survivor whatd she say she look at moras picture no no man i dont really have her im watching her shes on the stroll here well why dont you pick her up because im alone i think i could use some backup i try to take her alone she might bite or something you know shes got aids bosch was silent through the phone he could hear cars passing edgar hey man im sorry i shouldntve called i thought you might want to get in on this ill call the van nuys watch commander and get a couple uniforms out here have a good forget it ill be there give me half an hour you been out there all night yeah went home for dinner ive been looking all over didnt see her till now bosch hung up wondering if edgar had really missed her until now or if he was just filling his overtime envelope he walked back into the living room the light was on and sylvia was not on the blanket she was in her bed under the covers i gotta go out he said i thought thats what it sounded like so i decided to come in here nothing romantic about sleeping on the floor in front of a dead fireplace by yourself are you mad of course not harry he leaned over the bed and kissed her and she put her hand on the back of his neck ill try to get back okay can you turn the thermostat back up on your way out i forgot edgar was parked in front of a winchells donuts store apparently not realizing the comic implications of this bosch parked behind him and then got in his car whereyat harry wheres she at edgar pointed across the street and up a block and a half at the intersection of roscoe and sepulveda there was a bus bench with two women sitting on it and three standing nearby shes the one in red shorts you sure yeah i drove up to the light and eyeballed her its her problem is we might have a cat fight if we go over there and try to take her all them girls are working the sepulveda bus line stops running at one bosch saw the one in the red shorts and tank top lift her shirt as a car drove by on sepulveda the car braked but then after a moment of driver hesitation went on she had any business a few hours ago she had one guy walked him into that alley behind the minimall did him there other than that its been dry shes too skaggy for your discerning john edgar laughed bosch thought about how edgar had just slipped up by saying he had been watching her for a few hours well he thought at least he didnt beep me while the fire was going so if you dont want a cat fight whats the plan i was thinking youd drive up to roscoe and take a left then come into the alley from the back way you wait there and get down low ill walk over and tell her i want the nasty and shell walk me back then we take her but watch her mouth she might be a spitter too okay lets get it over with ten minutes later bosch was slouched behind the wheel and parked in the alley when edgar came walking in from the street alone what she made me well shit why didnt you just take her if she made you theres nothing else we can do shell know im a cop if i try her again five minutes later all right she didnt make me whats going on she wouldnt go with me she asked if i had some brown sugar to trade and when i said no no drugs she said she doesnt do colored dick you believe that shit i havent been called colored since i grew up in chicago dont worry about it wait here and ill go goddam whore bosch got out of the car and over the roof said edgar cool it shes a whore and a hype for chrissake you care about that harry you have no idea what its like you see the way rollenberger looks at me i bet he counts the rovers every time i walk out of the room german fuck hey youre right i dont know what its like he took his jacket off and threw it in the car then he unbuttoned the top three buttons of his shirt and walked off toward the street be right back you better hide if she sees a colored guy she might not come into the alley with me they borrowed an interview room in the van nuys detective bureau bosch knew his way around the place because he had worked on the robbery table here after first getting his detectives badge what became immediately clear from the start was that the man edgar had seen georgia stern go into the alley with earlier was not a john he was a dealer and she had probably fixed in the alley she might have paid for the shot with sex but that still didnt make the dealer a john regardless of who he was and what she did she was on the nod when bosch and edgar brought her in and therefore was almost totally useless her eyes were droopy and dilated and would become fixed on objects in the distance even in the tenbyten interview room she looked as though she was staring at something a mile away her hair was rumpled and the black roots were longer than in the photo edgar had she had a sore on the skin below her left ear the kind of sore addicts get from nervously rubbing the same spot over and over her upper arms were as thin as the legs of the chair she sat on her deteriorated state was heightened by the tshirt which was several sizes too big the neckline drooped to expose her upper chest and bosch could see that she used the veins in her neck when she was banging heroin from a needle bosch could also see that despite her emaciated condition she still had large full breasts implants he guessed and for a moment a vision of the concrete blondes desiccated body flashed to him miss stern bosch began georgia do you know why youre here do you remember what i told you in the car i memer now do you remember the night the man tried to kill you more than four years ago a night like this june seventeenth remember she nodded dreamily and bosch wondered if she knew what he was talking about the dollmaker remember hes dead thats right but we need to ask you some questions about the man anyway you helped us draw this picture remember bosch unfolded the composite drawing he had taken from the dollmaker files the drawing looked like neither church nor mora but the dollmaker was known to wear disguises so it was reasonable to believe the follower did as well even so there was always the chance a physical feature like maybe moras penetrating eyes would poke through the memory she looked at the composite for a long time he was killed by the cops she said he deserved it even coming from her it felt reassuring to bosch to hear someone say the dollmaker got what he deserved but he knew what she didnt that they werent dealing with the dollmaker here were going to show you some pictures you got the sixpack jerry she looked up abruptly and bosch realized his mistake she thought he was referring to beer but a sixpack in cop terminology was a package of six mugshots which are shown to victims and witnesses they usually contain photos of five cops and one suspect with the hope that the wit will point to the suspect and say thats the one this time the sixpack contained photos of six cops moras was the second one bosch lined them up on the table in front of her and she looked for a long time she laughed what bosch asked she pointed to the fourth photo i think i fucked him once but i thought he was a cop bosch saw edgar shake his head the photo she had pointed to was of an undercover hollywood division narcotics officer named arb danforth if her memory was correct then danforth was probably venturing off his beat into the valley to extort sex from prostitutes bosch guessed that he was probably paying them with heroin stolen from evidence envelopes or suspects what she had just said should be forwarded in a report to internal affairs but both edgar and bosch knew without saying a word that neither of them would do that it would be like committing suicide in the department no street cop would ever trust them again still bosch knew danforth was married and that the prostitute carried the aids virus he decided he would drop danforth an anonymous note telling him to get a blood test what about the others georgia bosch said look at their eyes eyes dont change when somebodys in a disguise look at the eyes while she bent down to look closer at the pictures bosch looked at edgar who shook his head this was going nowhere he was saying and bosch nodded that he knew after a minute or so her head jerked as she stopped herself from nodding off okay georgia nothing there right no you dont see him no hes dead okay hes dead you stay here were going out into the hall to talk for a minute well be right back outside they decided it might be worth booking her on an undertheinfluence charge into sybil brand and trying her again when she came off the high bosch noted that edgar was eager to do this and volunteered to drive her downtown to sybil bosch knew this was because it would make edgars ot envelope thicker not because he wanted to get the woman into the narco unit at sybil and get her straightened out for a while compassion had nothing to do with it sylvia had pulled the bedrooms heavy curtains across the blinds and the room stayed dark until well after the sun was up on saturday morning when bosch awoke alone in her bed he pulled his watch off the nightstand and saw it was already eleven he had dreamed but when he woke the dream receded into the darkness and he couldnt reach back to grasp it he lay there for nearly fifteen minutes trying to bring it back but it was gone every few minutes he would hear sylvia make some kind of household noise sweeping the kitchen floor emptying the dishwasher he could tell she was trying to be quiet but he heard it anyway there was the back door being opened and the splashing of water in the potted plants that lined the porch it hadnt rained in at least seven weeks at the phone rang and sylvia got to it after one ring but bosch knew it was for him his muscles tensed as he waited for the bedroom door to open and for her to summon him to the call he had given sylvias phone number to edgar when they were leaving the van nuys division seven hours earlier but sylvia never came and when he relaxed again he could hear parts of her conversation on the phone it sounded like maybe she was counseling a student after a while it sounded like she was crying bosch got up pulled on his clothes and walked out of the bedroom while trying to smooth his hair she was at the table in the kitchen holding the cordless phone to her ear she was drawing circles on the tabletop with her finger and he had been right she was crying what he whispered she held her hand up signaling him not to interrupt he didnt he just watched her on the phone ill be there mrs fontenot just call me with the time and address yes yes i will once again i am so very sorry beatrice was such a fine young woman and student i was very proud of her oh my gosh a strong gush of tears came as she hung up bosch came to her and put his hand on her neck a student beatrice fontenot what happened shes dead he leaned down and held her she cried this city she began but didnt finish shes the one who wrote what i read to you the other night aboutday of the locust bosch remembered sylvia had said she worried about the girl he wanted to say something but he knew there was nothing to say this city it seemed to say it all they spent the day around the house doing odd jobs cleaning up bosch cleared the charred logs out of the fireplace and then joined sylvia in the backyard where she was working in the garden pulling weeds and cutting flowers for a bouquet she was going to take to mrs fontenot they worked side by side but sylvia spoke very little every now and then she would offer a sentence she said it had been a driveby shooting on normandie she said it happened the night before and that the girl was taken to martin luther king jr hospital where she was determined to be braindead they turned the machine off in the morning and harvested the organs for donating thats weird that they call it harvesting she said sounds like a farm or people growing on trees or something in the midafternoon she went into the kitchen and made an egg salad sandwich and a tuna fish sandwich she cut them in half and they each had a half of both sandwiches he made iced tea with slices of orange in the glass she said that after the huge steaks theyd eaten the night before she never wanted beef again it was the days only attempt at humor but nobody smiled she put the dishes in the sink afterward but didnt bother to rinse them she turned and leaned on the counter and stared down at the floor mrs fontenot said the funeral would be sometime next week probably wednesday i think im going to bring the class down get a bus i think thatd be nice her family would appreciate it her two older brothers are dealers she told me they sell crack he didnt say anything he knew that was probably the reason the girl was dead since the bloodscrips gang truce the street dealing in south central had lost its command structure there was a lot of infringement of turfs a lot of drivebys a lot of innocents left dead i think ill ask her mother if i could read her book report at the service or after maybe theyd know then what a loss this was they probably know already yes you want to take a nap try to sleep yes i think i will what are you going to do i have some stuff to do make some calls sylvia im going to have to go out tonight hopefully not for long ill get back as soon as i can ill be all right harry good bosch looked in on her at about four and she was sleeping soundly he could see where the pillow was wet from her crying he went down the hall to a bedroom that was used as a study there was a desk with a phone on it he closed the door so as not to disturb her the first call he made was to seventyseventh street division detectives he asked for the homicide table and got a detective named hanks he didnt give a first name and bosch didnt know him bosch identified himself and asked about the fontenot case whats your angle bosch hollywood you said yeah hollywood but theres no angle its private mrs fontenot called the girls teacher this morning the teachers a friend of mine shes upset and i was you know just trying to find out what happened look i dont have time to be holding peoples hands im working a case in other words youve got nothing youve never worked the sevenseven have you no this the part where you tell me how tough it is hey fuck you bosch what im gonna tell you is that there is no such thing as a witness south of pico only way we clear a case is we get lucky and pull some prints or we get luckier and the dude walks in and says is sorry i did it you wanna guess how many times that happens bosch didnt say anything look the teacher aint the only one upset okay this is a bad one theyre all bad but some are bad on bad this is one of those sixteenyearold girl home reading a book babysittin her younger brother driveby yeah you got it twelve holes in the walls it was an ak twelve holes in the walls and one round in the back of her head she never knew did she no she never knew what hit her she mustve caught the first one she never ducked it was a round meant for one of the older brothers right hanks was quiet for a couple of seconds bosch could hear a radio squawking in the background of the squad room how you know that the teacher the girl told her the brothers sell crack yeah they were walking around mlk this morning boohooing like they was altar boys ill check it out bosch anything else i can do you for yeah the book what was she reading the book yeah it was calledthe big sleep and thats what she got man you can do me a favor hanks whats that if you talk to any reporters about this leave the part about the book out what do you mean just leave it out bosch hung up he sat at the desk and felt ashamed that when sylvia had first talked of the girl he had been suspicious of her fine school work after a few minutes thinking about that he picked the phone up again and called irvings office the phone was picked up on half a ring hello this is los angeles police department assistant chief irvin irvings office lieutenant hans rollenberger speaking how can i help you bosch figured hans off must be expecting irving himself to call in and therefore trotted out the fullcount official telephone greeting that was in the officers manual but was roundly ignored by most of the people who answered phones in the department bosch hung up without saying anything and redialed so the lieutenant could go through the whole spiel again its bosch im just checking in bosch did you just call a few moments ago no why nothing im here with nixon and johnson they just came in and sheehan and opelt are with mora now bosch noticed how rollenberger didnt dare call them the presidents when they were in the same room with him anything happen today no the subject spent the morning at home then a little while ago he went up to the valley visited a few more warehouses nothing suspicious where is he now at home what about edgar edgar was here he went over to sybil to interview the survivor he found her last night but she apparently was too dopey to talk to hes giving it another try now then in a lower voice he said if she confirms an id of mora do we move i dont think it would be a good idea its not enough and wed tip our hand my thoughts exactly he said louder now so the presidents would know he was clearly in command here we stick to him like glue and well be there when he makes his move hopefully howre you working this with the surveillance teams they giving you blow by blow absolutely theyre on rovers and im listening here i know every move the subject makes im staying on late tonight i have a feeling about what i think tnights the night bosch bosch woke sylvia at five but then sat on the bed and rubbed her back and neck for a half hour after that she got up and took a shower her eyes still looked sleepy when she came out to the living room she wore her gray cotton tshirt dress her blonde hair was tied in a tail behind her head when do you have to go a little while she didnt ask where he was going or what for he didnt offer to tell her you want me to make you some soup or something he asked no im fine i dont think im going to be hungry tonight the phone rang and harry answered it in the kitchen it was a reporter from thetimes who had gotten the number from mrs fontenot the reporter wanted to speak with sylvia about beatrice about what bosch asked well mrs fontenot said mrs moore said several nice things about her daughter we are doing a major story on this because beatrice was such a good kid i thought mrs moore would want to say something bosch told her to hold on and went to find sylvia he told her about the reporter and sylvia quickly said she wanted to talk about the girl she stayed on the phone fifteen minutes while she was talking bosch went out to his car turned on the rover and switched it to symplex five the dwp frequency he heard nothing he pressed the transmit button and said team one a few seconds passed and he was about to try again when sheehans voice came back on the rover whos that bosch what it be hows our subject the next voice was rollenbergers coming in over sheehan this is team leader please use your code designations when on the air bosch smirked the guy was an ass leader of the team whats my designation you are team six this is team leader out rrrrrogaaahhhh that dream leader say again say again your last transmission team five what was that rollenbergers voice had a frustrated quality to it bosch was smiling he could hear a clicking sound over the radio and he knew it was sheehan punching his transmit button showing his approval i asked who was on my team team six you are solo at this time then should i have another code team leader perhaps solo six bouh team six please keep off the air unless you need or are giving information rrrogaahhh bosch put the radio down for a moment and laughed he had tears in his eyes and he realized he was laughing too hard at something that was mildly humorous at best he figured it was the release of some of the tension of the day he picked up the radio again and called sheehan back team one is the subject moving thats affirmative soloi mean team six where is he he is code seven at the lings wings at hollywood and cherokee mora was eating at a fastfood restaurant bosch knew that would not give him enough time to do what he planned especially since he was a half hours drive from hollywood team one hows he look is he staying out tonight looking good looks like he is going cruising talk to you later rrrrrogah he could tell sylvia had been crying again when he came inside but her spirits seemed improved maybe it was past her he thought the initial pain and anger she was sitting in the kitchen drinking a cup of hot tea do you want a cup harry no im fine im going to have to go okay whatd you tell her the reporter i told her everything i could think of i hope she does a good story they usually do it appeared that hanks hadnt told the reporter about the book the girl had been reading if he had the reporter would definitely have told sylvia to get her reaction he realized that sylvias returning strength was due to her having talked about the girl he had always marveled about how women wanted to talk to maybe set the record straight about someone they knew or loved who had died it had happened to him countless times while making nextofkin notifications the women were hurt yes but they wanted to talk standing in sylvias kitchen he realized that the first time he had met her was on such a mission he had told her about her husbands death and they had stood in the same room they were in now and she had talked almost from the start bosch had been hooked deeply in the heart by her you going to be all right while im gone ill be fine harry im feeling better ill try to get back as soon as i can but i cant be sure when that will be get something to eat okay at the door they hugged and kissed and bosch had an overwhelming urge not to go to stay with her and hold her he finally broke away you are a good woman sylvia better than i deserve she reached up and put her hand on his mouth dont say that harry moras house was on sierra linda near sunset bosch pulled to the curb a half block away and watched the house as it grew dark outside the street was mostly lined with craftsman bungalows with full porches and dormer windows projecting from the sloping roofs bosch guessed it had been at least a decade since the street was as pretty as its name sounded many of the houses on the block were in disrepair the one next to moras was abandoned and boarded on other properties it was clear the owners had opted for chainlink fences instead of paint the last time they had the money to make a choice almost all had bars over their windows even the dormers up top there was a car sitting on cinderblocks in one of the driveways it was the kind of neighborhood where you could find at least one yard sale every weekend bosch had the rover on low on the seat next to him the last report he had heard was that mora was in a bar near the boulevard called the bullet bosch had been there before and pictured it in his mind with mora sitting at the bar it was a dark place with a couple of neon beer signs two pool tables and a tv bolted to the ceiling over the bar it wasnt a place to go for a quick one there was no such thing as one drink at the bullet bosch figured mora was digging in for the evening as the sky turned deep purple he watched the windows of moras house but no light came on behind any of them bosch knew mora was divorced but he didnt know if he now had a roommate looking at the dark place from the caprice he doubted it team one bosch said into the rover team one this is six hows our boy still bending the elbow what are you up to tonight six just hanging around the house let me know if you need anything or if he starts to move will do he wondered if sheehan and opelt understood what he was saying and he hoped rollenberger did not he leaned over to the glove compartment and got his bag of picks out he reached inside his blue plastic raid jacket and put them in the left pocket then he turned the rovers volume control knob to its lowest setting and put it inside the windbreaker in the other pocket because it said lapd in bright yellow letters across the back of the jacket he wore it inside out he got out locked the car and was ready to cross the street when he heard a transmission from the radio he got his keys back out unlocked the car and got back in he turned the radio up whats that one i missed it subject is moving westbound on hollywood on foot negative shit bosch thought he sat in the car for another fortyfive minutes while sheehan radioed reports of moras seemingly aimless cruising up and down hollywood boulevard he wondered what mora was doing the cruising was not part of the profile of the second killer the follower as far as they knew worked exclusively out of hotels thats where he lured his victims the cruising didnt fit the radio was quiet for ten minutes and then sheehan came up on the air again hes dropping down to the strip the sunset strip was another problem altogether the strip was in la but directly south of it was west hollywood sheriffs department jurisdiction if mora dropped down south and started to make some kind of move it could result in jurisdictional problems a guy like hans off was completely frightened of jurisdictional problems hes down to santa monica boulevard now that was west hollywood bosch expected rollenberger to come up soon on the radio he wasnt wrong team one this is team leader what is the subject doing if i didnt know what this guy was into id say he was cruising boystown all right team one keep an eye on him but we dont want any contact were out of bounds here ill contact the sheriffs watch office and inform were not planning any contact five minutes passed bosch watched a man walking his guard dog down sierra linda he stopped to let the animal relieve itself on the burnedout lawn in front of the abandoned house were cool sheehans voice said were back in the country meaning back inside the boundaries of los angeles one whats your twenty bosch asked still santa monica going east past la brea no hes northbound now on la brea he might be going home bosch slid low in his seat in case mora came down the street he listened as sheehan reported that the vice cop was now eastbound on sunset just passed sierra linda mora was staying out bosch sat back up he listened to five minutes of silence hes going to the dome sheehan finally said the dome bosch responded movie theater on sunset just past wilcox hes parked hes paying for a ticket and is going in musta just been driving around till showtime bosch tried to picture the area in his mind the huge geodesic dome was one of hollywoods landmark theaters team one this is team leader i want to split you up here one of you goes in with the subject one stays on the car out roger that team one out the dome was ten minutes away from sierra linda bosch figured that meant that at maximum he had an hour and a half inside the house unless mora left the movie early he quickly got out of the car again crossed the street and moved up the block to moras house the wide porch completely cloaked the front door in shadows bosch knocked on it and while he waited he turned to look at the house across the street there were lights on downstairs and he could see the bluish glow of a tv on the curtains behind one of the upstairs rooms nobody answered he stepped back and appraised the front windows he saw no warnings about security systems no alarm tape on the glass he looked between the bars and through the glass into what he believed was the living room he looked up into the corners of the ceiling searching for the dull glow of a motion detector as he expected there was nothing every cop knew the best defense was a good lock or a mean dog or both he went back to the door opened the pouch and took out the penlight there was black electrical tape over the end so that when he switched it on only a narrow beam of light was emitted he knelt down and looked at the locks on the door mora had a dead bolt and a common keyentry knob bosch put the penlight in his mouth and aimed the beam at the dead bolt with two picks a tension wrench and a hook he began working it was a good lock with twelve teeth not a medeco but a cheaper knockoff it took bosch ten minutes to turn it by then sweat had come down out of his hair and was stinging his eyes he pulled his shirt out of his pants and wiped his face he also wiped the picks which had become slippery with sweat and took a quick look at the house across the street nothing seemed changed nothing seemed amiss the tv was still on upstairs he turned back and put the beam on the knob then he heard a car coming he cut the light and crawled behind the porch riser until it had passed back at the door he palmed the knob and was working the hook in when he realized there was no pressure on the knob he turned it and the door opened the knob hadnt been locked it made sense bosch knew the dead bolt was the deterrent if a burglar got by that the knob lock was a gimme why bother locking it he stood in the darkness of the entrance without moving letting his eyes adjust when he was in vietnam he could drop into one of charlies tunnels and he would have night eyes in fifteen seconds now it took him longer out of practice he guessed or getting old he stood in the entry for nearly a minute when the shapes and shadows filled in he called out hey ray you here you left your door unlocked hello there was no answer he knew mora wouldnt have a dog not living alone and working a cops hours bosch took a few steps farther into the house and looked at the dark shapes of the furniture in the living room he had creeped places before even a cops house but the feeling always seemed new that feeling of exhilaration jagged fear and panic all in one it felt as though his center of gravity had dropped into his balls he felt a strange power that he knew he could never describe to anyone for a brief moment the panic rose and threatened the delicate balance of his thoughts and feelings the headline flashed in his mindcop on trial caught in breakinbut he quickly dismissed it to think about failure was to invite failure he saw the stairs and immediately moved toward them his thought was that mora would keep his trophies either in his bedroom or near a tv which also could mean both rather than work his way toward the bedroom he would start there the second floor was divided into two bedrooms with a bathroom in between them the bedroom to the right had been converted to a carpeted gym there was an assortment of chromeplated equipment a rowing machine a stationary bike and a contraption bosch didnt recognize there was a rack of free weights and a bench press with a chest bar across it on one wall of the room was a floortoceiling mirror it was spidered by a shatter point about face high in the center for a moment bosch looked at himself and studied his shattered reflection he thought of mora studying his own face there bosch looked at his watch it had already been thirty minutes since mora had gone into the theater he took out the radio one hows he doin hes still inside howre you doing just hanging around call if you need me anything interesting on tv not yet then rollenbergers voice came up teams one and six lets drop the banter and use the radio for pertinent transmissions only team leader out neither bosch nor sheehan acknowledged him bosch moved across the hallway into the other bedroom this was where mora slept the bed was unmade and clothing was draped over a chair by the window bosch peeled some of the tape off his light to give him a wider swath of vision on the wall over the bed he saw a portrait of jesus his eyes cast downward his sacred heart visible in his chest bosch moved to the bed table and held the light briefly on a framed photo that stood next to the alarm clock it was a young blonde woman and mora his exwife he assumed her hair was bleached and bosch recognized that she fit into the physical archetype of the victims was mora killing his exwife over and over he wondered again that would be one for locke and the other headshrinkers to decide on the table behind the photo was a religious holy card bosch picked it up and put the light on it it was a picture of the infant of prague a golden halo shooting up from behind the little kings head the night tables drawer contained mostly innocuous junk playing cards aspirin bottles reading glasses condomsnot the brand favored by the dollmakerand a small telephone book bosch sat on the bed and leafed through the phone book there were several women listed by first names but he was not surprised to find none of the names of the women associated with the follower or dollmaker cases listed he closed the drawer and put the light on the shelf beneath it there he found a foothigh stack of explicit pornography magazines bosch guessed there were more than fifty their covers featuring glossy photos of couplings of all equations malefemale malemale femalefemale malefemalemale and so on he flipped through a handful of them and saw a check mark made with a magic marker on the top right corner of each cover as he had seen mora do with the magazines at his office mora was taking his work home or had he brought the magazines here for another reason looking at the magazines bosch felt a tightening in his crotch and some strange feeling of guilt descended on him what about me he wondered am i doing more than my job here am i the voyeur he put the stack back in place he knew there were too many magazines for him to go through to try to find victims of the follower and if he found any what would that prove there was a tall oak armoire against the wall opposite the bed bosch opened its doors and found a television and videocassette recorder inside there were three videotape cassettes stacked on top of the tv they were minute tapes he opened the two drawers in the cabinet and found one more cassette in the top drawer the bottom drawer contained a collection of storebought porno tapes he slid a couple of these tapes out but again there were too many of them and not enough time his attention was drawn to the four tapes used for home recording he turned on the tv and vcr and checked to see if there was another tape already inserted there wasnt he put in one of the tapes that had been stacked on top of the tv it only showed static he hit the fastforward play button and watched as the static continued until the end of the tape it took him fifteen minutes to run through the three tapes that had been on top of the television each was blank a curious thing bosch thought he had to assume that the tapes had been used at one time because they were no longer in the cardboard jackets and plastic wrap they came from the store in though he did not own a vcr he was familiar with them and it occurred to him that people usually did not erase their home tapes they just taped new programs over the old ones why had mora taken the time to erase what had been on these tapes he was tempted to take one of the blank tapes to have it analyzed but decided it would be too risky it would probably be missed by mora the last home tape the one from the top drawer wasnt blank it contained scenes of an interior of a house a child was playing with a stuffed animal on the floor through the window behind the girl bosch could see a snowcovered yard then a man entered the video frame and hugged the girl at first bosch thought it was mora then the man said gabrielle show uncle ray how much you like the horsie the girl hugged the stuffed horse and yelled fankoo uggle way bosch turned the tape off returned it to the armoires top drawer once again and then pulled both drawers out and looked below them nothing else he stepped up onto the bed so he could see on top of the armoire and there was nothing there either he turned the equipment off and returned the armoire to the condition it was in when he opened it he looked at his watch nearly an hour had gone by now the walkin closet was neatly lined on both sides with clothes on hangers the floor had eight pairs of shoes parked toein against the back wall he found nothing else of interest and retreated into the bedroom he took a quick look under the bed and through the drawers of the bureau but found nothing of interest he moved back down the stairs and quickly looked into the living room but there was no tv there was none in the kitchen or dining room either bosch followed a hallway off the kitchen into the back of the house there were three doors off the hallway and this area appeared to be either a converted garage or an addition that was constructed in recent years there were airconditioning vents in the ceiling of the hallway and the white pine flooring was much newer than the scarred and browned oak floors throughout the rest of the first floor the first door opened into a laundry room bosch quickly opened the cabinets above the washer and dryer and found nothing of interest the next door was to a bathroom with newer fixtures than those he had seen in the bathroom upstairs the last door opened into a bedroom with a fourposter bed as its centerpiece the coverlet was pink and it had the feel of a womans room it was the perfume bosch realized but still the room did not have a livedin feeling it seemed more like a room waiting for its occupants return bosch wondered if mora might have a daughter away at college or was this the room his exwife used before she finally ended the marriage and left there was a tv and vcr on a cart in the corner he went to it and opened the video storage drawer below the vcr but it was empty except for a round metal object the size of a hockey puck bosch picked it up and looked at it but could not tell what it was he thought it might be from the weight set upstairs he put it back and closed the drawer he opened the drawers of the white dresser but found nothing but womens underwear in the top drawer the second drawer held a box containing a palette of varying colors of eye makeup and several brushes there was also a round plastic container of beige facial powder the makeup containers were for home use too large to carry in a purse and therefore could not have come from any of the followers victims they belonged to whoever used this room there was nothing at all in the bottom three drawers he looked at himself in the mirror above the bureau and saw he was sweating again he knew he was using too much time he looked at his watch sixty minutes had gone by now bosch opened the closet door and immediately launched himself backward as a jolt of fear punched into his chest he took cover to the side of the door while drawing his gun ray that you no one answered he realized he was leaning against the light switch for the deep walkin closet he flicked it on and swung into the doorway in a low crouch his gun pointing at the man he had seen when he opened the door he quickly reached outside the door and killed the light on the shelf above the clothes bar was a round styrofoam ball on which sat a wig of long black hair bosch caught his breath and stepped all the way into the closet he studied the wig without touching it how does this fit he wondered he turned to his right and found more pieces of womens sheer lingerie and a few thin silk dresses on hangers on the floor beneath them parked toein to the wall was a pair of red shoes with stiletto heels on the other side of the closet behind some clothes in drycleaner bags stood a camera tripod boschs adrenaline began flowing again at a quicker pace he quickly raised his eyes and began looking among the boxes on the shelves above the clothing bar one box was marked with japanese writing and he carefully pulled it down finding it surprisingly heavy opening it he found a video camera and cassette recorder the camera was large and he recognized that it was not a department storebought piece of equipment it was more like the kind of camera bosch had seen used by tv news crews it had a detachable industrial battery and a strobe it was connected by an eightfoot coaxial cable to the recorder the recorder had a playback screen and editing controls he thought that moras having such obviously expensive equipment was curious but he did not know what to make of it he wondered if the vice cop had seized it from a porno producer and never turned it in to the evidence lockup he pressed a button that opened the cassette housing on the recorder but it was empty he repacked the equipment in the box and replaced it on the shelf all the while wondering why a man with such a camera would have only blank tapes he realized as he took another quick look around the closet that the tapes he had found so far might have recently been erased he knew if that was the case mora might have tumbled to the surveillance he looked at his watch seventy minutes he was pushing the envelope as he closed the closet door and turned around he caught his own image in the mirror over the bureau he quickly turned to the door to go that was when he saw the rack of lights on a track running high on the wall above the bedroom door there were five lights and he did not need to turn them on to be able to tell they focused on the bed he focused on the bed himself for a moment as he began to put it together he took another glance at his watch though he already knew it was time to go and headed for the door as he crossed the room he looked at the tv and vcr again and realized that he had forgotten something he quickly dropped to his knees in front of the machines and turned the vcr on he hit the eject button and a videocassette popped out he pushed it back in and hit the rewind button he turned the tv on and pulled out the rover one how we doing movies getting out now im watching for him that wasnt right bosch knew no general release movie was that short and he knew the dome was a single theater one movie shown at a time so mora had gone into the theater after the movie had started if he had really gone in an adrenalinecharged alert swept over him you sure its over one hes barely been in there an hour were going in there was panic in sheehans voice then bosch understood were going in opelt had not followed mora into the theater they had clicked off on rollenbergers order to split up but they hadnt followed the order they couldnt mora had seen sheehan and opelt the day before at the burrito stand by central division there was no way one of them could go into a dark theater looking for mora and risk being seen by the vice cop first if that happened mora would instantly tumble to the setup he would know sheehan had rogered the order from rollenberger because the alternative was to tell the lieutenant that they had fucked up the day before the vcr rewind clicked off bosch sat there motionless his finger poised in front of the vcr he knew they had been made mora was a cop he had made the tail the theater stop had been a scam he hit the play button this tape had not been erased the quality of the image on it was better than bosch had seen in the video booth at x marks the spot four nights earlier the tape had all the production values of a featurelength porno tape framed in the tv picture was the fourposter bed on which two men were engaged in sex with a woman bosch watched for a moment and hit the fast forward button while the picture was still on the screen the players in the video began a quick jerking motion that was almost comedic bosch watched as they changed couplings over and over every conceivable coupling in fast speed finally he returned it to normal speed and studied the players the woman did not fit the followers mold she wore the black wig she was also railthin and young in fact she wasnt a womanlegally at least bosch doubted she was more than sixteen years old one of her partners was young too perhaps he was her age or less bosch couldnt be sure he was sure however that the third participant was ray mora his face was turned away from the camera but bosch could tell and he could see the gold medal the holy spirit bouncing on his chest he turned the tape off i forgot about that tape didnt i still on his knees in front of the television bosch turned ray mora was standing there with a gun pointed at his face hey ray thanks for reminding me dont worry about it look ray why dont you put dont look at me what i dont want you to look at me turn around look at the screen bosch obediently looked at the blank screen youre a leftie right with your right hand take out your gun and slide it across the floor this way bosch carefully followed the orders he thought he heard mora pick the gun up off the floor you fucks think im the follower look im not going to lie to you ray we were checking you out thats all i know now i know were wrong you the kosher burrito boys somebody ought to teach them how to follow a fucking suspect they dont know shit took me a while but i figured something was going down after i saw them so were wrong about you right ray you have to ask bosch after what you just saw the answer is yeah you got your head up your ass whose idea was it to check me out eyman leiby eyman and leiby were the cocommanders of administrative vice no it came from me it was my call a long moment of silence followed this confession then maybe i ought to just blow your head off right here be within my rights wouldnt it look ray dont bosch stopped from turning all the way and looked back at the television you do that ray and your life unalterably changes you know that it did that as soon as you broke in bosch why shouldnt i just take it to the logical conclusion cap you and just disappear cause youre a cop ray am i am i still going to be a cop if i let you go you going to kneel there and tell me youll make it right for me ray i dont know what to tell you those kids on the video are underage but i only know that because of an illegal search you end this now and put away the gun we can work something out yeah harry can everything go back to the way it was the badge is all ive got i cant give ray i shut up just shut up im trying to think bosch felt the anger hitting him in the back like rain you know my secret bosch how the fuck does that make you feel bosch had no answer his mind was tumbling trying to come up with the next move the next sentence when he flinched at the sound of sheehans voice coming over the rover in his pocket we lost him hes not in the theater there was a sharp degree of urgency in sheehans voice bosch and mora were silent listening what do you mean team one rollenbergers voice said whos that mora asked rollenberger rhd bosch answered sheehans voice said the movie got out ten minutes ago people came out but he didnt i went in hes gone his car is still here but hes gone i thought one of you went in rollenberger barked his own voice tightening with panic we did but we lost him sheehan said liar mora said a long moment of silence followed before he said now theyll probably start hitting the hotels looking for me because to them im the follower yes bosch said but they know im here ray i should call in as if on cue sheehans voice came from the rover team six thats sheehan ray im six call him be careful harry bosch slowly took the radio out of his pocket with his right hand and held it up to his mouth he pressed the transmitter one did you find him negative in the wind whats on tv nothing theres nothing on tonight then you ought to leave the house and help us out already on the way bosch said quickly where are you at bouh team six this is team leader we need you to come in were bringing in the task force to help locate the suspect all units will meet at the dome parking lot be there in ten out he dropped his arm back to his side a whole task force huh mora asked bosch looked down and nodded look ray that was all code they know i went to your house if i dont show up at the dome in ten minutes theyll come looking for me here what do you want to do i dont know but i guess that gives me at least fifteen minutes to decide doesnt it sure ray take your time dont make a mistake too late for that he said almost wistfully then he added tell you what take out the tape bosch ejected the tape and held it up over his left shoulder to mora no no i want you to do this for me harry open the bottom drawer and take out the magnet thats what the hockey puck was bosch put the tape on top of the stand next to the tv and reached down for the magnet feeling its heaviness as he lifted it he wondered if hed have a chance if he could maybe turn and hurl it at mora before the vice cop got off a shot youd be dead before you tried mora said knowing his thoughts you know what to do with it bosch ran the magnet over the top side of the tape lets put it in and see how we did mora instructed okay ray whatever you say bosch put the tape into the vcr and pushed the play button the screen filled with the static of a dead channel it cast a grayish shroud of dull light over bosch he hit the fast forward button and the static continued the tape had been wiped clean good mora said that ought to do it that was the last tape no evidence ray youre in the clear but youll always know and youll tell them wont you harry youll tell iad youll tell the world ill never be clear so dont fuckin say ill be clear everyone will know bosch didnt answer after a moment he thought he heard the creaking of the wood floor when mora spoke he was very close behind let me give you a tip harry nobody in this world is who they say they are nobody not when theyre in their own room with the door shut and locked and nobody knows anybody no matter what they think the best you can hope for is to know yourself and sometimes when you do when you see your true self you have to turn away bosch heard nothing for several seconds he kept his eyes on the television screen and thought he could see ghosts forming and disintegrating in the static he felt the grayishblue glow burning behind his eyes and the start of a headache he hoped he was going to live long enough to get it you were always a good guy to me harry i there was a sound from the hallway then a shout mora it was sheehans voice immediately it was followed by light that flooded the room bosch heard the pounding of several feet on the wood floor then there was a shout from mora and the sound of impact as he was tackled bosch took his thumb off the rovers transmit button and began to throw himself to the right out of harms way and in that moment a gunshot cracked across the room echoing it seemed as loudly as anything he had ever heard once bosch had cleared the rover channel rollenberger came up almost immediately bosch sheehanteam one what is happening there what isreport immediately after a long moment went by bosch answered calmly this is six team leader be advised you should proceed to the subjects twenty his home whatdid we have shots fired team leader be advised to keep the channel open and all task force units disregard the callout all units are tenseven until further notice unit five are you up five edgar responded five could you meet me at our subjects twenty on my way six out bosch turned off the rover before rollenberger could get back on the channel it took the lieutenant a half hour to get from the parker center operations post to the house on sierra linda by the time he arrived edgar was already there and a plan was in place bosch opened the front door just as rollenberger reached it the lieutenant strode through the entrance with a face turned red with equal parts of anger and befuddlement okay bosch what the hell is going on here you had no authority to cancel the call out to countermand my order i thought the less people that know the better lieutenant i called out edgar i thought that would be enough to handle it and that way not too many would know what bosch handle what what is going on here bosch looked at him a moment before answering then in an even voice said one of the men in your command conducted an illegal search of the suspects residence he was caught in the act when the suspect eluded the surveillance you were supervising thats what happened rollenberger reacted as if he had been slapped are you crazy bosch wheres the phone i want you call chief irving and you can forget about ever running a task force again you can forget about a lot of things bullshit i had nothing to do with this you went freelancing on your own and got your fingers caught in the jar wheres mora hes upstairs in the room to the right handcuffed to the nautilus machine rollenberger looked around at the others standing in the living room sheehan opelt edgar they all gave him deadpan looks bosch said if you knew nothing about itlieutenant youll have to prove that everything said on symplex five tonight is on the reeltoreel down at the city com center i said i was in the house you were listening you even spoke to me a few times bosch you were talking in codes i didnti knew nuh rollenberger suddenly sprang wildly at bosch his hands up and going for his neck bosch was ready and reacted more aggressively he pounded both palms into the other mans chest and slammed him back against a hallway wall a picture two feet to his side slid off the wall and clattered to the floor bosch you fool the bust is ruined now he said while slumped against the wall it was all il theres no bust hes the wrong man i think but we have to be sure you want to help us search the place and think about how to contain this or do you want to call out the chief and explain how badly you handled your command bosch stepped away adding the phones in the kitchen the search of the house took more than four hours the five of them working methodically and silently searched every room every drawer every cabinet what little evidence they gathered of detective ray moras secret life they put on the dining room table all the while their host remained in the upstairs gym room cuffed to one of the chrome bars of the weight machine he was accorded fewer rights than a murderer would have received had he been arrested in his home no phone call no lawyer no rights this was always the case when cops investigated cops every cop knew the most flagrant abuses of police power occurred when cops turned on their own occasionally as they began the initial work they would hear mora call out he called for bosch most often sometimes rollenberger but no one came to him until finally sheehan and opeltconcerned that the neighbors would hear and maybe call the policewent into the room and gagged him with a bathroom towel and black electrical tape the silence of the searchers was not in deference to the neighbors however the detectives worked quietly because of the tensions among them though rollenberger was visibly angry with bosch most of the tension was derived from sheehan and opelt having blown the surveillance which directly led to moras discovery of bosch inside his house no one except rollenberger was upset by boschs illegal entry of the house boschs own home had been similarly violated at least twice that he knew about during times when he had been the focus of internal investigations just like the badge it came with the job when they completed the search the dining room table was stacked with the porno magazines and storebought tapes the video equipment the wig the womens clothing and moras personal phone book the television that had been hit by moras stray shot was also there by then rollenberger had cooled somewhat having apparently used the hours to consider his situation as well as to search all right he said as the other four convened around the table and surveyed its contents what have we got number one are we confident mora is not our man rollenberger looked around the room and his eyes stopped on bosch what do you think bosch you heard my story he denied it and what was on the last tape before he made me erase it doesnt fit with the follower looked completely consensual though the boy and girl with him were obviously underage he isnt the follower then what is he somebody with problems i think he got bent by staying too long in vice and started making his own flicks was he selling them i dont know i doubt it no evidence of that here he didnt go very far in hiding himself in the tape i saw i think it was just his own stuff he wasnt in it for money it was something deeper no one said anything so bosch continued my guess is that he made our tail sometime after we set up on him and began getting rid of the evidence tonight he was probably playing around with the tail trying to figure what we were on him for he got rid of most of the evidence but if you put somebody on that phone book my bet is youll put it together some of those listings with only a first name you track them and youll probably find some of the kids he used in his videos sheehan made a move to pick up the phone book leave it rollenberger said if anybody continues this it will be internal affairs how they going to do that bosch asked what do you mean its all fruit of the poison tree the search everything all of its illegal we cant move against mora and we cant let him carry a badge either rollenberger said testily the man should be in jail the following silence was broken by the sound of moras hoarse but loud voice from upstairs he had somehow slipped the gag bosch bosch i wanna deal bosch ill give he began coughing ill give him to you bosch you hear me you hear me sheehan headed toward the stairs which began in the alcove outside the dining room he said this time ill make it so tight the fuck will strangle wait a minute rollenberger ordered sheehan stopped at the archway leading to the alcove whats he saying rollenberger said who will he give he looked at bosch who shrugged his shoulders they waited rollenberger looking up at the ceiling but mora was silent bosch stepped over to the table and picked up the phone book he said i think ive got an idea the odor of moras sweat filled the room he sat on the floor his hands cuffed behind him and to the workout machine the towel that had been wrapped around his mouth and taped had slipped down to his neck so that it looked like a cervical collar the front of it was damp with spittle and bosch guessed that mora had loosened it by working his jaw up and down bosch unhook me not yet rollenberger stepped forward detective mora you have problems youve youve got problems youre the one all of this is illegal how you going to explain this know what im going to do im going to hire that bitch money chandler and sue the department for a million dollars yeah ill cant spend a million dollars in jail ray bosch said he held up moras phone book so that the vice cop could see it this gets dropped off at internal affairs and theyll make a case all those names and numbers theres gotta be somebody that would talk about you somebody underage probably think were giving you a hard time wait until iad takes over theyll make a case ray and theyll make it without tonights search that will just be your word against ours bosch saw a quick movement in moras eyes and he knew he had struck bone mora was afraid of the names in the book so bosch said what deal did you have in mind ray mora looked away from the book first to rollenberger and then to bosch and then back to rollenberger you can make a deal i have to hear it first rollenberger said okay this is the deal i walk and i give you the follower i know who it is bosch was immediately skeptical but said nothing rollenberger looked at him and bosch shook his head once i know mora said the peeping tom i told you about that was no bullshit i got the id today it fits i know who it is now bosch took him more seriously he folded his arms in front of his body threw a quick glance at rollenberger who rollenberger said whats the deal first rollenberger stepped to the window and parted the curtains he was turning it over to bosch who took a step forward and squatted like a baseball catcher in front of mora this is the deal it is offered only this one time take it or let the chips fall where they may you give the name to me and your badge to lieutenant rollenberger you resign immediately from the department you agree not to sue the department or any of us individually in exchange you walk how do i know youll you dont and how do we know that youll keep your end i hang on to the phone book ray you try to fuck us and it goes to iad do we have a deal mora stared at him without speaking a long moment finally bosch got up and turned to the door rollenberger headed that way too and said unhook him bosch take him to parker and book him on assault on a police officer unlawful sex with a minor pandering anything you can think we gotta deal mora blurted but ive got no insurance bosch turned back to look at him thats right you dont the name mora looked from bosch to rollenberger unhook me the name mora rollenberger said this is it its locke the fucking shrink you assholes you put the finger on me and the whole time hes the one pushing the buttons bosch was jolted but in that same moment he began immediately to see how it could be locke knew the dollmakers program he fit the followers profile he was the tom yeah it was him gotm idd by a producer today he went around saying he was writin a book so he could get close to the girls then he killed them bosch the whole time hes been playing doctor with you bosch hes been out there killing rollenberger turned to bosch and said what do you think bosch left the room without answering he went down the stairs and trotted out the door to his car lockes book was on the back seat where bosch had left it the day he bought it as he headed back into the house with it he noticed that the first etchings of dawns light were in the sky on moras dining room table bosch opened the book and began leafing through it until he came to a page marked authors note in the second paragraph locke wrote the material for this book was gathered over the course of three years from interviews with countless adult film performers many of whom requested that they remain anonymous or be identified only by their stage names the author wishes to thank them and the film producers who granted him access to the sets and production offices at which these interviews were conducted the mystery man bosch realized mora could be right that locke was the man whom the video performer gallery had reported as a suspect when she called the original task force tip number four years earlier bosch next flipped to the index of the book and ran his fingers down the names velvet box was listed so were holly lere and magna cum loudly bosch quickly reviewed in his mind lockes involvement in the case he would definitely fit as a suspect for the same reasons mora had fit he had had a foot in both camps as locke himself had described it he had access to all information about the dollmaker deaths and at the same time was conducting research for a book on the psychology of female performers in the pornography industry bosch became excited but more so he was angry mora had been right locke had punched his buttons to the point that he had helped set the cops on the path to the wrong man if locke was the follower he had played bosch perfectly rollenberger dispatched sheehan and opelt to lockes house to put him under immediate surveillance this time dont fuck it up he said as he recovered some of his command presence next he announced there would be a meeting of the task force at noon sunday little more than six hours away he said they would then discuss seeking a search warrant for lockes home and office and decide what moves to make as he headed to the door rollenberger looked at bosch and said go cut him loose then bosch you better go get some sleep youre going to need it what about you howre you going to handle irving on this rollenberger was looking down at the gold detectives shield he held in his hand it was moras he closed his hand over it and put it in his sport coat pocket then he looked at bosch thats my business isnt it bosch dont worry about it after the others had left bosch and edgar went up the stairs to the gym room mora was silent and refused to look at them as they removed the handcuffs they said nothing and left him there the towel still around his neck like a noose staring at his fractured image in the wall mirror bosch lit a cigarette and looked at his watch when he got to his car it was and he was too wired to go home to sleep he got in the car and pulled the rover from his pocket frankie you up yo sheehan responded anything just got here no life showing dont know whether hes here or not garage door is down okay then bosch thought of an idea he picked up lockes book and took the cover off it he folded it and put it in his pocket then he started the car after stopping for coffee at a winchells bosch got to the sybil brand institute by seven because of the early hour he had to get the watch commanders approval to interview georgia stern he could see she was sick as soon as she was brought into the interview room she sat hunched over with her arms folded in front of her as if she were carrying a bag of groceries that had broken and was guarding against losing anything remember me he asked man you gotta get me out cant do that but i can get them to take you into the clinic you can get methadone in your orange juice i wanna get out ill get you in the clinic she dropped her head in defeat she started a slight rocking motion back and forth she seemed pitiful to bosch but he knew he had to let it go there were more important things and she couldnt be saved you remember me he asked again from the other night she nodded we showed you pictures ive got another he put the dust jacket from the book on the table she looked at lockes photo for a long while well what i seen him he talked to me once about what making movies he wasi think hes an interviewer interviewer i mean like a writer he said it was for a book i told him dont use any of my names but i never checked georgia think back hard this is very important could he also be the one who attacked you you mean the dollmaker the dollmakers dead i know that i think it was someone else who attacked you look at the photo was it him she looked at the photo and shook her head i dont know they told me it was the dollmaker so i forgot what he looked like after he was killed bosch leaned back in his chair it was useless you still going to get me in the clinic she asked timidly after seeing his change in mood yeah you want for me to tell them youve got the virus what virus aids what for to get you whatever medicine you need i dont have aids look i know the last time van nuys vice put the bust on you you had azt in your purse thats for protection i got that from a friendamine whos sick he gave me the bottle and i put cornstarch in it protection i dont want to work for no pimp some asshole comes up and says hes now your man i show em the shit and say i got the virus you know and he splits they dont want girls with aids bad for their business she smiled slyly and bosch changed his mind about her she might be saved after all she had the instincts of a survivor the hollywood station detective bureau was completely deserted which was not unusual for nine on a sunday morning after stealing a cup of coffee from the watch office while the sergeant was busy at the wall map bosch went to the homicide table and called sylvia but got no answer he wondered if she was gardening out back and hadnt heard the phone or had gone out maybe to get the sunday paper to read the story about beatrice fontenot bosch leaned back in his chair he didnt know what his next move was he used the rover to check with sheehan and once again was told that there had been no movement at lockes house think we should go up and knock sheehan asked he wasnt expecting an answer and bosch didnt give one but he started thinking about it it gave him another idea he decided he would go to lockes house to finesse him to run the story about mora by him and see how locke reacted and if he would say the vice cop was probably the follower he threw the empty coffee cup in the trash can and looked over at his slot in the memo and mail box on the wall he saw he had something in there he got up and took three pink phone message forms and a white envelope back to his desk he looked at the messages and one by one dismissed them as unimportant and put them on his message spike to be considered later two were from tv reporters and one was from a prosecutor asking about evidence in one of his other cases all the calls had come in friday then he looked at the envelope and felt a chill like a cold steel ball rolling down the back of his neck it had only his name on the outside but the distinctive printing style could mean it was from nobody else he dropped the envelope on the table opened his drawer and dug around in the notebooks pens and paper clips until he found a pair of rubber gloves then he carefully opened the followers message long aft the body stops stinking of me youll be thinking for taking your precious blonde oft your bloody hands ill make her my dolly aft ive had my sweet jolly and maybe to leave then for other soft lands no air for her to swallow aft me dare you not follow her last word my gosh a sound like boschhhhhh as he left the station he ran through the watch commanders office almost knocked down the startled duty sergeant and yelled get hold of detective jerry edgar tellm to come up on the rover hell know what i mean getting to the freeway was so frustrating that bosch believed he could actually feel his blood pressure rising his skin began to feel tight around his eyes his face grew warm there was some kind of sunday morning performance at the hollywood bowl and traffic on highland was backed up to fountain bosch tried taking some side streets but so were many of the people going to the bowl he was deep into this quagmire before he cursed himself for not remembering that he had the bubble and siren working homicide it had been so long since he had to race to get anywhere that he had forgotten after he slid the bubble onto the roof and hit the siren the cars began to part in front of him and he remembered how easy it could be he had just gotten onto the hollywood freeway and was speeding north through the cahuenga pass when jerry edgars voice came up on the rover on the seat next to him harry bosch yeah edgar listen i want you to call the sheriffs department valencia station and tell them to get a car to sylvias house code three tell them to make sure shes okay code three meant lights and siren an emergency he gave edgar her address make the call now and then come back up okay harry whats going on make the call now three minutes later edgar was back on the radio theyre on the way whatve you got im on my way too what i want you to do is go in to the division i left a note on my desk its from the follower secure it and then call rollenberger and irving and tell em whats happening what is happening bosch had to swerve into the median to avoid hitting a car that pulled into the lane in front of him the driver hadnt seen bosch coming and bosch knew he was going too fasta steady ninetythreefor the siren to give much of a warning to the cars ahead of him the notes another poem he says he is going to take the blonde off my hands sylvia theres no answer at her house but there still may be time i dont think i was supposed to find the note until monday when i came in for work on my way be careful buddy stay cool stay cool bosch thought right he thought of what locke had told him about the follower being angry wanting to get back at him for putting down the dollmaker not sylvia he hoped he wouldnt be able to live with it he picked the radio back up team one yo sheehan replied go get him if hes there bring him in you sure bring him in there was a lone sheriffs car in front of sylvias house when bosch pulled to a stop he saw a uniform deputy standing on the front step back to the door it looked as if he was guarding the place as if he was protecting a crime scene as he started to get out bosch felt a sharp stabbing pain on the left side of his chest he held still for a moment and it eased he ran around the car and across the lawn working his badge out of his pocket as he went lapd whatve you got its locked i walked around all windows and doors secured no answer looks like nobodys bosch pushed past him and used his key to open the door he ran from room to room making a quick search for obvious signs of foul play there were none the deputy had been right nobody was home bosch looked in the garage and sylvias cherokee was not there still bosch made a second sweep of the house opening closets looking under beds looking for any indication that something was amiss the deputy was standing in the living room when bosch finally came out of the bedroom wing can i go now i was pulled off a call that seems a little more important than this bosch noted the annoyance in the deputys voice and nodded for him to go he followed him out and got the rover out of the caprice edgar you up what do you have there harry there was the sound of genuine dread in his voice nothing here no sign of her or anything else im at the station you want me to put a bolo out bosch described sylvia and her cherokee for the be on look out dispatch that would go out to all patrol cars ill put it out we got the task force coming in irving too well be meeting here theres nothing else to do but wait im going to wait here a while keep me posted team one you up team one sheehan said we went up to the door nobody home were standing by if he shows well bring him in bosch sat in the living room his arms folded in front of him for more than an hour he now knew why georgia stern had held herself this way at sybil brand there was comfort in it still the silence of the house was nerveracking he was staring at the portable phone he had put on the coffee table waiting for it to ring when he heard a key hit the lock on the front door he jumped up and was moving toward the entry when the door opened and a man stepped in it wasnt locke it wasnt anyone bosch knew but he had a key without hesitating bosch moved into the entrance and slammed the man up against the door as he turned to close it where is she he shouted what what the man cried out where is she she couldnt come im going to watch it for her shes got another open in newhall please bosch realized what was happening just as the pager on his belt sounded its shrill tone he stepped away from the man youre the realtor i work for her what are you doing nobodys supposed to be here bosch pulled the pager off his belt and saw the readout was his home phone number i have to make a call he went back to the living room over his shoulder he heard the real estate man say yeah you do that what the hell is going on here bosch punched the number into the phone and sylvia picked up after one ring are you okay yes harry where are you at your place where have you been i picked up a pie at marie callendars and took it and the flowers i cut to the fontenots i just felt like doing sylvia listen to me is the door locked what i dont know put the phone down and go make sure make sure the sliding door to the porch is locked too and the door to the carport ill wait harry what is go do it now she was back in a minute her voice sounded very timid okay everythings locked okay good now listen im coming there right now and it will only take me half an hour in the meantime no matter who comes to the door dont answer it and dont make any sound understand youre scaring me harry i know that do you understand what i said yes good bosch thought for a moment what else could he tell her sylvia after we are done here i want you to go to the closet near the front door on the shelf there is a white box take it down and take out the gun there are bullets in the red box in the cabinet over the sink the red box not the blue load the gun i cant dowhat are you telling me yes you can sylvia load the gun then wait for me if anybody comes through the door and its not me protect yourself she didnt say anything im on my way i love you while bosch was on the freeway going south edgar came up on the radio and told him sheehan and opelt still had made no sighting of locke the presidents had been dispatched to usc but locke was not at his office either theyre going to sit on both locations im working on a warrant for the house now but i dont think the pc is there bosch knew he was probably right moras identification of locke as the man hanging around porno sets and the names of three of the victims in his book were not probable cause to search his house he told edgar that he had located sylvia and was headed to her now after signing off he realized that her trip to the fontenot house might have saved her life he saw a symbiotic grace in that a life taken a life saved before opening the door to his house he loudly announced he was there then turned the key and walked into sylvias trembling arms he held her to his chest and said into the radio were all safe here then turned it off they sat down on the couch and bosch told her everything that had happened since they had last been together he could tell by her eyes that it scared her more knowing what was going on than not she in turn explained that she had to get out of the house because the realtor was holding an open house that was why she had gone to boschs house after visiting the fontenots he explained that he had forgotten about the open house you might need to get a new realtor after today he said they laughed together to let some of the tension go im sorry he said this should never have involved you they sat in silence for a while after that she leaned against him as if she was weary of everything why do you do this harry you deal with so muchthe most awful people and the things they do why do you keep going he thought about that but knew there was no real answer and that she wasnt expecting one i dont want to stay here he said after a while we can go back to my house at four no lets just get out of here the tworoom suite at the loews hotel in santa monica gave them a sweeping view of the ocean across a wide beach it was the kind of room that came with two fulllength terrycloth robes and gold foilwrapped chocolates left on the pillow the suites front door was off the fourth landing of a fivestory atrium with a wall of glass that faced the ocean and would capture the entire arc of the sunset there was a porch with two chaise lounges and a table and they had lunch delivered by room service there bosch had brought the rover in with him but it was turned off he would keep in touch as the search for locke went on but he was out of it for the day he had called in and talked to edgar and then irving he told them he would stay with sylvia though it seemed unlikely that the follower would make a move now he was not needed anyway because the task force was in a holding pattern waiting for locke to turn up or something else to break irving had said the presidents had contacted the dean of the psychology department at usc who in turn contacted one of lockes graduate assistants she reported that locke had mentioned on friday that he would be in las vegas for the weekend staying at the stardust he taught no classes on mondays so he would not be back at the school until tuesday but we checked the stardust irving said locke had a reservation but never checked in what about the warrant weve had three turndowns from three judges you know its pretty weak when a judge wont rubberstamp a search warrant for us were going to have to let that jell for a while in the meantime well be watching his house and his office id like to leave it that way until he surfaces and we can talk to him bosch heard the doubt in irvings voice he wondered how rollenberger had explained the leap in the investigation from mora to locke as the suspect you think were wrong he realized there was a quiver of doubt in his own voice i dont know we traced the note partially it was left at the front desk sometime saturday night the deskman went back for coffee about nine got sidetracked by the watch commander and when he came back out it was there on the counter he had an explorer put it in your slot the only thing it means for sure is that we were wrong about mora anyway the point is we could be wrong again right now all we have are hunches good hunches mind you but thats all i want to proceed a little more carefully this time the translation was you screwed us up with your hunch on mora we are going to be more skeptical this time bosch understood this what if the vegas trip was a cover the note says something about moving on maybe lockes running maybe should we put out a bolo get an arrest warrant i think were going to wait until at least tuesday detective give him a chance to come back just two more days it was clear irving wanted to sit tight he was going to wait for events to control what he would do next okay ill check in later they napped in the kingsize bed until it was dark and then bosch turned on the news to see if any of what had happened in the last twentyfour hours had leaked it hadnt but midway through the newscast on bosch stopped flipping through the channels with the selector the story that stopped him was an update on the beatrice fontenot killing a photo of the girl her hair in cornrows appeared on the right side of the screen the blonde anchor said police announced today that they have identified a suspected gunman in the death of sixteenyearold beatrice fontenot the man they are looking for is an alleged drug dealer who was a rival of beatrices older brothers detective stanley hanks said he said the shots fired at the fontenot house were in all probability meant for the brothers instead a bullet struck beatrice an honor student at grant high in the valley in the head her funeral is scheduled for later this week bosch turned off the television and looked back at sylvia who was propped up on two pillows against the wall they didnt say anything after a room service dinner which they ate with almost no conversation in the front room of the suite they took turns in the shower bosch went second and as the coarse water stung his scalp he decided that it was time for him to lose all his baggage to come clean he trusted his faith in her in her desire to know all of him and he knew that if he did nothing he was risking what they had each day he kept the secrets of his life inside somehow he knew facing her was facing himself he had to accept what he was where he had come from and what he had become if he was to be accepted by her they were in their bleached white bathrobes she in the chair by the sliding door he standing near the bed beyond her through the door he could see the full moon casting a shifting reflection on the pacific he didnt know how to start she had been leafing through a hotel magazine filled with suggestions for tourists on what to do in the city none of them were things that people who lived here ever did she closed it and put it on the table she looked at him and then looked away she started before he could say a word harry i want you to go home he sat on the edge of the bed put his elbows on his knees and ran his hands through his hair he had no idea what was going on what do you mean too much death sylvia harry ive done so much thinking this weekend that i cant think anymore but i know this we have to be apart for a while i have to sort things out your life its two days ago you said our problem was that i held things back from you now youre saying you dont want to know about me your im not talking about you im talking about what you do he shook his head same thing sylvia you should know that look its been a rough couple of days i just need some time to decide if this is right for me for us believe me im thinking about you too im not sure im the right one for you i am sylvia please dont say that dont make it any more difficult i i dont want to go back to being without you sylvia thats all i know right now i dont want to be alone harry i dont want to hurt you and i would never ever ask you to change for me i know you and i dont think you could change even if you wanted to so what i have to decide is whether i can live with that and live with you i do love you harry but i need some time she was crying now bosch could see it in the mirror he wanted to get up to hold her but he knew it was the wrong move he was the cause of her tears there was a long silence both of them sitting in private pain she was looking down into her lap where her hands held each other he looked out at the ocean and saw a driftfishing boat cut across the reflected path of the moon on its way toward the channel islands say something to me she finally said ill do whatever you want he said you know that ill go into the bathroom until you get dressed and leave sylvia i want to know that you are safe i would like to ask you to let me sleep in the other room in the morning well figure something out ill leave then no we both know nothing will happen that man locke hes probably far away running from you harry ill be safe ill take a taxi to school tomorrow and ill be safe just give me some time time to decide yes to decide she got up and walked quickly by him to the bathroom he put his arm out but she brushed by it after the door closed he could hear her pull tissues from the dispenser then he could hear her crying please leave harry she said after a while please he heard her turn the water on so she wouldnt hear him if he said anything bosch felt like a fool to be sitting there in his luxury bathrobe it ripped when he pulled it off that night he took a blanket from the trunk of the caprice and made a bed on the sand about a hundred yards from the hotel but he didnt sleep he sat with his back to the ocean and his eyes on the curtained sliding door on the fourthfloor balcony next to the atrium through the glass wall of the atrium he could also see her front door and would know if anyone approached it was cold on the beach but he didnt need the sea winds chill to stay awake bosch was ten minutes late coming into the courtroom monday morning he had waited to make sure sylvia got a cab and was safely off to school before going home and changing into the same suit he had worn friday but as he hurried in he saw that judge keyes wasnt on the bench and chandler wasnt at the plaintiffs table churchs widow sat alone looking straight forward in a prayerful pose harry sat down next to belk and said whats up we were waiting for you and chandler now were just waiting for her the judge was not happy about it bosch saw the judges clerk get up from her desk and knock on the chambers door she then poked her head in and he could hear her say detective bosch is here ms chandlers secretary still hasnt located her the constricting feeling in his chest began then bosch felt himself immediately begin to sweat how could he have missed it he leaned forward and put his face into his hands i gotta make a call he said and stood up belk turned probably to tell him not to go anywhere but was silenced by the opening of the chambers door judge keyes strode out and said remain seated he took his place on the bench and told the clerk to buzz the jury in bosch sat down were going to go ahead and get them started again without ms chandler being here well deal with her tardiness at a later date the jury filed in and the judge asked them if anybody had anything they wanted to bring up a scheduling problem or anything else no one said a word all right then were going to send you back in to continue deliberations the marshal will come speak to you later about lunch by the way ms chandler had a scheduling conflict this morning and thats why you dont see her there at the plaintiffs table you are to pay no mind to that thank you very much they filed back out the judge instructed the parties who were present to stay within fifteen minutes of the courtroom again then told the clerk to keep trying to find chandler with that he stood up and walked back to his chambers bosch was up quickly and out the door of the courtroom he went to the pay phones and dialed the communications center after giving his name and badge number he asked the phone clerk to run a codethree dmv search on the name honey chandler he said he needed the address and would hold the rover would not work until he was out of the courthouse underground garage once he was out on los angeles street he tried again and got hold of edgar who had his rover on he gave him the carmelina street address in brentwood he had gotten for chandler meet me there on my way he drove down to third and took it up through the tunnel and onto the harbor freeway he was just hitting the santa monica freeway when his pager sounded he looked at the number while driving and didnt recognize it he exited the freeway and pulled over at a korea town grocery store with a phone on the wall out front courtroom four said the woman who answered his call its detective bosch did someone beep me yes we did we have a verdict you need to get back here right away what do you mean i was just there howd they its not unusual detective bosch they probably came to an agreement friday and decided to take the weekend to see if they wanted to change their minds look it gets them out of another day of work back in the car he picked up the rover again edgar you there uh not quite you i gotta turn around got a verdict can you check this out no problem what am i checking out its chandlers house shes blonde she didnt show up in court today i get the picture bosch had never thought he would hope to see honey chandler in court at the table opposite his but he did she wasnt there though a man harry didnt recognize was sitting with the plaintiff as he walked to the defense table bosch saw that a couple of reporters including bremmer were already in the courtroom whos that he asked belk about the man next to the widow dan daly keyes grabbed him out of the hallway to sit with the woman during the verdict chandler is apparently incommunicado they cant find her anybody go to her house i dont know i assume they called what do you care you should be worried about this verdict judge keyes came out then and took his place he nodded to the clerk who buzzed the jury as the twelve filed in none of them looked at bosch but almost all of them eyed the man sitting next to deborah church again folks the judge began a scheduling conflict has prevented ms chandler from being here mr daly a fine lawyer has agreed to sit in her stead i understand from the marshal that you have reached a verdict several of the twelve heads nodded bosch finally saw one man look at him but then he looked away bosch could feel his heart pounding and he was unsure if it was because of the impending verdict or the disappearance of honey chandler or both can i have the verdict forms please the jury foreman handed a thin stack of papers to the marshal who handed them to the clerk who handed them to the judge it was excruciating to watch the judge had to put on a pair of reading glasses and then took his time studying the papers finally he handed the papers back to the clerk and said publish the verdict the clerk did a rehearsal reading in her head first and then began in the above entitled matter on the question of whether defendant hieronymus bosch did deprive norman church of his civil rights to protection against unlawful search and seizure we find for the plaintiff bosch didnt move he looked across the room and saw that now all the jurors were looking at him his eyes turned to deborah church and he saw her grab the arm of the man next to her even though she didnt know him and smile she was turning that smile triumphantly toward bosch when belk grabbed his arm dont worry he whispered its the damages that count the clerk continued the jury hereby awards to the plaintiff in compensatory damages the amount of one dollar bosch heard belk whisper a gleeful yes under his breath in the matter of punitive damages the jury awards the plaintiff the amount of one dollar belk whispered it again only this time loud enough to be heard in the gallery bosch looked at deborah church just as the triumph dropped out of her smile and her eyes turned dead it all seemed surrealistic to bosch as if he were observing a play but was actually on the stage with the actors the verdict meant nothing to him he just watched everybody judge keyes began his thankyou speech to the jury telling them how they had performed their constitutional duties and should be proud to have served and to be americans bosch tuned it out and just sat there sylvia came to mind and he wished he could tell her the judge banged down the gavel and the jury filed out for the last time then he left the bench and bosch thought he might have had an annoyed look on his face harry belk said its a damn good verdict is it i dont know well its a mixed verdict but essentially the jury found what we already admitted to we said you made mistakes going in like you did but you already had been reprimanded by your department for that the jury found as a matter of law that you should not have kicked down the door like that but in awarding only two dollars they were saying they believed you church made the furtive move and church was the dollmaker he patted boschs back he was probably waiting for harry to thank him but it didnt come what about chandler well theres the rub so to speak the jury found for the plaintiff so we are going to have to pick up her tab shell probably ask for about oneeighty maybe two hundred well probably settle it for ninety its not bad harry not at all i gotta go bosch stood up and waded through a clot of people and reporters to get out of the courtroom he moved quickly to the escalator and once on started fumbling to get the last cigarette out of his pack bremmer jumped on the step behind him his notebook out and ready congrats harry he said bosch looked at him the reporter seemed sincere for what they said im some kind of a constitutional goon yeah but you walk away two bucks light that aint bad yeah well well any comment on the record i take it constitutional goon was off right yeah id appreciate that uh tell you what let me think for a while ive gotta go but ill call you later why dont you go back up and talk to belk he needs to see his name in the paper outside he lit the cigarette and pulled the rover out of his pocket edgar you up here how is it better come on out harry everybodys rolling on it bosch threw the cigarette in the ash can they had done a bad job of keeping it contained by the time bosch got to the house on carmelina there was already one news copter circling overhead and two other channels were there on the ground it would not be long until it was a circus the case would have two big draws the follower and honey chandler bosch had to park two houses away because of the glut of official cars and vans lining both sides of the street parking control officers were just beginning to put down flares and close the street to traffic the property had been preserved by yellow plastic police lines bosch signed an attendance log held by a uniform officer at the tape and slipped underneath it was a twostory bauhausstyle home set on a hillside standing outside bosch knew the floortoceiling windows of the upstairs rooms would offer sweeping views of the flats below he counted two chimneys it was a nice house in a nice neighborhood filled with nice lawyers and ucla professors not anymore he thought he wished he had a cigarette as he headed in edgar was standing just inside the door in a tiled entryway he was talking on a mobile phone and it sounded as if he was telling the media relations unit to send people out to handle this he saw bosch and pointed up the stairs the staircase was right off the entry and bosch went up there was a wide hallway that passed four doorways upstairs a group of detectives milled about outside the farthest door and occasionally they looked inside at something bosch walked over in a way bosch knew he had trained his mind to be almost like that of a psychopath he practiced the psychology of objectification when at a death scene dead people werent people they were objects he had to look at bodies as corpses as evidence it was the only way to deal with it and get the job done it was the only way to survive but this of course was always easier said or thought about than done often bosch stumbled as a member of the original dollmaker task force he had seen the last six of the victims attributed to the serial killer he saw them in situ as it was calledin the situation in which they were found none of them was easy there was something that seemed so helpless about these victims that it overwhelmed his best efforts at objectification and knowing that they came from street backgrounds had made it all the worse it was as if the torture visited upon each one by her killer was only the last in a life of indignities now he looked down at the naked and tortured body of honey chandler and no manner of mental tricks or deception could prevent the horror he saw from burning into his soul for the first time in his years as a homicide investigator he wanted to close his eyes and just go away but he didnt instead he stood with the other men who looked down with dead eyes and nonchalant poses like a gathering of serial killers something made him think of the bridge game at san quentin that locke had mentioned a foursome of psychopaths sitting around the table more killings to their credit than cards on the table chandler was faceup her arms outstretched at her sides her face was garishly painted with makeup it hid much of the purplish discoloration which spread from her neck up a leather strap cut from a purse which lay spilled on the floor was tied tightly around her neck knotted on the right side as if pulled closed with a left hand in keeping with the prior cases whatever restraints and gag the killer used had been taken away with him but there was something outside of the program bosch saw that the follower was improvising now that he was no longer operating under the camouflage of the dollmaker chandlers body was riddled with cigarette burns and bite marks some of them had bled and some were purplish with bruising meaning the torture had taken place while she was still alive rollenberger was in the room and was giving orders even telling the photographer what angles he wanted nixon and johnson were also in the room bosch realized as probably chandler had that the final indignity was that her uncovered body would be left on display for hours in view of men who had despised her in life nixon looked up and saw bosch in the hallway and stepped out of the room harry what made you tumble to her she didnt show up for court today thought it was worth checking out guess she was the blonde too bad i didnt see it right away yeah got a tod yet yeah an estimate coroners tech says time of death was at least fortyeight hours ago bosch nodded it meant she was dead before he even found the note it made it a little easier hear anything on locke nada you and johnson on point on this one yeah hans off put us on it edgar discovered it but hes primary on last weeks case i know it was your tumble but i guess hans off figured with court and dont worry about it what do you need me to do you tell me what do you want to do i want to stay out of there i didnt like her but i liked her you know what i mean i think so yeah this ones bad you notice hes changing hes biting now burning yeah i noticed anything else new not that we can tell im going to have a look around the rest of the house is it clean we havent had time to dust just a quick look through use gloves and let me know what you find bosch went to one of the equipment boxes lined along the wall in the hallway and pulled a pair of plastic gloves from a dispenser that looked like a kleenex box irving passed by him wordlessly on the staircase their eyes barely holding each others for a second when he got down to the entry he saw two deputy chiefs standing out on the front steps they werent doing anything just standing where they would be sure to be seen on the tv footage looking serious and concerned bosch could see that a growing number of reporters and cameramen were gathering at the plastic line he looked around and found chandlers home office in a small room off the living room two of the walls contained builtin shelves that were lined with books the room had one window that looked out onto the commotion just beyond the front lawn he pulled on the gloves and began looking through the drawers of the desk he didnt find what he was looking for but he could tell the desk had been rifled by someone else things were scattered in the drawers papers from files were outside of files it wasnt as neat as chandler had kept her things on the plaintiffs table he checked underneath the blotter the note from the follower wasnt there there were two books on the deskblacks law dictionary and thecalifornia penal code he fanned the pages of both but there was no note he leaned back in the leather desk chair and looked up at the two walls of books he figured it would take two hours to go through all the books and he still might not find the note then he noticed the cracked green spine of a book on the secondtothetop shelf nearest the window he recognized the book it was the one chandler had read from during closing argumentsthe marble faun he got up and pulled the book out of its slot the note was there folded into the center of the book so was the envelope it came in and bosch quickly learned he had guessed correctly about her the note was a photocopy of the page dropped at the police station last monday the day of opening statements what was different about this one was the envelope it hadnt been dropped off it had been mailed the envelope was stamped and then canceled in van nuys on the saturday before opening statements bosch looked at the postmark and knew it would be impossible to try any kind of trace on it there would also be numerous prints on it from the many postal employees who handled it he decided the note would be of little evidentiary value he left the office carrying the note and envelope by the corners with his gloved hands he had to go upstairs to find a tech with plastic evidence bags to place them in he looked through the doorway into the bedroom and saw the coroners tech and two body movers spreading open a plastic bag on a gurney the public display of honey chandler was about to end bosch stepped back so he did not have to watch edgar walked over after reading the note which the tech was labeling he sent the same note to her how come guess he wanted to make sure we didnt sit on the one he dropped off for us if we did he could count on her bringing it up if she had the note all along how come she wanted to subpoena ours she couldve just taken this one into court i think maybe she thought shed get more mileage out of ours making the police turn it over gave it more legitimacy in the eyes of the jury if she had just presented her own my lawyer couldve gotten it shot down i dont know its just a guess edgar nodded by the way bosch said howd you get in when you got here front door was unlocked no scratches on the lock or other signs of breakin the follower came here and was let in she wasnt lured to him somethings going on hes changing hes biting and burning hes making mistakes hes letting something get to him whyd he go for her rather than stick to his pattern of ordering victims from the sex tabs too bad lockes the fucking suspect itd be nice to ask him what all this means detective harry bosch a voice called from downstairs harry bosch bosch walked to the top of the stairs and looked down a young patrolman the one who was keeping the scene attendance log at the tape stood in the entry area looking up guy at the tape wants to come in said hes a shrink whos been working with you bosch looked over at edgar their eyes locked he looked back down at the patrolman whats his name the patrolman looked down at his clipboard and read off john locke from usc send him in bosch started down the stairs and beckoned to edgar with his hand he said im taking him into her office tell hans off and then come down bosch told locke to sit in the chair behind the desk while he chose to stay standing through the window behind the psychologist bosch saw the press gathering into a tight group in preparation for a briefing by someone from media relations dont touch anything bosch said whatre you doing here i came as soon as i heard locke said but i thought you said you had the suspect under surveillance we did it was the wrong guy how did you hear its all over the radio i heard it while i was driving in and came right here they didnt put out the exact address but once i got to carmelina this wasnt hard to find just follow the helicopters edgar slipped into the room then and closed the door detective jerry edgar meet dr john locke edgar nodded but made no move to shake his hand he stayed back leaning against the door whereve you been weve been trying to find you since yesterday vegas vegas whyd you go to vegas why else to gamble im also thinking about a book project on the legal prostitutes that work in the towns north oflook arent we wasting time here id like to view the body in situ then i could give you a read on it bodys already moved doc edgar said it is shit maybe i could survey the scene and weve already got too many people up there right now bosch said maybe later what do you make of bite marks cigarette burns are you saying thats what youve found this time plus it wasnt a bimbo from the sex tabs edgar added he came here she didnt come to him he is changing quickly it appears to be complete disassembling or some unknown force or reason compelling his actions such as bosch asked i dont know we tried to call you in vegas you never checked in oh the stardust well coming in i saw the new mgm had just opened and decided to see if they had a room they did i was there anyone with you bosch asked the whole time edgar added a puzzled look came over lockes face what is going he understood now he shook his head harry are you kidding no are you coming here like this i think you no dont answer that tell you what it would probably be best for all of us if you know your rights before we go any further jerry you got a card edgar pulled out his wallet and from it took a white plastic card with the miranda warning printed on it he started reading it to locke both bosch and edgar knew the warning by heart but a departmental memo that was distributed with the plastic card said it was best practice to read directly from a card this made it difficult for a defense attorney to later attack in court how the police administered the rights warning to a client as edgar read the card bosch looked out the window at the huge clot of reporters standing around one of the deputy chiefs he saw that bremmer was there now but the deputy chiefs words must not have meant much the reporter was not writing anything down he was just standing to the side of the pack and smoking he was probably waiting for the real info from the real guns irving and rollenberger am i under arrest locke asked when edgar was done not yet said edgar we just need to clear some things up bosch said i resent the hell out of this i understand now do you want to clear this trip to vegas up was there anyone with you from six oclock friday until i got out of my car down the block ten minutes ago there has been a person with me every minute of every day except when i was in the bathroom this is ridic and that is who this person its a friend of mine her name is melissa mencken bosch remembered the young woman named melissa who was in lockes front office the childpsych major from your office the blonde thats right locke answered reluctantly and she will tell us you were together the whole time same room same hotel same everything right yes shell confirm it all we were just coming back when we heard about this on the radio kfwb shes out there waiting for me in the car go talk to her what kind of car its the blue jag look harry you go talk to her and clear this up if you dont make noise about me being with a student i wont make a sound about this this interrogation this is no interrogation doctor believe me if we interrogate you youll know it he nodded to edgar who slipped out the door to go find the jag when they were alone bosch pulled a highbacked chair away from the wall and sat down in front of the desk to wait what happened to the suspect you were following harry we did whats that supposed to never mind they sat in silence for nearly five minutes until edgar stuck his head in the door and signaled bosch to come out checks out harry i talked to the girl and her story is the same there also were credit card receipts in the car they checked into the mgm saturday at three there was a gas receipt in victorville had the time on it nine oclock in the morning saturday victorvilles what an hour away looks like they were on the road when chandler got it besides the girl says they also spent friday night together at his house in the hills we can do some more checking but i think hes being legit with us well bosch said not completing the thought why dont you go up and spread the word that he looks clear i want to take him up to look around if he still wants to will do bosch went back into the study he sat in the chair that was in front of the desk locke studied him well shes too scared locke she isnt going along shes telling us the truth what the fuck are you talking about locke yelled now bosch studied him the surprise on his face the utter fright was too genuine bosch was sure now he was sorry yet felt some perverse feeling of power having run locke through the scam youre clear dr locke just had to be sure i guess the criminal only comes back to the scene of the crime in movies locke took a deep breath and looked down into his lap bosch thought he looked like a driver who had just pulled to the side of the road to collect himself after missing a headon collision with a truck by a matter of inches goddammit bosch for a minute there i had bad dreams you know bosch nodded he knew about bad dreams edgars going up to smooth the way hes going to ask the lieutenant if you can go up and give a read on the scene if you still want to excellent he said but there wasnt much excitement left in him they sat in silence after that bosch took out his cigarettes and found the pack empty but he put the pack back in his pocket so as not to leave false evidence in the trash can he didnt feel like talking to locke anymore instead he looked past him and out the window at the activity on the street the media pack had dispersed after the briefing now some of the tv reporters were taping their reports with the death house behind them bosch could see bremmer interviewing the neighbors across the street and writing feverishly in his notebook edgar came in then and said were ready for him upstairs staring out the window bosch said jerry can you take him up i just thought of something i need to do locke stood up and looked at the two detectives fuck you he said both of you fuck you there i just had to say that now lets forget about it and go to work he crossed the room to edgar bosch stopped him at the door dr locke he turned back to bosch when we catch this guy hell want to gloat wont he locke thought for a while and said yes hell be very pleased with himself his accomplishments that might be the hardest part for him keeping quiet when he knows he should hell want to gloat they left then and bosch looked out the window for a few more minutes before getting up some of the reporters who knew who he was pressed against the yellow tape and began shouting questions as he came out he ducked under the tape and said he could make no comment and that chief irving was coming out soon that seemed to mollify them temporarily and he started walking down the street to his car he knew bremmer was the master of the antipack he always let the pack move in and do their thing then he came in after by himself to get what he wanted bosch wasnt mistaken bremmer showed up at the car pullin out already harry no i just need to get something pretty bad in there is this on or off the record whatever you like bosch opened the car door off the record yes its pretty bad in there on the record no comment he leaned in and made a show of looking in the glove compartment and not finding what he wanted what are you guys calling this one i mean you know since the dollmaker was already taken bosch got back out the follower thats off the record too ask irving catchy yeah i thought you reporters would like that bosch pulled the empty cigarette pack out of his pocket crumpled it and threw it into the car and closed the door give me a smoke will you sure bremmer pulled a soft pack of marlboros out of his sport coat and shook one out for bosch then he lit it for him with a zippo with his left hand hell of a city we live in harry isnt it yeah this city at that night bosch was sitting in the caprice in the back parking lot of st vibianas in downtown from his angle he could look a half block up second street to the corner at spring but he couldnt see thetimes building that didnt matter though he knew that everytimes employee without parking privileges in the executive garage would have to cross the corner of spring and second to get to one of the employee garages a half block down spring he was waiting for bremmer after leaving the scene at honey chandlers house bosch had gone home and slept for two hours then he had paced in his house on the hill thinking about bremmer and seeing how perfectly he fit the mold he called locke and asked a few more general questions about the psychology of the follower but he did not tell locke about bremmer he told no one about this thinking three strikes and youre out he came up with a plan then dropped by hollywood division to gas up the caprice and get the equipment he would need and now he waited he watched a steady procession of homeless people walking down second as if heeding a sirens call they were heading toward the los angeles mission a few blocks away for a meal and a bed many carried with them or pushed in shopping carts their lifes belongings bosch never took his eyes off the corner but his mind drifted far from there he thought of sylvia and wondered what she was doing at that moment and what she was thinking he hoped she didnt take too long to decide because he knew his minds instinctual protective devices and responses had begun to react he was already looking at the positives that would come if she didnt come back he told himself she made him weak hadnt he thought of her immediately when he found the note from the follower yes she had made him vulnerable he told himself she might not be good for his lifes mission let her go his heartbeat jacked up a notch when he saw bremmer step onto the corner and then walk in the direction of the parking garages a building blocked boschs view after that he quickly started the car and pulled out onto second and up to spring down the block bremmer entered the newer garage with a card key and bosch watched the auto door and waited in five minutes a blue toyota celica came out of the garage and slowed while the driver checked for traffic on spring bosch could see clearly it was bremmer the celica pulled onto spring and so did bosch bremmer headed west on beverly and into hollywood he made one stop at a vons and came out fifteen minutes later with a single bag of groceries he then proceeded to a neighborhood of singlefamily homes just north of the paramount studio he drove down the side of a small stuccoed house and parked in the detached garage in the back bosch pulled to the curb one house away and waited all the houses in the neighborhood were one of three basic designs it was one of the cookiecutter victory neighborhoods that had sprung up after world war ii in the city with affordable homes for returning servicemen now youd probably need to be making a generals pay to buy in the s did that the occupation army of yuppies had the place now each lawn had a little tin sign planted in it they were from three or four different homesecurity companies but they all said the same thing armed response it was the epitaph of the city sometimes bosch thought the hollywood sign should be taken down off the hill and replaced with those two words bosch waited for bremmer to either come around to the front to check his mail or to put lights on inside the house when neither happened after five minutes he got out and approached the driveway his hand unconsciously tapping his sport coat on the side making sure he had his smith amp wesson it was there but he kept it holstered the driveway was unlit and in the recessed darkness of the open garage bosch could only see the faint reflection of the red lenses of the taillights of bremmers car but there was no sign of bremmer a sixfoot woodenplank fence ran along the right side of the drive separating bremmers property from his neighbors branches of bougainvillea in bloom hung over and bosch could hear faint television sounds from the house next door as he walked between the fence and bremmers house toward the garage bosch knew he was completely vulnerable but he also knew that drawing his weapon couldnt help him here favoring the side of the drive nearest the house he walked to the garage and stopped before its darkness standing beneath an old basketball goal with a bent rim he said bremmer there was no sound save for the ticking of the engine of the car in the garage then from behind bosch heard the light scraping of a shoe on concrete he turned bremmer stood there grocery bag in hand what are you doing bosch asked thats what i should ask bosch watched his hands as he spoke you never called so i came by called about what you wanted a comment about the verdict you were supposed to call me remember doesnt matter the storys been put to bed now besides the verdict kind of took a back seat to the other developments of the day if you know what i mean the story on the followerand irving did use that name on the recordis going out front bosch took a few steps toward him then how come youre not at the red wind i thought you said you always go for a pop when you hit the front page holding the bag in his right arm bremmer reached into the pocket of his coat but bosch heard the sound of keys i didnt feel like it tonight i kindve liked honey chandler you know what are you really doing here harry i saw you following me you going to ask me in maybe we can have that beer toast your frontpage story onea is what you reporters call it right yeah this ones going above the fold above the fold i like that they stared at each other in the darkness whaddaya say about the beer sure bremmer said he turned and went to the houses back door and unlocked it he reached in and hit switches that turned on lights over the door and in the kitchen beyond then he stepped back and held out his arm for bosch to go in first after you go into the living room and have a seat ill get a couple bottles and be right there bosch walked through the kitchen and down a short hall to the living room and dining room he didnt sit down but rather stood near the curtain drawn across one of the front windows he parted it and looked into the street and at the houses across there was no one no one had seen him come here he wondered if he had made a mistake he looked down at the oldstyle radiator beneath the window touched it with his hand it was cold its iron coils had been painted black he stood there for a few more moments and then turned and looked around at the rest of the room it was nicely furnished with blacks and grays bosch sat on a black leather couch he knew if he arrested bremmer in the house he would be able to make a quick cursory search of the premises if he found anything of an incriminating nature all he had to do was come back with a warrant bremmer being a police and courts reporter would know that too whyd he let me in bosch wondered have i made a mistake he began to lose confidence in his plan bremmer brought out two bottles no glasses and sat in a matching chair to boschs right bosch studied his bottle for a long moment there was a bubble pushing up from the top it burst and he held the bottle up and said above the fold above the fold bremmer toasted back he didnt smile he took a pull from his bottle and put it down on the coffee table bosch took a large gulp from his bottle and held it in his mouth it was ice cold and hurt some of his teeth there was no known history of the dollmaker or the follower using drugs on their victims he looked at bremmer their eyes locked for a moment and he swallowed it felt good going down leaning forward elbows on his knees he held the bottle in his right hand and looked at bremmer looking back at him he knew from talking with locke that the follower would not be driven by conscience to admit anything he had no conscience the only way was trickery to play on the killers pride he felt his confidence coming back he stared at bremmer with a glare that burned right through him what is it the reporter asked quietly tell me you did it for the stories or the book to get above the fold to have a bestseller whatever but dont tell me youre the sick fuck the shrink says you are what are you talking about skip the bullshit bremmer its you and you know i know its you why else would i waste my time being here the dolthe follower youre saying im the follower are you crazy are you thats what i want to know bremmer was silent for a long time he seemed to retreat into himself like a computer running a long equation the please wait sign flashing the answer finally registered and his eyes focused again on bosch i think you should go harry he stood up its very plain to see youve been under a lot of pressure with this case and i think youre the one coming apart bremmer youve made mistakes a lot of them bremmer suddenly dove into bosch rolling so that his left shoulder slammed into boschs chest pinning him to the couch bosch felt air burst from his lungs and sat helplessly as bremmer worked his hands under harrys sport coat and got to the gun bremmer then pulled away switching off the safety and pointing the weapon at boschs face after nearly a minute of silence during which both men simply stared at each other bremmer said i admit only one thing you have me intrigued harry but before we go any further with this discussion there is something i have to do a sense of relief and anticipation flooded boschs body he tried not to show it instead he tried to put a look of terror on his face he stared wideeyed at the gun bremmer bent over him and ran his heavy hand down boschs chest and into his crotch then around his sides he found no wire sorry to get so personal he said but you dont trust me and i dont trust you right bremmer straightened and stepped back and sat down now i dont need to remind you but i will i have the advantage here so answer my questions what mistakes what mistakes have i made tell me what i did wrong harry or ill kneecap you with the first bullet bosch tantalized him with silence for a few moments as he thought about how to proceed well he finally began lets go back to the basics first four years ago you were all over the dollmaker case as a reporter from the start it was your stories about the early cases that made the department form the task force as a reporter you had access to the suspect intelligence you probably had the autopsy reports you also had sources like me and probably half the dicks on the task force and in the coroners office what i am saying is you knew what the dollmaker did right down to the cross on the toenail you knew later after the dollmaker was dead you used it in your book yeah i knew it means nothing bosch a lot of people knew oh its bosch now no more harry have i suddenly become contemptible in your eyes or does the gun give you that sense that we are no longer equals fuck you bosch youre stupid youve got nothing what else you got you know this is great it will definitely be worth a chapter in the book i do on the follower what elseve i got ive got the concrete blonde and ive got the concrete did you know you dropped your cigarettes when you were pouring the concrete remember that you were driving home wanted a smoke and you reached into your pocket and there was nothing there see just like becky kaminski they were in there waiting for us marlboro soft pack thats your brand bremmer thats mistake number one a lot of people smoke them good luck taking this to the da a lot of people are lefthanded too like you and the follower and me but theres more you want to hear it bremmer looked away from him toward the window and said nothing maybe it was a trick bosch thought that he wanted bosch to go for the gun hey bremmer he almost yelled theres more bremmers face snapped back into a stare at bosch today after the verdict you said i should be happy because the verdict would leave the city only two bucks light but when we had a drink the other night remember you gave me the big rundown on how chandler would be able to charge the city a hundred grand or so if she won even a dollar judgment from the jury remember so it makes me think that when you told me this morning the verdict was only going to cost two dollars you knew it was only going to cost two dollars because you knew chandler was dead and couldnt collect you knew that because you killed her mistake number two bremmer shook his head as if he were dealing with a child his aim with the gun drooped to boschs midsection look man i was trying to make you feel good when i said that today okay i didnt know if she was alive or dead no jury is going to make that leap of faith bosch smiled brilliantly at him so now at least you have me past the das office and to a jury i guess my story is improving isnt it bremmer coldly smiled back raised the gun is that it bosch is that all you have i saved the best stuff for last he lit a cigarette never taking his eyes off bremmer you remember before you killed chandler how you tortured her you must remember that you bit her and burned her well everyone was standing around in that house today wondering why the follower was changing doing all this new stuffchanging the mold locke the shrink he was the most puzzled of all you really fucked with his mind man i kinda like that about you bremmer but you see he didnt know what i knew he let that sit out there for a while he knew bremmer would bite and what did you know sherlock bosch smiled he was in complete control now i knew why you did that to her it was simple you wanted your note back didnt you but she wouldnt tell you where it was see she knew she was dead whether she gave it to you or not so she took iteverything you did to her she tookand she didnt tell you that woman had a lot of guts and in the end she beat you bremmer shes the one who got you not me what note bremmer said weakly after a long moment the one you fucked up with you missed it its a big house to search especially when youve got a dead woman lying in the bed thatd be hard to explain if somebody happened to drop by but dont worry i found it ive got it too bad you dont read hawthorne it was sitting there in his book too bad but like i said she beat you maybe there is justice sometimes bremmer had no snappy comeback bosch looked at him and thought that he was doing well he was almost there she kept the envelope too in case you were wondering i found that too and so i started wondering why would he torture her for this note when it was the same one he dropped off for me it was just a photocopy then i figured it out you didnt want the note you wanted the envelope bremmer looked down at his hands how am i doing am i losing you i have no idea bremmer said looking back up youre fucking delirious as far as im concerned well i only have to worry about making sense to the da dont i and what im going to explain to him is that the poem on the note was in response to the story you wrote that appeared in the paper on monday the day the trial started but the postmark on the envelope was the saturday before see theres the puzzle how would the follower know to write a poem making reference to the newspaper article two days before it was in the newspaper the answer is of course that he the follower had prior knowledge of the article he wrote that article that also explains how you knew about the note in the next days story you were your own source bremmer and that is mistake number three three strikes and youre out the silence that followed was so complete that bosch could hear the low hiss coming from bremmers bottle of beer youre forgetting something bosch bremmer finally said im holding the gun now who else have you told this crazy story to just to finish the housekeeping bosch said the new poem you dropped off for me this past weekend was just a front you wanted the shrink and everybody else to make it look like you killed chandler as a favor to me or some psycho bullshit right bremmer said nothing that way nobody would see the true reason you went after her to get the note and the envelope back shit you being a reporter she was familiar with she probably invited you in when you knocked on her door kind of like you inviting me in here familiarity breeds danger bremmer bremmer said nothing answer a question for me bremmer im curious why you dropped one note off and mailed the other i know being a reporter you could blend in at the station drop it on the desk and nobody would remember but why mail it to her obviously it was a mistakethats why you went back and killed her but whyd you make it the reporter looked at bosch for a long moment then he glanced down at the gun as if to reassure himself that he was in control and would get out of this the gun was powerful bait bosch knew he had him the story was supposed to run that saturday thats what it was scheduled for but some dumbass editor held it ran it monday i had mailed the letter before i looked at the paper that saturday that was my only mistake but youre the one who made the big mistake oh yeah whats that coming here alone now it was bosch who was silent why come here alone bosch is this how you did it with the dollmaker you went alone so you could kill him in cold blood bosch thought a moment thats a good question well that was your second mistake thinking i was as unworthy an opponent as him he was nothing you killed him and therefore he deserved to die but now it is you who deserve to die give me the gun bremmer he laughed as if bosch had asked a crazy question you think how many were there how many women are buried out there bremmers eyes lit with pride enough enough to fulfill my special needs how many where are they youll never know bosch that will be your pain your last pain never knowing and losing bremmer raised the gun so that its muzzle pointed to boschs heart he pulled the trigger bosch watched his eyes as the metallic click sounded bremmer pulled the trigger again and again the same result the growing terror in his eyes bosch reached into his sock and pulled the extra clip the one that was loaded with fifteen xtp bullets he wrapped his fist around the cartridge and in one swift motion came off the couch and swung his fist into bremmers jaw the impact of the blow knocked the reporter backward in his chair his weight made the chair crash backward and he spilled to the floor he dropped the smith and bosch quickly gathered it up ejected the empty clip and put in the live ammunition get up get the fuck up bremmer did as he was told are you going to kill me now is that it another kill for the gunslinger thats up to you bremmer what are you talking about im talking about how i want to blow your head off but for me to do that you have to make the first move bremmer just like with the dollmaker it was his play now its yours look bosch i dont want to die everything i saidi was just playing a game youre making a mistake here i just want to get it cleared up please just take me to county and it will all get cleared up please did they plead like that when you had the strap around their necks did they did you make them plead for their lives or for their deaths what about chandler at the end did she beg you to kill her take me to county arrest me and take me to county then get against that wall you fat fuck and put your hands behind your back bremmer obeyed bosch dropped his cigarette into an ashtray on the table and followed bremmer to the wall when he closed the handcuffs over the reporters wrists bremmers shoulders dropped as he apparently felt safe he started squirming his arms chafing his wrists on the cuffs see that he said you see that bosch im making marks on my wrists you kill me now theyll see the marks and know it was an execution im not some dumb fuck like church that you can slaughter like an animal no thats right you know all the angles dont you all of them now take me down to county ill be out before you wake up tomorrow know what all this is what youve got just the wild speculation of a rogue cop even a federal jury agreed you go too far bosch this wont work youve got no evidence bosch turned him away from the wall so that their faces were no more than two feet apart their beer breath mixing you did it didnt you and you think youre going to walk dont you bremmer stared at him and bosch saw the gleam of pride in his eyes again locke had been right about him he was gloating and he couldnt shut up even though he knew his life might depend on it yes he said in a low strange voice i did it im the man and yes i will walk you wait and see and when im out there youll think of me every night for the rest of your life bosch nodded but i never said that bosch it will be your word against mine a rogue copit will never get to court they couldnt afford to put you on the stand against me bosch leaned closer to him and smiled then i suppose its a good thing i taped it bosch walked over to the radiator and pulled the microrecorder from between two of the iron coils he held it up on his palm for bremmer to see bremmers eyes became enraged he had been tricked he had been cheated bosch that tape is inadmissible thats entrapment i have not been advised i have not been advised im advising you of your rights now you werent under arrest until now i wasnt going to advise you until i arrested you you know police procedure bosch was smiling at him digging it in lets go bremmer he said when he got tired of the victory it was an irony that bosch savored tuesday morning when he read bremmers abovethefold story on the killing of honey chandler he had booked the reporter into county jail on a nobail hold shortly before midnight and had not alerted media relations the word had not gotten out by the last deadline and now the paper had a frontpage story about a murder that was written by the murderer bosch liked that he smiled as he read it the one person bosch had told was irving he had the com center patch him through on a phone line and in a halfhourlong conversation he told the assistant chief every step he had taken and described every building block of evidence that led to the arrest irving said nothing congratulatory nor did he chastise bosch for making the arrest alone either or both would come later after it was seen whether the arrest would stick both men knew this at am bosch was seated in front of a filing deputys desk at the district attorneys office in the downtown criminal courts building for the second time in eight hours he carefully went over the details of what happened and then played the tape of his conversation with bremmer the deputy da whose name was chap newell made notations on a yellow pad while listening to the tape he often furrowed his brow or shook his head because the sound was not good the voices in bremmers living room had bounced through the iron radiator coils and had a tinny echo on the tape still the words that were most important were audible bosch just watched without saying a word newell looked as if he could be no more than three years out of law school because the arrest had not made a splash in the papers or on tv yet it had not received the attention of one of the senior attorneys in the filings division it had gone to newell on the routine rotation when the tape was done newell made a few more notes to look as if he knew what he was doing and then looked up at bosch you havent said anything about what was in his house i didnt find anything on the quick search i made last night there are others there now with a warrant doing a more thorough job well i hope they find something why youve got the case right there and it is a good case bosch really good work coming from you that means a lot newell looked at him and narrowed his eyes he wasnt sure what to make of that but uh but what well theres no question we can file with this there is a lot here but what im looking at it from a defense lawyers perspective what really do we have here a lot of coincidences hes lefthanded he smokes he knew details about the dollmaker but those things are not hard evidence they can apply to a lot of people bosch started lighting a cigarette please dont do he exhaled and blew the smoke across the desk never mind what about the note and the postmark thats good but it is complicated and difficult to grasp a good lawyer could make a jury see it as just another coincidence he could confuse the issue is what im trying to say what about the tape newell we have him confessing on tape what more do you but during the confession he disavows the confession not at the end look im not planning on using the tape what are you talking about you know what im talking about he confessed before you advised him it brings up the specter of entrapment there is no entrapment he knew i was a cop and he knew his rights whether i advised him or not he had a fucking gun onme he freely made those statements when he was formally arrested i advised him but he searched you for a wire that is a clear indication of his desire not to be taped plus he dropped the bombhis most damaging statementafter you cuffed him but before you advised him that could be dicey youre going to use the tape newell looked at him a long time a red blotchiness appeared on his young cheeks you are not in a position to tell me what im going to use bosch besides if thats all we go with it will probably be up to the state court of appeals if we use it because if bremmer has any kind of a lawyer at all thats where hell take it well win the question here in superior because half the judges on those benches worked in the das office at one time or another but when it gets up to appeals or to the state supreme court in san francisco its anybodys guess is that what you want to wait a couple years and have it blown out then or do you want to get it done correctly right from the get go bosch leaned forward and looked angrily at the young lawyer look were still working other angles were not done there will be more evidence accumulated but we have to charge this guy or let him go weve got fortyeight hours from last night to file but if we dont file right now with no bail hell grab a lawyer and get a bail hearing the judge wont honor the nobail arrest if you havent even filed a single charge yet so file on him now well get all the evidence you need to back it up newell nodded as if he agreed but said thing is i like to have the whole package everything we can get when i file a case that way we know how we are going to work the prosecution right from the start we know if we are going to go with a plea bargain or go balls to the wall bosch got up and walked to the offices open door he stepped into the hall and looked at the plastic name plate affixed to the wall outside then he came back in bosch what are you doing its funny i thought you were a filing deputy i didnt know you were a trial deputy too newell dropped his pencil on his pad his face got redder the blotches spreading to his forehead look i am a filing deputy but it is part of my responsibility to make sure we have the best case possible from the get go every case that comes through that door i could file on but thats not the point the point is to have good credible evidence and a lot of it cases that dont backfire so i push bosch i how old are you what how old twentysix whats that got to listen to me you little prick dont you ever call me by my last name again i was making cases like this before you cracked your first law book and ill be making them long after you move your convertible saab and your selfcentered whitebread show to century city you can call me detective or detective bosch you can even call me harry but dont you ever call me just bosch again understand newells mouth had dropped open do you understand sure another thing were going to get more evidence and were going to get it as soon as we can but in the meantime youre going to file one charge of firstdegree murder on bremmer with a nobail hold because we are going to make surefrom the get go mr newellthat this scumbag never sees the light of day again then when we have more evidence if you are still attached to this case you will file multiple counts under theories of linkage between the deaths at no time will you worry about the socalled package you will hand off to the trial attorney the trial attorney will make those decisions because we both know that you are really just a clerk a clerk who files what is brought to him if you knew enough to even sit in court next to a trial attorney you would not be here do you have any questions no he said quickly no what no quesno detective bosch bosch went back to irvings conference room and used the rest of the morning to work up an application for a search warrant to collect hair blood and saliva specimens along with a dental mold from bremmer before taking it to the courthouse he attended a brief meeting of the task force where they all reported on their respective assignments edgar said he had been to sybil brand and had shown georgia stern who was still being held there a photo of bremmer but she could not identify him as her attacker she could not rule him out either sheehan said he and opelt had shown the mug shot of bremmer to the manager of the storage facility at bings and the man said bremmer might have been one of the renters of the storage rooms two years earlier but he couldnt be sure he said it was too long ago to remember well enough to send a man to the gas chamber the guys a wimp sheehan said my feeling was he recognized bremmer but was too scared to stick it in all the way were going to hit him again tomorrow rollenberger called the presidents up on the rover and they reported from bremmers house that there was nothing yet no tapes no bodies nothing i say we go for a warrant to dig up the yard under the foundation nixon said we might go to that rollenberger radioed back meantime keep at it lastly yde reported by rover that he and mayfield were getting the runaround from thetimes lawyers and had not yet been able to so much as approach bremmers desk in the newsroom rollenberger reported that heikes and rector were out of pocket running down background on bremmer after that he said that irving had scheduled a five oclock press conference to discuss the case with the media if anything new was discovered let rollenberger know before then thats it rollenberger said bosch got up to head out the medical clinic on the highpower floor of the county jail reminded bosch of frankensteins laboratory there were chains on every bed and rings bolted to the tile walls to tether patients to the pulldown lights over each bed were caged in steel so patients couldnt get to the light bulbs and use them as weapons the tile was supposed to be white but over the years had surrendered to a depressing offyellow bosch and edgar stood in the doorway to one of the bays where there were six beds and watched as bremmer who was lying in the sixth bed was given a shot of sodium pentothal to make him more cooperative more malleable he had refused to give the courtordered dental mold and samples of blood saliva and hair after the drug began to take effect the doctor pulled open the reporters mouth put two clamps in to hold it open and pushed a little square block of clay over the front upper teeth he then followed the same procedure with the lower front teeth when he was done he relaxed the clamps and bremmer appeared to be asleep if we asked him something now hed tell the truth right edgar asked thats truth serum theyre givin him right supposedly bosch said but itd probly get the case thrown out of court the little gray blocks with teeth indentations were slid into plastic cases the doctor closed them and handed them to edgar he then drew blood wiped a cotton swab in bremmers mouth and cut snippets of hair from the suspects head chest and pubic area he put these in envelopes which went into a small cardboard box like the kind chicken nuggets come in at fastfood restaurants bosch took the box and they left then bosch going to the coroners office to see amado the analyst and edgar going to cal state northridge to see the forensic archaeologist who had helped with the concrete blonde reconstruction by quarter to five everyone was back in the conference room but edgar they were all milling about waiting to watch irvings press conference there had been no other progress since noon where do you think he stashed everything harry nixon asked as he was pouring coffee i dont know probably has a storage locker somewhere if he has tapes i doubt hed part with them he probably has a drop somewhere well find them what about the other women theyre out there somewhere under the city only way theyll come up is by luck or if bremmer talks irving said he had just come in there was a good feeling in the room despite the days slow progress everyone to a man had no doubt they finally had the right man and that certainty validated what they were about so they wanted to drink coffee and hang out even irving at five minutes before five when irving was going over some of the reports typed during the day for the last time before facing the media edgar came up on the rover rollenberger quickly picked up a radio and answered back what do you have team five is harry there yes team five team six is present what have you got ive got the package definite match between the suspects teeth and the impressions on the victim roger that team five there was a whoop in the conference room and a lot of backslapping and high fives he is going down nixon exclaimed irving picked up his papers and headed for the hallway door he wanted to be on time at the doorway he passed close to bosch were gold bosch thanks bosch just nodded a few hours later bosch was back at the county jail it was after lockdown so the deputies wouldnt bring bremmer out to see him instead he had to go into the highpower module the deputies watching him on remote cameras he walked along the row of cells to and looked through the wired onefootsquare window in the singlepiece steel door bremmer was on keep away status so he was in there alone he didnt notice bosch watching he lay on the bottom bunk on his back his hands laced behind his head his eyes were open and staring straight up bosch recognized the withdrawal state he had seen for a moment the night before it was as if he wasnt there bosch leaned his mouth to the screen bremmer you play bridge bremmer looked over at him only moving his eyes what i said do you play bridge you know the card game what the fuck do you want bosch i just dropped by to tell you a little while ago they added three more to the one this morning linkage you just got the concrete blonde and the two from before the ones we first gave to the dollmaker you also got an attempted murder on the survivor oh well whats the difference you got one you got em all all i need to do is beat the chandler case and the others fall like dominoes except that isnt going to happen we got your teeth bremmer just as good as fingerprints and we got the rest i just came from the coroners they matched your pubic hair to samples found on victims seven and eleventhe ones we gave the dollmaker credit for you ought to think about dealing bremmer tell where the others are and theyll probably let you live thats why i asked about bridge what about it well i hear theres some guys up at q play a good bridge game theyre always looking for new blood youll probably like em have a lot in common why dont you leave me alone bosch i will i will but just so you know it man theyre on death row but dont worry about that when you get there youll get a lot of card playing in whats the average lead time eight ten years before they gas somebody thats not bad unless of course you talk a deal there is no deal bosch get out of here im going believe me its nice to be able to walk out of this place ill see you then okay you know in eight or ten years im going to be there bremmer when they strap you in im going to be watching through the glass when the gas comes up and then ill come out and tell the reporters how you died ill tell them you went screaming that you werent much of a man fuck you bosch yeah fuck me see you then bremmer after bremmers arraignment tuesday morning bosch got permission to take the rest of the week off in lieu of receiving all of the overtime he had built up on the case he spent the time hanging around the house doing odd jobs and taking it easy he replaced the wood railing on the back porch with new lengths of weathertreated oak and while he was at home depot getting the wood he also picked up new cushions for the chairs and the chaise lounge on the porch he began reading thetimes sports pages again noting the statistical changes in team ranks and player performances and occasionally hed read one of the many stories thetimes ran in the metro section about what was becoming known nationwide as the follower case but it didnt really hold his fascination he knew too much about the case already the one interest he had in the stories was in the details about bremmer that were coming out thetimes had sent a staffer to texas where bremmer had been raised in an austin suburb and the reporter had returned with a story culled from old childrenscourt files and neighborhood gossip hed been raised by his mother in a singleparent home his father an itinerant blues musician he saw once or twice a year at the most the mother was described by former neighbors as a disciplinarian and plain meanspirited when it came to her son the worst thing that the reporter came up with on bremmer was that he was suspected but never charged in the arson of a neighbors toolshed when he was thirteen it was said by neighbors that his mother punished him as if he had committed the crime anyway not allowing him to leave their tiny house the rest of the summer the neighbors said that around the same time the neighborhood began to experience a problem with pets disappearing but this was never attributed to young bremmer at least until now now the neighbors seemed engaged in blaming bremmer for any malady that beset their street that year a year after the fire bremmers mother died of alcoholism and the boy was raised after that on a state boys farm where the young charges wore white shirts and blue ties and blazers to classes even when the thermometer went off the chart the story said he worked as a reporter on one of the farms student newspapers thus beginning a journalism career that would eventually take him to los angeles his history was all grist for people like locke to consider to use as fuel for speculation on how the child bremmer made the adult bremmer do the things he did it just made bosch feel sad he couldnt help however but stare for a long time at the photo of the mother thetimes had dug up somewhere in the picture she stood in front of the door to a sunburned ranchstyle house with her hand on a young bremmers shoulder she had bleachedblonde hair and a provocative figure and large chest she wore too much makeup bosch thought as he stared at the picture aside from the bremmer articles the story he read and reread several times was in the metro section of thursdays paper it was about the burial of beatrice fontenot sylvia was quoted in the article and it described how the grant high teacher had read some of the girls schoolwork at the memorial service there was a photo from the service but sylvia wasnt in it it was of beatrices mothers stoic tearlined face at the funeral bosch kept the metro page on the table next to the chaise lounge and read the story again every time he sat down there when he grew restless around the house he would drive down out of the hills hed head across the valley with no place in particular to go hed drive forty minutes to have a hamburger at an in n out stand having grown up in the city he liked to drive it to know every one of its streets and corners once on thursday and again on friday morning his drives took him past grant high but he never saw sylvia through the windows of the classrooms as he went by he felt sick at heart when he thought of her but he knew the closest he could come to her was to drive by the school it was her move and he must wait for her to make it on friday afternoon when he came back from his drive he saw the message light flashing on his phone machine and his hopes rushed into his throat he thought maybe she had seen his car and was calling because she knew how his heart hurt but when he played the message it was just edgar asking him to call eventually he did harry youre missing everything yeah what well we hadpeople magazine in here yesterday ill watch for you on the cover just kidding actually weve got big developments yeah what all this publicity was bound to do us good some lady over in culver city called up and said she recognized bremmer that he had a storage locker at her place but under the name woodward we got a warrant and popped it first thing this morning yeah locke was right he videotaped we found the tapes his trophies jesus yeah if there was ever a doubt there aint now got seven tapes and the camera he must not have taped the first two the ones we thought were the dollmakers but we got tapes of seven others including chandler and maggie cum loudly bastard taped everything just horrible stuff theyre working up formal ids on the other five victims on the tapes but it looks like its going to be the ones on the list mora came up with gallery and the other four porno chicks what else was in the locker everything weve got everything weve got cuffs belts gags a knife and a glock nine his whole killing kit he mustve used the gun to control them thats why there was no sign of a struggle at chandlers he used the gun we figure hed hold it on them until he could cuff em and gag em from the tapes it looks like all the kills took place in bremmers house the rear bedroom except chandler of course she got it at home those tapes harry i couldnt watch bosch could imagine he envisioned the scenes and felt an unexpected flutter in his heart as if it had torn loose inside of him and was banging against his ribs like a bird trying to break out of its cage anyway the das got it and the big development is bremmers going to talk he is yeah he heard we had the tapes and everything else i guess he told his lawyer to deal hes going to get life without the possibility of parole in exchange for leading us to the bodies and letting the shrinks have at him study what makes him tick my vote is they squash him like a fly but i guess they are considering the families and science bosch was silent bremmer would live at first he didnt know what to think then he realized he could live with the deal it had bothered him that those women might never be found that was why he had visited bremmer at the jail the day charges were first filed whether the victims had families who cared or not he didnt want to leave them down there in the black chasm of the unknown it wasnt a bad deal bosch decided bremmer would be alive but he wouldnt be living it might even be worse for him than the gas chamber and that would be justice he thought anyway edgar said thought youd want to know yeah its a weird fuckin thing you know it being bremmer its weirder than if it was mora man a reporter and man i knew the guy too yeah well a lot of us did i guess nobody knows anybody like they think yeah seeya harry late that afternoon he stood on the back deck leaning forward on his new oak railing looking out into the pass and thinking about the black heart its rhythm was so strong it could set the beat of a whole city he knew it would always be the background beat the cadence of his own life bremmer would be banished now hidden away forever but he knew there would be another after him and another after him the black heart does not beat alone he lit a cigarette and thought about honey chandler crowding his last view of her from his mind with the vision of her holding forth in court that would always be her place in his mind there had been something so pure and distilled about her furylike the blue flame on a match before it burns out on its own even directed at him he could appreciate it his mind wandered to the statue at the courthouse steps he still couldnt think of her name a concrete blonde chandler had called her bosch wondered what chandler had thought about justice at the end at her end he knew there was no justice without hope did she still have any hope left at the end he believed that she did like the pure blue flame dimming to nothing it was still there still hot it was what allowed her to beat bremmer he did not hear sylvia until she stepped out onto the porch he looked up and saw her there and wanted to go to her immediately but held back she was wearing blue jeans and a dark blue denim shirt hed bought the shirt for her birthday and he took that as a good sign he guessed she had probably come from school it having recessed for the weekend only an hour earlier i called your office and they told me you were off i thought i would come by to see how you were ive been reading all about the case im okay sylvia how are you im fine how are we she smiled a little at that sounds like one of those bumper stickers you see howm i driving harry i dont know how we are i guess thats why im here there was an uneasy silence as she looked around the porch and out into the pass bosch crushed his cigarette out and dropped it in an old coffee can he kept by the door hey new cushions yeah harry you have to understand why i needed some time its i do let me finish i rehearsed this enough times id like to get a chance to actually say it to you i just wanted to say that it is going to be very hard for me for us if we go on it is going to be hard to deal with our pasts our secrets and most of all what you do what you bring home with you bosch waited for her to continue he knew she wasnt done i know i dont have to remind you but ive been through it before with a man i loved and i saw it all go bad andyou know how it ended there was a lot of pain for both of us so you have to understand why i needed to take a step back and take a look at this at us he nodded but she wasnt looking at him her not looking concerned him more than her words he couldnt bring himself to speak though he didnt know what he could say you live a very hard struggle harry your life i mean a cop yet with all your baggage i see and know there are still very noble things about you now she looked at him i do love you harry i want to try to keep that alive because its
